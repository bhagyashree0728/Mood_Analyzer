2,ihatethosemuffins,1630416366,1,"My father is the definition of talking out of his ass. Everyday he preaches to us that we should do as Christ commands that we need to love our neighbor. 

We have a very distant family member who is struggling and doesn‚Äôt have anything. My father keeps saying things like ‚ÄúI think of him and I get so emotional because I imagine him as if he was one of you guys‚Äù. I always have to leave the room or put on headphones and blast the fuck out of some music to drown out his bullshit. 

This family member is very distant because we‚Äôve never met this guy in our entire lives and he plays victim to my mother via messaging and she falls for it. They were willing to drive across the country during my dads only vacation time to pick this guy up and bring him into our home. 

I was that son. I was the guy struggling with extreme depression, betrayal, abandonment, being unwanted, unloved by my entire family and my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, which led to drugs and other things. Their solution to dealing with me was sending me away via arrests or to 51/50s. So many things happened within those 3 years that eventually, I finally gave up. I lost any ounce of hope I had left. I caved. I was trying to beat a river into submission, but they beat me until I was on my last leg. Literally, I had a broken leg and left the house at 12AM because I didn‚Äôt want to be arrested again and sent back to jail. I walked on a broken leg with a destroyed cast and barefoot on both feet, cut up and blistered, and through a dark park that went on for miles, but it was better than being in county again. 

They may have everyone fooled when it comes to that 3 year period. But they can‚Äôt fool themselves. And they hate me because I know who they truly are, and not the facade they paint themselves as. 

My parents would go to the ends of the earth for a complete stranger, but wouldn‚Äôt do the same for their own son when he was lost and broken. 

This is why I can‚Äôt and will never forgive them for what they did to me, their youngest child. They have never apologized, not once.

15,starzwillsucceed,1630396072,1,"Being lonely has made me realize many things about myself and life.

It has taught me that I am my own worst critique.

It has taught me that I can only rely on myself most of the time. 

It has made me become completely self-sufficient in doing everything around the house. If I don't do the dishes, no one is going to do them for me.

It has turned my into a great cook. Nom nom nom!

It has taught me that I will always be my own motivator. It's hard to be motivated sometimes, but I seem to be doing well since I make it to work every day. 

It has shown me that I have been codependent most of my life and that I tend to try way to hard to please others so they will like me instead of just being myself and waiting for them to make half the effort to get to know me back.

I have learned to accept the silence. 

I've become okay with talking to myself sometimes. I am fully aware of when I do talk to myself so I don't have any mental issues. 

It has taught me that it's okay to walk around the house naked. 

It is okay to poop with the door open.

It's okay to watch porn with the volume all the way up and not care if my neighbors here me. Jesus forgive me for I am a sinner.

I've come to understand that I'm most likely going to be single the rest of my life, at least I've accepted this fate.

I've become comfortable sleeping by myself. Getting to roll over many times on my king size bed is the best in the middle of the night.

I've learned that crying is okay when loneliness hits hard.

I've come to realize that there are many things in life I will never get to experience because I'm alone and lonely.

I've accepted that I'm most likely going to be childless for the rest of my life.

I have found that I have more freedom to go do random things or spontaneous trips that most people can't do because they have children and a significant other.

Most of all, I have found that I am **STRONG** in times of weakness because I have chosen to continue to live when the bad thoughts overwhelm me and I'm so emotionally delusional and my sobbing is so strong that I can feel a physical pain in my chest and all I want to do is die in the moment. 

I have realized that the peace of God is not felt, but just known.

I can relate with so many people that feel the way I do and have a gift of feeling someone else's pain even when they don't show it outwardly. 

Loneliness has made me into who I am today and I honestly wouldn't change it for the world. 

Maybe I won't always be lonely, but until then, I get to continue to learn more about myself because of its incredible power it has over me.",lonely,What loneliness means to me (36m).,2021-08-31 17:47:52

32,ThemOrUs_,1630387096,1,"I need some advice for anyone willing to listen. Sorry if this is a rambly mess, just writing whatever comes to mind.

I was in a long distance relationship for 8 months. We met in October, we hit it off immediately, with mutual interests, similar home lives, and humor. I‚Äôve never met anyone I connected with so early on that could make me laugh and feel as good as I did. I told her I loved her within that first week. I know it‚Äôs a red flag, but I truly felt that way as I‚Äôve never felt for anyone or anything since. She loved me too, and those first two months were some of the happiest of my entire life. I will cherish those memories forever.

Being in a relationship made me realize just how naive I really was about how relationships worked and functioned. I had so much more to learn than I knew. To start, she was Polyamorous, and she told me right off the bat. I knew what it was, but I had never stopped to consider the ramifications before. I guess I‚Äôve always defaulted to Monogamy. Ultimately, I was okay with it at the time. I did tell her my first impression of it wasn‚Äôt great, the thought of her being with someone else bothered me, didn‚Äôt understand it myself, but as long as it was her, I didn‚Äôt mind. I never once wanted or asked her to change herself for me, I would never do that or ask that of her.

Throughout the following months, there were some ups and downs periods. I‚Äôve always struggled with my self esteem; getting into a relationship made it worse in some ways. Especially with someone who was Polyamorous. I guess I feared that eventually she‚Äôd meet someone who she likes as much or better than me, and want to spend more time with them. She was quick to love and she never shied away from showing it. I hate that this bothers me, I‚Äôve used all the logic in my brain to tell myself that it‚Äôs perfectly okay, it‚Äôs just a different lifestyle/mindset, and when she would meet someone else, she would be upfront and tell me about it and not hide anything. 

The relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect. My life isn‚Äôt great at the moment, and even though I‚Äôve been making progress, it feels like I‚Äôm not doing anything. My depression bled through at times and I don‚Äôt think that helped anything. She ended up wanting to change the relationship to being ‚Äújust friends‚Äù something I didn‚Äôt and still don‚Äôt want, but acknowledge that it may be for the best at the current state. She told me previously that she will always love me unconditionally, and she doesn‚Äôt look at relationships in a typical way. She told me I was the love of her life at one point. We‚Äôve been just friends for 2 months now, and I still care about her the same way I always did. I feel like I will always love her the same way. I haven‚Äôt been able to look at anyone else the same way, even though I find other people attractive, I don‚Äôt look at them the same way. I don‚Äôt desire them, I only desire and want her.

We talk less, but the times we do get to talk, I cherish. Last night we were on the phone and she was telling me about her new crush and a boy she saw at the park she visited recently and how cute he was. I acted joyful about it and I want to be happy for her. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but I can‚Äôt lie, it crushes me inside hearing this. It makes me nervous and anxious, and sad. I think ultimately I‚Äôm so saddened because even though I do feel like she‚Äôll always love me regardless of what we are, it‚Äôs not in the same way that I do her. I love her with every ounce of my being. I go throughout my day thinking about her always, wishing I was with her. I hate being this obsessed about her and I‚Äôve focused on other things, but my mind always ends up drifting back to her. 

I‚Äôm asking for advice because I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if I can continue to handle being just friends, but I care about her so much I don‚Äôt want to let her go. Just for my own sanity I don‚Äôt know if I can keep going with it. I don‚Äôt know how to tell her any of this, and I know it isn‚Äôt healthy to keep this inside, but I cherish the friendship we have because I don‚Äôt have anyone else I can trust like her, and I‚Äôm not sure if this will change things even more. I don‚Äôt have any friends, she‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got left, and I don‚Äôt want to ruin that as well.

36,Educational_Fudge894,1630385350,1,"I'm a recently 22-year-old college student, with absolutely *no* relationship experience. Living in a highly conservative (think ""Fox News is too liberal"", literal swastikas hanging on the wall ""conservative"") family, I've spent my life doing everything possible to hide the fact I'm gay, all the while hoping somehow I was not.

I've come to terms with the fact that I am, and that's not going to change, but I still have to hide it. In fact, just hiding it isn't good enough. At home, I *must* be gay if I'm not actively lusting after and borderline sexually harassing women. It's exhausting. Having been homeschooled on top of this, I've never had the chance to meet or tell anyone. I've never been on a date, never been kissed... I've never even been *hugged,* and I'm a very hugg-y kind of person.

I finally left home a year ago to start college, and I've probably met more people in a few months than I had the previous 21 years of my life. The freedom I have now is amazing. Sadly, though, my school is pretty small (\~2,100 students), and the LGBT population on campus is tiny (a college equivalent of a gay-straight alliance tried to start up, but gave up after months of being harassed and having found only 5 LGBT-identifying people to join). The city my school is in isn't super LGBT-friendly, and isn't really a ""college town"", so people don't really leave campus. That is to say that my dating/gay friend-making prospects are pretty small.

I spent this last summer interning at a large state university that's a 4 or 5 hour drive from my school. While there, I met this guy that I was almost instantly head-over-heels for. I can't possibly begin to describe how sweet, smart, and absolutely adorable he is. I'm talking one of those people that you meet and just go ""wow"".

We have a lot of common interests and, although I admittedly only had the chance to talk to him a few times, it was amazing to be around him. No one had ever made me feel fluttery before, until him. I really, *really* liked him.

I have absolutely no ""gaydar"", though, and I've still never told anyone that I'm gay, so there was no chance that I'd ever even think about saying anything to him, although I *really* wanted to. Still, there were a couple of times I thought he may have been flirting with me. The first time I met him, for instance, we ended up talking about relationships at one point, and he made a couple of super vague comments that I interpreted as saying he was gay and was having a hard time with it. He then insinuated that I ""had been there"". I brushed it off as hopeful thinking and ignored it.

I'm back at my home school, now, and a few days ago I was talking with a friend I'd made over the summer, who had also met this guy once or twice. As it turns out, he was not only gay, but he liked *me*, and felt that I'd turned him down and wasn't interested. Looking back now, it's so incredibly obvious that he did. I can't stop looking back at all the things he said and realizing that he was so very clearly trying to tell me he was gay.

After the initial high of knowing someone I liked so much, and who's *wayyy* out of my league, was into me, I can't help but feel sad and frustrated. I screwed it up. I would've done next to anything to be with him. He was so incredibly sweet, so comfortable and fun to be around. He was one of the few people I've met that was actually interested in listening to the (very) nerdy things I like to talk about. He had the prettiest eyes I've ever seen, and one of those too-good-to-be-true movie start smiles. I wanted to hold him soooo bad.

We don't have any mutual friends. I never had the courage to ask for his number. I can't find him anywhere on social media. I have the number of his room mate, who might have his number, but it feels creepy to ask someone I don't really know for his number only to text him out of the blue. What would I even say? It just hurts to know what could've been :(.

I've wanted someone for a long time. It suck to just wait around, I'm not the sort of person that likes to be alone. He was everything I could've asked for.

I know the odds of me finding anyone else are slim to none. The dating pool at my school and in my town is absolutely tiny. I've tried Grindr, I've tried Tinder, and all the hundreds of other dating apps out there. They're all garbage. Knowing that I could've had him, I don't want anyone else. I want *him.* And it would take a miracle for that to happen.

Sorry for the rant. Being very in the closet, I have no one to vent to :(.",lonely,"I met someone, but I screwed it all up because I'm afraid to be gay",2021-08-31 14:49:10

I've finally been able to contact people to hang out with, but we don't talk that much, so the loneliness doesn't entirely go away. Honestly, I wonder if it'll ever go completely away. You stop feeling human after a year of being alone, because you really aren't a human at that point. A human is a social creature, and you're alone. The biggest part is that it's just more suffering in a life of suffering. I wouldn't be nearly as depressed if I had confidence that I'll have a happy life after I'm back with others, or if I had a mother who didn't verbally abuse me when she's stress (even when she's stressed because I'm suffering), or if I had a sister who would at least try to hide her extreme hatred of me. A 5 minute conversation is the simplest thing in the world, and nobody gave it to me. I'm a broken mess of a human, and there probably isn't any repairing me.

I simply do not believe that I could ever count an online 'friendship' as an actual friend. Without seeing someone face to face while we talk, I distrust the sincerity of what they say. The majority of my social interactions, excluding work conversations, over the last 10+ years has been online.  I have met many people who I think are awesome but not one of them is someone I would consider a friend.  Maybe I have this outlook because I grew up mostly before the internet was a thing.

Now for the saddest part.  Because of my self-esteem issues, I have serious issues even approaching people IRL, much less attempting to connect with them on any level.  When I do converse with people, it's almost always people I work with and I can't help but feel that they're only speaking to me to be polite.

I have pretty bad trust issues from past relationships, which has lead me to be less open with the few close friends I have. they always tell me I can talk to them about my issues, which I'm extremely greatful for, but there's always that little voice in my head saying that they'll just betray me because it's happened before.

either way, I often feel like the things I want to talk about would just come off as annoying and weak. the few times I have spoken to a friend they just shrug off whatever I say, saying things like ""I'm not good with this stuff"" or ""oh man that's rough"" and with my main issue being loneliness it just makes things worse.

if there were only just one person who would reach out and be able to hold me and tell me things would be okay, I feel like most of my problems would begin to fade away. the lack of sleep, bad eating habits, low confidence, trust issues, and so on.

we have been chatting for like almost 2 months,
i really really like him, and i havent liked anyone this much ever,
we send hearts and stuff, he even said he really liked me,
when we saw eachother i felt so safe, i felt like i was able to just be myself and that i finally was good enough, i really really felt like he felt the same about me because thats how he acted,
i confessed how i feel about him,
and he said he really likes me as a friend,
as a friend,
the moment he said that i felt my heart sank, my head  was glowing from warmth, how could i be so stupid,
i never open up to anyone this fast, and with him ofcourse i do,
so stupid,
it hurts so bad,
im crying for the third night a row, 
i just cant stop thinking of him, i think this is the first time ive really been in love, thr butterflies and all that, i got my hopes up to and my walls down all to soon, 
it hurts like hell,
and the very few people around me dont even notice or tell me to move on, ""you have only just met and only seen him twice, not everyone is meant to be"", but they just dont understand, how it hurts, i really thought i felt this connection, i dont have a connection like this so fast like ever, i dont open up this big and fast to anyone ever, i dont dare to be this much of my self to anyone this fast EVER, i finally thought i could be enough,
surprise, turns out im not, not al all, 
and then again, im not special to anyone,

82,ReaperXZeos,1630366157,1,"Probably not the best place to be seeking a significant other, don't know if it's inherently against the rules here but I've seen similar posts and not much luck on other subreddits so here I am.

I'm 26, 27 in November. Male seeking female. 5'10"" and live in the Midwest/IL USA. Throughout my years of being alive I've had friends and love interests but nothing quite substantial/reciprocated. Either there was never any interest or it fizzled out quick and I'm left to pick up the pieces again and again. After going through this so many times and other shit, it's left me pretty hopeless when it comes to finding someone that likes me back and won't abandon or hurt me in someway. To the point where taking my own life or having it taken by another seems extremely appealing. 

I figured giving this place a shot since a lot of us have gone through similar walks of life and maybe we're seeking the same thing. I'm not good looking, I'm not rich, I don't really have any dreams or goals anymore, and I can't work due to a bad back injury I sustained in 2019. But what little I have I will give it all to the one person that deserves it. Too many times I've gone above and beyond to please someone else and they end up not caring nearly as much.

I've driven hours to go see someone who seemed interested only for them to ignore me on their phone and have me drive them around and pay for everything. I don't want that. I want an equal partnership. That doesn't mean you have to pay for everything or have to have a car, just show some appreciation, care, and interest in me and my hobbies.

I love to sing and dance. I jam out to metal and rock but have plenty of other genres in my collection. Cooking for myself and others brings me great joy, Italian and BBQ are my favorites and specialties. Swimming is extremely relaxing and one of my few favorite outdoor activities. I've done some crafting, woodworking, and welding to create costume props before as I love Halloween/fall and am interested in getting into cosplay. I used to be a mediocre artist and would draw occasionally. I primarily play games on PC and Switch and watch shows and movies in between. Horror and sci-fi are my favorites. Co-op games over PvP any day.

I believe it's fair to know of some potential deal breakers/red flags ahead of time. I am overweight and at the moment can't really do much to help it aside from drinking water/non caffeinated drinks and trying to eat healthier. I am extremely depressed and deal with it by making self deprecating jokes, dark and crude humor, and self isolating when it gets really bad. I crave companionship, praise, attention, and reaffirmation more often than not. I don't use drugs or drink alcohol but I do use porn as a means of giving my brain short bursts of happy feelings and I understand that it could be an addiction at this point. I don't care for politics and don't lean heavily in either side as I think there's good and bad points for both. I prefer dogs over cats. There's probably more but those are the main big ones I can think of at the moment.

If despite all this you find me tolerable and mayhaps a bit interesting then feel free to reach out through PM as I don't enjoy the chat feature. Please include a paragraph or two at least about yourself. I don't expect a novel, just some equal show of effort. A committed long term relationship with co-habitation or marriage is the ideal end goal. I use Discord for communication. I can provide photos and verification at request. Dog pics included.",lonely,Broken for Broken,2021-08-31 09:29:17
83,stressedsquirrell,1630363894,1,"There are a million thoughts running through my head right now and I seem to be unable to sort even a single one. So, I decided to turn to the one thing I know how to do and the one thing that always seems to help even just a little. I write.

I‚Äôve been alone in this house for a few weeks now and it‚Äôs the first time that I‚Äôve truly been and felt utterly alone. Sure, I have my friends, but it‚Äôs different. They‚Äôre all moving on with their lives, and I‚Äôm just here. I‚Äôve fallen back into old habits, my mental state is a mess, and more than anything I just need someone to be here for me and tell me it‚Äôs all going to be okay. I‚Äôve considered going back to therapy, but the thought terrifies me more than anything. The last time I went to therapy, I got out worse than I went in. Going back means talking about things again, obviously, and I don‚Äôt want to.

I sat outside tonight. I grabbed a diet coke ‚Äì I only allow myself one a week now - and a cigarette, and I sat there after watching a terrible, mushy film. A rom con, of all things. I hate rom coms, mind you. So, I sit, and I breathe, and I think. And for the first time, the loneliness truly hits me. It hits me like a truck, The past two years have been incredibly taxing.

I worked in a hospital for the first year. It was a stupid part time job, cleaning. It got me the money I needed to pay for my university, but it was brainless at first. I was trained, specialised, and after a while I was moved to the ER and heart units. I started working there before covid hit, but I was specialised and so when they needed people to move to the covid department, I was chosen. I, and two others.

We worked every single day, without rest, and split the shifts into three. At this point I was also working an internship as well as following classes, so I couldn‚Äôt work during the day. Instead, I worked every single night shift on the covid department. 7 days a week. The night shift would start at 8 pm and last until 6 am. My internship started at 9 am, so if I got home quickly, I could catch maybe an hour or two of sleep. When I didn‚Äôt have to work my internship, I had classes.

At first, it really wasn‚Äôt that bad. My colleagues and I functioned well, like a well-oiled machine, but we started noticing strain after a few weeks. We held on though, we really did. We watched people come and go, dead and alive. While cleaning, we met the patients and we had amazing conversations with those who weren‚Äôt hooked to a machine. I met an old man. He was very sick, but he was pulling through. Every night around 11 I would head into his shared room in my safety gear to clean the bathroom. We were always safe, covered from head to toe in safety wear. Gosh, it was a hassle to always put on that safety wear, but we knew it was necessary. Anyway, a lot of accidents were happening, so the bathroom truly did need cleaning twice a day. Room cleaning was done during the day shift, so I didn‚Äôt have to do that.

Every night he would tell me a story. About his family, his life, his past. At some point the people he was assigned a room with would join in, and they would tell stories. But this old man was special for some reason. He reminded me terribly of my own grandfather. He always strove to make me laugh, really. He‚Äôd say that he was fine, he‚Äôd win this corona fight because he had no reason to die yet. He had too much to live for. His granddaughter just had her first child, you see, and he was looking forward to holding her. This continued for a week or so, until he started to get sicker. He was moved to a private, smaller room.

After that, I didn‚Äôt get to see him much. Only occasionally when I popped in for a quick cleaning of his bathroom. Until it wasn‚Äôt needed anymore, because he could no longer get out of bed anymore. And one day, I heard that he had said goodbye to his family through the phone. His family was from the other side of the country, and he had been transferred to this hospital because the ones nearest to him were overwhelmingly full and my hospital had some space. But he had to say goodbye through the phone. So, that night, later than normal, I went into his room. I had been requested to clean his bedside table, since the nurses had been unable to do so. It was around 3 am. And I looked at him. This spirited old man, who had been so sure he‚Äôd make it through, did not.

I walked towards his bedside table, cleaned it all up, and left.

Half an hour later, he passed away.

I cleaned his room. A new patient would need it, you see. So, I cleaned it. And before I knew it, the end of my shift was there.

As I went through the entire process of cleaning myself up and such, I left the hospital. I sat in my car for a few minutes at the very back of the parking lot ‚Äì I always parked there, as I wanted to leave the more upfront spaces for the patients ‚Äì and I broke.

I had seen a lot of death, a lot of suffering, and I was so tired. So, I broke down. I called my mother at 6 am, bawling my eyes out, and close to screaming as I tried to explain to her how much I was hurting. She stayed on the phone with me for a good twenty minutes before I managed to collect myself enough to drive home.

When I arrived, my mum was waiting for me with her arms wide open and a warm blanket, as she walked me inside. I wasn‚Äôt quite there; my mind was everywhere but there. She turned on the shower, told me to warm up while she‚Äôd get me my pj‚Äôs, and when all was done, she directed me downstairs and unto the couch. She put on a stupid film and just cuddled me as I cried. She was simply there. And after that, I became very detached. I had already been so, but this was worse. I called in sick that day. To my internship and my university. I needed just one day, only one, and I would be okay again. Unfortunately, calling in sick at my workplace would be impossible to solve, so I went back to work that night. And I worked.

I did my job all the way until covid cases went down and the three of us weren‚Äôt needed anymore. Close to a year, I believe. They had trained a few more people who would be taking over, and we would be transferred back to our old units.

I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore though; I was completely drained. I hadn‚Äôt slept well for almost a year, and I had been stretched thin. So, I quit.

I was focussed on trying to heal, starting a new job too, but then I met a man. An American soldier. And although I‚Äôm aware of the stereotype, this was different. He threw a huge wrench into my plans. And for more than a year, we‚Äôve been long distance without having met. I could tell you all about it, but it won‚Äôt add anything to this rant. The second year was only as bad as the first. My mother got covid, and we all thought we would lose her. She was extremely sick. I also lost two grandparents, got health issues myself, and my job was terrible and exhausting, as well as very good at mistreating me.

The man I‚Äôm dating is currently away for a few weeks. I haven‚Äôt heard from him (not that I‚Äôm expecting to, since he‚Äôs away for work).

But as I sat outside tonight and the loneliness hit me, so did everything else. Knowing that my friends are moving on, my best friend is married and pregnant, and I‚Äôm just here. In an uncertain somethingship with a foreign man I‚Äôve never truly met, struggling to keep my head above water, and thinking. What if he hates me when he truly meets me? What if he‚Äôs changed his mind after he comes back from work? What if I‚Äôm too big of a mess? Why can‚Äôt I be okay, like everyone else seems to be? What is wrong with me? Why can‚Äôt I see a future anymore?

All I want right now is someone here. Someone to just wrap their arms around me, hug me, and tell me they care. That it‚Äôs okay. More than anything, I want that to be him, but I can‚Äôt make things happen that are impossible.

This got more chaotic as it went on, I apologise. I‚Äôm also unsure of how to finish this off and it‚Äôs truly more of a rant than anything. Sorry.

Those who complain, gon‚Äô stay the same. LEARN TO EMBRACE YOURSELF. LOVE YOURSELF. 


Secondly, START DOING SHIT. It may not matter what it is, it doesn‚Äôt have to be elaborate. Have it be something POSITIVE. You can watch all the self help videos you want, but what good will it do if you don‚Äôt DO ANYTHING? Go to a park, go find a gym, find a club, ANYTHING. Get some fresh air and sunlight, even if it SUCKS. Even if the thought of getting out of bed is PAINFUL. DO SOMETHING.


Thirdly, DO GOOD THINGS FOR YOUR BODY AND IT WILL DO GOOD FOR YOU. Stop eating a full party size bag of spicy nacho doritos in one sitting. Yeah that icecream? Put that away. Learn to cook something. Drink more water. Take a multivitamin, doesn‚Äôt have to be super complicated. SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE. The simpler your way of life, THE HAPPIER YOU WILL BECOME. HAVE DISCIPLINE.

I could cry honestly im so sad. Seeing everyone in lovely relationships and care for each other. Cuddle hold themselves in the arms and just be intim. Dont get me wrong. Im honestly so unbelievably happy that these people found each other and are happy together. Its so nice and wholseome seeing that I would never wish them anything bad. 

I crave intimicy so much atm. Its so depressing me. I want to cuddle feel loved wake up to a partner. Fall asleep with one. Feel Intimit and just be close. Explore stuff with that person.

I was never in a relationship till now. Never kissed a girl nor did hold hands hugged in a intim way. Nothing. Never even dated or anything. I just want to feel loved.... And it's not like I can't be loved. I often got toled i have a nice personality. I can also do stuff like cooking or cleaning. I also appereantly am attractive. Of course I also have my flaws.

117,Throwaway948292834,1630346068,1,"I turned 30 this year and I've convinced myself that I'm destined to die alone.  Not alone in the sense that no one will be at my funeral, but alone in the sense that I have no one to share my life with.

When I was young, I dealt with some childhood trauma, mental health issues, massive depression and suicide.  For a very long time I avoided the world and my own health.  It got to the point where I was mostly just going though the motions waiting for the day I would die.

Because of all of that, I never dated when I was younger.  I asked a few girls out in High School and College, but no one ever seemed interested in me, and I can't blame them, I didn't like myself then either.

Then a couple of years ago, things started to turn around.  I got a great job, I started being happy for once, and stopped struggling financially.  I decided I was ready to actually live life, and started working to fix some of the health issues I had and started trying to date.

I don't really get many opportunities to meet people, so I decided to try dating apps and dating reddits.

Every time I post on reddit, I don't even get a single response unless I include a photo of myself.  When I do include a photo, I'm lucky if I one response, and they always end with the girl either ghosting me or telling me something along the lines of ""You're a really sweet, intelligent guy, but I'm just not looking for a relationship.""

On the dating apps, I get a decent number of likes, but hardly ever match with anyone, and when I do they either never respond or we talk for one night and then they're no longer interested for some reason.

I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong.  It seems like people love to be my friend, but no one ever wants to be more than a friend.  People in my personal and professional lives always have nice things to say about me, and they often seem surprised when they find out I'm single.

Even if that meant trying to turn gay. So that didnt work. I did get some comments about me from random pushy dudes saying they would break me in bed. Thats nice.

So then i tried tinder for some godforsaken reason. Ive tried that app before with no success. While i was making my profile i slowly realized how absolutely below every other dude i am. I have no pictures of me with friends, no pictures of me at any sort of social thing, i have no pictures of me looking normal or happy, i have no pictures of me on vacation anywhere because i dont go anywhere. I look like i want to die in every pic. I tried to take nicer pictures of me but it looks so forced. My interests were at least better, fishing, gardening, cooking, outdoors. Regardless, i still tried. 

One girl who, unfortunately for her, was definitely in my league messaged me telling me i look gross. Thanks. I saw some girls i went to school with ages ago and tried to go around them so they wouldnt see i am still a ugly loser like i was in high school.  Over all, no success but i knew that was gonna happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted both accounts on both apps and accepted what i already knew. I have a long, long, long way to go before i can be classified as human. The mountain i have to climb just to reach average is ridiculous and nothing has changed in over four years.

147,Wisdomle55,1630325234,1,"I have come to beleive loneliness is an insiduous partner.

It can start with a turmoilous relationship that lives lingering

pain, a close friendship that faded into nothing, a close family member

being taken from us, or other incidents that bring us the pain of

the ending of something emotionally important for us. 

As we deal with the feelings, some people bounce back, form new relationships

that fill them with joy, love, hurt, hate and other feelings. Other people

take their time. It is these other people that find themselves with a new

partner. Someone that settled in, slowly and imperceptible at first: loneliness.

We don't recognize it. We tell ourselves it's ok to feel lonely sometimes. And it is.

But the longer we are alone, the more frequent we feel lonely.

Something dangerous can happen, sooner or later. One can become familiar with the pain

of loneliness. We do not recognize it as pain, or even if we do, we make a sanctuary of it.

As we live our lives, as we deal with people around us, friends, family, colleagues, 

we have experiences, both positive and negative. The dangerous part is, when we have

the negative experiences, we take refuge in our sanctuaries, the sanctuaries of loneliness.

This snowballs into a problem where one can find it hard to establish new, meaningfull

relationships, perpetuating the state of feeling alone. We can grow addicted to the

pain, it can become a substitute for love. We turn ourselves inwards.

We live inside ourselves. I beleive many artists, poets and philosphers went through

this effect. Sometimes, the lack of relationships frees our mind to focus

on things we wouldn't have the bandwith otherwise. I suppose I'm looking for a 

silver lining in this. Who knows.",lonely,Is it ok that I like to reflect on things like these?,2021-08-30 22:07:14

I've also don't have much a family that's been supportive of anything I've done.

Since then I had to find the motivation in me to go to college which I only did for one semester, and juggled two jobs in between. After my semester ended, I quit one job and stuck with the other for almost two years but I only did part time so most of money from both job went to my toxic sister who kept gaslighting me. Then 2020 hit and I thought this year was going to be a great year and I thought I should start the beginning of the new decade right, boy was I wrong. The pandemic hit, hours got cut at work, since I had to take the bus and I was depressed for a long time because of my toxic sister, I just didn't show up to work and eventually got fired at October.

I grew up on a farm and was the only girl in my age group in the community. So I grew up being one of the guys. And I mean actually one of the guys, most of my friends were related to me or grew up so close they might as well have been.

I literally just realized tonight that I've always blamed my difficulty in making actual friends on my own weird/unique traits, when that's not the issue at all. Apparently it's because I've got boobs.

I don't mean to sound full of myself or whatever but I'm actually pretty good looking and was blessed with curves.

I don't vibe with a lot of women, my friend told me it's because if they don't know me I'm intimidating??? I'm literally the nicest person ever and my social anxiety is out of this world, like seriously I do not see how I could be intimidating.

I do click well with guys, but they always end up mistaking my kindness for flirting or just like my curves and pretend to care till I either get sick of the subtle or not subtle comments and shut them down. 

How do I fix this? I don't do mix signals if I say I want to be friends I legitimately mean friends, if I want more I say so.

I don't understand what I'm supposed to do besides be myself and be up front and honest??

Why the hell is making friends so hard?? I literally just want people to talk to and vibe with. I'm genuinely tired of not having more friends.

A lot of people don't even answer my first messages to start with, but that's fine really. The problem comes when you get an answer, and then you have to carry the whole conversation. Let me explain.

A conversation is a two way street, I ask something, you answer and ask something back, and then you develop the conversation by going deeper in what both of you are saying, is that simple.

The problem is that most people that I've talked to in these subreddits make little to no effort on making questions back. How are we supposed to be friends if I'm the only one asking you about what you like, how's your city, what are your hobbies, etc? It makes no sense, that's an interview, not a conversation.

Of course is not all negativity, maybe some of you can use this post to check your previous chats with other people and see where you can improve.

I'd like to know your point of view on this, if something similar happened to you and how many times, I'm curious!

201,girlonaslowquest,1630289389,1,"3am and everybody on all of my friends list i can think of a reason not to talk to them. the vast majority have proven that they don't give a shit about me, and i would much rather talk to someone who will actually listen, rather than wasting my venting power on a conversation i will never be properly able to reflect on.

it's crazy, how much my interactions have taken a landslide in the past few months. usually i have my mechanisms to be able to forget about the outside, but this loneliness has chiselled its way into my mind and it's controlling me. i find myself clinging to every sense of something that i can enjoy or gain some sort of feeling from, because it feels like the void is right behind me; and while i would love to let go and be consumed, i can't.

physicals have not been good either. i have experienced a lot of hallucinations, most of them being tactile, i feel like things are crawling on me all the time.

i always operated on the mindset i've had ever since childhood, ""x will have my back"", ""i can just talk to y"", and that's ok, because x and y did exist, but now.. nothing..

i thought i was going to be the bigger person by cutting out everyone that didn't message me first, but well, that left nobody left it seems..

so many projects that i've had with people that i had the illusion that progress was being made, but i was just curious what would happen if i didn't say anything for a day, and that turned into a week, and now it's been over a month. i'm sick of it, and i'm scared of it. that's right, i'm admitting it, i'm fking scared. everything is catching up to me, poor mental state, doomscrolling every night, i can't take this for much longer

forgive me as i have not traversed this subreddit before and am not aware of the regulations, but if it's allowed for one to ask for help, or just someone to chat to, then please.. if you don't and carry on with your day, i still have a lot of respect for you because by reading this you've done more for me than my friends have in months.

Later in the night on Friday one of the guy friends (let‚Äôs call him Max) started making moves on me, and as I‚Äôm single I decided to go along with it for fun. It wasn‚Äôt anything serious, just some dancing and kissing at first. And the same thing happened on last night on Saturday, expect just a lot more of it because we were more comfortable with each other on the second night. At the end of the second night I went back to his place and we slept together.

This morning I was bombarded with text messages from my friends. Apparently he and the other girl I met that night used to have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù between them and it was really insensitive of me to have slept with him. At first I did honestly feel guilty about this, I really liked the girl and hoped we would become friends but I‚Äôve ruined that now. But then again, I had no idea they had a thing - I had literally only just met them. I just don‚Äôt understand how I could be blamed for being insensitive when I didn‚Äôt have a clue? If anything, they should be annoyed at Max because he was aware of the situation - yet all the anger is aimed at me :(
They even had the chance to warn me. They saw what happened on Friday and didn‚Äôt say a word until me and Max took it further on Saturday. It almost feels like it‚Äôs been set up, like they just waited for an excuse to hate me, but I might just be reading into it too much.

Anyway, my closest friends aren‚Äôt even talking to me at the moment and I just don‚Äôt know what to do - I‚Äôd usually go to them when I‚Äôm feeling down. Ironically, Max is the only one who‚Äôs reached out to me, but I feel talking to him would just fuel the fire.

They always have nice talk with me, laugh with me, and seem to have a good time whenever I call them, but it's always just me calling them, they rarely call me and mostly when they need something.

In the last 1,5 years I have started to somewhat become more and more alienated from a lot of my friends since I started to change quite a few of my interests and opinions and they didn't. Which is fine, I would never force my views on anybody but it is quite sad nonetheless. This has left me to feel somewhat lonely from time to time. I am looking for somebody that would be interested in having a long term internet friend and that shares atleast a few of my interests. I like to involve myself with philosophy, politics and other topics that lead to respectful conversations.

282,MikeKoder87,1630257433,1,"I've been lonely most of my life. I'm an only child who was adopted by his maternal grandparents at 7 y/o because my mother was a drug user. Never knew my dad. Growing up I was friendless until 4th grade where I finally made a group of friends and it was great. However, we broke apart in 6th grade and I remained friendless until 8th grade. I made a single friend who remained my only friend throughout high school. It was good, but having only a single friend isn't ideal. We grew apart in college. I was friendless until my junior year in college where I met a group of guys. It was great, but after graduation we all drifted apart. 

That was 11 years ago. I have been friendless for that long. I've gotten by thanks to some online friends that I played games with, but they recently moved on to playing games I don't care to. I always had my grandparents who I was very close too, but my grandpa died in 2013 and my grandma died in 2019. With her death I became the loneliest I've ever been. 

There are people at work who I talk with and who talk with me, but they don't want to hang out outside of work, which is fine. I understand there are ""work friends"" and ""close friends"". There was this one person who was game to hang out for my birthday this year and it was great. They even invited me to hang out with them the next day. But since then it has become clear that they are not interested in being close friends. They've since left work to pursue further education. I've tried to set up times to hang out, but they are always busy. They probably are busy, but the fact that they never text me to set something up tells me they're just not that interested. 

I've recently tried to better myself by going back to school to switch careers. Things were looking up but I ran into a big problem: money. I needed to take out a private student loan but everywhere I applied required a cosigner. No one wanted or was able to be my cosigner. It made me feel even more alone. I had to unenroll in school as a result. 

The weekends are torture for me now. I want to go out and do things with people, but I have no one to do them with. I have no prospects of friends either in my life and everything is looking very hopeless. I'm faced with the very real prospect of not only living a unfulfilling career, but an unfulfilling social life. 

It doesn't help that I've also been single my whole life. I am a 34 y/o who has never been kissed let alone had any sexual relations. I've been on several dating sites and apps and I never get any likes which just exacerbates the loneliness. 

I'm not sure how to proceed anymore. I've never been this lonely before and it absolutely sucks. I'm no stranger to suicidal ideation. Back in 8th grade I actually attempted suicide but obviously failed. However, with my current life situation I find myself once again thinking about suicide. What's the point of living if that life is just going to be unfulfilling? Even if I was able to get a fulfilling career, but still remain with an unfulfilling social life would that be a life worth living? I find myself answering no. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, for those of you who do. I suppose it is more of a vent than anything. I really don't know how to proceed with my life.",lonely,"34M, I am so lonely",2021-08-30 03:17:13

There was a couple of people I talked with in class my first year, but because of the pandemic and me switching majors I don't now. And because I switched to business, I don't think I'm really going to be able to make any new friends. The people in there are majority sports players or in Greek life. They're athletic, outgoing, and attractive and I'm none of those things. 

And the problem is after spending so long alone I'm bored by everything. My only ""hobby"" is spending time on the internet and I can barely stand that. There's no clubs I would want to join. And I have nothing to talk about if the situation ever presents itself. I just blank out. I know these are probably products of depression/anxiety, but I can't get over being depressed if I don't have any friends.

I send her a picture of my face and she tells me that I am too old (she was 21 and I am 25), though I didn't understand what context.

Morning! :)

I must say, the summer weather in Sweden is still holding rather strong... not that I intend to venture out anywhere today, that's something those crazy, bubbly extroverts like to do! - [Insert an appropriate meme!](https://imgur.com/a/R2Py93A)

*The sudden click of the kettle calls me. I shall be right back with a beverage in hand!*

Now, where shall I begin this mess...

May I be intrusive enough to ask how your weekend has gone so far?  :)

Mine has been rather uneventful to date, but last night it was quite the excitement to be woken from my slumber by the bellowing of a fire alarm. As someone who currently resides in a long-stay hotel, I had to go outside and look in awe at the fire engines... brings me right back to the school days and meeting the firemen! - see how exciting a life I lead? :P

Anyways, enough of this nonsense! I know I will ramble on too much as it is, so feel free to read further if you want a monologue!

**About me:**

I'm a bit of an old-ish fart now, closer to 33 than 32, and I'm a relatively *sane* chap originating from the Northern parts of England... like, the really Northern parts so I might as well be Scottish! After passing through the school system with my life barely intact, I proceeded to spend my days being boozy and enlightened in the dingy local pub and drifting through a series of random jobs: cracker packer in a biscuit factory, cleaner in a mental health facility, two weeks in a metal factory and then a week on a bull-producing farm... you simply couldn't resist looking at those boys in sheer awe, and this was also the the time I was affectionately refereed to as the *bull wanker* \- just don't ask!

After all that it was finally some steady work in health and social care until...

I met someone who wouldn't be in the United Kingdom forever, and with said kingdom opting to deny me the continued right to move around Europe, I decided to back my meagre belongings, jump on a plane, bugger off to Sweden and go underground - [the public wants what the public gets!](https://open.spotify.com/album/4GQmfMtt1JhIQLK3L6p5lo?si=mr2Ed_zGQX6uw-55xGN9aQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1)

Whilst the said reason for moving to Sweden has since collapsed (*and I'd rather be anywhere else than here today!*), and I'm not really sure where my taped-over life is heading next, this is where I remain to this day... twiddling my fingers and waiting for tomorrow's dawn of another working week!

In an attempt to try keep myself sane, I do have some interests aside from picking bogies and staring at the walls of my little kingdom thinking, ""Where the heck did it all go wrong?"" :)

Some of those interests are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Music - important to me, in that it offers me an opportunity to escape reality and connect with whatever lyrics take my fancy. I am quite stubborn over my tastes, like my long love affair with Irish folk, but I am always open to pretending I have listened to alternative genres :P
* Travelling/Wandering - whilst I am certainly not some overbearing extrovert, I do actually like to wander about (when the mood strikes) and get lost in other worlds... especially the quiet ones! I can sit at a small harbour for hours, and I already have an upcoming Germany trip pencilled in!
* Rambling/Sharing - isn't the whole point of this to share and get to know each other? As someone who appreciates the open and honest approach, I will share anything and everything with you. It could be some random picture from my day, to the inner workings of whatever goes on upstairs!
* Postcards/Gifts - what's not to like about a postcard? If I get to know someone well, the day will come when I pester the life out of you until you let me send you one - there are more crude ones available as well! Usually sent with my thoughts of the day, plus a little doodle or two :P
* Fleeting moments - this meaning I will sometimes become obsessed with a particular *thing* and then move on after a week or so. I sometimes wish I could be a little more calm, not as impulsive, but ants in ya pants will make ya belly button dance!
* Other stuff - it will just come up as time goes by, you'll just have to dare get to know me and see what makes little Dexiteer tick!

**Moving on:**

I really hope that rambling nonsense above gives you some idea of who I am... I certainly still don't know who I really am! :)

Maybe I should mention what I'm looking for?

Well, friends would do nicely... so pretty please be my friend? :P But seriously, I am just in this to meet new people and hopefully expand my little social circle. We all have preferences, let's not fib, and mine would be to meet and get to know people from back home, Germany, Sweden and the rest of Northern/Western Europe... who knows, maybe we can go for a pint or two one day? I've done it before! :)

But preferences aside, I don't really rule anyone out based on your gender or where you happen to be in this world, that's not how I go about things. All I ever really ask of anyone is to be as genuine and open as they can be, and if we so happen to not really *click* as they say then that's fine!

I will, of course, do my best to be a good friend and hopefully get to know you well. I do care about people, and I am passionate about helping and being alongside others, but it's also important to note I am not offering myself out as someone's on-call counsellor. I do have some sort of life, I do get busy with work and so on, but I always do my best to be there for others when they really need it :)

I don't judge (I've had enough of that in my own life) and I will never throw expectations on anyone brave enough to get in touch!

**Gritty stuff:**

Depending on the kind of people I'm looking for, I sometimes choose not to add this part... but today I want to in some sort of hoping to connect way!

I am, writing this now, saying I am not without my skeletons and this is something I am always open to talking about. Not really saying I am depressed or anything 'cause I'm not, but I have been through past trauma that sometimes gives me a little wobble or two. Since the turn of the year, I have been striving towards being way more open and talkative about this and, overall, I would say it's being going rather well for me :)

[I was happy back then sometimes!](https://imgur.com/a/gnWDxKa)

I have other things going on, as many others do, and more often than not I am able to pick myself and carry on. As the small social circle I have is a little way off from me, not getting to see those people often, I sometimes get a little lonely and feel a little disconnected from the world.

All of this, of course, is not me saying I am going to talk your head off about the trials and tribulations of my life! I don't do that, but I think what I am saying is that I do get it - and I feel the best way to approach this stuff is to share your own experiences.

I will still talk your head off though! ;)

**And finally:**

Had enough of this crap now? :)

I just wanted to say my door is open to anyone who feels like venturing through it, and I am open to private messages and chat requests on here to begin with. I know I write way too much for my initial introduction, but there is no expectation for you to do the same. I am, however, not interested in small talk 'cause it simply doesn't go anywhere.

There's some stuff on my relatively new profile you can look at, and I am about for the rest of today and hope to hear from one or two of you :)

Take care,

I don't feel like I have real friends I can talk with freely and feel totally comfortable with. This group can have its frustrations where I feel like I need to be on my toes to deflect verbal attacks or annoying things they force on you lest I become somewhat of a punching bag. And this just gets amplified in this competitive board game scenario. Sly comments build up and people take sides against you and comments start flying back and forth and it becomes bigger than it should and I even start to annoy myself with how much I'm talking back, at which point things get turned on me for being difficult despite what everyone's said collectively. And I probably was. But it just brings back into full force how toxic these situations feel and the type of relationships I wish I had instead.

And then I go home alone and have nothing but this residual frustrated feeling that if I really let sink in might make cry.

332,HereForTheShow_,1630219815,1,"My third-person perspective:

In other countries, the broken are embraced. In the US, the broken are told to get their shit together, demonized, scolded, punished, estranged, and worst case scenario, thrown into the criminal justice system.¬†

In other countries, families grow larger and extend into communities. In the US you are told to go start a life of your own.

Not to long ago, you met your next spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend through your friends, family, or coworkers, sometimes even your family and friend's coworkers. Today, you are told ""oh, just download Tinder"". There is literally no need for a lady or male to even say hi to you in public anymore, sometimes it is even considered down-right weird to smile, make eye contact, or god for bid make conversation with someone who you do not even know. Chances are, the larger the city you live in, the more offensive it is to even approach someone. i.e ""why are you even talking to me""?¬†

In less than ten years, we value the word of podcasters, instagramers, and influencers more than our own mother's, the church, our friends, or even the everyday humans we walk amongst. \*PS you are free to practice any religion of your choice, hail satan if all I care or don't\*¬†

Parents are told that the world is more dangerous than it is ever been, but in reality, we live in the safest time we have ever been. As a result, kids stopped playing outside, and mentorship died. They convinced you that everyone had ill intentions for your children, when in reality, to gain the trust of a child is a blessing.¬†

Ipads became babysitters, youtube ran its course, and google became the end all, be all of all non-objective information. Rather than trusting your eyes and seeking experience, children sought information. Might I remind everyone that we used to convince children that they were safe from an atomic bomb by hiding under a desk... imagine what a child will believe today. Ask my 12 year old niece who was convinced a full grown man ""just wanted to be her friend and meet up""

Now... on to what it means to be a man.¬†

Women have been taught to humiliate men in the 2010's, where used to, women used to curtsy and/or flirt. Yes, essentially what I am saying is sometimes progress can be harmful to a society, and sometimes it is OK to conserve tradition. Also, humility goes a LONG way. We have lost humility...

Men were told for ten straight years that NORMAL FRATERNAL behavior and secondary male behavior was toxic and disgraceful... and god-forbid if you were straight or if you were white. \*PS Trust me, I grew up in the most diverse city on the planet, I love who I am, and who WE are. So we created a generation of ashamed men... are you really surprised that so many young men just ""checked out"" on life?! Said to hell with dating, masturbation and instant porn is all i need. \*PS I was a single, late 20s college professor expected NOT to date any of the students... do you have any idea how wrong that is? It is down right animal cruelty. (Lol).¬†

Between #MeToo, title IX, and every corporate mandated sexual misconduct training under the sun, who in their right mind would feel comfortable advancing towards anybody these days?

Women were convinced to seek out becoming a CEO of their company, but then shocked when men preferred a women who fit traditional nurture roles instilled in our DNA. 50 hour work weeks vs. millenia of evolution, pheromones, and raw expressions pulsating to be set free. Who we are and what it means to be human. The kind of sex that rattles the gods. Pure.¬†

This one might ruffle a few, and be forewarned, it is okay to be promiscuous, gay, or gender-whatever you feel comfortable with. BUT the hypersexualization of our children, and 10 years of constant exposure of perverse material against our will was wrong. No one asked for that, and frankly I think it is great that homosexual couples can now receive federal benefits, long overdue. \*PS Might I point out that Cardi Bs ""WAP"" was the Billboard top #1 song for several weeks in caucasian predominant countries ONLY. All asian, and hispanic countries featured local/traditional styled music. Just thought I'd throw that out there.¬†

Also, if you are a gay man‚Ä¶ you are still a man. It is okay to fill that role despite your sexual orientation. Also, if you are a female, feel free to be gentleman as well, i seriously do not care. In fact, if we are going to move down this trend of women empowerment, yet, still expect guys to be the ones to approach women, I am all for women taking over that duty. If women want to be insulted by advances of men, then dont be upset if the hot guy doesn't approach you anymore, it is your job now, remember, thats what you wanted... right? Seriously, no more of this ""it is the guys responsibility to approach a woman"" crap, you made this bed, now sleep in it. 

Also, what happened to the casual date? Ladies, go on dates with dudes who gain the courage to ask you out. There is nothing that says you have to sleep with them. Same for dudes, we can be pretty shallow too, but again, it is VERY rare for a woman to approach a women these days. 

Toss in years of adderall, SRIs, video games, screen time, the destruction of TRUST, fast food, and marijuana-abuse, and here we are... PS, I love marijuana, too much \*and fast food.¬†

So, the next time you are sitting here lonely, ask yourself... am I the problem?¬†

If you are frustrated, realize you are not alone. We NEED to come together as a society. I am sorry that it is not your president speaking these words. It should be.¬†

The amount of times I have seen dating app marriages fail, the amount of times I have seen smiling happy faces on facebook end up divorced, and the amount of PEOPLE I see including myself who see no light at the end of the tunnel is absurd. It is time it comes to an end. Normalize prenups or normalize what it means to be a human being again. Take your pick, but we cant do this on our own.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, this will all fall on deaf ears. Congrats, you have officially been red-pilled.¬†",lonely,Word Vomit 2021 USA Edition (Mature Readers Only),2021-08-29 16:50:15

so i changed schools around eighth grade, eventually communication between us slowly dimished and we basically went our seperate ways. i've been to four different schools, didn't make a single friend in any of those, except for some here and there. years later the same ""friends"" from my old school  started reaching out to me  and  linked up back again and i was happy really, i was really happy but, they were different people. i didn't know them anymore and even though  they were the only people who were willing to hang out with me,  i just don't feel like they like to have me around. they talk in their own alien language full of inside jokes or references they know i don't understand, i feel left out, extra, almost as if i didn't exist tbh. still was better than staying at home jerking off, feeling sorry for myself.  

i'm 18 turning 19 december, feel like i've wasted my whole youth and ironically a lot people would disagree but hear me out. i always see on ig stories some of my childhood supposed ""best friends"" hanging out together, going to clubs, shopping, picnics, doing rich kid stuff i wish i had the money for. they never reach out or anything. my best friend hanging with some people i've never seen or even heard of, when i text the dude, mf always replies MONTHS later and it pisses me off so much cuz he always comes up with this lame excuse of ""oh i'm sorry i forgot abt it lol"" like u didn't see my text on top of the chats and a notification and still chose to ignore my text. incredible. 

what made me wanna join this sub and write this post at 1:09 AM local time for me, was that i saw a story of them at the beach for a goodbye party for some friends that leaves to study abroad and they didn't even bother telling me. i've never felt so betrayed, lonely, sad, angry and just honestly so miserable in my entire life.

always saw them since age 15 doing  stuff i only wish i could house parties, surprise birthday parties, going to the beach, all of that i know i missed out. never got invited to any of them.

there's so much more but yea

all i wish, all i want is to find people who would appreciate me. listen to the weird  music i'm into together, watch animes, talk abt videogames and conspiracy theories and idk just live man. i wanna hang around people who make me feel loved and a ""i'm glad you're here with us"" kind of way

The context here is the following:   
I picked up a new mobile game 2 days ago with just one goal in mind, obtaining a character that  I really like from said game. Fast forward 2 days later into the game I've tried my hardest to get the character with no avail because luck wasn't on my side however on my last and very final attempt a spark of luck happend and I got the character that initially made me pick up the game. I instantly had a hectic happy reaction because I couldn't believe it myself, the sheer joy that I had at that moment was incredible however it wouldn't last long.  


I was so happy that I just wanted to share my joy by telling someone about ""my story"" and possibly send them a screenshot of me getting my desired character however when I opened my Discord that's when I realized that I have no friends at all, I didn't have anybody who I could message and share my moment of joy with and that felt so crushing that my excitment crumbled instantly.   


I am alone, I'll always be alone and I'll never find friends even online with who I can get along with because I have no social life. I really do question what for do I still wake up everyday because genuinely speaking I'm legitimately alone, I have nobody IRL nor online. To anybody who read this far if you happen to have a close and intimate friend online who you can message at any given time and you're able to share anything with them let me tell you that you're blessed. I wish I could had that as well.

Even if I didn't have friends in this city I wanted to do things. I volunteered and I made an intention to chat with others, and I did. I don't ask for their contact info because I don't want to feel any pressure. They ask me for mine but I didn't expect much. They were starting college and I was graduated. I've done this before. They can't relate. I almost thought he could. He said his parents didn't fully approve his choices sometimes, sounded like mine. But then I saw all the friends and social media he had and I knew he couldn't relate. his parents weren't like mine.

I look forward to therapy each week because it is the only place I feel like I can get answers to my life. I tried to chat with anyone I found interesting. I felt so empty after. I went to the movies alone. I did this once a few years ago and I felt emotionally broken after. Because it meant I had no one and I was rubbing it in. 

I have no idea what relationships I want. Work relationships can stay there I guess? But if they wanted to hang out I would always be down. I was always down, I took every opportunity.

I have a family but it doesn't even feel like one. What is a family that you actively distance from the last year? Is this even a family? It's like I lost my main support relationships right when I turned into an adult. The moment I tell other people they tell me things their family did that could be considered 'worse'. So is this normal ? So I don't know who to listen to so I go back to therapy.

I can't do this alone, can I? Do I even want to? I know I will keep spiraling if I stay in all the time.

Since then, during the senior's year, I was alone and sitting by myself. This is when I started to have social anxiety.

 After, college has started and was only offered online. The only contact I've got from senior was a guy. He makes me enter his discord server and I was glad to make new friends. We had so much fun and it was the first time for a while that I was happy and glad to be alive. There was a guy that Ive had fun to chat with.. One day he was open to me and tells me something personal and loyal as I am I wouldnt tell a word. As myself too I open up to him because I was finally trusting someone for the first time. But then a joke went off and the guy get pissed (but I really was joking and everybody knows I was the clown of the server ). He exposes all my secrets to 20 people of the server and tells shitties about me to the one and only guy I know from senior. I was trying to stood up but sheeps follows without trying to figure out. 

So then I left media for 2 months. So then the man I know from senior ask me to join back and tells me that everything is fine. So then I came back. Then the man who did me dirty left the server. But then create another server and start to Say how bad I am and bullying me online and judging everything I do. Not once of my online friends stand Up for me. But they where fine with me and I was kinda inconfortable. 

But few months later they start to just go on another server so I cant join them when they go on ""voc"". I tried my best to stay in contact with two of them which I like to talk . But the contacts are less there (the closest one let me on read and I felt heartbroken) and they tag the guy Who Bully me and talk to him like good friends. This hurts.

388,A_Refill_of_Mr_Pibb,1630199433,1,"Today is a day off for me (38/M). My phone alarm goes off at 10:45am, and I linger in bed until about 12:45pm. Flash forward to 8:15pm. Today I have managed to have coffee, shower, take the dishes out of the dishwasher and get the mail. The phone doesn't ring and I receive no texts. My last text conversation was more than a week ago and my last phone call was 11 days ago wishing my dad a happy birthday. I realize I haven't eaten yet, so I trudge to the car and drive the half mile to my grocery store in the rain. 

I'm looking for something single serve for dinner in the frozen foods. The store is quiet. A young couple about 23 bops into the section next to me. He looks like a gym rat. She's wearing his sweatshirt. They're being goofy and making couples in-jokes and she is hanging on his arm. I leave for a different section of the store to find something because it really doesn't matter what I buy. I end up getting an overpriced cold sandwich, a bag of chips and a coke. The couple leaves ahead of me and go together through a turnstyle door, laughing because they're caught in the same section on purpose. I'm leaving through the same door in a moment. I want to die. 

I approach my car, alone now in the lot. A group of kids enjoying their last week before school saunters through the area cackling and being kids. I watch them and remember when I wanted to be in those groups as a kid. But I was shy and anxious then. Now I watch them knowing you can never go back and try again. I sit with my wipers going for a moment, pull my mask off and pull my ball cap down farther over my forehead. I wonder to myself, if I filled my gas tank, and drove off right now until I was never heard from again, would anyone give a fuck? The moment passes. It always does.

I get back to the apartment, another night of isolation ahead. I have no furniture, and the chair I found at the dumpster last month broke, so I spread my dinner out on the edge of my bed. I'm careful to lay a napkin so I don't get crumbs. The food tastes good, and for a moment, I forget.",lonely,Can you relate to this experience?,2021-08-29 11:10:33

So to start off, I'm 21 now but I'll be turning 22 next month and socially it still feels like I'm still stuck as if I'm 12, and as to elaborate I struggle with borderline personality disorder, and no I've never gone to therapy and I don't much see the need to want to attend it since I'm mostly very isolated 95% of the time and I try and hide any of my issues from my family, mainly my dad because it's been a hard enough time as it is for this past decade dealing with the way life's gone in the direction of, so I try to be strong for him despite everything else that's happened.  


I've never made any real life friends, I've never attended public school seeing as I've been home schooled my whole life, and the only friend I can say that I have is a guy diagnosed with high functioning Aspergers that I met on Steam about 11 years ago when I started playing Team Fortress 2, but as of late our friendship has become very tense and strained due how hard his living situation has become with his family as well, and the way that I tend to become bitter and cause arguments over shitty feelings I struggle to control, so he's just been taking time to himself to try and recover from things due to total burn out which I recommended and even encouraged because I don't want to lose him as a friend.  


So I guess I'm just here now writing stuff out to anyone who might feel similar, because I've tried discord and it always ends like shit, omegle completely disgusts and disturbs me every time I use it, and the only thing I have going for me that keeps me in a positive direction is my friend, my dad, my artistic abilities (like ZBrush) and exercise.

Hi. Just wanted to say some stuff. Male bytheway 

So I have been on this planet for around 18 (almost 19) years and I haven't had a single partner in any Form till now. Not relationship/sexually/cuddling wise. And I don't really know what to do. It's not like I don't try. To be fair I have asked not to many girls till now but I dont wanna ask anyone. I tried it like 4 times to ask a girl out. I prob didn't really do a good job üòÖ.

I am not really the most  social person. I have some friends and some of the best ones I have are girls but i have male friends as well. Just not to many.

At this point im just feeling a strong urge to love someone care for someone and get those feelings back. Like I really wanna cuddle and have a nice time with someone. Not even talking about sex or anything. I mean sure that aswell but mostly cuddling/holding hands /love bla bla.
I kinda feel like I am one of those people who will never get into a relationship. I can't kinda imagine myself in one either. Like me? Relationships? Nah mate that doesn't fits.

If anyone cares to me personally here is some shit about me.

Im kind / have a good heart /like cooking /can do housework /am kinda lazy at times /around 5'8 (maybe a bit more. People claim I grew didn't measure yet) have broad shoulders /thick black hair /am Turkish /and appereantly I look really good according to some friends, family and some random girl on Instagram that hit me up because she was interested. I declined bytheway she wanted to marry at 23...üòÖ

417,Soviet_Viper,1630183248,1,"All my life I've been lonely. I'vs never knew what it felt like to have a real friend, i never knew what what it felt like to have an actual real life friend (all my friends have been online on discord). Whenever i try to make friends, especially with girls, shit always happens and i just can't have one long lasting friendship. I've met people before that at first seemed nice and found out how horriblrlr they were. 
Guy, 4 years (longest friendship with a guy), all we did was gaming so nothing meaningful, barely talked about each other's lives but we knew a bit about each other. After like 2 uears he started being really toxic whenever playing and i stopped talking with him for months then started talking again amd so on until i completely ended it around the end of 2019 i think.
Guy, 3 years, gaming a lot etc, there were times he also got pretty toxic cause of games and we stopped talking for months again cause of toxicity and the last time we talked a couple weeks ago he told me some bad things so that's gonna be the last time we ever gonna talk again.
Girl, 6 months (longest friendship with a girl), she ended up betraying my trust by leaking some things i told her.
Girl, 3 months, she went on tiktok mid-convo and i thought something bad happened and after 20 minutes or so she came back saying she was watching tiktok not even apologizing and when i confronted her she turned toxic and told me to unfriend her, so i did
Ex-gf, first and only gf I've ever had, 2 months, she was cool at first but she always believed other ppl other than me and she treated me badly cause those people did the same and she broke up and banned me from her discord server and last time i spoke to her she wasn't toxic anymore but i found out she's done the same thing to me she did with her other 5 or so boyfriends she's hsd after me. She hurt them, made them feel useless and like shit and in the end she suffered as well. She made me cry and that was the last time I've cried and I haven't been able to cry at all no matter how sad I felt. That was almost 2 years ago.

There's many other examples of bad people I've met. I've met over 300 people in the past 3 or so years. Never could have a long lasting friendship. While 1-2 years ago i could have friendships with girls (for example) last 1-4 months now i can barely pull 1 week. With guys we mostly just play games from time to time, we don't talk about ourselves much so i don't really see that as a meaningful friendship.

I just felt so many times like I just am meant to be lonely forever. Ever since I've known myself since 4 years old I've never had one good friend, kids never played or talked with me so yeah.

I recently entered a new relationship and for a brief moment thought it would ease my loneliness. For a while we lived in the same city and it was actually great fun but now we're long distance for the unforeseeable future... and hearing how he spends his free time is making me feel miserable again. It's just like being on social media again. Being constantly reminded of how lonely I am.

Him:

""I'm spending the weekend at my friend's summer house, gonna have a great time!""

""We had a game night with the boys yesterday haha I barely got any sleep last night""

""I went for a run with my buddy today""

""My childhood best friend is coming to visit me next week, I'm so excited! Haven't seen him in over a year""

""I've got a couple of friends coming over to study with me later today""

""We bought tickets to this concert next month, we've been looking forward to it forever""

""My friend invited me to go hiking in Norway for a week""

""Sooo what have you been up to?""

...

It's always the same responses from me. Well, I... read a book today. Got some work done. Went for a walk. Cooked myself dinner. Did some yoga. Watched netflix. Nothing... nothing special. Just like yesterday. Just like tomorrow.

I'm seriously considering ending this relationship because I don't know if I can deal with this pain. I'm relapsing back into my depression for several reasons (2021 has been the hardest year of my life) and I know for a fact that even though he's a great guy and I like spending time with him whenever we get the chance, I might not be mentally ready for a relationship and all of this is contributing to my declining mental state. I know I may seem ""ungrateful"" because there are so many people on this sub who would want nothing more than to have that someone special in their life to call their boyfriend/girlfriend.

It's so twisted being heartbroken over someone who never loved you truly. Seeing your emotions get wasted on someone who was never on the same page. Someone who just draws out love from you, without the intention of filling you back up.

Your feelings linger even as your anger tries to get the better of you. That clash of emotions, the breaking down of your spirit, the melancholy of the moment, all the memories no matter how one-sided it was - everything comes crashing over you, taking over your mind. 

No matter how many distractions you have the pain remains at the forefront of your mind.

And I don't know if this is the right sub, but I think most lonely people is dealing with that 

It is my choice, since being with or around people is really draining me. Being around right people, is okay.  And I have friends, but I still prefer to spend most of my time being alone and doing the things I enjoy. 

If I spend a day with more than 2 people, I actually feel so tired and exhausted, and I just dream of getting back home. And once I get a nice bath and read a good book, I slowly start to feel better again and get my energy back. 

And I just realised, I am really happy on my own, I  just really hate being judged by people that are close to me, because they think I am wasting my life, I am young so I should be more outgoing and doing more things. And for a long time I felt bad about choosing to be alone, I thought that maybe there is something wrong with me, and I am happy to finally understand the issue, it was always the judgement of others. 

And yes I tried to tell those people, that it is what I enjoy most. But I guess they take it as excuse, they think its something I say to make myself feel better about that. 

And I know where it is coming from. Something like 6-7 years ago, I was really outgoing, I would hate to stay home, I was always in the middle of everything. I had lots of 'friends'. But I changed, and those friends wasn't anything real, once I realised that, I focused on myself more and I somehow changed a lot. 

And since I recently broke up after 4 years of being in relationship, my family and even some friends are worried about me, that I am all alone, and I put 0 effort to change that, because they can't simply understand that it is my choice.

For context I (20) have always been someone who is anxious and not the best in new situations. But as someone who comes from a toxic household abroad was a pathway to my dream of travelling and escaping.
My journey to study abroad was not an easy one as I initially planned to come with a friend but due to her not getting a place at the same university as me her parents did not allow her so after deciding for a while I went anyway. 
Before this in order to appease her parents I took off the main countries I wanted to go off my application and decided to stick to Europe as it would also be close to home but without a passion for the city I was coming to.
However, due to these changes I only knew I was definitely going one week before leaving and I was really rushed in preparation.
My parents have been supportive but my elderly ill father has been missing me already and I have also been worried about him. I‚Äôve never been anywhere without my family at the very least my a sister and this is my first time in a new country.
Since arriving I‚Äôve had several issues such as being given a dirty room (student building) with bugs hair and dirt around which led to a breakdown but a cleaner did come in after lots of going back and forth but I did try to calm myself down as I thought it was just a first day issue.
The next day I was throwing up all day I don‚Äôt know what the cause was as I had not ate for 24 hours before this and just felt lonely as I didn‚Äôt want to tell my family as they would worry despite them calling me throughout the day.
Then the next day my roommate arrived, we have a shared studio apartment with just a wardrobe to separate us. I have never shared a room before and I feel like my privacy has ben invaded, she is kind but extremely noisy through the night and morning and i am a very light sleeper and the thought of her being able to look through my stuff when im not here makes me very stressed out. I knew it would be a shared studio before coming but I know im not cut out for this and I feel like a bad person for not being grateful and pushing the study abroad option on my friends and family to want to go back after a week without even making it through quarantine. 

I feel like I‚Äôve lost all self confidence and hope for things to get better as when I do the next is worse. Even now as I type someone in the building is blaring their music and it makes me want to go home and just be safe with my family again.

Sorry if this is long I just don‚Äôt even know how I feel other than overwhelmed and just a constant urge to cry because
I feel like I‚Äôve made the wrong decision.
The uni has been very disorganised not helped me with much provided me with no ways to food after being quarantined messed up my courses  which could mean my permit to stay in the country would be invalid as I won‚Äôt be studying what my home uni requires.

451,toxicpotatoez,1630167163,1,"Hey lonely people,


So here's the deal. I'm nearly 25m, and I'm generally content with the way my life is rn. I have a job with stable income, really good friend circle, and I like to fill my time with hobbies I enjoy. I'm fairly confident in myself, and at this point I'm recognising the value I'm adding in other people's lives. Hey I think this me guy is rather great!

Here's the thing though. As much as I appreciate all the me-time, and even seek it sometimes, there comes a be a point where I just yearn for something a bit more...intimate. Like yeah I don't mind doing things alone (already from my long commutes to my time at home) but like, I want to hear someone else's voice for once. Someone I tell all about my workday and other crazy shenanigans and hear about all their embarassing moments. To just lounge with and cuddle and watch a nice romcom and have a laugh. Make life go just that bit easier for both of us knowing we got each other's backs no matter what. Again, I have good friends but there's a certain intimacy I find lacking, that my friends or myself cannot provide (for obvious reasons). It's a bit difficult to cuddle or hug myself y'know......and my friends are also busy with starting their lives and getting married left and right T-T

As well, I'm very willing to absolutely shower that person with all the love and affection. I've got plenty to give man, I just want that person to reveal themselves at once so we could have a blast. I don't know, people say love comes when you least expect it or want it and I've never thought much about it tbh, I was of the mentality that ""it'll come whenever it does"" and didn't worry too much. But at this point it's just starting to get just a little frustrating and I'm getting old fast lol.

452,WholesomeMindbreak,1630166391,1,"I dont really have any actual friends I have 2 people I talk to and only one of them appears to treat me with mutual reapect. It used to be like that with the other but idk what happened. They used to be nice and considerate of my time meaning they actually seemed interested in talking to me and didnt just ignore and leave me on read all the time. I even talked to them about it and they said it was my fault cuz I was ""just talking about the same shit over and over"" when I wasnt we were both having conversation and half way thru he just loses interest and just respond with ""ok"" to everything I say even when it doesnt make sense in context. It makes me feel extremely empty and rejected. Like I guess he just expects me to stop talking to him and leave him alone but he cant just say out loud so he expects me to read his mind. This happens to me with everyone else ive ever considered afraid where they will literally never text me back no matter how much time passes unless I text them again.

I dont think its acceptable for me to be treated this way. But I feel like Im just so annoying and thats the reason I have no friends. I feel like i deserve to be treated like this cuz demanding respect and attention from someone who is not having sex with you and has their own lives is toxic. I want to talk to him again and tell him that if he doesnt treat me righ I'll block him but I know that would just make me look crazy and like Im again asking to much. I feel so lonely and lost.

467,OkMeeting4003,1630157052,1,"For the first time in my life, I feel alone. I graduated last year, and moved cities for work. I was always very independent, and enjoyed my time by myself. I'm pretty introverted, but not to the point where I would ever turn down plans just to be by myself. 

When I first moved, I enjoyed exploring the new city by myself, and spending some alone time. I soon met a woman here who is spectacular. I want a future with her, but long story short, there are some things I need to work on first before getting in a relationship with her. At one point, she made me feel so happy, and loved, and I loved the feeling. She tells me how important I am to her, and how strong her feelings are for me. However, for the past few months, I have been nothing but a convenience to her. We haven't keep plans for the last few weeks because she either forgets. or remembers she has plans with someone else. The only time we hang out are when she calls last minute and doesn't have anything else going on. It sucks. I put all effort into making sure she knows how important she is to me and going out of my way for her. She claims I am important to her, but doesn't show any effort. Whenever we are together, she is always on her phone, and texting other people. Whenever she is out with other friends, I can't even get a text back. I dont expect her to talk to me when she's with others, but it kind of sucks that she tells me I'm important to her, and then she doesn't show interest in me when we're together. It makes me feel like the most uninteresting person in the world. 

I have gotten into stock trading and recently, and have kept myself busy doing that stuff. But all I really want is to truly feel important to someone. It sucks when someone tells you how important you are to them, but shows no effort to be with you. I'll always be there for her because she means a lot to me, but I know its not the same for her.

477,horny_for_margot,1630147503,1,"I kinda feel stupid for writing this, but I need to talk to someone who understands it maybe (because even my therapist (who I actually admire and was able to help me mostly) doesn't seem to understand it). For context, I'm male, 17, in my last two years of school and I know the biggest part of my life is going to come, but I need write how I feel right now.

My parents don't get along together very well. It improved the last few months since they were able to go to work, but during the lockdown it was really uncomfortable to live with them. As much as I love my parents I find in both of them so many thinks that I don't like and I'm just tired to deal with. But they were never getting along really good, not just since covid, so I never was able to be as close with them as I wished or needed to be, which is the reason I have a therapist to talk to about my problems. I also haveq an older brother, but he's going to move in a few weeks and since he was the only person in this house with whom I'm getting along really well I think it's going to be more difficult.

I actually can say that I have friends, or at least something you would call friends usually. But I feel like 
I'm loosing connection to them. They seem to have new interests and I have a passion/interest that they're not interested in at all and that's totally okay, but it's not easy to come to a common denominator. Even when I'm with them I feel lonely and kinda wish that I just got to meet new friends, but I don't know how (and I'm not very often going to parties, maybe you noticed, but I'm more the introverted type of guy). It felt like we were better fitting together half a year ago and I know developements like these are normal but I don't want the friendships to end and I feel like I get no further in life, which brings me to my last point.

I really feel like I need a girlfriend. I know that sounds stupid and I shouldn't make myself pressure there, but reflecting on my life this is the thing that would cheer me up. And not even for sexual reasons (I know I shouldn't make myself pressure here either, but I really would like to have my first time with under 20). I just want someone to love me and someone I can love back. I just want someone that I can spend my time with and go out for dinner, go to the theatres or just someone to cuddle with or sometimes even kiss. That is really my biggest desire and as I said I'm an introvert and especially in covid times it's not really easy to meet women. I had one crush that I was getting along with very well, but I just waited to long because I was afraid to tell her and it didn't work. We're still actually really good friends (one of my closer friends) but it seemed like she was in each aspect the perfect girlfriend for me and she even seemed to like me (as much as I know there was a time she was interested in me, but as I said I waited to long). Now I'm over her and I noticed that I'm able to be interested in other women again, but they doesn't seem to be interested in me and I know as I said the biggest part of my life is still  going to come, but I'm just constantly anxious for some reason that this was my only opportunity and that I missed it. 

I'm not sure what I want you to do now with this information about me, but I just needed to let it out. Maybe you want to write something, I'm grateful for every advice, comment, statement, opinion or whatever, and if not that's also okay. Thank you for reading this if you did",lonely,I just feel like I have nobody,2021-08-28 20:45:03
478,TommyAtoms,1630147479,1,"Sorry, I need to vent big time!

I had the worst argument with my elderly parents yesterday. They are both 71, I am almost 42. 
It totally blew up out of nowhere and after a few minutes of yelling at each other I ended up storming out of their house and coming back home. I said some regrettable things, as did they. They started it by comparing me (a guy who stays in touch with them and who tries to be a nice son by actually spending time with them), to my older brother (a guy who despite living close to them really never shows his face and keeps his kids, their grandkids, at arms length, which is every upsetting to them). They all, all of them, piss me off so much and I'm so tired of it. It's really playing on my mind, what happened, to the point where I'm having very dark thoughts again. 
Thoughts of doing something silly. My depression came back again a few months ago and this latest event has really screwed my head up further. I'm single, live alone and hardly see my friends as they are always busy with their families. I work a very solitary full-time job. I'm on my own probably 95% of the time, which is hard for me because I class myself as quite a sociable person. 

While I guess we will make it up, I'm starting to wonder if maybe I would be happier just being my own person in this world. I don't really feel like family is worth the hassle. I just find it all very awkward and odd spending time with people that you don't have anything in common with, or who just totally annoy and irritate you. I find them all to be quite tragic, embarrassing people to be honest. Christmas is the worst time for me. Even when it ends each year I start to dread the next one almost straight away. It's just a day of awkwardness and we pretend to have a good time, when I know we are all just wishing it to be over so we can go back to normal.

This is probably the fourth time in the last decade I have badly argued with my mum and dad, but this time I really am considering cutting them off, and my brother too as I don't much like him. He is so cold and uncommunicative. 
That said, I worry it may make me even more lonely and withdrawn, that it will make them terribly sad which I don't want.... but then... I can't keep going down this road.
I am broken by it and the easiest option is just to stay away from these silly people none of whom have any self awareness.

485,Icy_Example,1630139191,1,"this is basically a long winded rant because I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone most this week and I felt like typing so I‚Äôm posting here. If u wanna read my nonsense rambling or even comment feel free;

I have a semi-unhealthy obsession with controlling and understanding all of my surroundings. I look at people a lot like basically everyone around me. It helps get a sense of who they are if that makes sense. You can get a lot from the way a person presents themselves. And that‚Äôs not just what they wear. Their posture, the way they move, maybe I‚Äôll notice little ticks or mannerisms. It builds a picture of what they‚Äôre like. Like watching that person‚Äôs nature, how they flow with their world around them. My need for control and understanding. This makes me feel safe. It feeds harshly into being near constant hypervigilant. Like I know something about people around me. Maybe I don‚Äôt or I‚Äôm wrong. In a social setting I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs more innocent than it may sound kinda creepy. Like I get it if I keep looking around glancing your way. It can make it awkward if I keep making eye contact but it isn‚Äôt to just check someone out or something. I do it with almost everyone for different periods of time until I‚Äôm unconsciously satisfied with what I feel about them I guess. Some people it takes longer to figure out. It can also make it harder to feel comfortable in a new group. Say meeting friends of someone I‚Äôve never met. Now I‚Äôm watching, and doing a lot of listening. What‚Äôre they saying? How‚Äôre they saying it? Can I get a feel for the type of person they are from this. And it can take a few times meeting. And I might seem really awkward and quiet. Which is kinda true I don‚Äôt talk too openly even with friends. But I want to feel comfortable, and sort of learn your boundaries. All of the deciding of ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre like this‚Ä¶ I know you‚Äôre like this for sure‚Ä¶‚Äù is unconscious. Like I‚Äôm sure everyone does something like this to some level but in my head I do more. And honestly I‚Äôve been pretty intuitive and right about most people. That sounds really full of myself to say but I‚Äôve hardly been wrong about people, even with giving the benefit of the doubt most the time. I don‚Äôt know. 
I feel like it makes it hard making strong first impressions though. I can be very talkative and open, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a total social failure. I can talk a lot if we really match up, but it can take a bit to get there. Like are you the type of person I can just send random stupid stuff I find funny out of the blue ? Will you even find it funny? What can I even talk about with you? Are we going to be acquaintances, someone just know exists and talk sorta like coworkers, a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that were kinda cool but whatever, or a strong friendship. I like to just be open with the few people I‚Äôm close to.

So I try to hang out with others, but there's a problem - I have to try hard to make friends, to push the interactions when I get satisfied from interaction really quick, then I just don't want to be there. I yearn to get close to someone, but I don't want to hang out outside of school. I don't want to hang out with a group of people I hardly know, and people I try to make friends with usually have their own agendas already.

To preface this, I am not religious or belong to a religious family that blocks sexual interaction before marriage. I am not asexual either, I experience sexual attraction to others. However, I just physically cannot have sex or give pleasure in any way. It hurts to try and pleasure myself and it hurts mostly emotionally when I have sexual thoughts. It feels impossible to find anyone because you want to experience it but physically can't, it's a fucking nightmare. You have attractions you can't control, but you can't go after that person because *you know* you will never be able to satisfy them. Complete and utter torture, I just want to love and be loved. 

It's horrific looking for a partner with sexual desires that haunt you every day.

I'm pretty sure I would have been unhappy with her in the long run. I miss her as a friend and she wanted to stay friends but at the time I couldn't handle it. I'm not sure I could handle it now even though I have zero desire to be with her. Being friends again with her would be tough because I have this weird desire to show her that I'm happy and successful even though she dumped me.

I guess I often feel like I'm not good enough. That emotional hangup would possibly sabotage a friendship with her.

We met online and bonded because of our mental health struggles. We talked for a while and then i ghosted him and then talked to him again.  We both said we were kinda interested in each other. So we started talking. He was honest with me upfront saying how he wasn't looking to be in a serious relationship because he was about to go to uni and I understood that. I just wanted someone i could be intimate with and have someone understand me. I also wasn't looking to be in a relationship.

He was understanding at first at how i didn't feel comfortable sending any nude pics that early. But now when he asked he seemed kinda impatient and when I asked if he was mad, he explained how we knew each other for a while and it seemed like I didn't trust him and thats why he was fustrated.

Then he started feeling guilty and sorry for himself for being like 'every other stupid horny guy' and i said it was okay because I saw how self-aware and honest he was.

It was all good until he said ""I have to be honest. Sometimes I feel as though you're treating me as if I'm your boyfriend, when I'm not. I'm sorry if that comes across as mean."" Honestly I don't even know how to explain how insulting that statement was to me. 

Its funny because he was the one who told me he was starting to ""fall in love with me"" within a week of talking to me. (*He says his BPD makes him fall in love easily)* I was a bit hesitant at first but I said I loved him back and I honestly now I feel like I do. 

This just made me feel like I was a crazy obsessive internet girl. I just feel so alone because this was someone I shared my pain with and felt validated by. I told him everything is good now but honeslty its not. 

He then explained how he felt pressured when he doesn't respond to my texts right  away because he worries if I'm in pain while he is busy. I know I can be weridy needy at times.

This can be from a regular friendship to a whole relationship. Literally I've had females lie to me about getting into relationships and they stated they werent ready yet they ended up in a relationship a few months after. Literally one of the females I've liked and put my heart into ended up in a relationship with some guy, after not wanting to be in a relationship, and it makes me so angry.

Anyway does that mean how I end up here now is partially not my fault? I sometimes beat myself up for thinking what if I did differently during school days.

600,SeaOld6326,1630080504,1,"hey. I originally joined this subreddit just for fucks, but here I am, reading every. Single. One, ever since I‚Äôve joined.
I see you. I see all of your stories, your problems, and your cries. I‚Äôm sorry, I never reply or gave advice to anyone, but I read every single thing down to the last word. 
Even though we all come from different stories, it seems like we all just want the same thing.
Instead of commenting this on each post in this sub, I‚Äôll just say it here and hopefully most of you will read this because it‚Äôs changed my life and will probably do the same for yours. (probably)
My advice is.. try games, if you haven‚Äôt already. I know, kind of sounds cringe at first but hear me out.
Here‚Äôs my quick story; In 2018 I joined an online community. It was a completely random thing I did, I just asked random twitch streamer if he wanted to play games (it was fortnite during that time) and he invited me to his discord. Never have I thought I would have online friends, because at the time I thought online friends were just weird in general and weren‚Äôt really real ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù But I did. Hell, I‚Äôve even found the love of my life here. They are the most amazing group I‚Äôve ever been with in my entire life. It‚Äôs a small group, just with 6 people. But each day I wake up, they‚Äôre in discord. We‚Äôre in a voice call all day up until we fall asleep and we say goodnight to each other each time someone leaves, every single day. Its amazing to know that there‚Äôs going to be at least one person I can talk to each day. And It‚Äôs been like that for 3 years now. 
Ive even met my online friends that are all around the world in real life. It took a lot of planning, but we went to this convention called Anime Expo for a week. Because of these guys, I‚Äôve been motivated to go to school, get a job, and be successful in life just solely so I can be with them.
I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I never crossed paths with these amazing people. Before I met them, it was a very, very dark time. but I want to live. I don‚Äôt want to lose them ever, and we even have plans in moving in together in the future.
(I didn‚Äôt realize how long this was, so much for a ‚Äúshort‚Äù story that I tried to do, but they‚Äôre just that life changing to me.)
So.. my advice is to join a gaming community, preferably on discord‚Ä¶ I probably could‚Äôve just said that but I wanted you guys to see just a little bit of how much it‚Äôs changed me as a friend, and as a person in general.
Heck, it doesn‚Äôt even have to be gaming. Join a discord community that you‚Äôd find interesting, trust me, you‚Äôll find one that you can fit in easily sooner or later.
There‚Äôs community discord‚Äôs for gaming, for drinking, for dating, for nearly every single hobby, and much more. Don‚Äôt expect it to be so easy though, for me I just got lucky and found mine immediately. For others it takes a very long time.. but they eventually find their way. I hope you guys do too.
I hope you are all having a good morning, day, or night. Stay safe during these times, and if anyone needs anything, just to talk or need someone to listen to you, shoot me a message.

I lost both my parents when I was in high school and that had a great impact in me. I became kind of a loner after that. I didn't talked with anyone and became introverted. Didn't know how to talk infront of people. But my brother he took care of me. Without his caring and love I would have been dead by now. Some people came into my life just because of their personal benefits and called themselves friends. My brother had a good job but now he lost his job and we had to sell our house that our parents built and live somewhere else. Now we are bankrupt and he is trying to make a living for us. And I am trying as much as I can to graduate and find a decent job to back him up. 

This bankruptcy thing had a huge impact in me mentally. I became so much disturbed and fucked up from inside but I showed that I was okay so that my brother doesn't feel bad about it. I show that I am fine and happy to others but I am not. I always try to find meaning in something but at this process I hurt someone. 

Even the only two girls who I dated broke up with me because I was too clingy and emotional. And I was so emotionally unstable at the first break up because at that time my brother lost his job and we had huge financial crisis and family issues. I fucking shouted at her for that but I regret it now and I am really sorry for that. I was not me at that time. 

Sometimes I become crazy, weird, angry and arrogantly shout at someone. But I don't want to do that. I am learning to control my anger now. I am trying to be a better man. Hope I have a better future ahead.

I used to be known for being funny and social by my old friends from years ago. But now I can‚Äôt talk to anyone or get comfy enough to be my true self. People make me uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt want them to.. I keep crying because my phone has no new messages. I do message people when I‚Äôm full of enrrgy and am in a good place. But that ends cus neither of us are consistent in responding. I don‚Äôt blame people for it either. I literally start to shake when it comes to the situation of speaking to others. I just started taking an art class and even just being in front of the other students makes me shaky. I get nervous and begin thinking people are staring at me and judging me for being ugly and having thin balding hair, which I‚Äôd be okay with if I weren‚Äôt so young. I know that‚Äôs irrational but it happens. This usually calms down though once I‚Äôm seated and begin relaxing and breathing and reminding myself I‚Äôm not a big part of any of these peoples days. 

Ps : I‚Äôm working on these things. Im not just sitting around waiting for things to change. I‚Äôm just not anywhere near past the problems yet.

Yes I already wrote here before but I deleted my post because I was rambling about little nonsensical details.
Anyone just feels as they may never get a ‚Äúsocial life‚Äù? 
Idk, most people my age live in dorms with people their age- except me, and I don‚Äôt socialize or am interested with young adults like me. I might be boring because all I talk about are real life subjects or things I find interesting or research stuff etc 
I never did anything ‚Äúfun‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù yet.
- I‚Äôm also scared I‚Äôll never be able to find ‚Ä¶. Will I ever find or experience love with someone else? Because Knowing my age : yikes. Oh and :( I‚Äôm saying this because 4 days ago I heard my sister/mom making you-know-what female noises and I felt like trash. I never felt this ever in my life. Why do I need to be the ugliest women of my entire family? I look like a child, 85 pounds at the most. And small breast because genetics makes no sense, comparing to every other member of my family. I‚Äôm even shorter than my mom which makes no sense + nobody will love me because of this. And I‚Äôm too skinny.
- another thing: does anyone out here feel as they may study forever? I don‚Äôt even know what I like, :( all the interesting subjects I find require math so I can‚Äôt go into them 
- why does my family need to be bilingual? My dad (he‚Äôs anglophone) strongly dislikes my mom‚Äôs culture and vice versa. Does that mean I don‚Äôt have an actual identity? What‚Äôs my ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù? Why can‚Äôt I be unilingual ?
-why me? Why can‚Äôt I decide and know what I like or want to do?
-why am I still anxious about life, :(
-Is it possible I may never find someone who loves me? :( what if I‚Äôm weird and don‚Äôt know what to talk about or look ugly ? I really hope not because I want to love someone but irl I look like nothing. I want to feel pleasure, know how I can feel this feeling someday if it‚Äôs still possible knowing I‚Äôm no longer a teen.

Just ‚Ä¶ I cant, I don‚Äôt know what to write because - like. What do I stand for? Everyone around me (meaning my family) = intelligent engineers and then there‚Äôs me like : ‚Äúoh ‚Ä¶ yes! You :/ ok then bye!!‚Äù *chuckles because I‚Äôm an introvert and idk what I want to do later on 

I need to do something about everything and I don‚Äôt know what. Talking to a professional won‚Äôt help since I tried many times. They just give tips and talk to your parents behind your back. I‚Äôm exhausted and talking about myself makes me feel selfish, something people I know wouldn‚Äôt think but that‚Äôs how I feel now.
I don‚Äôt even know why I wrote this , maybe I‚Äôll see my post later on and I‚Äôll laugh. I really hope i‚Äôll be at least a bit successful
At least one day- or ‚Ä¶. ? :/ 
Why am I crying?
I want to be successful. I want to love someone and be loved even though I doubt it will happen because I have 0 knowledge about anything related to s-e-x or even my own anatomy. :( nobody would pick me.

I can't explain why I have these suicidal thoughts because I took the approach of not even understanding it as I have seen some of my classmates and how there families suffer after it.

I don't know if it's being rude but I think of it as am I a coward to just go and end my life, and leave my responsibilities behind for my family(or who loves me, I highly doubt that). Its like I have a debt on me from my parents who have invested in me by giving me a shelter, food, education, and everything, am I just gonna bail out of that not even being free in the real sense.

I dream of having an accidental death more than a suicide as I don't want to embarrass my family for the coward ness I will show by suicide but if I ever get into the situation where I will be dying, I don't think I will be helping my self to even try to survive out of it.

And for the thoughts I get, I think of wierd what's which are no where possible to be done, so I am also safe to not really end my life. I know it's wierd, but my thoughts are like I want to fly that high into the space that my body freezes to death. I know it's crazy of me to think that, but I think that helps a lot to not end my life by simpler method I could opt for easily.

About me:
I am 20 year old guy, introvert, never had any good friend, most of the friendships end after a couple of months, I think I am a nice guys, always helped everyone no matter what and when, even if I had to sacrifice my something in it as it makes me happy to be helpful, but at last feel used and betrayed.

So the thing is, my school time was fair enough I guess, that months of friendship was working fine, as for some reason whoever I thought of as my friend, left me everytime, making other good friends and moving on from me, may be I am just boring, or some other transfers, some school/class changes. So I never had any good friend in school too, so I was sad and gave up my hopes on making friends 4 years agon, which affected my mental health and studies a lot since then.
Now this year, I felt super lonely I decided to let's try online friendships, got ghosted a lot(I knew that's gonna happen, so not affected by that). I finally found a friend(a girl this time), and we talked a lot for 2 months and yesterday, out of nowhere, she said that she is gonna delete snapchat(where we use to talk) and focus on her studies for her career, fair enough, so I wished her good luck and a final see ya(I hardly believe ever gonna happen).

I cried a lot yesterday cause the curse is still there, I was being nice to her, never forced her to send her pics or anything(idk how she looks but it's fine), we watched anime together, played games, and now again this time I am left with no friends. I feel terrible.

So now finally I am not gonna have any friends from now on, it hurts a lot, still will be helping out anyone who asks me to, makes me happy, but now I know they are not my friend so it won't hurt me.

641,sondermori,1630041552,1,"*Jesus Christ I‚Äôm so blue all the time*

It‚Äôs been quite some time of me existing on this planet, completely devoid of a relationship. No one has ever found me physically attractive or had a crush on me. I used to struggle with it more, deflect outward and blame others. Hella softcore ass incel vibes (but I don‚Äôt think I was that bad). But these days, I‚Äôve come to terms with it a lot more. 

I‚Äôm in no place to be in a relationship. I‚Äôm desperately unattractive, and don‚Äôt know if I can ever realistically offer anything of value in one. And I think I ultimately value my free time most of the time. My views of romantic relationships are very cynical from my position. 

1. Because lizard brain makes  superficial unavoidable, and the fact it‚Äôs valued disgusts me.  I‚Äôm not above this though, I do have a baseline standard of looks I‚Äôd consider, but I try to push it out. I hate I can‚Äôt be attracted to someone just for who they are. I‚Äôm no better. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want to change for anyone, focusing on income, status, physical attractiveness.. if you‚Äôre only drawn in by these things? How genuine is your attraction to me really. And vice versa.

2. Ladies. Love you guys. But it‚Äôs wildly difficult to pin down what you guys are interested in. All my lady friends have physical/attraction preferences across the board. Which is nice to an extent, because every little nich√© gets a little a attention at least. But at the same time, with this immediate limit. The odds I‚Äôm going to meet someone who is somehow attracted to me, I‚Äôm attracted to them, we actually MEET? like our paths cross, and we‚Äôre actually compatible and share enough commonality. It feels like too many filters and the odds are slim to none. 

The lizard brain is a nuisance I wish I could turn off, most of us care most about ourselves and want only the finest dating fodder, male or female. I know this wouldn‚Äôt be good for me and ultimately a big waste of time. I know there‚Äôs more than just romantic relationships in life, and I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about a lot of things. I can always substitute relationships with close friendships.

But wow. It hurts to much sometimes, being so devoid of touch and affection. Sure sex sounds great in theory, but I still feel this deep longing for being close physically to someone. Hugs and cuddling and shit, I‚Äôve only ever been hugged by my mother.. which I mean can‚Äôt complain too much because I actually have a good one.

I even get envious of friendships women can have with each other. No, not in a creepy way, but at how emotionally vulnerable you guys can get and. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but that feeling of sisterhood and supportive bond you can physically observe. 

And I‚Äôm not trying to be like aH mEn hAvE iT sO bAaaAd. I‚Äôm not under that delusion at all and try to empathize with unwanted attention and being fuckzoned. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm completely unwanted and disposable. The radio silence is deafening sometimes, and fuck other people. I want to live for me, but at the same time I understand the limitation that I can‚Äôt entirely stop caring about what other people will think and I can‚Äôt stop longing for something intimate. And it‚Äôs so frustrating.",lonely,"I don‚Äôt want a relationship, yet I long for one.",2021-08-27 15:19:12

what if i had a girlfriend. what if she was a scientist, an artist. what would my parents and the people who see us together think. it wouldnt last long, i am emotionally incapable of being close to another person. i have somewhat accepted this. 

i am the silent observer of other peoples lives. i punish myself for trying to get close to anyone, i dont see myself as worthy enough to be in their world. so i observe them from afar and fantasize about me being worthy. 

no matter how illogical, unrealistic our personal fantasies or dreams are, despite all odds, we convince ourselves that we will achieve them one day. that no matter age, cognitive ability, income, people believe in their dreams past their expiration date. this is the essence of the human condition. no matter what you have you will always want more, inexplicable and illogical more. 

brotherhood, human companionship, connection, can only exist through collective suffering. collective suffering is what brings us together, not love. funerals bring us closer together than weddings. the only way we can begin to understand each other is by understanding each other's suffering and where it comes from. 

what am i waiting for? what days do i remember? i spend my life waiting for things to happen, they never do. i spend my life waiting in vain, wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. and it never comes, so you spend your time in vague regret, or vaguer hope that something good will come along. something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. and the truth is, i feel so angry. the truth is, i feel so fucking sad. i felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long ive been pretending im okay. i dont know why. maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery. because they have their own.

Unfortunately humans are social by nature and when we are alone for this long stress builds up.

Lately, when i get home, i find myself hugging myself. Sometimes for a few seconds, other times for several minutes, in total silence. Sometimes ill rub my back too, tell myself things will be ok.

674,10_agape_04,1630022610,1,"There is the saying ""love is patient love is kind"" but that's not all what love is. Love is pain and draining sometimes, but it just comes with the territory. When you choose to love someone, you have to expect hardships and the thought if disappointment and mistakes because it will happen. Love is a choice and one day, the person that you love most can just wake up and decide that you are no longer what they want. Sure they might have promised you forever and that they want nothing else, they could have looked you in your eyes and called you the breath of fresh air that they have been needing and that you feel like home. They can tell you that with their whole heart and they can also take it all back the next day like it was never even said or meant. You will be left alone, confused, angry, and even still hopeful of the situation even if they just ended what you thought was going to last a life time. Maybe that is why you are still so hopeful though, because they had you so convinced it was a forever thing. They could be so sure of what they want and so passionate about forever with you but then just end things because they no longer see you in their future anymore. You WILL be left feeling broken, and that is okay! In the moment it will feel like you are living in hell and you will be searching for answers that you will never find. There is a few options and out comes. You could give that person some time to make their way back to you, if they are smart enough to realize that they fucked up and made a mistake, you can take them back to work on your differences and live happily ever after or even to just get crushed all over again. You might also choose to pick yourself up and do everything in your power to end your heartbreak and heal yourself. but even by the time you are healed you shouldn't care if that person comes back into your life or not because NO ONE deserves to feel that type of pain ever or even again. Either way, at some point in time on our healing journey we will hope, pray, and manifest that they will come back because we know that what you once had isn't over just yet. Through all the pain and healing that we endure, it is just bound to happen all over again but alls we can do is continue to choose to love over and over again because it is a craving that you can never get enough of.

I haven't been able to reach any of them. And even so, part of me hopes they never see the messages. Because I know there was likely a reason they never tried to contact me. Others I have simply left alone, knowing we're too different now or that things ended for a good reason.

I've kept things from people; I've compartmentalized everything -carefully controlled what I say to people, selecting an image and playing whatever part I need to play just to make it through. I'm not in the habit of lying, but I don't think I've ever told the whole truth about anything out loud before. I used to think it was a defense mechanism; but in truth I've realized that there's no one underneath to defend. I'm just here for damage-control; whether I like it or not, I'm just trying to get through my life hurting as few people as I can. And I I know for a fact that the people who support me most are doing the same because they don't want to hurt me either -they may have some genuine care beyond obligation, or they may not, and I've made my peace without ever really knowing.  

The real reason I write this bullshit, other than because I've got nothing better to do, is because I thought for a long, wonderful moment that there would be an exception to this. There could exist something, some connection, for me outside of those rules. Then some distance I can't really explain changed things, and now I'm putting up barriers rather than risk reaching further and guilting somebody else into my mess. And from here on, we'll both pretend like nothing has changed and everything is fine, because that's all we can do.

714,highonjollyranchers,1630003523,1,"TL;DR: I'm someone who prefers to be alone. Made fun of for my nonexistent social life by my cousins which made me start to get self-conscious about it. 

I've always been someone who preferred to be alone. Basically a loner. I don't like how people view introverts/loners as if it's a bad thing. Like yeah you don't have that much of a social life but the fact that people say you NEED friends to be happy and if you don't have any you're just a complete outcast/weirdo/or basically any other word you can think of. 

April 2020 is when I felt really bad about my social life. I lost a friend of mine for about 4-5 years and I struggled to cope with the loss but I tried to comfort myself saying that my ex friend is probably hurt too. I still felt very lonely and school work piling up just made it even worse. I didn't even have the
motivation to do it.

So every time I call my cousin he just loves to flex about how many friends he has and he knows I don't really have any so he tries to use that to his advantage. It hurt a little but at the same time I found it weird. Why do you have to brag to me about it if you're so happy with your social life???? You know I don't have one so why are you flexing them like some trophies?? Like wow OMG you found human beings that match your vibe and you're flexing it off like a 5 year old getting a hotweels toy at Walmart. It's just making me more sad. I told him to stop but he still does it.

And this isn't even the full part.
It got even worse soon as my other cousin started doing it too.

At first she didn't have any friends like me. I felt way better because of that. I didn't feel alone. Then bam. She goes to public school (I learn online &amp; it's great but also bad for me) and makes friends. Then the next day she makes some really good ones and then laugh at the fact that I don't have any.  My mother and my cousin literally complain and laugh about my social life. Honestly I'm so tired of being made fun on on this freaking earth. They're literally the ones who are closest to me why can't they understand?? And before you ask, yes, I told her to stop too, guess what she didn't.

I have internet friends, but my two cousins want to make fun of me for having them because they're not considered ""real friends."" I barely even talk to my internet friends anyway. It hurts because my cousins are basically my only social life.  But at this point I'm like sad and angry. 

If you read all of this holy you're like the best person ever. This was so therapeutic. I needed somewhere to vent. Im still kind of sad about this and I think going on social media and the way people see loners is reminding me that I really need to get off the damn internet for once.",lonely,(18F) My social life is pretty much nonexistent and it didn't really bother me at first until I saw my cousins brag about their friends,2021-08-27 04:45:23

basically growling up I never really had a change to make friends other then my sister, and later I didn't really talk to her ether. I was just by myself on the internet, didn't even have accounts ether so I was just an observer. late last year though I decide to become active on a discord server, at first it was like all the other times I was active in public spaces but then one person, who I'll call Maria, started to light up when I was around and generally seemed to enjoy my presence. I've never really had that before, and it made me realize I craved human interaction that I never really did before. Eventually however, things changed and Maria became indifferent to me and seemed to care more about other people, which really isn't wrong of her, just saddening on my part. There was also some community drama of which the details don't matter other then me and Maria being on different sides and it in general adding to feeling lonely, but eventually me and her had a talk about our feelings, though she seemed so cold about it, I even asked her if she cared and she didn't actually say yes but did reply to me asking that saying something so I just took that as a yes. However when we were having a discussion about something and she used a gotcha that wouldn't make sense if she had read and/or cared about what we had talked about, it just hurts so much. I do luckily have a friend I'll call Olivia, who I do feel I have a proper friendship with and actually managed to be close with, though she's been busy lately so we don't talk as much anymore, and there are acquaintance-friends that I probably could be closer to, but I guess I just got obsessed with having Maria care about me.  


Update before I post: It's a specials day for Olivia today and she's celebrating it with Maria and someone Maria became closer with then me. Olivia of course didn't mean to exclude me, she told me as much, but it doesn't help my mental state to have Maria be closer to the last person I felt close with. it all just hurts so much",lonely,why is it that I feel more lonely then I did when I was alone,2021-08-27 04:22:38

I feel so lonely and lost lately. 

I'm 27 I'm finally near to my final exam to get my Uni degree, (I struggled in the past a lot, I didn't like what I was studying and I also found out I have ADHD) yet even if I finished all my exams months ago I got stuck almost a year because of covid. 

I don't know why but the few friends I had are all gradually disappearing, it's like even after years our friendship is not that important and I'm the only one doing things to keep it alive. It breaks my heart but after all, I know it is fine because people change and move on in their life. What worries me is that it seems that I'm the only one that can't meet new people is me. I'm usually nice to people, I respect them, I think (?) they generally see me as ""normal"", nobody really thinks bad of me but it's like I can't develop a real connection with anyone, nobody really wants to hang out with me more than they have to.

I read books, watch movies, listen to music, play videogames, I'm interested in politics, sports, etc so it's not like I have difficulties keeping the conversation going, I'm also a guy who stands by his opinion so there are sometimes when I engage in nice discussions but it all end there. Sometimes I try to invite people to hang out with me, it's not even a straight ""no"" it's just that they seem not really interested so I feel kinda embarrassed and I don't want to insist or look desperate. The same thing goes for my love life, I've never been in a real relationship, in this field I know that it's mostly my fault since I have acne I'm insecure about my look, (I'm treating it since I was a teen but it apparently won't go away completely, I'm already working out, following a diet, drinking enough water, etc.) but as I said I feel like that the few people that I liked (I don't know if I've never been in love with someone) were all not interested in me, even when I tried to engage in dates their interest was not that much, it was like they were thinking: ""yes you are nice but I can find better for me"". I'm going to buy a car in the next few months, I really hope it can help to make my dates easier and more ""appealing"". I don't think people get super bored by me and that's it, there must be some other reason but I can't really understand it.

I feel like I'm doing small steps in everything but they are so derisory compared to the flow of an ""average"" life, it's like I fell behind the others and I don't know why and what to do about it. I put a lot of effort into what I do, I was on time with my new uni plan but covid stopped it, I really want to connect with people but it seems like nobody really coincides with me, I am super strict about my diet and my workouts but nothing can stop acne.

I'm so worried about my career, I'm scared to be alone and single forever. I feel like I'm giving my 99% and it's still not enough.",lonely,"I really need some advices, what am I doing wrong?",2021-08-27 02:27:25

Before covid I did not have a consistent social life after my breakup with my ex who I have since drifted apart from. I have autism and throughout my life I have struggled to make friends somewhat because of it and had a mundane social experience in school and have not had much experience with . After I left school when the pandemic started I have been stuck at home ever since and only close friends with one person now. Thanks to college (Scotland) being online last year I had not made any real friends and once again college is online again this year until at least January due to lecturers being allowed to work at home as well as high covid cases in recent days. 

I had hoped college would have been a way to meet new people with similar interests such as games, comics and potentially even Goth ( Im interested in the fashion and music and hope too meet other goths in the future) but unfortunately covid has diminished that opportunity. I had hoped to meet people and move on with my life and I do not know if I can cope with another year of this isolation. I have gotten in touch with the college higher ups and they want to help so hopefully something good comes from that. I don‚Äôt want to spend another year rotting in self pity and wasting my youth

746,itakpoydetttt,1629985385,1,"Hi everyone! 

I just thought I would share what I felt like yesterday and maybe someone would help or share their experience.

I am a senior at a small private college in the US. I am also an international student, and my campus is 80% involved in Greek Life. 

My freshman year was not that great as I immediately started dating a guy and didn‚Äôt really talk to a lot of people. Later on, at the end of freshman year I broke up with him and had the best sophomore year before the pandemic started. I had a huge group of friends whom I would spend 24/7 together. I also didn‚Äôt rush anymore (didn‚Äôt have the best experience my freshman year), but I still felt included on campus because I had such a huge group of people behind my back. 

Then pandemic started, some people left, some people didn‚Äôt. In any way, I had a chance to come back on campus for the second semester of my junior year. I just lived on campus, was an RA and met a lot of great freshmen + worked remotely on an internship so didn‚Äôt have to take classes. 

This past summer was also great: I spent it with my closest friends and started dating a guy whom I was seeing for quite a while before. 

And two days ago I started my senior year. I know a lot a lot of people on campus, I am also in a sorority and I have a huge involvement on campus: I am a president of 2 clubs, I work some jobs helping peers, I am a presidential ambassador and all that good stuff. But I started to feel terribly lonely. Because my closest friends went abroad. Like just 3 people, but their absence on campus makes me feel so bad and lost. I know I have people to study with and party with, but at the end of the day I need my close friends, people whom I feel like at home with.

I also shared my feelings with my boyfriend yesterday. I know he is a president of his fraternity and a lot of guys respect him yet he doesn‚Äôt seem to hang out with them that much, he always texts me whenever he is free (he has a full time remote internship). But when I shared my feelings with him, he told me I should meet and talk more to his brothers (I never really talked to people from his fraternity and it scares me). Like how do I say hi to them? How not to be awkward. People whom I knew in his frat graduated... same with my sorority, girls whom I was closest with graduated.

So at the end of the day I have two feelings: I feel like I am alone on this campus even though a lot of ppl know me and I know them + I feel like my boyfriend is lucky to have so many brothers and for no reason I keep comparing his social life with him.

Of course we sometimes had disagreements but still were quite friendly. Today one of them after school played a sick joke on me telling that my crush liked me over a text message, of course I asked him to make sure, he continued telling me that for a while that honestly, I believed him, and at that moment, he said that he was just kidding. Of course I was miserable after that and infuriated. I started cursing at him in messages and asked him why would he do that. He told me that he was in a call with my crush and that she told him to do that, I was in disbelief so I made sure asking him over and over again, he confirmed. I was thinking to myself what a sick joke it was that they both played. I sent a message saying if that‚Äôs true what he‚Äôs saying that she‚Äôs an asshole (Can I swear in this sub?). Then the friend that made this joke proceeded to ss it and send it to her, and then, out of a sudden she‚Äôs texting me that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bit harsh calling her that, she didn‚Äôt even tell him to do that‚Äù I of course told her that I was lied to and apologised. So I tried to get to the bottom of it and asked him again why did he make that joke. He answered ‚Äúidk‚Äù. I asked him was it to make a person miserable, or was it for fun?. 
He just answered ‚ÄúYe‚Äù. 
Then I told him that I trusted him, I thought he was my friend, and he just answered that he doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck and that he doesn‚Äôt like me as a friend.

786,poopypath,1629951669,1,"I‚Äôm 19M and once I graduated high-school, I didn‚Äôt hang out or communicate with anyone. I had a lot of acquaintances, but no close friends. Now, I‚Äôm in my second year of electrical engineering at college and I‚Äôm in the same position. I have no close friends and I‚Äôm having an increasingly hard time slogging through the monotony of modern life.

In high-school, I was the guy everyone knows and gets along with, but never hangs out with. I‚Äôm still that guy. I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, or even had a full-fledged convo with a girl, despite being physically fit. I blame it on childhood trauma, crippling anxiety, chemical imbalances, and my turbulent personality. 

At this point, I feel I‚Äôve lost my will to live before I‚Äôve lived. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in this world.. I get along with everybody, but understand nobody. I want to meet more people, yet it‚Äôs so mentally exhausting to do so. 

This is probably a post more suited for r/depression , but I believe the cause of my feelings stems from the lack of genuine human connection. If I disappeared now, precisely 0 people would care. My only enjoyment in life at this point is the endorphin high I get at the gym.

Without connection, many other facets of life feel meaningless as well. What am I working towards? Money? A career? I can already see wealth as a shallow corruptor. I have all my survival needs met, yet I‚Äôm still intensely dissatisfied with my existence. People are fighting for survival all over the world, yet here I am groveling in my own despair. Why must my brain be like this?

Maybe it‚Äôs hitting me now because i‚Äôm realizing how much bullshit there is in the world and I have nobody to help me navigate the shit seas. Or maybe i‚Äôve finally metamorphosed into a cynical degenerate butterfly I was fated to be. Regardless, I feel lonely, depressed, angry, and disillusioned all at the same time.

I have absolutely no one I can talk to about this. I have a sister but she is very much in her own world and is not a very good person to talk to other than things on the surface in life.

Besides all of the dating problems I usually keep myself busy work, school, hustle, hobbies, take care of myself too. I believe that I was meant to be alone, but I think I know where this comes from and why I expect people to leave. 
I don't want to date someone like my dad. Not that his a bad person, never been abusive or verbally abusive. 

He has a drinking problem. Says that he would quit, but never has. He recently had a heart attack and still drinks and smokes, even though he's suppose to quit. He's been drinking since I was in middle school. When I was in highschool we had arguments and fought about this. I know addiction is hard, but when is enough is enough, I mean he had a heart attack because of this when do they change? I still live with my family it's only my mom and my dad. 

And then I thought that it would be best to stay single. I don't think there would ever be someone who could love me. And I don't want them to be an alcoholic either. Just to stay safe I do distance myself because I expect them to leave, they always usually do. My friends that I did have left over time and was left alone in junior and senior years of highschool and been alone since then. The people I do have rarely talk or hangout. 

I never been on a date, because I can't connect to them and that they don't  fit to what I want either. And I don't want them to be like my dad either. I think staying alone is better at times. I wish I had someone as my rock when things get rocky, but that wasn't never the life for me. At times I wish I was held at night or even thought of. 

What's even the point of people when they turn out to be disappointments. I hate being hopeful at times that maybe I could find someone who isn't like that, but then I realize that's practicality impossible. I gave up on love and dating hell even making friends just because I was stupid in thinking that I could find decent people.

I am the son of a rape victim mother and an autistic father. Neither dated or were in relationships before meeting each other, so I have no inherited romantic traits. my dad's best dating advice was to just be friends with women, which has never worked and has always left me in the fucking friend zone and with zero luck. I'm beginning to believe i actually don't care anymore and im numb to the pain honestly.

I was locked in a fucking closet for sometimes days as a child, i went through online schooling for years, I can't have kids because of a bullshit birth defect and i havent had an erection since i was 21, I was diagnosed with autism when i was a toddler, covid has taken my one chance in my remaining young adult youth to go out and socialize and find my type or something, but i dont fucking know anymore. i had lost way too much of my youth and potential, maybe all of it, to fucking screens and addiction and isolation and endless lonely pain due to ignorance and trauma and a dysfunctional upbringing, but now i feel nothing. 

Like, i just dont care anymore, and that scares me. I don't want to not care, but im only getting older and my ignorance and inexperience and shitty past and isolation since i was a child is starting to show its mold and decrement on my soul/being, and now im beginning to believe I'll be happier or better off just not caring anymore and dying alone with my money and time. I don't fucking know anymore man.

Why the fuck am i even like this? where the HELL did I even go wrong? is it even my own fucking fault? im so pissed at myself for how blind I've been and how so much could have been so much differently if i only were born to a different fucking family that didn't make me so soft or hurt, or how if people actually gave a shit about me while growing up and answered my cries for isolated help and pain that eventually subsided because i became too apathetic towards everyone and grew the fuck up, realizing NO ONE would give a fucking SHIT about me or whatever the hell ive been or am going through, whatever. What. Fucking. Ever.

Everything ive worked hard for since graduation was taken from me because of fucking covid. haha. I'll never have what my parents, uncles, aunts, or grandparents had because this once great country and its economy has gone to utter fucking apeshit, and I'll never have offspring to pass anything i do make onto. Is it really my fault I'm becoming sociopathic and greedy? is this my fate or am I losing it? oh the sins we will never admit to haha.

Real men aren't actually loved for their character or their romantic qualities. haha. don't fall for that sugar coated bullshit, it's never worked. Women really only love men who can provide in some form and aren't soft-spined losers who will take charge of their own lives and will thwart any threat or inconvenience that comes their way and only have their eyes on a prize and who couldn't care less about women. The valuable chase of a lifetime is what they really want, they just won't admit it. haha. Am I in the wrong here, or has my honest experience failed me?

Why the fuck should I care? I mean, I don't even care about sex since I can't even perform it, no one gives a fuck about me, so what isn't stopping me from just ending it all in an abrupt scene of chaos? who should i even inflict it upon? i don't even know who to blame except myself, and myself is a conglomeration of my past experience, and my past experiences are fucking bullshit and have shaped me into this fucking angry degenerate who can't even socialize properly unless it's through a screen, so i really do think i should just end it all in a blaze of glory haha",lonely,not actually lonely,2021-08-26 12:41:58

I've been virtually a shut-in for a decade. No online friends. No one. We were friends for a month and while my mental health wasn't the best I at least had someone by my side. I felt like I wasn't in it alone. My suffering was manageable. 

They were suicidal themselves. We listened to reach other vent. Shared things that went on throughout the day and did things together. These simple things meant the world to me. They knew what I've been through, what I suffered with, and they accepted me. So interacting with them meant so much. 

Then they stopped talking to me. They said they couldn't handle being important to someone and that they need to work on themselves. I understand they aren't in the best place in their life, but neither am I. I really need them and I can't stop thinking how selfish what they did is. They've deleted Reddit and discord to take a break. 

For some reason, I started cutting. I have no clue why. It's never been a problem I've had. Usually I just get drunk, although I've been doing good... I've actually been doing really good. I've been exercising a lot. Actually ran six miles today ^^ I run four miles a day have been for the past two months. I'm seeing a physical trainer and started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I also started Latin classes at a college... So yeah, I'm unrecognizable from who I was.. I've talked to a lot people online and each person in some way has helped me. But I can't get over them. I've been crying the past two days profusely and have been over eating. I'm finally skinny and am working on building muscle. I really don't want to gain back all the weight I've lost.

It really looks like people are living a great life, with some friends, going out every evening. Yeah, maybe drinking a lot, but at least they have fun and get to know someone new.

837,nueva_student,1629931409,1,"I always thought I would eventually somehow find someone. You see, specially in my teens, i never considered myself ugly, and i never really thought about having a boyfriend bc none of my friends had one. I also never flirted with boys, mostly because I never knew how to do it. Whenever i talked to someone at a party, no matter their gender, I always got really anxious and made others join in the conversation. 

I have never been a social person, I haven‚Äôt made a new friend in years. I only have 2 close friends, and I only met them because one of their moms is friends with my mom, and I don‚Äôt know how but they somehow liked me and we have been friends ever since. The only problem is they are literally the two most attractive girls I have ever met, and they get invited to everything. In Highschool, they always invited me to this parties/clubs, but because of my social anxiety I only ever went once every couple of weeks/months. In senior year, they both got a boyfriend, and ever since that year I rarely go out of my house on weekends. They both study abroad now so i rarely have a chance to see them.

I only really realized in college how asocial I was. I literally made 0 friends, and whenever we worked in groups, which was often, i had to practically tell the teacher to randomly put me in a group. I thought I just bad luck, but then I changed careers and the same exact thing happened, i have 0 friends. I now realize that the common denominator is me, I am the problem. 

I am almost 24 now, and even though I have been hitting the gym for a couple of years now and even got my nose fixed, my self confidence is worse than it has ever been. I forgot to mention i am adopted, and i have 5 other siblings. Every single weekend they all go out with their friends, and I feel so ashamed every Friday/Saturday when i tell my parents i dont have any plans. Sometimes, i tell them im going out with friends so they dont feel sorry for me and then I just drive around, alone.

I have gone to therapy all my life, mainly because of my adhd and because of anger issues, and more recently because of my depression. I have change psychologists and psychiatrists multiple times, and i dont feel none of them have helped me. 

The reason i am writing this post, is because yesterday my psychologist asked what had been my favorite social moment this year, and I realized that I had probably gone out with my friends no more than 2 times in the last year. I haven‚Äôt done anything in my life except studying online and going to the gym this last 2 years. I have tried online relationships, but i never know what to talk about. I have tried to make new friends irl, but I never succeed. There is just something about my face that makes people dont like me. I see people in here genuinely suffering because they actually try and get rejected because they are ugly. And i hate myself even more because i know many people in here are actually decent people and if they could improve their looks they would get a partner. I have decent looks and I cant even get friends. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I thought things would eventually change but here i am, alone as always. My depression has only gotten worse, and in the last 6 months i have been in a psychiatric stay twice.

My dad comes in everyday and point out all my mistakes and how boneidle and ignorant i am. My mum believes i hate her she told me im whiney and spoilt because i wanted to cook my food the microwave way and not spend an hour preparing both mine and my dads oven cooking it and waiting. 
While my parents work, since its the summer holidays, i babysit my brother all day everyday and he makes a point to make fun of me to his friends on his computer aswell as cousins. Yesterday he also made a horrible dig at the fact i never got a job i applied for.
Anyway, the worst thing today was the fact that i was left alone at home today and was told i could not join (i assumed this was because my brother was getting me a late gift since he made comments about nit even having a gift for me), they spoke about going out for lunch and my mum mentioned possibly bringing me luch home. That never happened and i just binge ate instead after waiting till 4. 

No one called me all day no one cared about me and after being mocked tooped with the fact no one willingly cares about me i just feel like shit.

Someone in the background, nothing to be serious about. 

Never on the top of someone's list or the one that gets loved to real life. 

I'm not the one that gets the mushy poems, or the beautiful love songs. 

I'm someone who just gets scraps of affection and the occasional love mentions. You know, just enough to keep me around but not enough that I feel truly and deeply loved. 

I am convenient. I am dispensable. I am forgettable. I am replaceable. 

I'm not the one you'll shed tears over when I'm gone. I'm just one of the many anyway. 

It is ironic, that being there for the lonely makes you lonely. 

And to earn someone's affection, is losing some for yourself. 

I'm just a scapegoat of sorts from whatever real life miseries one could have.

Yeah. I know. My mother called me for dinner. She practically screamed so loudly (I was in the other room) that I couldn't handle myself. All of it faded away. The friends. The fun. The enjoyment. The conversations. Everything. For the past hour and half or so, I was imagining all that. All of it. All of those fun talk never really happened. Well it did, but only in my head. That realization is the hardest part if you ask me. The realization that these 'friends' that I was talking to don't even know where I am. The realization that nothing happened. The realization that I haven't spoken to any of my old school friends in months now. The realization that I haven't fixed anything.

I had a wonderful, loving, goofy, and encouraging friend group in college. They were my friend soulmates. For 3 years I was laughing until tears every day. I always had at least one person to hang with. I never felt friendship like this before. 

After college they decided I was no longer worth their friendship. They never told me what I did wrong. They simply ghosted me. This was in 2019. 

Now it‚Äôs 2021. I‚Äôve made some friends. Reconnected with some friend high school. But nothing feels the same. No one makes me laugh as hard. No one helps me feel as complete. 

I have friends but not soulmate friends. I don‚Äôt have ‚Äòmy person‚Äô. I don‚Äôt have someone I can causally text to hang. Like I don‚Äôt have a default person to even run errands with.

I genuinely haven't felt ""happy"" for like 5 years, precisely since my depression and anxiety started getting out of hand, and my mental and physical health as a result.

I stopped having interest in a lot of things I liked, I stopped feeling excited about anything, I've became more and more nihilistic in recent years. My passion for art (which is a big part of my life) has been slowly diminishing, to the point where I feel like I just ""need"" to do it, rather than ""want"", and so us the case with basically everything else.

I'm afraid of going outside, I'm afraid of people, I'm afraid of myself, of death and dying. I'm constantly worrying and I feel generally awful most of the time, I feel like I'm living my last weeks or months, for years, that feeling doesn't go away.

No, I'm not alone, but what good is it if everyone around you doesn't understand you? They ask, you explain, and it always comes down to the same, ""why?"". If I knew why, there probably wouldn't be a problem in the first place. 

I've tried ""being happy"" and living healthy, but no matter what I do and how hard I try it always comes back, and I just pretend that it's fine, but it clearly isn't, I feel unhappy, I feel empty.

That's all fine and well, I'm already homesick a bit but it's good for me to get out and become my own person.

The problem is that I'll never be living with my brother again. He's basically my best friend. We have the same interest in everything, and we do everything together. Movies, sports, games, hiking, you name it. Despite trying to make friends at college for almost four years, I've never found someone that shares as many interests with me. Which makes sense, because my brother and I grew up together. 

Anyway, I'm starting to get this constant anxiety that I'll never find anyone else like him, and that I'll have to do the things I enjoy alone for the rest of my life. Which doesn't really make them enjoyable. Has anyone here been in this situation? He's also leaving for a church mission thing in a few months, and my only contact with him will be email/phone calls, so it's not like we can play games online together or anything.",lonely,"Moving out of my parents house, no real friends",2021-08-26 00:42:56

908,realhacker6993,1629893753,1,"If past experience is any indication, then I got dealt a shit hand by whatever ""God"" is out there in the universe. And I don't mean growing up in poverty or struggling in school or anything like that. What I mean, essentially, is that anytime I tried to let someone in emotionally and thought they would be there for me as a friend, even as a girlfriend, I got fucked over. I am not in any way joking or making light of anything. I have truly, genuinely been betrayed in some fashion anytime I open up to people.

It of course started with hi-jinks in school where some kid(s) would pretend to be my friend only to sell me out to some bully or actually be the bully and embarrass/humiliate me in some way. This turned into me having some anger issues and spending two years in juvenile detention for stabbing a kid with a broken piece of plate when I got into a fight at school (there were some other factors at play also). By the time I got out of ""juvie"", I wasn't really ""transformed"" or anything like that. I just didn't give a shit anymore and just kind of went along with life.

And for a while it was okay. I did decent in school and even got into college. But after choosing to not make any new friends because of my past experience of being betrayed, I started to feel lonely. And what better way to fill that loneliness than not just through drugs but also girls? Sure I had some FWB-type relationships that weren't anything serious. But I did have two serious relationships in college, both of them ended in me getting cheated on.

I know I sound like Mr. Pity Party or something, but I'm just being honest. I don't bother anybody and nobody bothers me. That's how my life is right now. And I think, if it brings me not necessarily happiness but safety, it's a good way to live into the foreseeable future. Maybe even all the way to the end. Barring any tragic accident that should befall me, I don't see why becoming an island and never having to deal with the pain of either being betrayed or losing someone close like family (not that I have one anyway) wouldn't be a bad thing. The opposite would be too risky, and I don't like my chances.",lonely,I know I have my whole life ahead of me and all that yada yada.

910,JayFal,1629892455,1,"14 months ago I had an accident resulting in a traumatic brain injury (TBI). I (34F) still can't work, I still can't drive, can't even ride in the car further than 20 minutes. Outside of medical practitioners and my many different therapists (physical, visual, etc.), I have seen 10 people since my accident (to add context I am married, large family and felt rather social for an introvert prior to the accident). I have seen my husband, my parents, my brother, his wife, their 2 year old, 3 of my friends and my husbands best friend. Out of these 10, my 1 friend stopped in for 10 minutes and my niece doesn't even know me, so do those interactions even count? The cognitive impairments from the accident make it harder to follow conversations, so even in a group of people I feel totally alone. I've never met my nieces &amp; nephews on my husbands side, haven't seen a single in law since a month before the accident (he goes for a couple days at a time to visit, I stay home alone). I hate weekends because every Monday, people go back to real life, work, routines and here I sit. Alone. Again. Reminded just how alone I am.

Did I mention I had to put my rescue beagle, 14 years of solid friendship, my true companion, down last month? It made the loneliness 1000√ó worse. Oh, did I also mention  months pregnant and feel totally detached to the point I'm concerned I won't even love this baby when it's here. I need companionship and everyone keeps saying the baby will bring that but I think that's bullshit thinking and too much pressure on the baby. I think if anything this baby is just going to make me feel more isolated.

I see an RSW weekly for CBT. He joked that ""we're basically best friends at this point"" and I cried because it's true but I pay him haha. I guess that's 1 way to find companionship. Pay them üòÇ

Anyways, I guess there's no real point to this post except maybe ask if others can relate to feeling alone even when surrounded by others? If you followed this far, thank you.

912,I-Sweater-God,1629890134,1,"My birthday was a few weeks ago and no one, not even my group that I‚Äôve been friends with for years, did anything special for me. Just the courtesy groupchat text and comments on social media, but that was it. People that have my number that could have easily called or texted just put ‚Äúhbd‚Äù under my post, and that made me feel like shit. I‚Äôm big on giving and receiving gifts; I love doing that and that‚Äôs how I feel loved. I also recognize that we are in the middle of a pandemic. I expressed to my closer friends months ago that I don‚Äôt feel safe going out, BUT the past year and a half I‚Äôve dropped off gifts at doorsteps and spoken to them, masked up, from a distance. Over the last few months our groupchat texts pretty much stopped and I thought we all just drifted apart for a bit (which is totally normal) but that obviously was not the case. I mention this because I‚Äôve seen all their posts of them going out all the time; like I said, I don‚Äôt feel safe doing that stuff rn, but imo, if you have the time to go out every weekend, then there‚Äôs no excuse and it‚Äôs obvious how I don‚Äôt fit in to this equation. 

I know friendships shouldn‚Äôt be transactional, but if I got you something and celebrated your day with you in the past‚Ä¶I‚Äôd like to feel the same way too. I‚Äôve bottled everything up and it‚Äôs just finally hitting me that nobody seems to care about me the way I care about them, and it really fucking sucks. This isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs happened, and it‚Äôs the same pattern every time: we drift, I eventually stop initiating conversation, there‚Äôs no communication between us until several months later when they finally say something, and I either respond or don‚Äôt respond because I‚Äôm so numb by then. I always feel people‚Äôs absence 100 times more than they feel or care about mine. As I get older I realize that everything is fake and in the real world, no one gives a damn about you. I tried to make my birthday special for myself, but you can‚Äôt really do that when no one celebrates with you or makes you feel appreciated.

913,srh_bxtr,1629887859,1,"My mental health fluctuates (as I'm sure most people's does!) but even if I'm in a good place I really struggle to spend time alone. I don't know what it is but I find it so hard to feel motivated to do anything if I'm by myself. I often can't decide what to do and then just end up doing nothing or just doing something boring like cleaning the house. My joy comes from spending time with people I love and if they're not around I just feel like doing anything is pointless. I live with my husband and have family close by. I also drive but I'm not a confident driver and can often feel very anxious driving any journey longer than 10 minutes. I work from home and just feel like I'm becoming more and more of a recluse. I'm not in a good place with my mental health at the moment and feel really down all the time. My mood is very flat. I recently got married and we're in the process of buying our first house (renting at present). It feels like there are so many things I should be excited and happy about but I'm just not. I'm spending most of my time alone, my husband works weekends in August so my days off are alone. He has hobbies he likes to enjoy a couple of weekdays after work so those nights I am alone too. And of course all day I'm alone whilst working from home. I do have the option to work from the office however none of my team will be there as they're working from home too so that feels pointless
 It makes me feel so depressed. But I also have no motivation to get out of the hole and see anyone or do anything. I don't have many friends closeby anymore as a lot of my school friends stayed in the cities they moved to for uni. Locally I mostly have my family and my husband's family and then my one best friend but she is 8 months pregnant so understandably is busy with other things. I just feel hopeless and just a drain on my husband and I don't know how to pick myself up.

I remember this one moment I was in a mental hospital in new jersey, staring at my reflection. I had long the long red hair I always wanted, and I was wearing a pretty dress holding the hospital guitar. I looked beautiful, but I was there. Locked up in a mental hospital. No one to love me. Alone.

917,imtiNation,1629884340,1,"How do you describe the feeling of being lonely? You know you are alone when you have nobody that you can truly be vulnerable to in the sense of opening up and sharing how you feel, sharing your successes and failures and having no one to put their arm around you and tell you everything will be okay. The feeling of helplessness and knowing that your death will probably mean nothing to anyone and you'll probably have no one visit your grave, not that I suppose it matters since you're dead. 

My granny fell ill a few days ago and I've been constantly going to the hospital to check up on her and provide support to my parents. My whole life I've always been treated differently to my siblings, I've always felt like I was definitely a mistake, a child they were hoping not to have but ended up having. None of my siblings had the time to provide support to my parents in this time, I've spent a couple nights in the hospital so my parents could come home and sleep well. Unfortunately I missed my granny's death this morning as I was unable to reach the hospital in time. Upon reaching the hospital, my parents denied me access saying that I did not deserve to see her as I was not there for her death despite the fact that I've had sleepless nights keeping an eye on her in the hospital whereas my siblings went about their days as normal but because they were there at the time of my granny's death, I suppose they have more worth and are more entitled to see my granny. My heart hurts to not be able to see her but I respect my parents and decided to leave. I've never been the type of person to cause a scene and with quite a few people there, I didnt want to add more to my parents' grief. 

I had the smallest room in my family home and never complained. I was given no financial support since the age of 15 (as in had to buy my own things with my own money) as my dad said that its time to grow up and understand how the real world works whereas I have siblings who are 24/25 years old and they still receive money from my parents. I still never complained and just accepted this. I was told to move out and have my own place at the age of 19 whereas I have siblings who still live at home. I've spent many holidays going back home only to see my entire family having a huge lunch or dinner and no one seemingly even telling me. I've had aunts and uncles invited to my family home celebrating with my family and again, no one telling me, having to view my siblings snapchats to see how much fun they are all having.¬† I have always felt disconnected from my family and I just dont understand why. I spent my entire childhood trying to get my parents to love me, I've thrived in my studies, stayed away from any trouble and did everything with the sole aim of making them happy and yet nothing worked. Maybe I was a mistake and and thats why my parents find it so hard to look at me? Is my dad my real dad? Maybe my mum cheated on my dad and as a result I was born and that my 'dad' just hates me and thats why cant stand being around me? 

I'm sat in my apartment just wondering whats the point anymore. I have no friends, clearly I have no family which I've always known for a while but just held on as I knew if I lose them, I will truly have nobody. And here I am, I have nobody. None of my siblings even checked in with me to see if I'm okay. 

A lonely life, never having anyone in my life feeling like an empty shell just looking forward to the day I just drop dead and find some peace and warmth. Even if I was a mistake, I try to find happinness in the fact that I am extremely lucky to experience life even if it is just painful. Just keep marching forwards I suppose, eventually it gets better and hopefully I find someone who might see some worth in me. The last person to ever give a damn was my granny and now shes no longer here. 

Sorry for the extremely long text, I just needed somewhere to write it out all. I know I should be a lot more grateful, atleast I have a job and a roof over my head but sometimes I just feel so down knowing that I have nobody and that no one cares. I long for meaningful connections and I have done my entire life which has made me into a loner whose only purpose in life is to slave away in my job as it atleast allows me to forget for half of my day until I come home to complete silence and go to sleep looking forward to going to work and forgetting again. I cant remember the last time I even had a hug, probably been atleast a couple years. I spend my weekends at a cafe and just watch people go about their day laughing and talking with each other and just imagining what its like. Seeing sons laughing and joking with their fathers, seeing siblings play around with each other, seeing couples love each other. This is my life I guess, live one day at a time and just be grateful and hold on to the fact that it will all end one day.",lonely,The last person to ever care about me has died.,2021-08-25 19:39:00

After a toxic trio friendship (they left me too for others, blamed me always for everything, had phases when they acted like they don't even know me, got mad at me for talking to other people than them) I changed my class and got into a new friend group.

That friend group was really messy and everyone hated each other and there was a lot of ""drama"". It eventually broke up when upper secondary school started. Me and one of them were still friends (we had been friends from elementary school) but since she got a boyfriend... well, she doesn't talk about anything else. It's always just about him. And if she does want to hang out with me, she is bringing her boyfriend or she is talking about him. When she messages me, I get excited but then feel disappointed again when I notice that the only thing she was messaging me about was her boyfriend.

In upper secondary school I thought I got a new friend. But I've noticed that they aren't that interested in me really. It hurts. I try so hard and overcome my fears to make finally friends but there just isn't anyone who actually cares about me. I had another friend in upper secondary school too (we had been friends a couple years already, but he destroyed my blooming friendship on a certain camp). Well, I wasn't surprised but I certainly was disappointed when he left me too for other people. 

I feel like I can't make anyone happy. I just want to have friends and feel appreciated. But that is impossible for me because I am not enough. My former friends and the boyfriend of my friend I talked about have said to me some pretty hurtful things about my personality and looks. The boyfriend even said that no one could ever love me. He also called me fat many times although he knew that I am recovering from an eating disorder. I just know everything is my fault. But I don't know what can I do to make myself more lovable.

I hate people. They scare and disappoint me. But I still can't stop myself from looking out for them and trying to find friends. My only wish is just to find a friend, who actually wants me and doesn't leave me. (And sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker) (And sorry for venting.

I sound like someone that‚Äôs living the perfect life, but if I am then why do I feel like a piece of depressed shit. Why do I love the idea of suicide and think it would fix all my problems. 

Truth is once I get home, people just kinda forget about me. As soon as I walk out of school or a sporting event or something like that. I become invisible. Nobody wants to hang out with me. No one wants to be with me. 

Last year I met someone that actually wanted to hang out with me. He just texted me he‚Äôs leaving the school district and moving away. He was the only real friend I had. 

I don‚Äôt know what do now. Ik suicide isn‚Äôt an option or at least I‚Äôm trying to make myself feel that way. I‚Äôm probably gonna move on with my life. I‚Äôve started hitting the gym.  And just started being more healthy. I just want someone I can consider a true friend. 

First day of school was today. I barely kept in touch with any of my friends over COVID-19 , and my relationship with them hasn‚Äôt changed. I guess that might be a red flag. 

I know a lot more people have it worse than me. I mean at least people acknowledge me an respect me, but I don‚Äôt know.

952,Affectionate-Ad-5400,1629861931,1,"I remember feeling an emotion I never felt before a little while back. Or rather I felt that emotion for a very long time, but never so enriched. The emotion of loneliness of course. It felt as if I was swallowed whole and could never escape out of it. Even surrounded by family, I felt so estranged.

Now I have been progressing and climbing the stairs of somewhat feeling what it seems to be happy and content. Even with no actual friends that I could run to in moments that I wish to. But rather working with what I got and recognizing what I have thankfully. Whether it‚Äôs my dog or my family, my manga collection, a good movie, a fun day, or an accomplished dish. As long as I‚Äôm not self-sabotaging, I‚Äôve notice the lonely feeling escaping. That recognizing my lack of self-love and severe doubt is only making my lonely emotions deepen. So I gave myself a reality check and started to treat myself in the same mentality I would treat someone like else in the same predicament. I no longer stressed and overthought every move to compromise for others to the point I lost my emotions. I no longer felt the strong urge to feel dependent on others for happiness and validation. I began to feel whole, rather than wallow in my own predicament and self-indulge in the comforting feeling of what I made my norm, pure dread.

Whenever I notice myself deepening that lack of self worth and doubt. I almost yelled within my head and put something in front of me to take out those emotions within my head. I began to make goals that made me proud, that gave me bits of meaning to my sad unproductive moments. I created a space in which I could go to as a creative outlet. My desk. I have things such as sketchbooks, headphones, skincare, makeup, etc scattered across my desk. After a stressful day, I indulge in a creative space, whether I‚Äôm feeling it or not, because I know it‚Äôll take out negative emotions within my mind.

But what really helped is being real with myself. Recognizing the patterns of self sabotage. Talking to myself and coming to myself as a friend rather than seeing myself as a tedious task I have to put up with. Self-love began to form. Slowly, although I would love friends, I stopped wasting my life away on what I didn‚Äôt have, and when I did, I got up and fought for what I dreamt for. I slowly became blunt and sure of myself, stopped overthinking every interaction I had and hating myself for it not turning out how I hoped for. I became content of my progress and kept moving forward. Reminded that I am my own worst enemy. Reminded that in life it‚Äôs easy to give up, but maaan when you succeeded, all that heart wrenching pain was worth it. That those moments are very much worth it. I still got a long way to go, but I‚Äôm excited for the journey.

So those who have came upon tips that genuinely helped you even a bit escape loneliness in a healthy manner, please share; Whether it‚Äôs building a connection of emotions between artwork you‚Äôve invested your time in. Making effort to make your own self proud instead of others. Please share for those struggling in this shared emotion of loneliness.

959,_Luniella_,1629860755,1,"Hey, you.

Remember that map we played together? The one we couldn't beat despite working on it for over an hour and a half?

It took me 40 minutes, but I beat it. I wish more than anything I could call you and tell you, hear you lose your mind when you realise I'd actually done it, you'd be so proud of me if you still loved me.

I beat it twice actually, only took 30 minutes the second time. I beat the wall climb too. I figured out how to work with gems. I never could bring myself to marry anyone again.

I know you were online after you left me, I don't know if you know that everyone can see when you were last active. If you hate me so much, why couldn't you break us up in game? Did you want to leave it there, a relic of our time together?

We've been together on that account for over 200 days, milestone, I know. 

I had to make an entirely new account because I couldn't handle playing the old one without you. I can't even look at the character you mained.

I've gotten really good! Sometimes, I can even keep up with En! 

They made a major update, by the way. Added new maps too. Each time I play a map I think about what you would've thought of it. Like the driving one, you would've hate-loved it. You would've been so determined to beat it and would be so salty, but so proud, when I'd beat it first. I made a gold record on the map you loved, idk, maybe in an attempt to honour you. I'm shooting for the top record, I want to at least have that. I know you would've been so fucking proud. 

A lot of maps include the grapple now, the one you could never work for some reason. You'd have hated them, complaining about the game giving you a disability, and I'd find your rambles adorable.

I found everything you did adorable.

Sometimes it's so hard to remind myself that you were lying the entire time, that you never REALLY cared about me, you just had such a way of convincing me you'd change. And I'd let you convince me again, if you'd come back.

If you'd just play it with me again.

If I could marry you again.

Because regardless of how many times you leave me, how many times you absolutely ruin me, how many times you make me feel like I'm worth nothing and that I am incapable of ever being loved

I'd marry you again. And again. And again. I'd never stop choosing you. I'd make endless accounts just to get to marry you on them again. 

Just to hear those cute, salty rambles again.

Just to hear the pride in your voice when I beat a map again.

Just to get to the end together and playfully push eachother bc we always wanted to give eachother the win.

Just to get to love you again.

Just to get to pretend you loved me again.

I'm so afraid to put myself out there, so afraid to get hurt because last time I did I ended up in the hospital on suicide watch. But even if I tried to, it wouldn't be long before my depression would push them away and myself into isolation, that's how I got into this position to begin with.

This could be long, apologies. I just want to let it all out. We knew each other for years. Everything was so great between. It was like the perfect bond you could have with another person. She understood me so well, cared for me. Made me feel like I mattered. I have always had having stable relationships, but this was great. I could go on and on about how much she meant to me. And I didn't realise it until I messed it all up and started losing her. We were great friends, but I didn't realise when I caught feelings for her. She eventually figured it out as well. Things then started going bad, she obviously didn't feel the same. Eventually after our fair share of fights and discussions, and trying to keep it going, she said she can't be close anymore and just wants to be ""casual"" friends. What the hell is that? We fell apart. I keep feeling I am replaced. We had fights even after this. It's been months since this happened, I want to move ahead but every once in a while I am back to square one. We are still on talking terms, and there are no bitter feelings. But I still can't accept her reason. Though she says that is the reason. I am spiralled. I have self harmed. I have thought of hurting myself in different ways. I have cuts all over my arm. I hate myself. I can't text and tell that I miss her, because it is not going to help either of us. I have other friends but I feel disconnected from everyone. I lost my best person. And I am failing to cope with it. I can't accept the fact that a person who came to for every little thing has gone away. Things may never be alright, my mind knows that, but my heart can't accept. I'm not suicidal, but I really wish I didn't exist. I never thought anything could hurt so much. Not even breakups hurt like this, and I have been in a few.

So we basically have been talking for the last day and I‚Äôve been trying to tell her that I miss the times when we were closer together and how her rejections when I ask her to hang out or when she just texts me only once or twice at maximum times a day affect me and make me think that she doesn‚Äôt care about me anymore. She basically responds that it isn‚Äôt her job to make me happy (which is true but I didn‚Äôt even talk about that topic as I responded to her that she‚Äôs not the key to my happiness but I feel sad when my best friend ignores me) and she also said that I shouldn‚Äôt be affected so much by her because she just my friend and not my girlfriend. At this point I really got upset because she didn‚Äôt appreciate our friendship like before because she wouldn‚Äôt have said that. I realized that I wasn‚Äôt her close friend anymore. And I just responded as i said before that I‚Äôm not depending on her about being happy and just in general telling her that our distancing hurts me and I ask her if she had any problem towards me. At last our conversation ends just her saying that she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong to me (which is true) and that the conversation was not good psychologically and she just said that she doesn‚Äôt have to explain herself because we are ok with each other. I just answered than that we are definitely ok and that she didn‚Äôt make any mistake with me. This is the story how I lost my close friend. We probably still talk but I don‚Äôt think any of us will consider the other a close friend anymore. After all these times of being insecure about this relationship I convinced myself that she doesn‚Äôt care about me as she used to. I will definitely miss the old her but it is what it is.",lonely,Update: I‚Äôm losing (maybe already lost) my best friend and I feel so fkn bad right now,2021-08-25 06:34:56

1006,RequirementSavings56,1629834773,1,"For two months, kind of, I was away from Facebook. The first time I was banned for thirty days, and when the ban lifted, I realized I have lost the enthusiasm to be on this account. So again for almost a month, I was away. And I have figured out some things, you might not agree with, but I have made up my mind about it.

1: Just because you talk to someone daily or talk in a good manner, or they watch the same movies as you, that doesn't mean they are your friends. You are just people with a common taste, and you can find one or two even on a bus on long travels, or on a train.
2: Virtual world is not real, even if you cannot stay away from it, and you might never will. No matter what you do, no matter how bored you are of social media, you just cannot stay away from it. Eventually, you are going to return. This is the curse of this century, we are lost people, we are empty, we are drained, we are raised in a way that social media is the last and only thread to keep us going alongside the time.
3: There are more than 2 billion people here, and people you see here in an hour are almost 20 times more than you see in real life. That brings relations dilation. When there are so many people to see, there are not many people to remember, leaving you highly replaceable, and forgettable. In real life, it is hard to forget people as you are going to see them one way or another, but here, you will are going to see or talk to 100 people every day, and you will barely remember 2 out of them throughout the week. When for a month it becomes 3000, you see odds fall to 0.3% of anyone remembering you.
4: The only way people are going to remember you, is that you keep reminding them that you exist.
5: Most of friendships or relationships are formed here on the base of 'charm', and believe me, that is highly volatile, extremely momentarily. You might be Stephen Hawking in someone's eyes, but as soon the charm fades away, you are nothing more than a random person they found you on Facebook.
6: Yes you will find some people that will like you, be impressed by you, or impress you with their devotion, and finding them is rare. If you have them, do not waste your energies elsewhere looking for more which might even risk losing what you already have.
7: Even the people in case 6, will forget you eventually. The only difference is, it might take some months for them. But this is not only the case on social media, but that is also the truth of life.
8: In the end, the only way to decide who your real friend is to die, and see if they read some poetic elegy on your grave after your family has left. (Well at least my friends are gonna do that, in case I die first, not sure about yours.)

1020,inaraserra1981,1629831351,1,"I‚Äôve had depression for a long time. My first suicide attempt was at 9. I‚Äôve tried medication and therapy and gratitude and exercise. I do volunteer work and my job is focused on helping underserved people. I‚Äôve done everything they say you‚Äôre supposed to do, and I still wake up in pain most days because I‚Äôm alone.

I haven‚Äôt had a real relationship in 15 years. The kind where someone introduces you to their friends and care if you‚Äôre in their life or not. I‚Äôm a spiritual person (please don‚Äôt judge) and prayed about it so much earlier this year. I asked for my person to be here before I turned 40 in June.

And I met someone two weeks later and it was amazing. I fell for him, he said he fell for me, and then he dumped me out of the blue after about three months. Just days before he‚Äôd been telling me how lucky he was to be with me. He dumped me in a text without much reason and wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. It felt like a very loud message of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre worthless to me.‚Äù I spent 40 alone.

A month later he wanted to see me, so I went and we started texting again and hung out twice. He told me he dumped me because it seemed like I wasn‚Äôt as into him (don‚Äôt know how he thought that) but talking about it would have been too much work. He said things that I took to mean he wanted to slowly try again. But when I clarified, he said he just had ‚Äúfriend feelings‚Äù.  I said we couldn‚Äôt be in each other‚Äôs lives because it would be too hard. And once again felt worthless and thrown away.

Then eight days later he started following me on Instagram and engaging with my posts. I sat on it for a while, and finally asked what he wanted. It seemed like if I said we couldn‚Äôt interact because I‚Äôm heartbroken, and he inserted himself back in my life, he must be feeling some kind of way.

He went off on me about how he wishes I could move on, social media isn‚Äôt real life, that I‚Äôm crazy for thinking it meant anything, he doesn‚Äôt want attention from me, etc. I sent a short response saying I‚Äôm not crazy but ok, I get it that he doesn‚Äôt miss me/think about me/want attention from me. No response, just an unfollow.

And I feel even worse now because I gave this man multiple opportunities to show me how little I mean to him, how much he wants me out of his life, how inconsequential I am to him. 

It‚Äôs just proof of what I‚Äôve feared for so long, which is that people don‚Äôt attach to me. He‚Äôs certainly capable of attachment. He‚Äôs got a new gf and they‚Äôre super in love. I‚Äôll never have that in my life, and a life without that isn‚Äôt worth it.

1023,__mifflin,1629829684,1,"I've been struggling to focus on anything lately, due to feeling more intense loneliness than usual. During the bulk of the pandemic, I'd pretty much allowed myself to ignore the loneliness of living alone because there wasn't anything I could really do about it. Dating apps felt like they weren't an option, so in my mind it was actually oddly easier to *not* feel lonely, because it was mostly out of my control.

Well, now I don't have that excuse as much, so I've been feeling the lack of connection &amp; intimacy a lot more lately. I also work 100% from home, so it also enables me to give into maladaptive daydreaming more than I would otherwise. What's ironic though is that I've been more social now than before the pandemic, going to events on Meetup and whatnot, chatting with new people and making new acquaintances along the way.

But that has also made me feel more lonely, because every time I come home I realize how lonely I really am. My house is kind of a mess. I've literally just been putting my clean clothes laid out on the couch for months now, instead of organized in a drawer. I leave dishes out on the counter instead of putting them into the washer, because the washer still has clean dishes I haven't taken out yet. Et cetera.

I don't know what else to say, really. This just sucks. I also have recently paid for dating app shit, and I feel a bit like a loser for doing so. But I have a disposable income, and I want to date again, so I went through with it. It just sucks feeling like I'm being taken advantage of by these dating app companies, knowing that it's the best way for me to actually start dating again. I'm trying to meet people organically, of course, but it's a very slow and arduous process. I wish I wasn't a guy, because I've always been super shy and worried about making other people feel uncomfortable when it comes to asking them out. Dating apps in that sense are kind of a godsend for me, despite how toxic they can be.

When i was in HS I had friends and knew the popular kids, but i always kept to myself and my ipod (back then). Never went to any social event, no dances ( got rejected 2x when asking.), and i wasn‚Äôt in the best shape. I was 5‚Äô6 hovering on 190 lbs. I graduated, didn‚Äôt walk the stage as I felt it was a waste of time and that while people knew me, i felt no one would really cheer for me as i never made the most strong connections. Went to CC as I didn‚Äôt feel the need to go straight to a university and didn‚Äôt even know if college is for me, just got an AA. Worked asa Preschool teacher for a-couple of years and Work at a Hospital after that and still do.  I have gotten in a lot better shape since HS. Gym is my go to for stress and just to see people (sad). I do alot of things alone and have no shame in it as i have been doing that since HS. Gym, movies, eating out, hiking, traveling, etc.

Issue:
I never made meaningful connections.
Had intercourse once, wasn‚Äôt the best, obviously. 
Anytime I asked a woman out they are usually take taken.

I'm 24 years old, I have a full time job in an architects office. I still live at home with my parents, who are great, but overall I feel unfulfilled and extremely unhappy. 

I once had a close nit group of friends, but long story short after I left for uni many of my closest friends decided they would rather spend time with my younger brother. To the point where when I came home I would see my brother leave the house to go hang out with those same friends who didn't seem to care that I was only back for a weekend etc. 

The brother I mentioned is a few years younger than me, and after we had been getting on for years, slowly over time seemed to grow to resent me, taking my ex's side when we broke up, barely speaking to me except to critise, being physically violent with provocation. Recently even breaking my jaw, which resulted in him being kicked out by our parents and myself needing an operation. 

I know I'm to blame for my loneliness, I dont really get out of the house much. I've fallen out with the majority of friends, either through lack of contact or childish arguements. Now I wake up everyday with a sense of existential dread, knowing theres another day of doing nothing but playing video games or watching youtube ahead of me and I hate it.",lonely,"I have no friends, no life and I'm really struggling.",2021-08-24 21:21:07

You could have a heart to heart with me and unload all of your burdens and I'll listen and do my best as a friend because I care. But that alone doesn't mean I feel bonded to you. 

As an extrovert I enjoy time around friends, going out each week for dinner with the boys to shoot the shit about work and life, getting together with old friends I've known since birth, game night, etc. But I find that most of the time I end up feeling alone. Especially when none of the friends I'm with are deep individuals or can hold a meaningful conversation.

And then there's one. The one that gets me, the one I can talk to, who I'll listen to and she'll listen to me. And feel like we share some strange telepathy. Usually it tends to be a female (I'm a male) so I end up confusing it for possible romantic feelings. But I once had the same connection with a friend of mine in college. We were vastly different and he irritated me to no end but no matter how hard I tried to cut him off I found that maybe we needed each other in our lives at the time.

Carry yourself with dignity and the upmost self respect.

Never indulge in attention seeking behavior no matter the struggle. A man of few words. All the while looked upon with impeccable wisdom and knowledge, yet humble and modest all at the same time

The loneliness will come about, and when it does there's the finest scotch at the ready.

Prone to depression, dark thoughts as dark as silent mysterious skies, questioning humanity and it's very existence

You are in your head boy, let it go.....

Knowing that human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution, and and every one you know is so oblivious to this and are satisfied with the little things that bring them fulfillment such as materialistic belongings, house's and cars. Only thinking of what's in front of them and never beyond themselves and their daily lives.

Discovering you have so much empathy for the world and your fellow man. You give and give and not even a slither of what you gave is returned. Such generosity and compassion. Disappointment on a constant level

It makes me sad because nowadays I only rely on the internet and I'm not even good at making friends online unless they want to start a friendship.

‚ÄúYou have to find happiness from within yourself!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have to love yourself before you can have a relationship with someone‚Äù ‚ÄúSelf love and self care is most important‚Äù

I hear this type of advice all the time and it never seems to help no matter what I do. 

I‚Äôve had many issues with hating things about myself throughout my life. Things that I strived to fix. I was obese, now I‚Äôm normal body weight. I was a social outcast, now I strive to socialize and even found a friend group that accepts me. I didn‚Äôt have a plan for my life in high school, now I‚Äôm 3 years into college majoring in something I love. I was broke, now I have more money than I feel most people my age have, I lived with and mooched off my aunt for years, now I have my own apartment. Point is, I‚Äôve been self improving and self caring for a while.

None of it makes me happy.

In my head, I can only feel truly content when loving and being loved by someone else. I feel like such a loser saying it, so I never talk about it with anyone. I was only once happy during all that self improvement and that was the 2 years I was in a relationship; even if she was an abusive nightmare towards the end.

I watch all these videos and try my hardest to take their advice, but it all boils down to things I‚Äôm already doing to see no results.

And now that all of my friends are gone on to much finer things such as relationships and careers I stand here alone. As an introvert I didn't mind the changes the pandemic brought the zoom calls and the online learning didn't phase me but I did learn something I learned that I was much more extroverted than I let on and now that things are relatively back to some kind of normalcy as people can meet and gather in in small groups I feel lost because I have no groups anymore. I did clubs in college but when the pandemic hit we never had clubs so I lost a great deal of opportunities, but most importantly I lost the opportunity to meet people and that's something I'll have live with.

1106,Cradle_2_the_grave,1629764043,1,"I feel like my entire life is a never ending game of whack a mole. Whenever I deal with one thing, something else comes up. COVID hit and I was forced to be alone with my thoughts. I wasn't particularly social before COVID, but I had to be. I had to go to university and socialize. I had a reason to get out of bed, get dressed and go somewhere. Then, I had no reason whatsoever. I'd get up, attend my lectures on Zoom, fall back asleep. My eating habits were horrible, I'd barely eat. I smoked a lot, a pack a day maybe. Cried myself to sleep every night. I was so unhappy with myself. 

Things started looking a little better (pandemic wise) after a few months. I had lost whatever social confidence I had within me after things went back to ""normal"". Case numbers were going down, restrictions were getting less extreme. I was able to see my friends more regularly. My friends are sort my go to, as opposed to my family. My anxiety was getting worse, though. It would spike when I'd go out, before going out, and even after going out. My panic attacks were worse. I wouldn't cry before, when I'd get a panic attack. Then, I started to cry. Barely being able to breathe + having a stuffy nose is a bad combination. I felt weak, I felt like I was a burden to anyone that I'd talk to.

It stayed that way for a while. I was depressed. I went to a psychiatrist and a therapist. Didn't feel like I was getting better. If anything, I was more bothered by the fact that I was taking medication to suppress whatever it was that was bothering me in my environment. I was not tackling the issue head on, I was merely putting on a band-aid and had managed to convince myself that things were getting better. They weren't. I stopped taking the anti-depressants.

I got diagnosed with Vitiligo shortly afterwards. It started to develop around my hands, and around my lips. A few random spots around my body. You can't really see the patches around my lips, unless you look closely. The ones on my hands are obvious. It stopped, but the dermatologist had told me that there's no way of knowing whether or not it'd get worse. No way of knowing how fast or slow it would spread. Someone who overthinks as much as I do doesn't do well with unpredictable diseases that have no cure. As you can imagine, my anxiety got worse after learning that.

Now I'm just on autopilot. I've lost control of the reigns. I'm just on the ride, seeing where it takes me. I'm slowly feeling weaker and weaker. I yearn to be alone and not feel lonely. I can't seem to get my life together. I need to start looking for a job. I need to start creating objectives. I'm just so tired all the time. I'm hopeful, still. I hope that things will get better. I'm hopeful that I'll meet a guy who'll tell me how to make a day go by. Someone to fall in love with. Be there for me, and I for him. Till then, I guess I'll see how things go.

At the start of the academic year my ex (together for 2 years) left me due to long distance complications. After spending a couple months alone to recover from the breakup, I decided to put myself back out there. I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly what I wanted yet but I knew I was ready to move on and meet new people.

Since then I‚Äôve gotten with a few guys at nightclubs but it didn‚Äôt help at all. As I haven‚Äôt been able to meet anyone on my uni course, I tried online dating for a while and met this guy (21M) who honestly was my type on paper. We really hit it off online and had so much in common. We‚Äôd be on the phone talking until 3am every night and I was so excited to finally meet him in person. But then he changed the subject of our conversations to sex - at first I was okay with this and enjoyed talking about it, but it became all he ever talked about. For our first date we just had sex and that was it, it wasn‚Äôt really much of a date at all really. I‚Äôm just so embarrassed - I really saw a proper relationship with him but after that it was clear that he only wanted a fwb situation, which just broke me. I was foolish enough to think he‚Äôd actually be interested in me as a person. I guess it‚Äôs my fault for catching feelings too soon.

Even though we were only talking for 2 months, cutting him off hit almost as hard as the breakup. I don‚Äôt see him anymore of course, but I‚Äôm just finding it so difficult to meet anyone that I feel that connection with.

1116,Luca_02-59,1629759828,1,"As I catch myself staring up towards the cold, bright circle shining in the dark my thoughts flicker. 
Happy memories almost forgotten, sad memories pushed aside. 
Strong feelings resurfacing just to quickly be forced down again.
The heat from my last cigarette starts to burn me laying between my cold fingers, only for it to burn out seconds later. 
The smoke clouding my vision briefly, then disappearing. 

Everything is in slow motion, and quiet.
Every breath. Every feeling. Every thought. 
It's still. Easy to read, easy to understand. 

The moment the cigarette hits the ground I stomp on it, grind it down and keep grinding it between my foot and the grass.
Feeling the dirt, the rocks and the sticks slowly chewing away at my foot.
Feeling my knees hit the ground and my forehead soon after. 

Blurry vision, blurry thoughts. 
Not like a minute ago. Why dit it change?
Why did chaos erupt?
More pictures than I can register, more sentences than I can listen to.
Beautiful smiles, meaningful touch, embarrassing blushing, brothers laugh, warm thuth, comedy.. family. 

Slow and steady again, but stuck instead.
Family. Love, blood, loyalty, friendship. 
Shit it's getting hard. And I'm stuck.
Family.
Chaos. Just let it. LET IT.
I can't. I must, but I can't. I will, but I won't.
Do I want to? No? Well yes, but actually no. You
know? 

I'm sorry man, I just can't. 
I know I promised and I'm sorry for breaking it.
But I tried, even when I was sure I couldn't anymore. I kept going, for you man. But there's a limit, you know that.

Greetings, shitheads. 

I'll try to keep this to the point by spouting some random shit about me and from there you can decide if you wanna jump on board. Deal?¬† (23f)

-long term is not a requirement,¬† though not opposed. I've always been more of a ""fuck it, go with the flow"" type. 

-Dark and sarcastic humor welcome- I've been told I'm somewhat of an acquired taste. You might dig it, ya might not. 

-I have a bit of a sailors mouth, one of my many character flaws. If that offends your sensibilities there is a good chance you'll detest me. 

-super into true crime, you can find me on YouTube a good bit listening to people talk about murder. I'm more so interested in the psychology of the macabre side of things. Super fascinating to me. 

- Which leads into movies. Horror is my preferred genre, love old horror. Can't go wrong with a good slasher. But my taste isn't completely limited to horror of course. 

-Honestly¬† usually prefer movies/documentaries/podcasts over tv shows but some shows I enjoy are:
Shameless, Euphoria, AHS, The Simpson's, House, Happy, Rick and Morty, Solar Opposites, South Park. I'm not into anime. Don't burn me at the stake. 

- Music. Phew. If I listed all of that we would be here all night but here is just a few: Ozzy, Dio, Danzing, Metallica, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Johnny Cash, Tame Impala, MGMT, Megadeth, Korn, Alice in Chains, Mad Season, Soundgarden, Disturbed, Santos and Johnny, Pearl Jam It is never ending- 

- I like to listen to people word vomit, I would say I'm a better listener than I am a talker but I am working on that. 

Some more random outta pocket factoids: 

-I am left handed. 

-I'm an aquarius for all you astrology bitches out there, take that for what you will. 

- I am far from graceful, more like the type of broad that trips on air. 

- I'm an INFP¬† not sure if that matters either but why not throw it out. 

-420 friendly. - Have also dabbled in other things in my life so no judgement here on anything drug culture related. 

- I smoke cigarettes, do I know it is gross and unhealthy? Yeah. Do I really care at this point in time? That's a negative, ghost rider. 

-If you have a dick, that's great- I'm happy for you. But please refrain from sending unsolicited pics of your millimeter Peter. I know your proud, and wanna show it off but I digress. 

-I have a dog. (If you can guess what kind of dog, you get a gold star.)

Come find out if I'm your cup of tea- if you don't like tea, come find out if I'm your drink of choice. Besides coffee. Cause fuck coffee.

I still mostly freeze up when someone does something as little as a little insult, or say my name without knowing what they're going to say next. I feel so superficial around the  people that I can say I'm comfortable with, I have different types of tones when I talked to people and it's not consistent. In most group I mostly speak in slang, in others I speak formal, and I don't say anything of value, I just respond. I hate it so much, I wish I could be me right now and not have to worry about bullshit like it's life threatening when it's not, but I'm not in that point yet. Alright so that was just the background, now here's the actual context of the title. I was in the last class I had to attend today, and we were doing an assignment, and I was answering some of the teacher's questions while my group was listening, I spoke in the way I always wanted to speak in, and afterwards one of the girls in that group said ""You have an amazing voice, you should do ASMR"" the two others agreed and they were joking about how they wanted to manage my career, this was literally the only time I talked to them today, there were some topics I wanted to jump on but saw no openings, but either way I feel a little bit more comfortable around them now. And a little confidence as well, because my voice is my least favorite part about me, but apparently people like it.

1126,jayantpagadala,1629756786,1,"I am 25M and now I am in a stage of life where I feeling totally unsupported emotionally and mentally, let me tell you the background on how I arrived to this feeling - I left my Job today and I had a terrible breakup earlier this month both fell apart after completing 2 years on the exact same day they started in my life. I don't know if I wanna put it as a coincidence or the universe is trying to save me from toxicity from both of them. 

I mean I have to be honest I kind of lost my mental peace performing both the tasks gradually with time. And now I don't know who I am really at this point in time. So the reason i am putting this here is that, I am a greatly introverted person and I tried to perform tasks that is easy for most extroverted persons. Being in a long distance relationship with your partner being an heavy extroverted person and being a lawyer. Both these are easy to handle if you're an easy going person in the world, persons who are shy or who don't express themselves find it difficult, I hope i am making sense of what i am saying. 

Anyways, the way I am feeling this is cause I am rn in a feeling that you lost you're most favourite person who was your mental support (forget about they're having the best times in their lives without you and I being here sad and depressed) and the sense of financial security when you have a job.

1141,idk_wtf_im_doing19,1629749039,1,"Hey, I don't really think anyone will actually read this but here's my story.

I have always felt different from people around me. I grew up in a small town where I was the only kid that had a special needs sibling, I resented my sister for the most part of my childhood when it was actually my mom that didn't take me seriously when I told her I was bullied in elementary school because of my sister. My mom told me to just be normal and fit in, which made me resent every little thing about me that was individual. 
When I got older I didn't go to school with anyone from my hometown anymore. I struggled a lot between feeling like I have an opinion on things and that I have things to say, and better not be too individual because people might not like me. 

High school me was an emotional wreck, who hated being around most people. I hated being around my overworked annoyed but actually lovely dad, my by the time severely alcoholic, narcissistic mom and my disabled sister whom I had to take care of most of the time. 
I hated school because I wasn't part of any group and never invited to anything. 
The guy I loved was dating a friend of mine, the girl I loved had too much of my depressed annoying existence 
and the few friends I had were extreme introverts who needed so much convincing for the smallest stuff that it wasn't fun in the end. 

I thought life would get better when I made some money and moved away. It did for a short second. I was euphoric moving away to study, finally the chance of starting over, meeting new people, going to parties like others my age, maybe even finally a first boyfriend at 18. NOPE HERE COMES COVID. 
I spent my whole time away in a small apartment, alone studying on my laptop. 

So now I live near my parents and old friends again, for a part of my studying that takes part near, my old home.
 Clubs are opening again, bars are opening again and I still don't have a friend group or a boyfriend to go with. My few friends don't want to go, don't have time or have social issues. 

I know that others have it a lot worse, but today I really missed High School, because I felt so alone and unappreciated. I actually put one of my High school outfits on and only by looking in the mirror remembered what an awful time it actually was. 

I just want to be loved once. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I just want to be around people that make spending time with me and having fun a priority. 

The rest of adult life is actually going pretty well, I make enough money to provide for myself, I have to study a lot but I do succeed academically. I know  all of that will one day maybe buy me a house or a car but not a loving boyfriend/husband.

I even consider sperm donation to have children in the future because I'm sure I want kids one day, but can't imagine being loved by someone who would want kids or even a relationship with me. 

It's not because I'm ugly, I am pretty average looking I guess it's just that I don't have a personality I think. And the fact that I don't know how to talk to when I go out 2 times a year, with friends that are even worse than me in social settings.  

Some guys did want to f*** me though but didn't want a relationship, which I tried but it just made me feel even less appreciated and more unlovable than I already felt.",lonely,I just feel like I'm always gonna be alone,2021-08-24 06:03:59

And girls must feel like shit when they can't trust anyone because it's like oh shit are they just trying to get with me?

I'm a lad and I have done this before, and at he time i saw nothing wrong with it but fucking hell it annoys me so much now that I've had time to mature.

I genuinely just want to see 1 fucking movie where the straight male and female duo dont end up together and just stay as friends.


platonic relationships are a thing and whilst we shouldn't feel bad about falling for our friends, when it's literally all of them we just end up being more lonely.

1163,codecrunchie,1629742048,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

Now I left her because I didn't love her as much as she loved me (and more specific reasons I will not deepen). I am realizing how little time I spend with friends, how, except some messages here and there just to say hi, nobody ask me out. In whatsapp groups, when I take the initiative, I usually obtain nothing, and I have to wait and hope that someone organizes something.

I had a positive r√©alisation today. 

I have been working on myself de past couple years, improving in many ways, small and major improvement.

But my desire for a partner and having my own family and the fact that it's not going to happen anytime soon often saddens me. And I was just on auto pilot for years doing the only thing I had control of, improving myself.

And after said years and improvements I realized, I'm 80% done with my life. I am so close to be 'successful' in life. 

I have a decent paid job, a decent degree with real opportunities in the future, I have gone bald but I'm still decent looking, I gained 2kg of muscle, the thought of giving up the gym is non-existent.

All I need (and desperately want) is but one thing. My family. I already have everything else.

So if you're like me and you have no other choice but to wait that a potential partner miraculously show up, and you're actively improving yourself. It's worth it. 

Your future partner is just the cherry on top of the cake. Work on that 'cake' (you) and make it sweet and delicious!

It's hard I know, demands an iron will. But y'all here are warriors on the battlefield of loneliness. Desperately trying to survive, and you will.

With time the self improvement attitude will just be second nature and you will basically do that on autopilot.

Also sorry if it's kinda long.

I honestly hate how lonely I've become its so terrible. I mean I have friends but over the years it has become a bit harder to plan stuff especially with most of us separated now by state lines and in some cases whole countries. Two of my friends who live closest to me don't even really talk to me that much and only really hang out together. I mean not than anyone else ever really messages me anyway. I almost always have to be the first to message anyone and no one ever just checks in on me. It goes from days to whole months and quarters of years where people don't talk to me. I mean these are people I have been friends with for anywhere from 10 to 13 whole years of my existence and when we do hang out to talk it's always a good time but as of the last like 4 years it's just been constant ups and downs as far as communication goes. It can be a bit annoying to the point where I have kinda stopped initiating convos because it's so exhausting feeling like no one gives a shit about you or what you have to say. I mean the second they need emotional support or advice there I am but otherwise some of them even duck my texts and calls. And I dont even have a problem being there for them thats what friends do, ya know? But it's like no one ever asks how I'm doing or if I'm good. Its gotten to the point where I sometimes question I'd they care at all. Debating whether or not them saying they care even means anything. I mean am I boring? Am I not entertaining? Am I too overbearing? I know that I'm not always the best to talk to cuz Im not the best at talking but we tend to have pretty good times when we do hang. Some of us even went on a little vacation together and I thought we had kinda bonded and yet here we are and it's like no ones talking to me again. I mean have I been wasting my time all these years hanging on to people who couldn't give less of a shit about me? I genuinely just feel so fucking drained at this point and I don't know what to do. Is it me? Am I overreacting? I mean I literally live 2 to 15 minutes from some of these people and whenever I do try to do something or instigate conversation it's all ""we should hang out more"" and I agree but then nothing comes of it when I try and it's like I live so close we could literally just chill but it never actually happens because they never actually go through with it.

This isn‚Äôt the stereotypical slow down as the relationship ages. I still think she is hot and beautiful but it appears to be one-sided. 

My wife has basically stopped being intimate with me. We still very occasionally have sex, but it is becoming less and less and when it does happen it is basically just about getting off. There is no intimacy, connection, or foreplay. Do the deed and be done. 

This is very difficult for me and my self esteem is non-existent at this point. It is crushing to hit on and flirt with your spouse, only for it to go unacknowledged and be rejected. I am in better shape now than when we got married but I actively cover up and try not let her see me naked because it hurts less. (If she isn‚Äôt seeing me then it doesn‚Äôt feel like she had the chance to reject me). Makes sense to me anyway. 

She makes comments ‚Äúthat if I was home more‚Äù but when I am home nothing happens. She is more interested in shows or some other project.

I don't go out much. But I like to perform on a stage with huge crowd. 


The worst thing now I'm going through is this huge crush on my Boss(29). She's a psychologist who was there to help me with my studies and depression while she was teaching in the same school as I was. I had a crush on her back then and it gradually faded away


I graduated 3 years back and we were still in touch. She's such a pure soul. After these years me and her started a small virtual clinic. She'd do the professional things and I help her as her PA. It's been around 4-5 months since we've been working together and with time I gradually built up feeling for her. 


The worst part is the truth that I'll be never with her through her entire life as her companion and all I do is hug a pillow at night and imagine things that are never going to happen. (Worst things about us)


I really want god to drop a girlfriend for me from anywhere cuz all I want is unconditional affection everday, Free hugs and kisses everyday, Just to stare at her cuz I like star gazing, Someone to ask ""hey honey how was your day"", wait for her at the doorstep while she's back on her way to home and finally end the day wrapped up in her arms.

Some background, I suffer from some mental health issues (anxiety, depression) and I recently stopped taking my antidepressants and going to therapy. After I stopped taking my medication I started drinking and going out more since I was not able to drink on my medication. Recently I went out with my two close friends and got pretty drunk and I think I smoked some weed, but a lot of the night is kind of blurry. At the end of the night we were all pretty drunk/high and our guy friend asked me and my friend to do something sexual for him, she said no and he insisted and my stupid drunk ass asked her if I could do it. She really likes our guy friend and they sleep together regularly. I really wasn't thinking anything of it in that moment, wasn't thinking of anything period really.  The next day she cut me off and ended our friendship. I did not actually touch him but it was the fact that I asked her if I could, and now she says she cannot ""trust me."" I am not that kind of person and its upsetting that she is holding me this accountable for something I did pretty intoxicated. She still hangs out with our guy friend on a daily basis and in no way holds him accountable. I have been very upset because she was really my only friend. I have others but because I invested so much in this friendship I kind of put the rest on the back-burner. I have tried to tell myself that this was for the best, because before hanging out with them my life was going pretty well, I have a great job and my career has started and I am constantly growing and progressing. This weekend brought me back to when I had an issue with drinking, and all of the times I had gotten too drunk and ruined friendships or made people uncomfortable. I realize I have not acted this way since I quit drinking two years ago due to a pretty traumatic event. In addition to this I struggle romantically due to some pretty impressive abandonment issues. It feels like I will be alone forever and will never have any real or solid friendships/relationships again. I feel a lot better after writing this.

My roommates just moved in and are mostly from India. They invited me to a party last night with their friends. I uncharacteristically accepted the invitation and went with them.

At the party they introduced me to their other friends. All of them were very kind to me and showed me a lot of attention. Even the girls there. One girl in particular actually talked to me quite a bit and even told me she thought I was cute.

When I got home I couldn't stop thinking about the event and her in particular.

I cant help but feel that the reason my roommates and their friends were so kind to me is because I am a white American, and this being their first time in the country feel inclined for some reason to think well of me.

It's difficult for me to talk to them like I am just some normal American dude, when in truth I am the dictionary definition of an incel social outcast.

Hearing that girl at the party tell me I'm cute made me think that perhaps she is just ignorant.

I'm not attractive. Proof being the opinion of all my fellow Americans which I have had the pleasure of living around.

I feel like a con-artist talking to these foreign students. I cant imagine it will be long before they see that I am a strange individual, in no way representative of the typical American male.

1277,old_door_knob,1629679431,1,"Background*******


Like many others on this sub, I grew up extremely lonely. My friends consisted of people who would talk to me in class, and now they would be my coworkers. But even that was minimal. Out of desperation, I got into a relationship with someone who hurt me in so many ways yet I could never leave out of fear of being lonely again. I knew it was a bad idea from day 1, yet I couldn't bear to be alone anymore. 


5 years later, after so much trauma, I ended the relationship. It's a good thing I finally did. Yes, the loneliness was stronger than ever, but it never truly left since I was in a bad relationship. That was my 1 and only relationship with someone. 

Now*********


I finally met someone who was good for me. Literally perfect in every single way, as far as I could tell. I didn't think someone like this even existed. I went on multiple dates with this person, and it went great each time. I was genuinely happy for the first time since childhood. We connected in so many ways. I found myself to be falling for them extremely fast. Too fast, even. I knew I could get hurt, but I couldn't stop my feelings. My every thought was about them... they then informed me they had to move out of the area, and because we were still early enough in talking to each other, it was best to just end things. Of course their decision makes sense. I even agree with it. Still, my soul has been crushed. It wasn't a lack of compatibility, or anything like that. Simply unfortunate circumstances. I'm not religious, but I prayed it would somehow work out. Alas, it won't. I don't know if I'll ever meet someone as great as they were. Hopefully years from now I'll have the ability to not compare others to them. 


I cannot stop thinking about them nowadays. I know I'll get over it eventually, but they will always be ""the one that got away"".",lonely,I was so close to finding happiness,2021-08-23 10:43:51

1325,Mla003us,1629659699,1,"Warning I will be talking a little about some aspects of alcohol, vaping, and smoking weed.

I know someone recently posted something similar and their post just pushed me to want to vent. I didn‚Äôt wanna do it on their post cuz I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll really contribute. 

School has started up again after the summer holiday and since covid hasn‚Äôt been a big problem for our country we have been going to school physically since last year. I go to school everyday with a smile plastered to my face and hang out with friends, talk to girls, make jokes with random people at parties but for over a year I‚Äôm still f$kin lonely. Every night Im home barely getting any work done even though it‚Äôs the last and most important school year, listening to songs that are probably making me sadder and lying down like a fox (in a ball). Even though I have a bunch of friends i hang out with everyday it feels like I‚Äôm a character in an underfunded play, there are moments of genuine happiness, sure, but it‚Äôs definitely not a rare occurrence where I‚Äôm just pretending so I don‚Äôt have explain my feelings to others, cuz I‚Äôm pretty bad at doing that (even the school therapist can‚Äôt figure me out). 

For some context: I previously lived most of my life with barely any or terrible friends and being told I had to have a crush. So in 2017 this girl (I‚Äôll call her Bella) had joined our school and after talking a bit we became close. I had a crush on this other girl for about half a year at the time so I only saw Bella as a friend at that point but a few months after I had drifted with the other girl, I began to have feelings for Bella (around mid August 2018).  We were close and were only getting closer, I became the one she came to when she couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone else about her whatever and she became the person who was with me by day and in my dreams by night (NOT CREEPY). We had this plan for how we‚Äôd go to the same university and always be as close as we could. There was not a single doubt in my mind that I genuinely liked her and tbh if it was possible at that age I loved her bro. Everything was great even after she rejected me the first time (smh), we were still friends but after the second time I got rejected something seemed to have really struck a cord in me and I decided to end our friendship because I couldn‚Äôt take being near her without getting rly teary eyed. So one morning I stopped her on her way to morning attendance and I basically explained that I couldn‚Äôt be friends with her anymore because I was always so sad then told her I sent a message with more details about how I was feeling. And to my young mind‚Äôs surprise she was not happy and ended up crying three times that day, missing most of the classes and I was absolutely oblivious until someone had to tell me a week or so later. After that my everyday became a slipping slide of guilt and bad decisions. We became friends again a month later but we‚Äôd never be the same. From mid 2019 to late 2020 I was desperate to stop feeling so guilty and to move on so I did anything my dumbass could think of, mainly (I rly regret this) having several rebound relationships. 

I had that crush till December 2020 when my close friend and her started dating. I was going to give it my last shot but ended up not because I realized this would be my chance to get over her and be supportive of my friend at the same time. Everyone who knew about my crush on her thought I had stopped liking her a year prior so my friend wasn‚Äôt being uncaring towards me (he has every right to go after anyone available even if I like them or not). After they became official, I did get over her but something seemed off. Everyday Id go to school and hang out with friends but i didn‚Äôt feel like as happy as I‚Äôd normally be with them, nothing seemed to make me as happy as it‚Äôd usually make me. I began to compensate for that by acting like my normal self but as the months went by and acting became harder and harder I just started kinda blowing up every few nights without any warning (like I‚Äôm doing now). I always tended to bottle up emotions and have everything explode at once but it never tended to be so often and so back to back. It‚Äôs making me so tired and sad all the time, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm living under the person I normally am until I‚Äôm alone by myself, which is when I should be working or studying but instead I‚Äôm decomposing on my bed. It‚Äôs overwhelmed me enough that instead of just not getting any sleep, I‚Äôd steal a bottle of soju from my parents stash for when they wanna get into a Korean mood at dinner and walk by the beach drinking the whole bottle. The mixture of the sound of waves, fishermen bringing in their catches to the market early in the morning, the twinkling stars and the feeling you get when you‚Äôre drunk just makes me forget about anything bad or at least makes it tolerable. I‚Äôve also begun to use vaping and smoking weed as a secondary way to escape and forget about all the guilt and loneliness. 

Right now I‚Äôm just trying to find someone I can genuinely like like I liked her or just someone I can be open about my feelings with because maybe that gives me the drive it once did. Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel as lonely with someone by my side. I mean I have a best friend I‚Äôve had since I was little and she is currently the biggest reason I haven‚Äôt dipped any lower than I have but she is so busy with school like I should be and we don‚Äôt even go to the same school or live near each other. I‚Äôve tried opening up to some people through text because it‚Äôs always too hard in person but honestly it‚Äôs not the same. Maybe I miss being held by someone or just knowing I have someone I can go to and when I open up to them they‚Äôre not pitying me or immediately trying to fix me but just being there proud that I could open up to them. Maybe I‚Äôm a blind optimistic idealistic romantic or something or other but man I miss when I didn‚Äôt feel lonely.

That was a lot of text and I‚Äôm not even sure I got through everything or made any sense but it took me close to 2 hours to write because of the emotions it brought up and if u made it through I just want to say thanks for reading my vent.

Never have posted on this subreddit before but have sometimes posted to makenewfriends or r4r hoping to find any kind of connection.

I just wanted to give a little rant if that's okay with everyone. 

To give some context I'm a 26 year old guy from MN and am just having the worst time trying to find connections. I feel like with the shift in technology over the last few years and covid have just made it near impossible to find people to talk with and more importantly connect with.

Everyone is either staying home or just sticking to apps and such and it just makes it that much harder to find people. I don't want to necessarily have to use an app but here I am lol. They really need something like tinder for friends. I know they have bumble BFF which is cool. But it's not necessarily for me. I think it's a little ridiculous to only consider guys friends and never women. I mean. I get it. It's because most of the time, guys don't necessarily just want platonic relationships and can make things real uncomfortable for those who are only looking for friends.

I just feel like it's so important to have people that you can talk to about what's going on in life. People to cheer you on and help you work through issues. I mean we need that kind of connection as humans. 

Anyways I don't necessarily know the whole point of this but I figured if it helps me get a little off of my chest.. then hey it's good right?",lonely,Mid-Twenties.. is it impossible to make friends?,2021-08-23 05:09:41
1329,TinyPinkPumpkin,1629657468,1,"Hello.  


For starters, I don't really expect much to come of this post, if anything at all.   
But, I'm trying. That's what count, right..?  


Anyway, this is my attempt at reaching out...   


So, to give a little context, I'm a girl in my early-mid twenties residing in northern Europe, I'm selectively mute, I moved out for the first time about 3 months ago, due to unfortunate past I have never graduated any form of education, I've never had a job, haven't physically hung out with a friend for about a decade.  
The only people in my life, are my parents (and their cats), and a couple online friends scattered across the globe.   


Without attending a job, education, or sport/group activity etc. the internet is currently my only place to satisfy my social needs, which has made me content for a long time, but after a decade it's starting to feel like it's not enough, when you spend every day within the same 4 walls, doing roughly the same repetitive routine that only really consists of keeping myself alive. Some days even that feels overwhelming.   


Today especially has been rough, I don't know why. I just get days like this occasionally. Constant brewing feeling of impending doom throughout the day, my thoughts reminding me of how I've wasted my time, and continue to, yet getting up to do anything useful seems so overwhelming, despite really wanting to. I'm dying to have some more eventful inputs in my days. Hell, I'm dying to even be able to speak vocally, more than I do currently. I'm dying to be able to have more genuine friends, especially within a distance that doesn't require a plane ticket to hang out in person.  


I just don't know what to do or where to start. And I feel like no one *really* listens. So I guess that's why I am writing this, so that *someone* will listen. So if you made it this far, thank you.

I have given up on the dating scene but figured what do I have to lose here?! I am a trans female who has yet to get the surgery and I have found that when searching for a genuine connection with someone things go well for a few days then I never hear from them or they end up sexualizing me and who I am.

I do not wish to be a fantasy but to be seen as the woman that I am trying to show to the world.

People my age (25) and around my age seem to only want sex and although that‚Äôs not necessarily bad, I‚Äôm at a place in my life where sex isn‚Äôt the only thing I‚Äôm searching for. I want a partner, someone to grow with, learn from, laugh with and share life‚Äôs ups and downs. And I know that he is out there somewhere but I have yet to find Mr. Right

I want to hear about your day, about life, about the thoughts you‚Äôre too afraid to share with anyone else. I want to be the shoulder you cry on and the person you turn to when you just want to say hello. 

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs much to ask‚Ä¶..is it? 

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm talking to myself right now, thinking out loud, throwing a coin into the air and seeing how it would land.

May I get personal for a second? 

As a trans woman of color, I know that my options are limited but I truly believe that there is someone out there for us all. What is life if we do not have someone to share it with? 

If it is not clear by now, then I hope that you can tell that I am a hopeless romantic with a heart of gold and the day I am able to pour my love and happiness into a man who sees me for who I truly am will be the greatest day of my life.

That is all for now, but I want to thank you for reading this if you made it this far. May your day be filled with joy and search for love results in the purest form of happiness.

1357,DazeddandConfused,1629636469,1,"I‚Äôm approaching the end of my 20s and I don‚Äôt have many meaningful connections to show for it. 

I‚Äôm a social introvert. I engage/get along with people, but become easily drained by social scenarios because I have to keep up this fake front to get through it.

I‚Äôm getting really down about my inability to make meaningful connections. I walk away from social situations, particularly in big groups, feeling lonely and sad. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a glass panel between me and everyone else, and I can‚Äôt cross it. 

I know it‚Äôs my problem. I cancel group events last minute, either because I know I won‚Äôt enjoy them or because I get nervous about being awkward or looking fat or doing or saying something embarrassing. 

The pandemic has compounded a lot of these feelings. 

Since moving West, I‚Äôve assimilated into a crowd of really cool, fun, nice people. But they‚Äôre also quite functional, ‚Äònormal‚Äô (even vanilla) people: the type of person I model my inauthentic self on and probably wish I was. No darkness. Right now they think I‚Äôm chill and fun rather than sad and dysfunctional. They think I cancel or make little effort because I don‚Äôt care, when in reality I‚Äôm scared and ashamed.

So the pattern is: see people, hide big parts of myself, feel miserable, cancel future events, inadvertently create distance, lose opportunity to create connections.

I know what the solutions are, just venting I guess. Y‚Äôall make me feel a little more ‚Äòreal‚Äô.

The last 4 or something years I've been limiting the amount of people in life because I wasn't doing to well. I got out of a harsh relationship that pushed me face first in the ground of a big and lonely world. I did the smartest thing I can think of at the time. No relationships, set goals, and fix my ego. 

Within the last few years I've only had about 3 good friends stick from high school but as time passed they went on their way. I barely talk to one right now, but once I got out of high school my fathers health was decreasing more. Not too long later he died, I'm not gonna get into details but this I can mention. He died in our house it was just us two and I watched him and couldn't do anything. That really fucked with me horribly. I was losing touch with everything. I stopped talking to my family besides my mom, I threw my phone away because I didn't wanna deal with reality, and just bummed around for a long time. I was just constantly smoking pot, sleeping too much, quit work, got fat, grew an unhealthy obsession with porn, and just stopped functioning with everyone. 

Only until a few months ago I stopped and I hit the gym, trying to fix my sleeping schedule, gonna get to work, try to get into college (tbh I'm way too late but zero fucks given) and socialize. But I've noticed that socializing sucks now I can barely get anyone to talk to me over on Reddit or anywhere else for that matter. So many people around the internet sound desperate for friendship and etc but just ignore me..? I'm sorry but why do people do that it hurts that so many people can be deceitful. I just want some friendship or company no need to ignore me, just explain you don't want to be bothered.

1372,Majestic-Crow-8061,1629623968,1,"I was a 14 years old boy with low self-esteem and he was an absolute angel (15), like when you see someone and they're so beautiful that you try to find some sort of 'flaw' just to end up giving up on that. He seemed so confident and above me; so, after a few minutes of staring at him for long periods of time, my best friend at that time went over and asked him his insta, both of us started following and kind of stalking him in a good way.
So... One day I started liking all of his pictures and just a few minutes later, I started receiving likes from him on mine. I remembering being at school and at the verge of blowing up.
We started talking and he told me two things: that he was high because of a friend of his... And that we should meet some day; that day turned out to be in the next weekend. By the day we accorded to meet my best friend already knew the way that he made me feel, so she sent me to pick up another friend while she stayed and talked with him. Turned out that he also had feelings for me :3
We were planning on partying in a department btw. 
So, I didn't actually dared to go and talk to him until we arrived at the said apartment, where he was lying down on a king sized bed and, you guessed it, I led next to him facing him (I'm sorry if this is awkward but I remember all of it, it felt so beautiful and true :p), i still remember that angle: his nose, lips, eyes form made him just look SYMMETRICAL=perfect lol. 
We kissed, like those long and very expected kisses... I must also add that that night he went to sleep to my house, you know I guess.
After that we started hanging out and making out more and more often until we said those three words: 'I love you' (we had already talked about us liking each other). 
We made it official in new year: 1st of January, 2019.

One day, he said he couldn't assist to a birthday where we were supposed to go together, so I didn't go either, I was feeling kind of down. The next day I found out that he did actually go, thanks to a couple of insta stories where he was lying on a sofa making the same eye contact we did with someone else. Also, people told me about what happened. 
You might be wondering why I did such a long introduction just to end up saying he kissed someone else: I wanted you guys to understand why I forgave him and just forgot about what happened (not talked about it), i simply though that an opportunity like that could never happen again to me...
The 13th of February happened something similar, I went to the department where we kissed for the first time (it started being a place where our group of friends would hang out very time) to surprise him and do something the night before valentine's day. But... he went to a birthday yet again. Anyways, everything's great, we went and had breakfast thanks to some money that my parents gave me, cause I told them I was going to hang out with a girl.
A few months later, I'm told that he had kissed a girl this time. When it happened I had a panick attack. I didn't want to see him. But the only thing that revolved on my mind was why: I felt like I wasn't as slim as the guy from the first time, or didn't have the body of a woman basically. The feeling of not being enough plus him begging me to forgive him surpassed me.
After that, we started a viscious circle, where we'd break up and get back together. I started loosing friends and contact with people. Today I'm still in the same relationship, or at least we talk very often. It's just that whenever I'm alone I feel trapped with myself, I don't want to have to think about my life and the things that I've lived. I'm getting really depressed lol. 
Anyways, I was trying to let some feelings out, three years later, I still feel I'm not as slim as that guy, or as sexy as that girl. Idk it's probably the age.

1391,teenonasaturdaynight,1629610513,1,"so, last year I am not clinically diagnosed but I believe I have been suffering from depression and I was also burnt out and I just didn't want to do anything so I ended up doing poorly in an exam last year

Now this year, I get to write the exam again but even with the enough time I had, I am still not prepared, honestly I feel like last year I did something at the last minute and also since before the pandemic I was attending classes normally I had at least a little memory of what I've been taught but this year since it was only online classes I barely focused and now I don't even remember what I have learnt before. This exam I am going to write has two years worth of studies to put into paper so I am doomed. I'm not sure if I am not interested or if I am still depressed or if I am just lazy.

Everyday I think about learning and keep telling to myself that I need to but when I open the book and start reading the text after a few lines I feel like the words are flying above me and I don't really understand anything even though most of it were topics that I had a understanding of before.

Anyways my parents are going to be super angry and disappointed when the results come, I kind of want to tell them my situation right now but I feel like that will lead to an angry outburst since I've been lying straight out of my teeth that I am learning when I was just actually wasting time.

It wasn't like I wasn't learning because I had something better to do or I was passionate about something. I mean I used to draw or read but I haven't done neither of those in the past year. The only thing I did was watch series after series but if you ask me to summarize them, I barely remember the storyline, in the beginning it was nice to watch but now it doesn't really give me much dopamine.

I do laugh at funny things and all but then almost always I am followed with the thought that I am faking my depression even though I literally haven't told anyone about it.

I don't know how I am going to write the exam, if it were possible I want to work with whatever time I have now but now I am just keep thinking that it is useless because I have very little time left.

Two of my old friends from high school are already married off, not even being older than 28. The guy at my work, who just turned **18**, is now in his first ever relationship... Guess that's what happens when you're tall. 

I can't tell anyone about this stuff in real life because they don't understand the struggle. I'm probably already considered weird in everyone's eyes - so why make things worse by trying to explain things to them that they have no clue about? 

I do everything I possibly can to make me feel good about myself. New haircut, contacts, new music tastes, exercise, new job - I've done nearly everything you can suggest without drinking. I'll never drink -- if it ends up being anything like my porn addiction I **know** it will 100% ruin my life. 

Either way, I make all this effort and put time into bettering myself as a person only for it to go straight down the shitter. Literally ANYONE ELSE would find success in doing these things. They'd at least be noticed for their efforts.. Not me, though.

Most people have their first relationships in high school. Not me, though.

1411,thatonesnlguy,1629601859,1,"This is hard for me to type out but I‚Äôm going to do it. This has been the worst year of my life. Let me give some backstory: I‚Äôm currently  and before the pandemic, I was doing really well. For the first time in my academic life, I had finished a semester with nothing lower than a B+. I had a 3.9 GPA and was planning to graduate early to go to my dream college. Even they had already made it clear they wanted me. Outside of school, I was doing comedy in Chicago for about a year and was successful for my age and time I had been doing it. I was writing for shows, training at some renowned theaters, and doing standup. I had won a local standup contest and the next part of it was to travel to NYC to challenge against other winners from other cities (LA, Toronto, Atlanta, etc.) at a very prestigious comedy club. While my private life was still somewhat lonely, and my relationship with my family (most of all, my father) was awful, I didn‚Äôt mind considering at where my life was. I was extremely proud and looking for future opportunities.

Then the pandemic hit. Everything around &amp; me, literally, physically, emotionally, mentally, shut down. The clubs I had performed at and introduced me to then-peers of mine shut down, some permanently. The contest that was to advance my career said that they were canceling it forever and that what was to become of it. The few friends I had left slowly began to shut me out and I had no one else. Now stuck at home with my family, I was subjected to each family member‚Äôs berating of me. When I lost all hope in myself, my senior year started at the worst time of my life. Still scheduled to graduate early, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to work at school. Meanwhile during all of this, my dad went ahead and put in an application for me at a store without my permission, and they called me saying I got a job. No interview, nothing. Now with the very little energy I had all going to my job, I had put away school and failed a class. I would not be going to college early. I wouldn‚Äôt even be going to college at all. Every school I applied to rejected me because of that last semester. I had to go back another semester to retake my class after telling everyone I was graduating early. I eventually did graduate that semester but with no plan afterwards. I quit my job in June because it was becoming too much work and I was the only one eventually showing up to work at all. This whole summer, I have been contemplating whether anything in my life is worth it. Everything I earned has been taken away from me. Everyone I loved and trusted slowly left me to rot alone. No love or positivity by the people in my family was thrown my way, even after taking care of them during that time. One question that‚Äôs been racing in my mind for three months is: if I were to hurt myself right now, what would I have to lose? I don‚Äôt have a career anymore. My peers in the business either moved away or stopped talking to me. I don‚Äôt have a college to go to where I can meet people. I couldn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúhello‚Äù from someone my age if I tried. Anything positive in my life is gone, all gone. If a car were to hit me right now, what would be the point to survive? For who? For what? 

After a year of my life crumbling to the ground, like a forgotten building whose structure is deteriorating, a tiny spot has possibly opened up. A new comedy club in a local town is opening and I‚Äôm contemplating whether I should apply there for any type of job. On one hand, I could possibly work my way up and maybe even work there as a featured comic. The headliners they have booked so far are not just midwestern comedians, but also rising ones who are doing really well for themselves. I could eventually work myself up to better clubs and maybe headline a few clubs. Or possibly find a more successful comic I work well with and maybe open for them. On the other hand, I may never get far and I‚Äôll be stuck being a busboy forever. Or I won‚Äôt get far in this dream of mine and I‚Äôll never be as successful as I want to be. I also believe I‚Äôm not as funny as I was and I‚Äôll constantly fail again and again and again. I don‚Äôt believe in myself enough to think that I deserve any type of success, big or small. And the few people who say they believe in me, come off as just lying to my face. In fact, anyone who has ever given me any type of compliment in my life I believe was lying and were saying it just to be nice to someone who seemed so clearly down and out. I especially feel that if they were telling the truth, it would just be because they want me to have a job and don‚Äôt care about my dream.

I see what it‚Äôs like being an adult. And it‚Äôs so fucking hard. From the time we are young, we are constantly told by our elders that ‚Äúif we work really hard in life, great things will happen to us.‚Äù What they fail to tell are the stories of those who did try hard to achieve what they wanted in life, but were failed. Failed by the society that lied to them and said everything was going to be ok. No one‚Äôs ever going to want me. No one‚Äôs ever going to want to be my friend. I‚Äôm too fat, too tall, my feet are huge, my hair sucks, my glasses make me look more creepy than attractive, I‚Äôve got acne all over my body, I‚Äôm clumsy, stupid, weird, and basically anything that fits with that description of me. I don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to me in life, but I can‚Äôt help but think that I deserve it. While I want to see my dream succeed, the more likely outcome I see is me begging for money on the side of the road. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust the people around me, as well as myself, to jump into something as simple as a job, and become a robot in this society. My whole life, I‚Äôve tried to treat people with respect, to hope that in return, I‚Äôd receive it as well. Sadly, you don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt help but feel extremely sorry for my family, who put thousands of money and time and care into me for 18 years, for someone they probably didn‚Äôt want, all for that thing to doubt everyone and everything and practically give up. I understand their anger, stress, confusion, madness now. 

I don‚Äôt expect anybody to look at or even reply to this. I just needed to write down how I‚Äôve felt this past year.

I beg you to skip if you will be effected by this l, and stay safe ‚ù§



Edit: I'm sorry for the wall of text, I went on an insane rant lmao, I guess I had more on my chest then I realised



Hey I'm Pete, I'm 22 and for the last 7 years I've been depressed asf. I also want to add that I'm really bad at reddit so idk what the correct way of saying any of this is so bare with my shit explanations, thank you ‚ù§

So idk where to start. Last year was pretty decent for me tbh , I had a thriving job that i love (which I'm still at) a girlfriend who I was scared to get attached to so she ended up leaving, and I don't blame her for it. And over the past few months I have been planning to game over myself. (Sorry for the terrible jokes, I'm not making fun of anyone I really just don't like being serious and making people feel weird so I just try to defuse the tension)

I used to get a weird rush of happiness when I was planning the way I would die, because it finally felt like i was in control i guess? 

The reason I think death is the way out is because I wake up to my job which I love but I don't feel happy about waking up at all anymore. I dont really feel like ""oh I can't be arsed to get up"" it's more ""another day"" I also wake up feeling tired... I know who does that right? Crazy.

But seriously I never woke up tired before, I always get a solid amount of sleep and I'm just constantly tired. I wake up tired, I have breakfast I'm tired, I drink my tea I'm tired, I get on my computer to work im tired, 14 hours later I'm still tired its seriously getting so fucking hard to get through the day without just lying down on my bed for 20 minutes every hour. 

I used to get such a rush from coding, and now it just seems so ""boring"" I guess? Like in my heart I want to code all day like I did a couple years back but I just can't do it. I used to love movies and TV shows and now I can watch a TV how one minute and be fine, but randomly through and episode I'll just be like ""I dont care about the plot"" it's not because I dont it's just because I feel like I dont have the spare ""resources"" in my body to actually give a fuck you know?

I'm sorry for my language but it really does annoy me to the fullest.

I speak to my doctor monthly and used to talk to a therapist but in the most polite ways she was useless. I've gone up tablets after tablets from my doctor for the past year and a half I think? And I'm just like surely I should be better now? But I'm just so useless I can't even allow myself to be happy

Like fucking hell I used to have a mate, I'll just call them pop.

Me and pop clicked like we knew each other for YEARS when we met and there was an instant connection, I started feeling things for pop and they did to me too. But the distance along with me saying I couldn't be friends with someone if we dated and broke up just made it a bad idea in general. 

(I know I might get shit for that, but please understand that i really do that for the best of both people not just myself. I'm too immature and emotional to be able to just be friends with someone after that love and connection)

So we just continued being friends, which was amazing. And one day out of the blue I decided that I seriously wanted to die but I didn't want to hurt pop. So I pushed pop out of my life forcefully, I'm sure they still hate me for it. I did it to protect them against me and my actions, I'd rather them hate me, never look back and move on then wonder why they couldn't help me after I'm gone.

I miss pop so much, as well as my.other mates who I did the same thing too. Socially I really am a lovely person, but on those bad mental days where my brain wants me dead all I try to do is save everyone around me. Because I care about them more than myself by a mile.

Also since I'm ranting and I doubt anyone will make I this far (and if you do I wanna say umm... you're really handsome / pretty ‚ù§) but I am a virgin at 22. Now technically I'm not, and WARNING YET AGAIN I'm gonna be talking about ABUSE, so if you can't handle it please leave now.


But when I was a young boy I was raped by a neigbour and his son used to touch my dick. In a technical stance I'm not exactly a virgin  but, I'm really not letting the pedo version of the Adam's family take something away from me that only I can give to someone so in my mind I'm still a virgin.

I've been on tinder and got some matches and even a few offers for being a friend with benefits but in my stupid mind I want to give it to someone I care about deeply... the right person, I just want to let them know how much they mean to me in that weird way... a lifetime memory (from 15 seconds of fun #Speedrun) but seriously I know I shouldn't feel ashamed but I also know its NOT going to happen.

That's not me being self doubtful, it's just I dont go out. So unless the adverts for sexy Russian singles in my area are real I'll never meet anyone to be able to make that connection up to that point. I will die a virgin, which I am ashamed of in a way.

However i know it's my fault for being a lil pussy boi who's too scared to go outside lmao.


Anyway I'll shut up now, if you made it this far I will give you a hug (provided you want it of course) and lastly just thank you for reading this. Even if you dont comment just thank you for taking the time out of your day and spending it reading about me

I‚Äôd been with my ex (23M) for 3 years and had been contemplating leaving well before we hit the 3rd year mark in summer 2020. We met on a dating app and before then I‚Äôd never had a boyfriend, not throughout elementary, middle or high school. For the longest time I was scared to leave him because I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt find anyone else and being single for almost a year now kinda solidified what I thought all along. 

That I‚Äôm not worthy of a relationship and there‚Äôs something wrong with me because I can‚Äôt find anyone. I did hit it off with someone a few months ago but we ended up being incompatible in the long run so it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm just upset because it seems like everyone around me has someone. Out of my there best friends, ones been with her husband since they were like 14/15 so she doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to experience being alone, my other friend has been with her boyfriend for 3 years now and even before then she didn‚Äôt go through a period of being alone because she basically chose between him and another guy she‚Äôd been dealing with for a while before him but they weren‚Äôt official. 

And my third best friend who I‚Äôve known for almost a year now is single as well but she has a rotation of guys which isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm opposed to but I just don‚Äôt know where to meet them in the first place. Half the time there‚Äôs an inconvenience too like they don‚Äôt have their own place or something of the sort. I just don‚Äôt have any luck with guys in real life and it‚Äôs so frustrating because no one understands what it‚Äôs like to feel so out place. 

I don‚Äôt know of a single girl my age who‚Äôs as lonely as I am. Not saying it hurts any less but I definitely feel like it‚Äôs more common for guys to go without a connection/sex for an extended period of time.

1476,GolAccio7,1629583261,2,"I've just been reflecting on my life recently, when people see me , I feel like they don't see the real man that I am. My childhood was tough, I grew up in a poor part of northern England but I think I did alright despite all the bullying and beatings. I finished school, got my degree, at 21 I met an incredibly beautiful girl and started what still is the best relationship I ever, she was petit, blonde, had a fiesty personality and I felt like I became a better man.  I wasn't worried about money or having a decent career, i had her and we both worked low paying jobs, made ends meet and life was never dull.

As with any relationship when you're young, people change and eventually that relationship ended.  I had a few tough years, came down with depression once more and after a few crap jobs, bad dates, things just became a blur.  Around 30 I sorted myself out, I found an actual career, a job that I enjoyed and I was happier. I didn't have any proper friends, but at least I was getting out of bed each morning with purpose. In the early 2010s we also saw dating apps appearing, I didn't really have any friends to go to pubs and bars with so I did the whole app thing, and it was a huge hit to my self esteem. But even then just because of the fact that I was out and about everyday , I ended up dating a girl who worked in our local Tesco, I gave her my number in person after weeks of bumping into her, and it was romantic

And then depression kicked in once more which led to that relationship ending.  But I got help, went back on citalopram, carried on working, I got promoted and I've got a decent job now. I have used apps like Tinder but honestly being on Tinder in your late 30s is a car wreck, I'm not an incel and I have female colleagues in their 40s who say the same, about most of their matches being awful, it's nothing like being single in your 20s.  Coupled with my lack of friends to go to bars with , the pandemic , which meant our office closed and I'm working from home permanently, it's resulted in apps being the only option for a guy like me to meet someone. It's cripplingly lonely most of the week, I mean I do speak to work colleagues but it's all online, I put on a facade of confidence and I pretend to be happy but it's all fake, and I'm going entire days without seeing a single real human face. The thing is this might well be my life now until I retire, so I'm looking at another 27 years or so of this

I've realised I made mistakes when I was  younger and the odds of meeting anyone decent especially now that I'm 40 and stuck at home all day are pretty much zero. Tinder makes me miserable, so I've just deleted it and haven't been on it for over 6 months, I'm not missing much as looking back I've never ever had a single decent date from Tinder. Sometimes I guess in life you can't have everything, so I've started exploring other ways of finding meaning and a bit of peace. During lockdown I read an incredible number of books, watched movies that I'd missed out on (Watched Back to the Future for the first time at the age of 39!!) , I began to look into Buddhism and spirituality. I do take care of myself a bit more, I've started working out at home and I'm in good physical shape. I sometimes look at my depression and anxiety as a blessing, it's made me empathetic and I genuinely do care about the wellbeing of others so although I might never be happy at least I can make others happier

I've had suicidial thoughts over many years,  but I don't want anyone reading this to worry as I know I need to carry on and there are others going through hell and live in worse situations than I do so let's focus on them. Although I don't have kids of my own, my niece and nephew love me and I'm a role model for them, there's a 23 year old woman from work who became close friends with me and I know I'm someone she looks up to whenever she goes through a tough patch, I gotta stay alive for my mum too. I do get the feeling I'll be alone, I'm sure I'll struggle but as I guess to paraphrase Jay Z, this is not the life I chose, this is the life that chose me.",lonely,Recently turned 40 and life looks like it's going to be long and lonely,2021-08-22 08:01:01

1478,schmadolph,1629582553,2,"I read a little through this subreddit and it makes me so sad that there are so many good, worthy and amazing people feeling this lonely, feeling like they don't have anyone. Life really can be cruel but all we can do is deal with it.

I am lucky. I've always had a circle of friends I belong to. But this past week, partly because of lockdown, mainly because of something that happened recently, I've been feeling lonely. Today just feels really really lonely. It's no ones fault really. My brother spontaneously met with friends online so I cooked alone. I didn't talk to a friend all day and there is this girl I recently met and parted with (not a relationship but still affecting me) and it definitely still affects me...

And then it hit me... this empty feeling, not devestating, not immensly painful but still painful, a weird sense of longing for something, this feeling that you'd take anything you could get right now...
I felt lonely. I am not alone. I am with my family, I have pets, I'll be on vacation with my friends in a month. In fact I'll have a call with a friend tomorrow and meet my friends again next week... but I feel lonely right now.
Maybe it's gone tomorrow but this feels terrible.
Maybe that girl I recently met brought my needs for something intimate/romantic up inside of me, maybe I'm just lonely for no reason, maybe I am lacking other things I am not aware of...
But I really need someone to just share intimate thoughts with openly... I don't know why I'm scared of doing that with my friends or brother or parents. I think I really fear burdening them and also fear seeming weak and fear the ""rejection""... I fear feeling that they are closed up and fear that they'd worry about me...

If I'm being honest. I think I'm desperately and deeply longing for someone to share my deepest feelings with and to carry their burdens too. I don't even mean this in an explicitly romantic way even though in our modern society it might seem like that's implied. This genuine interest in another person, this open ""vibe"" you rarely feel with another person.

The world is such a lonely place sometimes.
I look at my parents, married for ages and I can't help but look at them and feel like they are both lonely deep down. Many of my friends, even some that are in relationships, seem so lonely and dissatisfied at times.

Isn't this just terrible? I feel like not many people experience a permanent deep bond in their life. Even many married couples seem so... not really unhappy or anything... but just as if something crucial is missing. Something both of them gave up on long ago. I am scared to end up like this, to marry someone and always have this expression on my face that something is missing. I see it in so many faces.

And then there are a few people that just make me happy looking at them. Friends of my family for example, another family, and the couple is so warm. After like 30 years of marriage. Something about them is so admirable. They don't have this face of ""loneliness"" I'm talking about and it's so beautiful to watch. There are probably more people like this than I might think... but yeah. Just needed to vent. It pains me to see lonely people and feeling lonely just hurts too.

Thank you if anyone read this. I'm feeling lonely right now anyways so hit me up on reddit if you want to talk :)",lonely,"The world seems like such a lonely place at times, it pains me to see lonely people",2021-08-22 07:49:13
1479,thataintfunkedelic,1629581707,1,"So i came alone to a beatles tribute concert at a local bar by myself, i would have brought my little sister but she doesn't like the beatles. It struck me that i tend to do this a lot, go for social outings by myself, the movies, the mall, even for a walk downtown, to get ice cream...etc. 

Everyone here is accompanied by someone, old couples, young couples and families and it feels so lonely. It feels incredibly isolating to always be alone. Like yesterday i went to this bar because they were having a harry potter trivia night but there were no seats, well there was a 1 seat but it was in the middle of a group of girls and tbh it would just been awkward for both them and me to just have a stranger sitting there. Had there been some single stools, or some people by themselves i would've maybe joined them but everyone was accompanied.

I have two friends that i hang out with, and i guess i should've asked one of them to come with me, but i also wish i had more friends to hang out with so that i didn't feel so dependent on my 2 friends.

1500,codecrunchie,1629569094,6,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

Im not even close to being a good person. Everytime I have a friend group, in time I fuck it up. I bring chaos into everything. Im not good with handling certain emotions. And a man in pain is unreliable. 

A couple months ago I blocked a friend almost out of the blue cuz I was starting to have feelings for her. I can't let that happen again. Nor can I explain anything to her. I told her not to feel bad and it wasn't personal but life isn't a disney movie so obviously she thought I didn't wanna be friends with her. I know this thru her best friend (basically a mutual friend in the situation)

She outright said she won't be around if I am. Im glad. She's the purest person I've met. Best not get too close to her and she saved me the trouble. 
The friends I have now serve purpose. Once that purpose is gone, I'll be gone too. Its best when I don't stick around.

only 2 people know this in my circle. And they both say its a bad idea. Yeah no shit lol. But at least this way people won't suffer chaos and drama lol.

1516,shriekingwindow,1629560650,2,"Hello everyone.

I thought I could manage on my own but shit has hit the roof in my mind. I am barely able to cope anymore. I will elaborately write everything about me so I can seek some help. I studied mechanical engineering for 4 years and made a decent enough resume for grad school in US and applied too and got in. Then later I realized that the major is not suitable in long term and will lead to lot of problems and cut to trying to make it in software world. Not gonna lie, the learning curve is too steep but still I am able to make progress.

Anyway so my family background is difficult to explain. My sister and mum are dyslexic(not really diagnosed as family is taboo or they did and didn't tell me), meaning both have an emotional intelligence of a 8 year old( I am being factual here and not taunting them, I really wish things were different.) My dad and grandparents are too toxic and biased and they even act irrationally. They didn't even let me take vaccine even though I had booked the slot. Mentally I feel so suffocated because I do not have a single friend at the moment. I tried too in multiple ways, reddit, discord etc but didn't work. I have irregularly gotten panic attacks and have been having suicidal ideations for the past 3-4 months. I will need therapy to explain to parents I need therapy. I have realised I maybe am suffering from ADHD too because I am not able to focus and I really have to fight my mind. I have fallen out of all my friend circles as I graduated as I genuinely realised nobody really reciprocated the efforts.

I genuinely lack a support system. People say to start a hobby to make friends but it does not seem realistic to me as most hobbies need money and I don't have money. Mentally I am just fighting to try to have a will to live. Don't get me wrong I do have a plan and I am working hard towards succeeding but somedays my mind just breaks down and I don't know what to do. Everyone wants you to be optimistic and rainbow and sunshine and the moment you are gloomy they cut you off.

I just want to focus on my studies so I can get a job so I can move out 1 day and eventually apply to USA for a masters. But right now my mental health is taking heavy tolls. I am trying to exercise too and jog regularly too but my mind just gives away in the middle. I wish I had a mom I could talk to something about all this.I feel like I have to teach myself all of this on my own. Like I am being the parent to me.

I don't know why but I just have this feeling. 2 Weeks ago I self-harmed myself and the only person I told was her last week. I feel like this is pressuring her, which is why I waited a week to even tell her. I feel guilty, but at the same time anxious. Guilty because I put that pressure on her, and anxious because well.. I'm afraid of losing her. She is the best friend I have had in over 5 years. The only one I could really ever depend on. Without her, I would be alone and lonely. Anyone would hate that. I already feel lonely IRL; she is an online friend you see. IRL well.. I have no one, and I am soon to get shunned by my family for having left their religion.

Maybe it's because I'm suicidal deep down. I haven't told her, because that would be unfair. I feel like I have already died, that I am just an empty shell that walks around everyday.

1522,vanillalilith,1629556127,4,"I think I lack something socially. When I look at the people around me they're able to become best friends with someone in a few days meanwhile I'm stuck in the casual acquaintance zone even with people I've known for years. I don't think I'm completely terrible company. I do know how to make small talk and join conversations and fill the silences but that's not enough. People don't want tolerable conversationalists. They want the funny or witty or smart ones. The ones who do it naturally. Whereas my attempts at being social are always somehow clumsy and awkward. Often my mind seems to just draw blank and the conversations stay very superficial. And it's like no one ever wants to get to know me better. Everyone always has something better to do or someone better to hang out with. I'm just an afterthought. Like ""yeah sure I guess you can come too if you want"". 

I think I tend to compensate my lack of social skills by bending over backwards for people cause that's the only way I know how to make others like me. I go out of my way to help people and to always be available when they need me but that doesn't seem to be enoguh. I guess I just lack the confidence to be the person I want to be. And don't get me wrong, I fully understad why people wouldn't like to be friends with someone like me. We all prefer and gravitate towards charismatic people. No one wants to be friends with the plain jane. There's a reason why some people are popular and some are not.

I used to blame others for not understanding me or liking me. But if other people really were the problem I think I would've met some good people after all these years. I think it has to be me that's the problem. Something about me is wrong. Something about me just repels people. Sometimes I wish I could ask someone what's wrong with me.

1531,Konkursipesa,1629544812,4,"So I went to see someone. She invited me to her place, we had fun time talking and doing puzzles. Next day she invited me there again. This time we ended up sleeping together. Not having sex or kissing or anything. Just sleeping close together in the same bed. Let me tell you, after being so incredibly lonely as I have been most of my life, I've never felt so good. We were even talking and planning on going on a trip together in a few weeks.

This is where it gets bad. Next day I'm driving home, I'm obviously feeling super good. Maybe this is finally the one. Maybe now I won't be so lonely anymore. I'm happier than I can ever remember being. When I get home, I see a message from her. She wants to cancel the trip, and thinks we better just stay as friends because she isn't feeling ""the spark"" with me.

Let me tell you, I've felt many types of pain in my life. Both physical and mental. But I don't think anything hurt as much as this did. It was absolutely soul crushing. I cannot even describe how much it hurts. It's not just the fact that I was rejected. It's happened to me before, big deal. It's the fact that it happens right at the moment of my peak hope and happiness.

I obviously don't blame her for it. You can't force yourself to like someone. And there are plenty of things about me to not like. It's just that it came completely out of the blue because I thought she felt the same about me as I felt about her. Previous night she even did things like changing her contact name on my phone to [Her name]‚ù§Ô∏è and kept getting closer to me through the night. I thought we were going somewhere. I felt closeness I've never felt before. 

I've not cried properly for years, but that really made the floodgates open. I've cried so much since then. And the rational part of my head knows I'm just as lonely now as I was, say two weeks ago, but right now it feels **so** much worse. I think something in me snapped yesterday and I'm not sure it's possible for me to live like this anymore. I tried to take a knife and see how much it would hurt, but it turns out I was too afraid of the pain. For now at least.

1546,SmattyB,1629534044,7,"So, I'm going against what feels like every cell in my body telling me not to post this. 

Hello.  I'm a 36 year old male. (It feels uncomfortable mentioning that, not sure why, but more uncomfortable if I didn't mention it.) Well with that awkwardness out of the way...

I have always been kind and respectful to everyone I meet.  I try to always be courteous, thoughtfulI, and considerate of others.  I really like to help people if I can.  I don't intrude on people's lives. I try to stay mindful of others feelings.  I like to see people happy. I try to remain nonjudgmental and to keep an open mind.  I think I'm a good guy.  I have many flaws for sure but I am a nice guy.

I have no family or friends. Nope not a single friend. Not one. It's been years since I called someone friend. It sucks. Sometimes I wish I had a friend, or friends to talk to. Just send or maybe even receive a friendly text checking in.  Learn about something interesting, ask questions, bounce ideas off, share funny stories, tell jokes etc.  Just regular stuff I guess?  Sure I'd like to have someone to go to a concert with or whatever but one step at a time‚ò∫Ô∏è I also know that being a real friend means sticking around when life isn't all smiles. It means being a shoulder to cry on if needed  someone to lean on if needed, and a lot of times it can mean being someone who keeps there mouth shut but stays beside you just so you know you're not alone. That's what I believe anyway. 

I've always had trouble making and keeping friends. I'm not totally sure why.  Yes I've always been a little different than those around me and those I meet.  I was never in to the popular music, movies, games, or fashion etc as everyone else.  I never seem to find the same things appealing or interesting as those I meet.  I often find myself with little to add during group conversation.

A large hurdle for me is I hate small talk. It's just so boring.  I understand that it's perhaps needed for most to open dialogue, to get a real conversation going but I just can't. I don't want to talk about the weather or the game last night and I don't care about ""how bout that (insert local politician/celebrity)"". 
I'm happy to talk about those things if I'll be exchanging real thoughts with someone.  What I mean is I'm not interested in parroting headlines and swapping cliches. I'm not afraid to jump in to a conversation if I feel I have something relevant to add. I'm comfortable with silence and/or just being silent myself.

There are a few more reasons I struggle with friendships (and relationships of any kind)  but I'm not here to whine. Something compelled me to share a little. I guess with hopes of getting the ball rolling.

If anyone can relate to anything I've said, wants to expand on, or share their own thoughts/feelings, well someone is here. Questions are welcome.

Who knows, maybe some of us may make an acquaintance, a text buddy or maybe even a friend one day.

1549,TheExquisteVista,1629532592,1,"Hey, 19M here. I've got something to confess. I cannot, by any means get off to anything that isn't NTR or cheating anymore.

I've never really had a girlfriend, nor do I really care to have one, but I believe, if I ever were to have one, it'd end up in the similar case to me being cheated on. 

I have a strong sense of those around me who I consider ""close"" to me, that they don't legitimately like me, and by therefore default talk shit about me behind my back. I find this as a sort of two face charade that in a way, gives me a sense of feeling important in a way, by having people talk about me. Even if it's shitty, or just by passing, hearing people talk about me in how they view me, or what they've heard of me makes me feel as though I've developed a personality that people as an overall and differentiate from others. 

So, back to the original discussion, ""NTR/Cheating and Relationships.""

I tend to relate strongly to the fictional characters being cheated on, I find it sort of relatable, even though I've never experienced it. I believe the reason as to why I gravitate towards pornography that details cheating and ruining someone's emotions, makes me personally feel as though it's a reason as to why I shouldn't want to date. And, don't get me wrong, I don't hate women, I don't view them lesser or any of that shit, that's fucking stupid and anyone who believes that, or believes that they deserve a woman or some other fucking crazy bullshit, needs to see a therapist. No, I'm talking about me, personally feeling that I won't be a committed partner, or a partner who will be able to satisfy my ""future"" partner. 

Ive accepted that awhile ago to be honest. View myself as a loser with no real future besides being surrounded by guys in some big sausage fest, always wondering if I'm being talked shit on or not. I've declared myself undatable and from there decided to just be alone and accept the fact that I'm going to be alone for awhile, probably forever. I could argue that I can change the very situation I've boxed myself in, but what good does it do to change a mindset, when it's always going to be in the back of my head, telling me I'm never going to be able to make a girl happy. 

I enjoy NTR/Cheating as an escape from what I've trapped myself into believing, I find it as a reality, if anything close to what it would be, to be my own.

It's amazing I'm aware, yet I decide to do nothing about it, because I know I feel as though any attempt is fruitless. 

I'm not tall, I'm not sociable, I'm not funny, I'm not smart, I'm pathetic.

That's what it feels like, and I used to worry, that's what it'd always be.

I have a lot of thoughts, some of them about the real world.

Sometimes, I have this need for feedback from real world tho.

So, I go out and look for people, ask them, try to have a decent conversation.

What I get?  Lies, not being answered to, being pushed away.  I get rejected, labeled as ‚Äúcreep‚Äù or ‚Äútoxic‚Äù, judged in the worse way possible, emarginated.

This of course darkens my feelings.  And causes me to be rejected even more.

And people even either make unnecessary assumptions about me, or talk about mistakes I‚Äôve made in the past, in a negative way.

What‚Äôs wrong with me?

Poor communication skills?  People being mean?  Lack of charisma?  Or just bad luck?

As information I collected about human relationships say, my needs could be satisfied with a good friendship and/or dating.  But Internet tells me, based on who I am and what I want, that I have a lot of red flags meaning I‚Äôm not ready for both of them, especially for the latter.

This is what I want from people: discussing my ideas, asking for opinions, some support.  Too demanding?  What‚Äôs the cost of being true and nice to me?  Without lies or judges of any kind? üòî

I think I'm a good person, you know? I think I'm a pretty approachable and likeable person. Not to a narcissistic level of course but at least a decent human being. I can hold a conversation, I can make people laugh, I've helped people out, you know? People of all types come up to me and talk to me, but nobody really cares more than just small talk. I'm fairly attractive I'd say, well, at least I'm not ugly or repulsive. Am I just not good enough somehow? No, that's not true. I'm no narcissist but I can at least admit that I AM a likeable person. So what am I missing? Why do I have to float around trying to fit in while everyone else somehow just has their shit figured out? 

I try not to pay attention to it, I really do - and I succeed most of the time - but I'm not perfect man. Waking up on holidays, birthdays, etc., and nobody giving a shit about you except your family is the worst.

I was like one of those kids in the movies that has and got everything they ever wanted, hot girls, so many friends that you can't keep up, people from other schools hitting you up and knowing you. By the time 8th grade began, i was a little brat, i didn't know it then... but i just was. i was too popular and began hanging with high schoolers and older kids, started doing high school shit, the thing is, i was 13 living life like an adult, smoking, drinking, robbing, intruding and so on. the thing was though, that i had so much fun doing all those things because i felt invincible...untouchable. girls from every school and even high school at grasp, but none of them ever 'good' or 'cool' enough for me, and even those who were, i treated them like shit. i really messed up with this one girl... but that's a long story. everything went to shit quick by fall (nearing winter), which at this point i was hanging out every day living life as if i was already ready to be an actual teen, but when you're 13 that kind of shit gets past you. one particular hang out messed everything up, it got me arrested and truthfully, it wasn't being in chains head to toe in front of my parents at court that fucked me up, it's really what came after. not only had i found out that all those ""friends"" who i considered brothers ratted me out, but there was a rumor going around that i had snitched on one of the high schoolers involved that got me arrested. i didn't give the guy much attention, but after getting out my parents made sure i went ghost, they would tell me about how no one could ever know about what really happened with me (not showing up to school) and how i had to lie to my friends, having felt like a piece of shit for letting my parents down i felt no hesitation in doing so. this was a big mistake, rumors flew around, rumors that would only reach me by march, after 3-4 months. i had no control over the rumors, but things were not bad at all, i started hanging out again, but only to fairs and parties in communities with my best friend, the only one who would stick around. some girls started telling me about these rumors but i ignored em, however, by the time freshmen year started everybody straight up dropped me, they wouldn't even look at me.

 I'm gonna sum it up, but basically freshmen year was the worst-mentally tarnishing year of my life, people laughed at me, they would come to my first period algebra class just to laugh at me over stupid shit, i was never used to being the loser, girls were embarrassed to even talk to me. i'm leaving out an important part of the story, to keep this guy anonymous  we'll call him john, john was the high schooler that accused me of ratting on him, he made sure to go up every girl, boy and peer to assure them he was ""gangsta"" and told them i was a rat and that i ""ruined his life"". I didn't... i wish i had, but i didn't, everybody but me ratted this idiot out. so not only did i have to eat shit for the rest of freshmen year for something i didn't do, but i also had to keep it all to myself, my emotions... the truth. it sucks that all those people i was so close with dropped me to avoid embarrassment, and i get we were kids, and kids do that shit, but wow... we're talking about friends i hung out with everyday, friends i had known and been with since the jump. this high schooler 'john' would follow me and pick on me throughout freshmen year, and one time, he caught me slippin at a target with my little brother and followed me into an alley to do who knows what. after freshmen year i told myself to lay low, be quiet and get high school over with, but like a smart man once told me, with time everything gets better... and it did, it seemed as if people forgot. it's senior year now and things are all good, but i'm lonely as shit, and i get i don't approach people but everybody knows me and are stuck with this image of me from the past, i'm not that idiot kid anymore, but what am i supposed to do? i'm just waiting to graduate and get up out of this town-city i live in... to many familiar faces &amp; to much jealousy. it sucks that i had to swallow the truth about what really went down, but it is what it is and i guess i'm the problem as to why i am lonely and depressed. it just seems so strange how people i forged so many memories with can just walk past me without checking up it's like wow... y'all don't remember huh.",lonely,Why am I so lonely?

All my life people have never liked me, I was just oblivious to notice until adulthood. In fact, two of the few friendships I‚Äôve made literally told me they were my friend because they felt sorry for me. 

My friendships start out promising. I‚Äôm tolerable at first meeting. The conversation isn‚Äôt too deep or opinionated, and we play some chill games. However, I‚Äôm very bad at thinking of funny things to say or interesting/entertaining things, so the conversation becomes stale. 

I often end up responding with ‚Äúnice,‚Äù ‚Äútrue,‚Äù or something similar because my brain can‚Äôt think of anything to continue a conversation. 

The friends I make only last a short while until they find someone else more interesting, funny, and fun. This has happened to me over and over again throughout my life. 

The last two close friends I‚Äôve made have not only rejected me, but began insulting me after they became friends with some racist/sexist bros. Their liberal opinions and respectful demeanor vanished. I thought if I tried to be really kind to them and complimented them from time to time that they would be loyal to me and like me because I‚Äôm so sweet to them, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt maintain friends or why they belittle me after they can‚Äôt tolerate me anymore.

Turns out I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs stuck. He moved away this year and I still find myself thinking about him every day. It seems as though he‚Äôs moved on. I know he‚Äôs okay, why wouldn‚Äôt he be? Isn‚Äôt it kinda cruel to wish he wasn‚Äôt or is that justified? 

(We can call the guy Tom for all of our conveniences )

In an attempt to move on I asked out a guy without even really feeling like I wanted to be with him, he said no of course. Next up I‚Äôm back to smoking again, I only ever stopped because of Tom. He didn‚Äôt like me smoking and told me to stop so I did for over a year. And now I just feel like nothing is stopping me from that. It isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôve moved on, I think this may be me trying a futile attempt at getting Tom to notice me again.

I was sorta the one who told him to leave me alone but that was only cause I hated seeing myself slowly getting replaced. I just figured he‚Äôd be happier without me around. He‚Äôs started school and is going out tonight, probably with his girlfriend which is yes the turning point that made me unable to continue talking to him without feeling like I was having a nervous breakdown (Which I I know isn‚Äôt fair but at the same time I was in love with this guy for over two years and mostly that‚Äôs his fault). 

Then the nights are the worst part. When I really have time to think and question whether he and his girlfriend are closer than we were. Does she know more about him by now than I do? Do I even know him like I think I do? And have they been intimate? I know that‚Äôs not my place but since the day he said he was straight (which funnily enough wasn‚Äôt until months after I confessed I liked him) that was one of my biggest fears. I suppose I always thought it was his family or church forcing him. Now If that did happen between Tom and someone else, well it would be real.

The week before he left I lost my best friend (it was him but even in his last week here it felt like he had already left). Once i know he‚Äôs moved on I‚Äôll have lost him entirely.

Planning for college, watching movies, playing games, hell my life in general does not feel the same without him. Now it just hurts, guess I really did just become one of those friendships that just die.

1615,Chrlik,1629495000,3,"The past year, I have been really awful to people close to me. I was acting weird, innapropriate... and people rightfully distanced themselves from me. I am still sorting out why I acted in a way that was so different from my usual self. With a bunch of other reasons, I think all this covid situation really f me up.

Anyway, I became pretty lonely for the first time of my life. I used to be alone when I was a kid, but then I grew confident, made friends and went from friend groups to friend groups. But 2021 was different. I now knew what it was like to have a social life so I knew what I just lost. And the loss of friends -especially after disappointing them so much- is a pain I can hardly bear.

I'm feeling a bit better now, but I know three things helped me stay, well, alive : a few friends from older friendships who were totally outside of the fuss I made, the Webtoon I'm writing, and... this subreddit.

I want to give back a little bit of the support I got from reading your stories, watching you help each other...

It may be a small thing, but I want to do it : as I said before, I'm working on a Webtoon. It's called Cupid's Duty and it's -for now- only available in french, my native language. So it's only available on Webtoon Canvas France. This Webtoon is talking about emotions, rejection, love, controlling others, pardon... eh, what a surprise!

I want to dedicate my next chapter to you. So, if you wish, put your name in the comments. I will put a little text at the end of the chapter with the list of names written here. It don't have to be your actual name if you want something else, it can be a pseudo for exemple.

I know it's not much, especially considering it's only in french, and all... but I also know that when you're in the situation I was -and still kinda is- you really appreciate existing somewhere. Having a trace of your existence noted.

Anyway, love you all, I hope you had a beautiful day.

It's clear she's put me in the friendzone and I am sitting here again with unrequited feelings.

To put into perspective, my girlfriend (LDR) has recently moved to a new state, where she has very limited internet usage and has to take care of a relative so even then she doesn‚Äôt get much time to talk to me anymore, it doesn‚Äôt help that this was very sudden and although I understand family comes first, I really had trouble dealing with seperation from her. I know it‚Äôs long distance and there‚Äôs not much seperation, but I mean seperation in contact and just feeling separated in general, it really hurts and scares me and makes me feel so bad. I‚Äôve been trying my best to do good things for myself, aka work on myself and even try to talk to friends, but every time I try to talk to the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù I thought I had, it was only because she was dating me and they felt they had to include me, as soon as she had left I ceased to exist until they needed something, never when I needed or even wanted to do something. It made me feel so.. void. And invisible.

It just makes me feel so alone and it eats at me every single night.

1662,Similar_Analysis_459,1629463418,4,"My ex and i broke up over a year ago now, I was in a shitty place for about 9 months afterwards, The friend group went her way (since she got with someone else in the group, so i didn't want to hang out etc. with them).


I recently moved away from everything for about 6 months.



I just feel like im kind of headfucked with relationships now. That sounds really strong, but its not, its mild. I don't mean romantic relationships either, i'd really say this whole thing has damaged my idea of friendships. I find myself getting upset at my old friends for not clicking on my messages on facebook. Like the same way you almost would in a shitty relationship. 


It's hard to describe but i'm just getting up in my head about it all in a way i previously only wouldve with someone im involved with. And it'd be a negative thing in that circumstance too. I also just don't really know how to confront it. I've never enjoyed facebook messaging people because i don't know how to keep conversation flowing. Yes I can have a perfectly good exchange for a day, but I don't feel inspired or know how to just chat endlessly and off and on with friends. 


I'm great at catching up and just having conversation then.


Conversation seems to only happen when i get pent up with feeling lonely and put in the effort to reach out, and yeah just goes for a single conversation.



I've been thinking about telling one of my friends just this kind of general way i am feeling, yet i feel like it's too much. It would just be out of nowhere from them. And honestly if they don't want to talk to me they don't have to. They would be otherwise, and i can't just sit there and demand attention. Thats one thing i learnt from my breakup, in some ways i was so so childish, and i cringe at the memory of it. I want to apply those learnt lessons.


Something i've been trying to do is message lots of people. My ex and I dominated each others lives, and even though i feel a lot better now, perhaps its that absence that is truly dragging me down. I had a good friend group back then, but at times we probably really were each others only real interaction. I can't expect someone else to just focus in on me like that, but if I have a little chat with lots of people, and only spoke to an individual person every 3 or so days, maybe thats a great solution. I still would struggle though just to hit up one of the people im not super close to after 3 days. Just because what am i going to talk about haha. But maybe i can figure that out. Wing it.



I just feel incredibly down and negative about it all. I dont think ive ever felt so poorly about my friendships in my life.



And i have met people up here, idk maybe I should just do that, forget everyone down there till im back down there.




Just part of me really is salty that i called my mate 6 times across a 2 month period and every time he was busy, then i told him to msg if he wanted to chat and here i am over a month later not receiving any. Like i if read that situation as ive described it, im like ok, move on man. he obviously doesnt want to. But i legit knew this guy really well, he was genuinely a close mate and its just strange confusing and feels really bad to have nothing. And im now at this stubborn point where im like ok screw you. I wont message you for months until you me. And yeah usually i go nah be the bigger guy, you want to talk, talk, but ive already done that twice. 


I guess im a bit of a dickhead and i almost want to let him know how much its gotten to me, and how sucky it is. And yet is it? Im not owed his time. I should just cut and move on. yet ive done that so incredibly much in the past year or so and i just dont have much more to cut haha.",lonely,"How can i connect with people again, should I try with new people or old friends?",2021-08-20 22:43:38

1679,Acrobatic_Solid_5947,1629442816,1,"I graduated highschool last year and instead of choosing the normal next step of a 4 year college like all my friends did, I chose to go to a trade school. I recently just graduated my trade school and am awaiting to start my life as an adult in the work force. 
Meanwhile, every single one of my friends, and my boyfriend are in college. Lately I‚Äôve just been feeling so scared to start my life as a real adult because everyone else my age is still able to be a kid in a way since they‚Äôre all in college. They have total freedom, can party every night, meet new people etc. and I can‚Äôt help but to feel like I‚Äôm really missing out. 
Every one of my close friends goes out of state and I‚Äôve gone to visit and live a week in their lives of the college experience and it‚Äôs just all so fun. Then coming home back to work by myself honestly makes me feel so depressed. My boyfriend plays college football at a school 2 hours away and I do go visit him very frequently but it doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre sort of ‚Äúlong distance‚Äù since it is a drive to be able to see each other. And I just feel so left out of what everyone my age gets to do. I‚Äôm 19 starting a career while all my friends won‚Äôt be in the position I am for another 3 years. Everyone is coming up on their sophomore year and for the first year i didn‚Äôt feel like I was missing much since I was at a school of my own too. But now that I‚Äôm done with school and starting my life in the real world I feel so left out. 
There are many positives to the path I chose as I‚Äôm not in student debt, I will be making great money within the next year, I get to buckle down and get a head start on my life before any of my friends so I am proud of myself and happy with my path but it is a lonely one and it is hard being so far away from all the fun. 
It‚Äôs also hard to make friends because everyone my age is in college. I truly feel like the only one in my position and it is so lonely. I do try to keep myself busy by working out, spending time with my family but other than that there‚Äôs not much to do other than work. And to see my friends and my boyfriend it‚Äôs either a 2 hour drive or a plane across the country. I‚Äôve considered moving in with my boyfriend in his house where he goes to school but the only thing in the town for me is him and I don‚Äôt wanna move there for the next 3 years and start my life there just for him then to end up moving back once he graduates. And I‚Äôve contemplated even moving out of state but I know I would miss my family like crazy and my boyfriend. I‚Äôm at a loss but I‚Äôm sick of being lonely and tired of living in the town I grew up in while everyone of my friends is far away onto the next big step.

1700,mrsGravyx,1629430069,1,"Many years ago I was depressed and would self harm/have a really bad attitude towards everything and everyone. 

My friends would tease me calling me ‚ÄúE-kid‚Äù as a joke (ik it might not sound like one, but we‚Äôve been together for 10 years now), instead of getting mad at me for the things I said to them (although sometimes they would). 

When I told my father about me having suicidal thoughts he told me it was just a phase, when the school‚Äôs counselor called him, he got mad. He says I don‚Äôt need any help.

I feel so lonely, there are a lot of feelings mixing inside me right now and Idk what to do with them. 

Even tho at the time I didn‚Äôt express myself correctly, I still did. I‚Äôm scared of telling someone since everything has been better ever since I stopped caring about what I felt. 

I got better grades, more stable relationships, and even better opportunities.

I can‚Äôt sleep at night because I keep having all of these intrusive thoughts that I shouldn‚Äôt be here, and I feel like I‚Äôm running out of air.

1701,Proud-Wrap-6866,1629429541,1,"I have always struggled with loneliness all my life. But from 2013-2019, I was in college and for the first time had an active social life. I‚Äôve always been introvert so this was like they best thing that happened to me. But slowly after graduation ppl got in relationships. 

When I graduated in 2019 I told everyone a month in advance. They all said they would show up and on the day of none did. This was literally my worst fear as a child and it came true. And I confirmed with them multiple times throughout the week. And the day of no one showed up even though everyone lived less than 20mins away. I went to their graduation and the year prior. I don‚Äôt think it was asking much to see me on that day. 

My family was out of the country because their flight got canceled so they couldn‚Äôt make it.

I never got a a sorry from anyone either. 
The group is currently geared towards the couples of the group since 2019. And the fact that I always show up single now to any event that is planned is noted. My male and female friends make comments like I need to bring someone. Actually I remember the New Years 2019 it was heavily implied I bring someone or just don‚Äôt show up.

I would stop showing up and hanging with them. But I‚Äôm afraid to be alone I guess. I‚Äôm always texting everyone and no one texts me. It feels like i maintain these friendships one sided. 

I just have a hard time letting go I guess. And friendships mean more to me than the average person.

Anyway during the pandemic I got a job offer in another state. I just feel like there isn‚Äôt anything for me here. The job is amazing but I don‚Äôt know how to meet ppl in a non-school environment. And with COVID kinda still around Idk how social ppl are. And being an introvert doesn‚Äôt help.


But I might just leave without saying anything.
I‚Äôll doubt they‚Äôll notice I‚Äôm gone anyway.

sorry for bad english, it is not my native language. 
First of all: I (M,35) am happily married with a wonderful wife. She is my rock and i know that i am very lucky. Despite that, there is a part in my life that hits me very hard:
When i was younger, i had a lot of friends, some of them since kindergarden and most of them from school. From time to time my hobbies and interests changed and i didn‚Äòt like things like partying anymore. This and other things (work) led to me losing contact with a lot of them. About 10 years ago i met an old friend on a subway ride, we realized that we had a lot in common and became best friends. For years we met 3-4 times a week and he also introduced me to a group that met a lot to play videogames (his brothers and a two good friends). As we are all video game nerds we made old school LAN parties, went to the cinema together and met a lot. 
From time to time i realized that my friend would lie to me about his relationships with his girlfriends. One girlfriend reached out to me and my wife, because she couldn‚Äòt take his behaviour anymore. He was abusive (Not physical) and showed narcisstic behaviour. When she told it to us, i believed her immediately because he had already shown this behaviour in his youth. Because of this a lot of friends and i had cut contact with him for years in the first place. When we met again he seemed to have changed.
Well this incident led to us arguing. I told him that i would always help him figure stuff out, as long as he would be honest with me. I told him that he is my best friend and that trust would be the Most Important thing for me, no matter what he had done. In the following weeks, he chose to lie to me several times and i chose to end the contact with him. As the group of friends consisted of his Brothers and his other friends, i kinda lost contact to them too. I don‚Äôt know what he told them but they don‚Äôt seem to be interested in getting in touch with me.
In addition to this i kinda feel that i am changing. I feel like i act weird in front of other people (can‚Äôt show my normal humor and act more formal). I wonder if I acted wrong towards my friend who always helped me in need but only lied to me when it comes to his relationships. 
I just watched the movie ‚ÄûReady player one‚Äú and cried at the end because I saw myself in James Halliday, the creator of the oasis (virtual reality) who had the same kind of regret that I feel about not being able to act normal to other people and losing his best friend.
I don‚Äôt how to become the person I once was. My wife always says i am a very funny and that she loves my humor, yet I feel like I can‚Äôt show it to anyone else.",lonely,Need advice,2021-08-20 11:38:22

One thing I have to tell you, that people like us are one of the nicest people and we begin with pain but we end up getting a lot more happier and successful.

Greetings,

\&gt;&gt;This is a repost from another subreddit that posted on. For whatever reason 

no one saw it or replied &lt;&lt; 

I am and have been going through a rough patch for so many years of my lifetime.

I  am wrecked with chronic depression that has had a grip on me for so  long that I am drained and literally feel like there is little to  nothing that I can do to make this all go away for good.

I  have a few links to some previous posts I made on other subreddits but I  wanted to see if I could reach more people to talk to [My first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mcsby0/need_serious_help_advice_for_getting_out_of_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [My second](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/p4ds71/a_mentally_exhausted_soul/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Everyday  I awake to feel like I did not sleep at all, I feel as if I am dying a  slow yet annoying death ""annoying"" because I really hate and dislike the  situation I am in. I'm angry at those who've wronged and hurt me and  never gave an explanation as to why they said and did the thing that  they did. I am angry at myself for allowing this to continue for so long  and not doing anything about, I tried yet every time I try to find a  way out It's as if I am not allowed and I have no choice but to suffer. I  hope I never wronged or hurt anyone in any of my past lives and if I  did I am truly sorry. That is not my nature and I wouldn't even wish any  form of suffering let alone this pain I am going through to my worst  enemy if I had one.

I  have difficulties falling asleep and when I arise it's stressful. I  awake to people arguing and toxic abusive comments and it just disrupts  my spirit even further. I asked 3 questions on Quora about 6-7 months  back [Quora 1](https://www.quora.com/Need-advice-help-on-getting-out-of-a-dangerously-toxic-environment-I-am-a-young-adult-I-am-on-the-cusp-of-losing-my-mind-my-spirit-is-exhausted-what-advice-and-ideas-do-you-have-for-me-or-anyone-like-me-who-may-see) [Quora 2](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-share-my-Go-fund-me-if-I-have-no-friends-or-family-cannot-share-my-name-or-face-due-to-being-in-a-toxic-abusive-environment-This-is-a-serious-emergency-my-mental-health-cannot-take-it-anymore) [Quora 3](https://www.quora.com/Need-help-and-advice-on-getting-out-of-a-toxic-environment-I-am-a-young-adult-male-who-is-literally-on-the-cusp-of-losing-my-mind-I-feel-like-giving-up-I-am-mentally-emotionally-exhausted-I-cant-take-it-anymore-What)

To  which out of nowhere I was notified that I was not allowed to reply,  comment, or edit due to ""Not having my real name on my account"" I lost  what little motivation I had to actually find some people to talk to and  with their knowledge and wisdom; find a way to escape of find some  services that could help assist me in my running away.

I  feel like I am slipping away each day I really dislike how that feels. I  am currently trying to make another GoFundMe the first time I made one I  did not know much about it and thought I could just make it and people  would see it but alas, I have to share which I had no way to do so.

Also  if anyone knows how I can make one without showing my face due to my  situation I will gladly accept whatever advice you may have. I know  unfortunately people have abused such things and scammed people because  of it. I had my share of scammers especially here on reddit and it  really messed me up.

I am tired of feeling inadequate, I am tired of feeling like ""new day same terrible feelings""

I  am tired of waking up every single day and doing the same daily  activities only for them to feel like chores. I used to take 15-25 even  up to 30 min showers (on the weekends as a little extra bathing treat so  to speak)  to after being shackled with depression finding myself  taking over an 1-2 hours in the bathroom not knowing where the ""time""  went.

Someone once said ""Rather  piss in the sink than sink in the piss"" and I resonate with that comment  because it describes the proclivity of my situation in a small way.

[Visual Description of how I feel](https://images.app.goo.gl/YTtspCcd61qTSio97)

I am trying to fight the dark mass that wont let me go and fighting to me somewhat feels

futile.  I have people gaslighting me into thinking I am making things up  deliberately and in turn has me over thinking and questioning my sanity.  I want to live but what I am going through isn't living at all.

In  3-4 weeks I will either be homeless because I can't take this anymore  or perhaps gone from this earth because I gave in to the pressure that  has been draining and exhausting me.

Please forgive me for typing so much this is just a small amount of it believe it or not.

Also  the first link that I posted on here my apologies if seems like it's  all over the place. That day when I posted it I was really all over the  place and my energy was in disarray and I just let it all flow unto that  post. Also I don't mind talking to people but I had a incident many  months ago

[I asked a question that I almost forgot about](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mrq1vp/what_is_something_you_did_to_get_out_of_a_bad/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

and someone said if I needed to talk they would share whatever knowledge and information with me.

Well  that person never replied even though they have been active on reddit a  lot. I know we all have our own issues but please don't say one thing  especially when people are looking for some assistance and you are not  going to honor your word.

Forgive  me if I made any mistakes I am new to this subreddit and I am just  looking for any and everything to help me because I literally have no  one to talk to at all.

If you have read all of this thank you very much for taking the time to do so ü¶ã

1738,MonkeyDAstra,1629405534,1,"Ever since I can remember, I've needed to be surrounded with people, it's hard to describe but Johan Hari explains it awesome in his book called ""Lost Connections"", people need to be part of a community, to interact with others while doing day to day activities.
Myself in particular, has always needed that connection, i remember i used to cry every vacation or holidays just cause i couldn't see my school friends back in kindergarden, primary and secondary school.
I've always felt that need for friends, and it's hard to explain cause I have some awesome friends, it's just that I can rarely see them, talk with them or feel like i'm accompanied in life, I live with my mother and brother , however it's not the type of convivence that I need, I just somehow need daily interaction with other semejants in an activity of mutual interest, I always feel like life is a pain and a pretty tiring experience, so having someone to rely on, even if it's just to whine, makes me feel such a relief.
Problem is, everywhere I go, it seemes like i'm pretty good at starting relationships, but cannot keep any of them, for years I have analyzed my self to try to understand why is it this happens, never really found the answer until recently that i drooped college and rejoined and started from zero, I got some friends and a gf, I was having a pretty good time and thought I could handle my life with its difficulties just by having company, however, due to some misunderstandings and myself being the way I am but not really being polite and experienced enough to handle pressure situations, I screwed up, I apologized and tried to get better, but things just seemed as if they had changed, and that was the point of no return, cause once trust is broken it's almost impossible to recover it. I've talked with my best friend and came to a conclusion that made me understand the flaws in my personality and way of being, however, it's sonething engrained in me, so it's gonna be hard to change it, and due to that, it feels like only when I get access to another social circle I'm going to be able to improve, however thing is, I've been out of school before, and I found it impossible to get a circle of friends, due to living in M√©xico in a kinda small town, not having super common interests neither being super outgoing, so i end up with nothing to do, I have cursed 1 year in my actual school and I feel like i cannot handle anymore, now without friends, without any support nor gf ( i broke up with her due to some conduct like felt a little like abuse to me and was thought to not tolerate something like that by my mother, however it makes me think i overthought things and that i won't find someone as special as her ever again, cause she had a lot of pros but a few flaws that seemed to much for me at that moment, but thing is, I got 0 chances with anyone else, so I guess I didn't conformed at the right time)
Nowadays I'm lonely , I feel like life is too hard, even tho I'm not facing any ""real"" struggles and i got my basic necessities met, maybe i'm just super dramatic , but i experience life in a way that everything feels like a struggle and everytime I've felt like that, it's always due to a lack of company, cause with that covered, I feel like I can rock it all, but without it I feel like i'm sh*t, and every second adds up til it makes me feel like commiting suicide, things to add:
I've taken therapy a lot of times, I'm taking psychiatric medicine in a constant and i'm regulated by my doctor, also i have ocd and have had anxiety and depression episodes throught my life, I really need some help, I feel like I can't handle my life anymore, also the pandemic helps nothing, so I'm just stuck",lonely,Can't hold on anymore,2021-08-20 06:38:54

1747,anti2matter,1629400441,1,"We may be less fortunate than others when it comes to having someone to talk to, or to tell us that it will be alright. 
There are so many people surrounding us and yet we feel all alone. Some of us have family members but they arent supportive or just cant help. 

But I believe there is a whole world inside us that we do have control over. The thoughts in our head, how we interact with things around us. Maybe being lonely just shows that we need to take a break from everyone and experience this world of yours, and love ourselves. As cliche as it may sound, take care of yourself. Try doing things by your own, even if you think it would be better doing it with someone. Probably no one can satisfy you better than you can to yourself. 

Being with someone who is toxic is worse than having nobody. Also, if you did have somebody, you cant rely on them keeping you happy if you cant do that yourself. Most importantly, you need to remember that everything is transient, nothing remains the same. Thats just how life is. As hard as it is to believe, the dark clouds will clear. And you get to decide that.

Me personally, when I feel lonely I try to things like coming to this subreddit and help people who feel the same way. I understand, it is hard. But loving yourself is a constant process.

I have terrible anxiety at night. The aching void of being alone prevents me from going to sleep, it's like trying to fall asleep when you're starving. Except that I'm not starving for food, I'm starving for touch, acceptance, love, and support.

But I'm slowly turning it around. It's taken a season of effort but I've slowly made a couple more friends - got in touch and rebuilding an old friendship, making a new friend who I can talk to and share interests with, and flirting/talking with a new potential lover.

I'm trying not to get my hopes up though, I know from experience this could all come crashing down at any day. But at least I'm no longer just lying around in bed wishing I was dead.

People say that you need to love yourself first before you can love someone else - that's completely false. People need to love you before you can love yourself.

The only occasional interactions I have are when things go wrong so the only communication I have with others tends to be negative or highly formal.

I don't know how to go on anymore. I just feel dead and left behind almost every day. Just so lonely, like I'm flying through space alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends, not very many but good ones. We are all in the early 20's. I was recently introduced to my buddy's girlfriend. We hit it off right away, we can ""relate"" and ""connect"". It feels somehow like Yin and Yang. We can talk about our problems and fears. Now not in a sexual way, I don't want that at all. I'm not into her and she's not into me. Period. A little WhatsApp is enough and my life feels briefly like lighting a match in absolute darkness. It just feels better when you somehow do something together. Everything that was shit on the day, no matter whether messed up family or the crappy work and the thoughts about it blur when we do something. Like she puts me in a shield or umbrella when it rains. As if my heart had chosen this person as a ""best friend"" even though you don't know them much. I don't know why, but I trust her deeply. When her boyfriend is around it feels wrong to do something, like I'm a thorn in the eye or just the weirdo hanging out with the girlfriend. Like I'm somehow destroying the relationship with my presence (Even though it's not the case). They assure me I'm welcome and everything is really ok, but this feeling or fear that it's just said out of niceness is driving me crazy. It's like I'm ""throwing myself"" at her even though I'm just looking for security and somehow affection or the feeling of being liked. Everything feels so wrong even though it feels so good to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

But when the end of the day approaches and I'm on my way home, the feeling comes back. Shortly after getting into the car I have to stop myself from crying. The feeling of being alone, the eternal whirlpool of darkness between my heart and stomach. I would love to kick down into the next tree and die. At home in bed it is the worst, I would like to vomit from the feeling. Fears to have said something wrong or to have screwed up only accelerate this whirlpool. Is it so strange to like someone?  I am not in love and not jealous of the relationship, but I just need someone in my life to show me that I am alive and not just a tool. What is wrong with me?

I am not asocial in the slightest and I am fine in social situations, Ive recovered in many ways, and I am severely introverted, but honestly my problem lies in finding someone to love, never have been at 23. My final hurdle in life is finding my love language or someone to eventually start a family with, but it is so hard. Why is it so hard? intimacy feels like a trap :( and every flirt or advance i receive is a mountain of uncertainty and pain and it pushes me away, and I hate it. 

Reddit isn't my therapist, and I honestly just want some place to vent or find others who relate in this sense because I am stuck in a painful dichotomy of wanting yet not knowing how to love. Neither of my parents dated anyone before meeting each other in their early 20s, my autistic dad got with my rape victim mom, and the best advice my dad gave me was just to be friends with women, but that has never worked and has always put me in the friendzone or ""saved till later"" so what even is the point? most women by my age have already found who they want to love or marry or many are damaged or used, or reserved just like I am, but those who are reserved or damaged like I at this age are so few and far between.

I come from a good, loving, overly supportive home, but it was my school and peers that damaged me that took so long to recover from. I would have been locked in a closet for sometimes hours every day as a kid by the school administration, they sent letters to everyone's parents saying that their children were in danger because of me and my autistic outbursts back then. For years I was ostracized and bullied, beaten, or ignored, and I became apathetic towards everyone and addicted to so much bullshit. Eventually put into online school where I missed out on so much crucial socialization from an early age. I've recovered since then, but intimacy has always been an issue for me, and it's embarrassing.

I just want to know what love is :(",lonely,"can being locked in a closet every day as a kid, beatings, peer ostracization, online schooling, unchecked childhood depression, and autism damage you socially growing up?",2021-08-20 00:20:49

I really missed my family, my home, my pets, my security, everything that made me feel safe and so I acted out. Everyone thought I was just a mean and nasty brat of a kid and it's not until many years later that I've realised, I wasn't mean spirited, I was grieving enormous loss but as a 10 year old, I couldn't articulate what it was that I was experiencing. 

I had brown skin and I was raised as a white kid. I was reasonably smart too so when I went to high school I really struggled with my identity. I was brown and looked like the cool basketball, football players but I was smart and talked like a white kid so I didn't really fit in with them. I was in classes with all the smart white kids but didn't really fit in with them either because I didn't look like them. So I kinda drifted between the groups and often found myself relating more with the outsiders - the kids that looked funny, or didn't wear cool clothes.

I guess I was the only girl in high school that no one tried to hit on. And when people notice I haven't had a girlfriend yet, they'd always assume it's because I got high standards or uninterested but the truth is that absolutely no one has ever confessed.

I thought I was average and I was probably average then but now that everyone has hit puberty, all of the girls are prettier. And I tried to find excuses for myself too like it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm quiet and seem mean, that I‚Äôll get prettier when I grow up, etc. But I know girls who have the same qualities yet still manage to find themselves a boyfriend.

I was super insecure but hopeful until last year. I finally got into a relationship and it‚Äôs the happiest feeling I thought someone can finally love me. But 5 months in and I found out he was cheating on me during all those. I just couldn‚Äôt accept it. He told me he loved me and we even talked about a future and all. Of course, looking back, that‚Äôs an obvious red flag but we were also young then and I don‚Äôt see a problem with being optimistic.

It‚Äôs been months and I think I just cried even longer than the time we had. Now, I‚Äôm back to being invisible to guys. I was still hopeful yesterday because I thought maybe I‚Äôd be considered pretty in another country but I know that‚Äôs bullshit.

I'm an intense and motivated person. I live in the United States, and my passion led people to deal with me as their competition. After that, they used immoral tactics to attack me. People who I thought were close friends started talking behind my back to single me out. I was the only Spanish person in a friend group that's mainly made up of African-American men. People started making sarcastic jokes about my race, then tried undermining anything I said. After that, they, started excluding me from their activities until I was on my own.

My ex-girlfriend, on the other hand, grew up in a household that traumatized her. She did not receive a lot of affection when she was younger, and that caused her to have severe separation issues. I fell in love with this girl because I could connect with her spiritually. The separation issues, though, drove me crazy until the point that I lost sight of goals such as exercising, taking care of my body and appearance, and made me lose a lot of weight, and also made me start smoking nicotine. When I told her about her toxic behavior, she did not want to accept that she was causing many problems in our relationship. She never exercised, go to therapy, or practice a good amount of self-care. She's a very strict Christian and subconsciously believes God will solve her problems without doing any work (even when the Bible urges people to work hard on their goals).

A woman who I wanted to have babies with left me because I told indirectly told her that her behavior is crazy and toxic. She harmed me with her words and doubts about my abilities. The people who I thought my friends were, I met them at college, and they left me because I thought I was crazy.

1897,The_Mad_Onion,1629327235,1,"This is a wordy vent and I've never put this out to the world or talked about it with anyone else.  

Tl;dr at the bottom

I was raised by a mostly absent father (worked an incredible amount), a very mentally ill mother (she has hyper religiosity schizophrenia. I began taking care of my mom and doing adult household tasks when I turned eight years old), and five other mostly absent siblings that I didn't really grow up with. I can recall often being told to be quiet, stop being annoying, and stay out of the way when I did happen to be around family. I took this to heart and got quieter and quieter over the years. All of this is set in a super-religious background that demanded time, money, obeying parents without question, and disconnecting yourself from everyone that wasn't in the religion. If it wasn't god related in a good way, the family didn't want to hear it. All my extended family is in this religion too. At least I'm not in that religion anymore... üòå

My birthday is Dec 25. It's shitty when everyone celebrates an invisible sky daddy and glosses over you're existence because you're not supposed to take credit from god.

I could never have any school friends over while growing up (except one every now and then, because he understood how the game was played about god stuff and he didn't feel worried about my mom's illness) since they weren't in the religion. I didn't want to have church friends over because of my mom's sickness and I didn't know how anyone would really react or spread rumors since my church was gossipy.

I had a couple of small friend circles that were at school throughout elementary, middle, and high school, but they were all casual acquaintances since I spent a large portion of time helping my mom at home and not spending it with friends or going places like music concerts. The one friend that I did have over sometimes throughout my life (we're still friends), has been a pretty two dimensional relationship. We talk about video games and some tech stuff and sometimes music but that's it's. Every time I've tried to talk about something emotional or important to me with him, he rolls his eyes and gets really annoyed with it. Like he shouldn't be bothered. There was even a time I just stated ""I really like this part of the song."" for what we're listening to and he replied with a rude ""Why are you telling me this?"".  That just added to my ever growing list of reasons to be quiet around others, since others don't want my opinion.

I feel like I have PTSD from religion. It's a huge struggle to talk about and the church is a big part of why I don't connect with others well. I was taught that others are the enemy. Morally speaking.

My first job at KFC when I was 14yo, a school friend I worked with outed me for the religion I was in. At work I had a big target on my back. I was locked in the walk-in freezer. Spit on. REALLY made fun of. A lot. I didn't talk to them because most everything felt mean. It was more reasons to be quiet.

I forced myself to have no interests in just about anything while growing up for fear of someone somehow telling my family, which would have made my life so much worse. 

One of my older brothers purchased and watched contraband. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective on VHS.  My dad instructed him to get rid of it since it's ""bad"". My bro said no. That led to a physical fight between my dad and bro that I witnessed (I was 11-ish?) that ended with my dad throwing bro to the ground and knuckles pressed to his throat with more threats. So bro gave in. I really didn't want to be threatened like that, especially since my dad is more than double my size and military fit. So I fell in line or at least hid my small list of interests away from almost everyone.

The only absurd thing I got away with that's normal and has helped me cope with life: fucking god damn video games and being weird.

*If you've ever seen Gilmore Girls, think to when Lane Kim was sneaking around her mom, listening to forbidden music in secrecy. That style of hiding is what I did often. (fun fact. I'm ghost quiet when I move around, like Lane, too!) üòÖüò≠

I am completely disconnected from all family and can't talk to any of them about anything that's critical or casual to me. My last and final attempt to repair or have any relationship with them was squashed about four years ago when I was hitting a mental rock bottom and was told to not talk about my problems to them.

The icing on the cake. I have a fatigue health problem where I'm constantly feeling like I've been jogging a mile or two. Been like that since I was 13 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so pursuing a friendship feels like it takes energy, but I just can't be this alone anymore. I need someone that can understand this.



Tl;dr

I super struggle with knowing how to connect with people. Became quiet and odd/weird from an early age through abuse and often feel awkward around others, since I don't know how to engage in social chat very well. I feel alone with what's happened to me. I took a nosedive into video games to escape reality and added in being odd and weird to cope with being alone.

I'm always tired.

1903,Pankunia,1629324711,1,"19F here. 

I never was the popular kid in class. Having no real friends until high school, having my facebook account taken over by the bullies, being the only kid in class who didn't attend religion (catholic) classes, having weird name, never really socialising with people outside of the school... 

It wasn't really a surprise that when I moved to a bigger city for high school, I lost all of my contacts from hometown. I got into a group of friends and pretty much stick around them. When the pandemic struck it turned out that only 2 out of 4 of them were willing to stay in touch while we were at homes. 
Don't get me wrong - I love them, but when you open up your contacts and realize you can only call 2 people while officially calling more of them you friends... that hurts. 

There's also neverending looking for someone special. I got rejected 5 times - after that I stopped counting. Maybe I'm not that ""girly"", but I don't want to force myself to put on make up just to have a chance to find someone. 

And lastly ""THE GHOSTING"" I've tried many times meeting people through the internet. When the things stopped going smoothly it was okay - we said goodbyes, end of the story. But many times guys messaging me wanted something more (not nudes, thank God) and after some time they just stopped texting. Like the last time - the guy was complaining about being lonely and straight up said that he's looking for ""special someone"". We were talking for like 2 weeks and then his messages became shorter, ignoring those previously sent by me. He said he was busy with his work, but then he admitted to having started streaming recently and asked me to make his some views - LIKE HELL I'm going to help you after ghosting me for more time than we were actually talking!!!

Jonah: I'm not going.

God: you're going.

Jonah: No

\*God makes him go\*

Jonah: see this is exactly why i didn't want to come. I literally wish i was dead right now.

God: do you think you're being a little overdramatic Jonah?

Jonah: no

God: I kind of think you are.

i enjoy finding biblical characters i can relate to. a lot of the prophets got depressed so that makes me feel better. i think it was Elijah who got depressed and God told him to eat something and take a nap. and of course there's Job who said "" naked we come into this world and naked we will leave.

After my last relationship, which was also my first, I'd just about given up on ever trying to have something meaningful again. But then I stumbled across this girl on instagram, she's bffs with this girl who used to be my friend back in school.

She's so perfect man, it's fucking crazy. Her hair is like dark brown ish black and she has a slightly crooked nose and huge, beautiful eyes and a full, flush face and delicate lips. She's got these slightly offset teeth but when I see a picture of her smiling it's the most beautiful, most honest thing ever I can't help but just stare at it and marvel at how beautiful someone can be. She plays so many instruments and sings so beautifully, and she makes these funny little skits and parody pieces and they're all so genuinely humorous and I sometimes just have a hard time believing someone so devastatingly wonderful could exist. She seems so soft yet so resolved and strong and ah fuck man my heart just melts every time I see her on my feed, or hear her voice. 

But I can't ever have her. Her bff, the girl with whom I used to be friends, me and her fell out in a very bad way, and she spread a lot of shit about me and told this girl a lot of stuff without context that painted me in a really negative light.

So I obviously feel lonely not because I don't have friends because I do have some but because I can't connect with them. Keeping or creating bonds with people has always been very difficult because I had a traumatic childhood and suffer from some mental illness as an result. Because of my past trauma I usually see people as a threat. I am aware that most people are friendly and normal but my body still reacts in a way where I am simply seeing groups of people as dangerous. It doesn't help that I as a person am 'weird'. I know that I am a normal girl with a normal life now but used to treat me in a way that I simply was unwelcomed. Many social things are very confusing to me because sometimes I don't understand convention.

My friends are nice,honest and overall wonderful people but sometimes I think they aren't ment for me. We share diffrent passions which isn't a problem for me but usually when I start to talk about stuff that I enjoy they never pay attention to me or even show any interest. What interests me is simply creativity and innovation. Usually I question things like a pseudo philosopher. My friends don't share the interest to analyse everything which is fine but I just whichever that they would do more. Many times I told them that I was unhappy but not much chnaged. What I do know is that I can't force people to like the sake things like I do obviously.So I  just learned not expect much from them and it helps to tell that they are just my school friends.

I have crippling anxiety and depression which colour my world and experiences on a daily basis. I really want to find a partner to share my life with and have a family with because I can‚Äôt stand how lonely I am all the time. I am on online dating and I have spoken to a number of people who seem really nice but then I find myself immediately shutting down. 

I internalize this idea that it isn‚Äôt fair to someone else to date them when I don‚Äôt have my shit together. It isn‚Äôt fair to have them take on the burden of my depression, to take on my mood swings or cost of medical issues that will come up because of my avoidance issues. I hate that I sit at home and lament about how lonely I am, but the moment a potential partner asks to see me in person I feel overwhelmed and politely decline. I try to push myself to socialize sometimes and I go but I‚Äôm not a happy person. When someone news asks basic things like ‚Äì what do you do for fun, how was your day, how was your job ‚Äì and all you have to say are miserable things, it isn‚Äôt attractive. 

I find myself masking my depression and presenting this part of me that feels like a lie so I can have less awkward conversations. I just don‚Äôt see an end to it. I don‚Äôt think my depression and anxiety are going anywhere. I‚Äôve missed the window of my 20‚Äôs and most of my 30s.

I know this may seem silly, but I saw this story on Dodo about a woman who adopted this sad and sick goldfish. She gave him a good home, love and attention and once he was comfortable and protected, his true colours came out. I, maybe stupidly, related to that goldfish.

Not this gravel, nor these doling pains.

I forgot to call or text,

If I wanted it, I would try my best, 

Instead I read, or write, or play a game.

I have posted an online ad looking for a friend and ideally a hug/cuddle buddy. Nothing more.
A got a reply...

So we exchanged a few messages. All seemed good, honest, open, nice and really friendly.

And then... One day I sent a message... And nothing.

There was NO hint, no indication whatsoever that this should happen.

I know the person is fine as I could see an activity sign on the ad site.

What's adding to my sadness and depression is that this is just another experience like this. The same scenario... Nice and friendly messages and then nothing, just silence.

1973,ApplebeesSucks33,1629290628,1,"Hi everybody. 

I just made this account to say how completely drained I am from trying everything to reach out and make friends. I'm not sure how much of this is because of corona or just generally people my age being closed off to new friends, but I'm a 23 y/o guy who's tried everything from online dating to meetup to volunteering. Nothing seems to be of substance or lasting. 

Online dating is a wasteland. I took the time and did the research to set up the best profile I'm capable of while remaining honest, and the only interest I get are from chronic smokers/drinkers who I really don't want in my life. 

Meetup has plenty of events, but finding anyone my age of either gender is like finding a needle in a haystack. Here in Atlanta, GA, most events have people aged 35+. I've heard people say that young people organize events too, but in my experience I haven't found them here. 

Volunteering here seems to be centered on supporting the disadvantaged communities in urban development projects. That's all well and good, but every time I go to something like that, the focus is the work and not making connections. No one ever remembers my name no matter how much I show up. I'd prefer something like an animal shelter or something more social to volunteer with, but I haven't found much. Maybe I just don't know where to look.

I've always felt different than other people and struggled to connect with them even though I desperately wanted to. I've struggled with my mental health for legitimately all of my life which I think has been a major factor holding me back. 

For a while I was okay at masking the loneliness, even from myself but recently I've made some positive changes in my life and for some reason it's made it more difficult to hide from it all. I've become more outgoing but it hasn't translated into anything yet and it's so frustrating because I don't know what I should do. I suppose I still have some issues to overcome. 

I'd struggled forever with feelings of suicide but I know I don't actually want to do it. I just want this feeling to go away. I want to watch cute animal videos and laugh but I can't bring myself to be happy. I want to be able to sit down and just watch a TV show but whenever I try and distract myself from my thoughts they just hit me stronger. I don't know how much longer I can go on because my future just looks bleak.

I've come to realise that I don't want anything too extravagant in life. I just want a nice, normal house with a normal car, a normal job, a husband, a couple of pets, go on a nice holiday once a year and have a couple of hobbies to fill up the rest of the time. Am I asking for too much?

I have trouble doing so because of trauma and I was raised without love so I don't really know how to go about it. My parents weren't really the best people to rely on when it comes to this, domestic violence, manipulation, fear, mental, physical and emotional torture was my comfort. As child I was also really saddend living this way, envying others who didn't have to slit their wrists and be hospitalized for an ounce of care, who didn't have to be encouraged to take their own lives, I don't know if you would call this tough love, but I really wanted everything they had. 

But over the years, I have grown to like this mistreatment, I am no longer envious but it does sadden me at times when I do come across someone with loving friends, partner and family with a lot of wholesome moments, I admire them for it and I'm actually happy for them. Nowadays in my isolation, I always found it strange how they can confidently tell their loved ones how much they love each other, it's astonishing, it's surreal to me and leaves me confused. I try to be better than my past by pushing myself to be more expressive, but I always get discouraged and ridiculed by those around me because everyone only knows me as silent, cold and empty and it makes the whole atmosphere uncomfortable for everyone including myself as I am not used to it, it makes them sick and prefer I stop.

I love music. It is how I describe my mind and soul to those who will listen. I listen to it to get pumped or cry or have cathartic experiences on the highway.

But, now that I've drifted to this new level of loneliness I have noticed myself setting boundaries. I only let myself listen to surface level lyrics. I avoid music that deeply covers love and death - usually my favorite.

Today I wish I could go back in time and smack myself. When I got into university I finally met my first love. She was super into me and I was madly in love with her. Our relationship wasn't perfect, in fact in hindsight it was probably toxic, but at the time it didn't matter. She made me happy. Those were the best 8 months of my life until we both got out of school and she confessed to sleeping with and having formed a new relationship with her coworker.

I've had a couple girlfriends and a handful of dates since then but they fizzled out relatively quickly, with the longest one lasting a month. Women that I actually connect with and are attracted to are very few and far between. I've now been single for over a year, and not from a lack of trying.

I miss how it feels to have a loved one lay next to me, or to hold and be held by. I miss those little moments where you look into the other person's eyes and feel connected with them on a spiritual level. Spending all day with someone and never growing tired of their presence. Missing them when they're gone, but being excited to see them again. And of course, I miss making out.

I just ask you give me a chance and try to chat with me. I do have discord if you'd rather switch to that. Whatever is easier. If you choose not to talk to me then I hope you read this and still hope you have a wonderful day/night 
Also I will text if told to give my number.

hey there! i know this is the internet and no one cares but I really have no one else to tell this too.

about myself: Im a male (18) half Russian and half Latvian. I've lived in London for nearly 10 years (more than I lived in Latvia) , im an average build, dark nutshell hair (went bold 3 weeks ago), blue/yellow/gray eyes. I mostly like art and crafting etc ( more in my profile) i also play trummpit, guitar/bass and drums. I'm social, but also antisocial. I like to make others around me happy, i like to see my ""friends"" happy but... idk. doing college right now my last year, and from there ..... im also dyslexic.

I honestly dont know.. like lately ive just been empty inside. like hardly anything brings me joy in life, even tho I got sexy pc set up, sexy desk that ive done, seemingly a lot of friends but mhe, I got so much tech around my room and so many games to play, however ... like I just feel nothing. i got no one to talk to, no one to meet up with. It seems that im always on lonely vibes. Here I am seating at 4am was just doing nothing, just listening to music and staring into the void. i was never lucky in the relationship side as well. Every time im trying, but its just one-sided. And the only person who seems to understand me is BMTH. ive been listing them since 2013 or 2014. and i thought I understood their lyrics before, but not its getting a different meaning, lonely feeling. As i said previously im on my last year of college before Uni or apprenticeship, and i love drawing landscapes, or just drawing and making things in general, but im not sure anymore :/ im just losing interest in everything, absolutely everything, and i dont know what to do. dont want to open up to be hurt again, but also dont want to push others away. im always walking with a fake smile around college, but i soon im not around anyone ik it just nothing, not a single expression. i just feel like im falling apart. Most of mine dopamine ive been getting from smoking weed, listening to music, scrolling through ticktock or Instagram. i just dont feel right....anywhere!

well at list its better somewhere else. Im not reading what ive wrote, i just let it be how it is. If you did manage to read all of this! congratulation, im being honest if not oh well... as i said, i needed to let this all out and i never get too much attention anywhere so its doesn't matter cause im just a male.

2045,trollola97,1629254896,1,"I'll try to break this up, but bear with the long post ahead.

For the past few months now, I've been feeling lonely and like no one really cares and that there is nothing to be done about this. Ever since I graduated from university, I slowly lost touch with all my school friends (especially due to Covid). I occasionally talk to 1-2 people from school and the only person I talk to regularly is my boyfriend. Between work, busy schedule, and Covid restrictions, I don't ever see friends outside work. Even with restrictions loosening, I haven't had the chance to meet up with people besides my boyfriend. But even then, none of my friends have contacted me much to try to meet up. I've stopped caring about going on social media and trying to keep in touch with people. For awhile, I was getting along quite well with my coworkers at my current job since a bunch of us are around the same age and we seemed to have lots in common. But lately, the dynamics have been off within our group and I don't know why. One person in particular doesn't want to seem to want to talk to me now (and we didn't even get along that well before either). And it just makes me wonder if something is wrong with me, if I'm unlikeable or what.

I will add two notes which are

1. I have never had my full driver's licence so not being able to drive really restricts my freedom to go out and do things with people, since I either rely on my parents or the person I'm hanging out with to drive me (and I feel bad having to ask all the time). This has been quite frustrating since I moved back home (I took transit everywhere at university, but the bus in my area is not as easy to take). I did get my G1 last year, but due to all the lockdowns, still haven't gone yet for my G2 road test. I have it booked for late September and have been trying to practice, so hoping I pass and this will help me gain some independence.
2. Due to varying health problems over my lifetime, I get fatigued very easily and can't do too many social events in a row. I have tried remedies as recommended by my doctors as well as basic things like getting enough sleep, exercising, consuming less caffeine, sugar, etc. What does baffle me is that things like studying for an hour or exercising intensely throughout the week don't seem to wear me out compared to hanging out with a friend or going out for hours at a time. My thoughts are because I am more introverted, and these more social situations are more tiring for me. But it is still frustrating when I really want to hang out with people and I choose not to because I know I'll be too tired to do so or to last through an activity.

There's a lot more I could say, but that's the gist of it. I'm not here to say I have no hope and I'm at the end of the rope, but I'm definitely frustrated and starting to give up (and not to go on, but Covid isn't helping). I'm usually a positive person and I don't like to complain (my life is very blessed in terms of having a place to live, being employed, etc.). But having gone through so many people who I thought would be friends and who ended up just drifiting away for various reasons has made me cynical. And I really love my boyfriend and I know that he enjoys spending time together, but he does have his own friends and I worry that I will become annoying if I don't have a friend group of my own. Any words whether it just be agreement or advice or whatever, I'm open to hear (literally just came on here to rant).",lonely,"I feel stuck and like no one really cares, just trying to find a friend (24F)",2021-08-18 12:48:16

It makes it worse that whenever I tried to meet people on forums like r/meetpeople, r/needafriend or r/MeetNewPeopleHere I barely ever get a message. When I do the conversation usually lasts for a few messages at most. And I know that I'm to blame, I'm probably the boring person.

I'm single for a few reasons, lack of offers is probably the biggest one, ha!
I have Vaginismus and BPD (EUPD) which is why I don't try to date as I can't have sex and I don't have the emotional ability to be in a relationship, so I can't have a relationship, I know I can't but there's a stupid part of my brain can't really stop thinking about what if....

I'm overweight with bad skin, no career, currently getting my B.Sci in Psychology, live with my mother, essentially I tick every red flag box going. And I could never let someone I would care about ruin their life by dating me. So more reasons why I don't bring anything to the table. 

And for most of the time I can accept this as my life and be OK but feck me, every now and then it hits like a punch to the throat. 

Like tonight, scrolling in Reddit, and two silly threads, one about what people find attractive  and the other one about sex and I started crying. I just feel I walked by a party where everyone  is having an amazing time and I'm locked out.

2097,throwgoal,1629228692,1,"Hi, i'm a guy in mid twenties. I'm stuck in life. I want a relationship first. I believe it will give me strength and motivation to work on my career. 

Idk what's good about me or how I will attract a woman.

I don't have too high requirements , i'm ready to compromise. 

I have this urgency to find relationship because i'm nearing late twenties. After 30, my hair will start balding, i'll lose libido. Also,  it's very lonely and sexually frustrating without a partner. I don't want to go to a prostitute because of lot of reasons but primarily becoz I don't think my future partner would like such a history of mine. And I wouldn't be able to lie to someone about my past if I really love her.

Also, my career path and family situation is highly confusing. I need a wife's guidance in that.  Because I am not sure what's the right way for me to earn money.  If I know my partner's desires, lifestyle, financial situation,  etc, I can tailor my path accordingly for her. 

Because I have no personal desire for money,  except to provide for the girl I love. Nothing materialistic excites me. Cars, foreign vacations, jewellery etc don't excite me. I don't care where I live, what I wear,  what my status/respect in society is. 

And if i'm unable to earn money in future and my savings finish, i might not have strength to continue anymore. I'll of course try my best to find a career,  but sometimes,  even high efforts don't yield results. So, i'll just ask her to find another partner for herself,  leave her some money as a compensation for the inconvenience I caused to her and exit from her life.  I'll of course tell her all this in initial stage only,  well before she gets too emotionally invested. I don't want to break anyone's heart.

I believe in doing things for my loved one. I want to maintain my fitness and put in effort to please her sexually.  I want to make her feel loved emotionally and logically try to understand her life issues and empathize with how she feels.

I'm a college dropout.  I won't get a job easily,  most require a graduation degree.

And i'm not motivated to,  until I find a relationship. It's like I need support of a partner to give me the drive and reason.

Can't poor people marry? And i'm not hard fixed on marriage/kids. Even medium term relationships would do.

Right now, since past 6 months,  my whole day goes into messaging people on reddit.


I am alright looking.  (6/10 ) in looks.
I'm tall, fit.

should I attract someone on basis of my looks or words?  Should I show my pic right in beginning or after talking for a while? 

I really want to be loved and I have a lot of love to give. I have zero relationship experience. 

I have almost 99k $ savings (inherited )

And I'll receive a lot more hopefully someday... around 500k - 1 million $.

I don't have a job or degree

How should I present my profile?

YOU ARE WORTHY.   
Life has been given to you for the sole purpose of fufilling your hearts desire. 

Don't let this demon called anxiety cripple you, being sensitive can be a burden to carry but actually is a blessing. **Bless you for being such a pure and thoughtfull human &lt;3.**  
Living with anxiety has learned me that the internal thinking proces is scarier then the actual experience of following your desires. The only one that is capable of lifting the curse is our hearts will to move on, the strenght you house is unimaginable, remember that. Think, but try not to overthink as it seperates the body from the mind. 

If more people were as considerate as you the world would be a nicer place with more acceptance and love, I'm sure of it. Lonely souls are powerfull as we never take love for granted...

When I'm in my darkest moment the song **Reflection** by **Tool** helps, give it a try.

I admire ALL OF YOU for the courage to start the journey to happyness even though it may seem endless. Important to notice is, is that your destination is not the main point of interest but the path you walk. Be strong, do whatever it takes, YOU ARE INVINCIBLE. YOU ARE WORTHY MY FRIEND.",lonely,YOU ARE WORTHY.,2021-08-17 22:27:12
2134,Humzinilom,1629202255,1,"Just as many on here have spoken about having to walk away from damaging relationships, I feel it is time for me to leave this subreddit and I wanted to say why, in the hopes that it may help other people, even in the smallest of ways.

We have all the phrase, ""you are what you eat"" and in terms of our physical health, there's no denying that our nutrition has a huge (if not the biggest) impact. However, I think we need to broaden this phrase to ""you are a product of what you repeatedly consume"".

Repeatedly consuming content that makes us feel inadequate, whether that's social media, or constant negativity will have an impact on our mental health. We may not notice at first, but it definitely builds up. Constantly engaging, whether actively or passively does feed our feelings of inadequacy, contribute to a sense of hopelessness and will lower our self-esteem.

This place was (to me anyway) supposed to be a place to vent and receive support and comfort during difficult and lonely times. Very few people engage, especially when you message other people on posts, and while other people's priorities are none of my business it does seem counter intuitive that on a community for lonely people, no one replies to messages that they asked for on a post.

Additionally, the attitude of some commenters (as with anywhere)but is particularly common here can be quite discouraging. When someone shares a story or a moment of pain, it's very common to see in the comments, phrases like ""you lost me at having x friend/s"".

Of course we would like as many people to understand us, especially during a very difficult time in our lives, but the reality is everyone's lives are different, everyone's pain thresholds are different and every suffering, every pain, every grief is unique in its own way and in how it affects each person. If you're looking for someone who understands every single thing you've been thinking and suffered exactly the same things as you and has improved their lives in the way you have, I'm sorry to say but it's really unlikely. We have to learn from others, but ultimately make our own path, there is no carbon copy for us to follow because our values, our happiness, our pain is all totally unique.

Life is never all positive and I would not encourage people to fake happiness or positivity, especially during times of extreme suffering, difficulty or depression. No one solution works for everyone, but there are definitely better and worse things we can do. For me personally, this subreddit didn't help me as much as I believed it could. 

I know this post will probably tank my karma with down votes but I feel like it really had to be said.

This sounds like a rant, and it probably lowkey is, but I just want to say I may not understand you or what you're going through, but as humans we all do want better quality of relationships, better connections, and we all want to try and heal ourselves from whatever we are going through and so I wish you all the best in your journeys.


Tldr: I'm leaving this subreddit for various reasons as outlined above but I really wish every single person reading this healing and contentmentüíö.",lonely,It's time for me to go....,2021-08-17 22:10:55

I just never had the balls to ask anyone out except for one of them, who said she was already dating someone else. 

Now that I'm out of school for good (about a year now), I have no idea how or where to meet anyone.

I had this girl for 2 classes and then one day we wound up talking about an exam and we hit it off pretty well so I knew we were on the same page about being romantic with one another but before all of this, I observed that she was going through a similar thing in her life because she was obviously an outcast and whenever I would look at her she would have the 1000 yard stare and a real bummed out face ect.

It wasn‚Äôt until we were partners for a lab that I actually got scared away from her because her behaviors would fluctuate and she had made a few comments about a cadaver and another while dissecting a brain that made me sick so I distanced myself from her.

Even though I actively avoided her I was still pondering on wether I should chase her or not but I ultimately decided no because if I didn‚Äôt like her for her then I wasn‚Äôt going to get with her just for my gain.

But I was feeling lonely, so I forced myself to like it, I wanted to be the kind of person that enjoys things like that. And I kinda fit in when I'm drunk: made small talk, jokes, one of them told me I was definitely gonna be invited the next time. Hell, I even made out with a girl, she was wasted and not really my type but it happened.

I thought all of that was gonna make me feel loved, desired, part of something. Why do I feel worse? I feel like shit, an absolute piece of shit. Used, abandoned, alienated, and even more lonely than I was before I went to that...little hell.

I'm ashamed, for all the ways I degrade myself trying to build a social life, and this wasn't how I was planning to end. I just wanted friends to listen to music, get into quirky adventures, being send a weird meme and just vibe somewhere.

But apparently I can just make friendships based on alcohol, with really self-destructive results.

And I'm gonna do it again, because at the end of the month, when this feelings burned out, I will just feel lonely again.

It is all I think about, it stops me from doing anything productive, and it makes me feel like shit because I know deep down a relationship is impossible. There was a chance for a meaningful platonic relationship underneath all of the crud, and something I cannot control is ruining it.

It's not like middle school anymore, where you could just go along with it and have it be a fun thing---it changes the way you interact with them, whether you like it or not. I feel so powerless. Depression, at the very least, is something I feel like I have some control over---I can work on myself and become a better person. This, on the other hand, is a completely untameable whirlwind of emotions that I am just sucked into. There is no escape from it, save for confessing, which would without a doubt alter the relationship forever, most likely not in a good way.

However, I have been using dating apps for almost three years and at most I had only four matches a year and most of them were f bots and scammers. I only went on one or two dates throughout my entire time through online dating. Before anyone challenge me, yes, I have tried multiple dating apps including POF, Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and OKCupid. I have tried taking more flattering photos of myself and my hobbies. I have repeatedly worked on my bio. And yes, I have lowered my standards (the bar is already very low to begin with).

Seriously, all of this constant rejection is seriously damaging my self-esteem. I even had to take week long breaks from dating apps just to preserve whatever self-worth I had for myself. Online dating (and trying to date in general) seriously makes me feel so worthless as a person. I feel such a horrible person completely underserving of love and companionship.

It will be a number of years before i can even bring forth the prospect of a partner, since i will have to gain nearly 40 pounds to look human, then on top of that, get fit then learn to dress better then find a woman who isnt neurotic and then find one who is single and also find one who wants to even be with me. Looking at this long todo list, id be amazed if it ever even happens.

2257,PerformanceComplete7,1629139123,1,"I‚Äôm 31f and making friends has always been hard for me. My older sister always had tons of friends and treated me pretty badly at home and in school. She told me she thought I was always showing off and trying to be the center of attention, so decided to always knock me down a peg. I was thinner, smarter, and more athletic but she also had her positive qualities which I think she failed to see and made her insecure and made me her personal emotional punching bag. 

Fast forward from that I got into a really bad relationship for the past 12-13 years and had two kids. During this time I was isolated from my family and didn‚Äôt have many friends. The few friends I did have they couldn‚Äôt relate and most jumped ship, the others were sick of my relationship drama. During this I had been homeless and when my mom refused to help me and after hearing the nasty things my sister was saying about me I stopped talking to them. 

Now to Present day, I‚Äôm in an amazing relationship and am finally stable and happy. I‚Äôm working on the things like getting a license and getting another job (thanks COVID) I have no one to share this with. I‚Äôm rebuilding the relationship with my family but your mom isn‚Äôt the same as a friend. I went to a cook out and I just can‚Äôt handle pretending to be nice or having a relationship with my sister after everything that‚Äôs happened. I‚Äôm just so damn lonely. I can‚Äôt be around her and essentially not being around her means my other cousins. After years of animosity no one wants to set the record straight the just want to move on and I can‚Äôt move one knowing I never got to say my side of the story. 

I have no idea how to make friends and coming from a toxic family I can‚Äôt turn to them either. I just feel so damn lonely. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Without a car I‚Äôm essentially not able to go anywhere and really have hobbies. I don‚Äôt like to do things on my own so I just sit at home. I‚Äôve given up because I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

The summer was supposed to be great, best summer yet, even though I'm stuck in my house cause my mom is scared we'll catch COVID. I was fine with being home all the time, I don't have many friend so I didn't mind being inside. Me and my online best friend planned a grea tsummer fo tlaking all the time, it was going to be great, calling everyday etc etc. But then summer starts. It starts great, it rly does, then a few weeks in, she goes into a depressive episode and doesnt talk to me for a few days. i understand her completely, so I don't get mad at her or anything, I let her take her time to come back to me. And she does. and so a week or so goes by, and she does it again. and this time, she tells me that she'll be on some, and thats its ok to spam her, she'll see it and most likely reply to some. So, she leaves. I spam her about my life, and this goes on for a week or so. As usual she comes back, yet she has no idea what has happened in my life, even tho I told her pretty much everything. Then this cycle continues of her being there and not being there, this went on for three months. Jumping to the present, She had done it again at the end of July, it had been weeks, since we actually had a full convo We claled once, but it was mostly jsut her tlaking about the person she likes. then after that call, a week goes by and she says nothing, She then sends a two minute recording about her crush and how she's going to go hang out with them. Cool, goof for her, I'm happy for her, so aain i spam her, and then after like three days of no response after she said she would be back and she would message me after she got home, she didnt, i was pretty pissed. so four days FOUR DAYS i dont say anything, nothign, nada. then she messages me like ""hi mads, ily and miss you, i'll be back soon, ope your okay"", i'm again mad so i reply with okay. and then the next day she's like ""ik your mad, yell at me"" like huh? you want me to get mad and yell at u? it took me a fulll day, btu I did, i wrote her two long paragraphs (which now looking back, i could have been a lot nicer) calling her out for leaving me and all that. and then on saturday, she blocks me, she leaves the group chat, and blocks the others from the group chat. at this point im freaking out cause im like, this is my fault, now she's never gonna talk to me again, so I message her irl bsf on insta, she replied to me then blcoked me, so now i think i've ruined it.

And now, i feel alone. we've known each other for over a yr, she was my bsf, we knew everything about each other and it took two paragraphs of me being mad for her to jsut permantly leave. I've gone weeks and weeks without her and feeling so alone, even thought I've surrounded myself with ppl online and it doesnt even fit the void she jsut left in me.

2267,codecrunchie,1629134661,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

One of them doesn't really care about anything. He's quite popular and has recently got back with his ex so he never has time to hang out with me. He either already has plans with other friends or his gf or he ""wants to take a chill day"".

The other one either lies, makes excuses or just ignores me when I ask if he wants to hang out. He likes to be alone a lot and is a bit of a hermit on some levels. If he doesn't wanna hang out with me I'd rather him just tell me instead of making up bs.

Theyre not bad friends though like we all get along I'm very close to both of them as they're my only friends (they have other friends but they're my only ones). I just don't understand why they never want to hang out with me.

I do enjoy my alone time and too much social interaction tires me out (I consider myself a bit of an introvert) but I still want to hang out with my friends and it upsets me that they barely ever want to hang out with me. Sometimes I find myself almost begging trying to convince them to come out when they don't want to.

Whenever I try to talk about me and show my feelings they change the topic or either act like they are interested and care but they just want it to end and don't listen to me. I'm not asking for a lot I just want someone to ask me how I am. I just wanna tell someone what I'm feeling and what not. I just want attention for a little while. I just want it to be about me for even a little bit of time. I just want you to ask me what's wrong when I'm sad. And my friends even if I'm crying they will ask me what happened and have no interest even if I'm crying.

2292,Accomplished-Result8,1629107960,1,"I was in the seventh grade when one day there was a new student in first period. I developed a crush on her slowly after seeing her. When the 8th grade started, long story short, I repeatedly kept on asking her out and the whole thing failed miserably.

Two years later, my family and I moved to another city and. I got ahold of her Snapchat and start chatting with her on there and apologized if I was weird to her and stuff. I was really surprised when she forgave me and said that she would've like to hang out with me if I was still around. 

We talked throughout the whole summer and the biggest problem was that I chatted with her literally EVERY SINGLE. DAY! I did not wanted to go a day without talking to her which led to some very awkward conversations.

Long story short, when the school year kicked in, we started talking less because she started ignoring my texts which led to us never speaking again. But then two years passed by and I decided to talk to her again (this was around the time the pandemic was at its peak). We ended up having one small conversation and then went our separate ways again because I was too scared of making the same mistake again. 

Its been over a year since I last spoke to her and I'm having heavy thoughts about talking to her.

Okay, so let's start from the beginning.
He is a very good friend of mine and he is actually kind of into me. But the thing is he doesn't know that i am a depressy kind of a person (which is the part, what i hate about myself) and i don't get to help much when someone else is damaged or feeling low.

He had an accident a month ago. And he was unconscious for for 15 days. He have had knee injury and head injury and had lost a lot of blood. He had acted very bad to the doctors and to his family and evryone else which is one of the reason he feels guilty. Secondly, this made his family to get into hard times. And all he behaviour because of thia accident and all still makes him feel worst. There had been a lot of things within this one month for now.

Now, he always feels guilty, sad depressed, lonely, every second of emptyness and all other things which could add on to these. And truly, i try to help him so hard but from his side, i feel i don't help much. And as far as i know, he expects more from me, he somewhere wants me to help him in any way. But for all i know, first off, i am suffering from my own things by my own, and i don't think that telling him about it would help. Cuz, for him what he went through was worst and don't want to get dissapointed on me. Neither do i want to feel helpless anymore. 

There's a lot if things he is going through, he needs to study, but he isn't able to. He has to get into a job post as soon as possible but he ua not able to concentrate at all. He says his mind and thoughts are getting him. And i feel so hurt from inside and I don't even know what he thinks about me, as i am totally bot helping him at all and that hurts me more than anything. I always think about him and his condition but always feel helpless towards him. 

Ugh! The thing is we live in two different states and i could have make him feel at least a little bit fine, if we were close. But harsh reality, we aren't close and he says he needs me. Plus, i cant go due to some of my own reasons. All we do is chat or call. And i have no idea how to help someone through social media. 
I feel that he is in a post traumatic situation. That is what i think after what all he keeps saying everyday every second and the way he has become now. He's totally changed( a different person, that I can't be friends with anymore, it gets toxic) But i still wanna be there fir him, I don't wanna betray anybody or abandon anybody just like that. I am not that sort of a person, to leave somebody at thier hard times.

No one who actually cares enough to ask if I'm doing ok. The pain is unbearable. When I leave the house, I see people. People with actual functional lives. People in relationships, with a decent job they don't despise, with a decent place to live. People who can afford to be independent. 

Sure, maybe no one is really that happy. But I doubt many people know what kind of suffering you go through on a daily basis when you're isolated. I live in my ideal world, where I'm able to talk with people. I'm able to do things here. I have a creative job, that pays for a place where me and my girlfriend can live happily. My girlfriend and I talk all the time, about whatever comes to mind, mostly. I have an outlet for being me here. But this world I'm describing is all in my head. And I don't know how to make it a reality. I know this isn't healthy behavior, but when you're cut off from social development for over a decade, how else am I suppose to cope? The alternative is not something Im willing to entertain.

I have to live day in, day out, with the weight that maybe I will never have any of that. Maybe I'm destined to forever live with my family that holds me back.

I got diagnosed with breast cancer at 27 years old, I had a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and now I'm on shitty drugs with shitty side effects to prevent recurrence. The woman I consider my mother (she was my foster mom for a little while when I was in high school and has been there for me for everything ever since) has stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasized into her liver and bones... her abdomen started swelling with fluid to the point where it looks like she's pregnant and the fluid has cancer cells in it. It's awful and she's so uncomfortable. My biological mother tried committing suicide last year and has been in a homeless shelter and in and out of mental hospitals. She got housing and has her own place now but she is poor, lonely, and depressed. I'm very close with my siblings but my little sister is still dating my ex boyfriend of 5 years (he cheated on me with her a few years ago and they've been together ever since) so I don't talk to her... Work has been so shitty because I was seeing someone who I used to talk to years ago but we lost touch for stupid reasons. We reconnected at the beginning of this year and it was great but when I found out I had cancer, I felt like I wanted to live my life to the fullest and so I made the decision to see multiple people. I mentioned it to him but I guess I wasn't as clear as I should have been and he ended up learning the password to my phone and looked through it and found out I was seeing someone else from our job and playful flirting with a couple other random people ( I didn't want to tell him WHO I was seeing because it was my business and I didn't want to make things awkward for anyone). He got pretty upset and I did too because I felt violated that he'd look through my phone like that. I have personal shit on my phone like everyone else does and it's just so upsetting to me that he took it upon himself to do that. He basically thinks I'm some disgusting whore now and talks shit about me at work. I never had any bad intentions with him and I should have been more clear with him but at the same time we were never in a relationship and I didn't owe him an explanation or anything else for that matter. We only saw each other for a few months... Now it's so fucking awkward. I have to see him at work knowing what he thinks of me.

2351,SportsMajor,1629080084,1,"I'm 19, so I got plenty of time to fix it but I hate being lonely.

I hate not having friends to talk to. I only got my family. I love them, but I just need some more interactions outside of the house. I can't get that at the park, I can't get that at college, I can't get that anywhere. I'm too nervous to make friends or I can't. If I do make a friend, they're never life-long. Either the friendship evaporates after a few months or it slowly fades away after a certain number of years.

I hate being single. I've had plenty of crushes throughout the years. Plenty of minor ones: people I didn't seriously want to pursue or rarely the thought that someone I would pursue is out of my league. I've had a few major ones, I say three but it's probably two given the circumstances. One of them I hit up through Snapchat rather than face-to-face in my school and that backfired (I didn't give up for awhile though, I had confidence) as I was left on read all the time and the other one I never broke the ice with even when they were dropping subtle hints on my IG at one point. That was two years ago though and I still run into them from time to time, I wanna do something but I don't think I can. 

I hate doing things alone. I go to the park alone to shootaround on a daily basis. Sometimes I get involved in pickup games, but those aren't the same as olaying with a friend. I go on walks alone. Those are nice, but sometimes being able to talk with someone while walking would be nice. I occasionally go to restaurants alone (or with my brother). That's nice, but it's a little awkward. 

I'm just sick of being lonely. It's gotta be me being shy. That's something I can't change is something I'd rather keep. I like being lonely at times, but I hate it a lot. I just have a hard time clicking with most people. I just gotta get through college alone, hopefully find a job, and focus on my grind alone. I love life, but this loneliness is the only thing preventing my life from being even better.

I will not say here what it was but I assure you I did not hurt anyone if that's what you are thinking. I am currently unemployed living with my mom, and I don't drive. It is very difficult for me to go anywhere. I have one friend who is disabled, they can very occasionally come to my house but it has been 2 weeks since I've seen them in person.
I have 2 long distance friends. One of whom has a pattern of talking to me for a bit, then ghosting me for weeks, sometimes months at a time. It's very hurtful and I confronted them about this a week ago when they said hi after a month of radio silence. They apologized but the other day I asked if I could call them, at first they said yes in a few, then they said I'm sorry how about tomorrow, now it's been 2 days with nothing.
The other is deep in a depressive state and hasn't responded to me in over 3 months when I try. Today I kind of selfishly said I wish I knew they weren't going to talk to me anymore, because our last conversation was so banal, I wish it weren't our final conversation. They lashed out and said they aren't talking to anyone, not just me and not to attack them.
My friends seem to cope with stress and hard days by withdrawing, keeping to themselves. This is hard because it's like the exact opposite for me. When I'm upset my instinct is to talk to someone about it. I think I overwhelm people.

2360,Glittering-Bag9935,1629075498,1,"Let's start from the beginning. The first quarantine hit near the end of my grade 8 year (March 2020). So from march to September, I had no school and by extension, nothing to do. I started to realize how big of a role school played into my social life and overall happiness. Sure, I hung out with friends every now and again (only when quarantine restrictions were less strict), many of which I don't even talk to anymore. But other than that, everything else feels like a blank in my memory. But hey, I can cut myself some slack for those wasted months considering how much covid affected everybody and how restricted everything was. 

Skip to the end of the summer, I was starting grade 9. Honestly, I would fantasize about the 'high school experience'. I convinced myself I could start fresh, make new friends, talk with people, create relationships, all that stuff. As you can probably guess, it didn't exactly go the way I wanted it to. The whole year went by in a blur, and at the end of it all, I just felt empty. I did talk to some people and I think I made a new friend too. But here I am, summer of grade 9, going into grade 10 and I spend nearly every day by myself. I desperately tried to find reasons to explain my loneliness, like covid restrictions, but they're nothing more than excuses and I know this. It's even more painful because I see people around me who have found friend groups and even romantic relationships. It seems everyone else is happy while I spend every day wondering to myself where I went wrong. I want to clarify that I have small friend group from grade 8, but I'm not that close with any of them despite how much we've been through, which alarms me. The fact i'm venting to strangers on reddit shows a lot about my current situation lol. Anyway, that's a whole separate topic. 

All in all, I'm just scared that nothing will change in grade 10 and the years to come. I dearly hope things get better from here, but I don't want to get my expectations too high because idk how I'll react if my hopes getting crushed again.

2364,Rich_Carpenter2730,1629074340,1,"I lost my best friend to cancer and I can't get past it. We met through mutual friends and had similar charitable interests. The funniest thing though is when we were introduced we hated each other. The impression we had was of a cocky asshole trying to live off of a charity. I never thought he would defraud or steal from the organization, but he was definitely in it for the money and not the cause. He told me years later that not only did he feel the same way about me, but he tried to convince our mutual friend to remove me from my board seat. I only bring that up because over the course of about a year  we became inseparable. We were always together, personal time and business, if you got one the other wasn't too far behind. It was about four years later when his doctor sent him in for a few routine tests. It was about a week after the results were in he finally told me about the mass they found in his stomach. Without getting into to much detail, our relationship didn't  really change. I was with him through the treatment and helped him when he couldn't help himself and that sort of thing. He was never an invalid and worked as much as he could through it all. I never felt like a substitute care giver and he never acted like a cancer patient. Obviously things didn't stay like that for long, there were times his wife wouldn't allow visitors, he wouldn't take my calls and it seemed as though everyone around us had an opinion about his case but hadn't talk to him or his wife in months. When the chemo was done the doctors felt good about surgery and everything was getting back to a normal routine. Slowly we started doing things we loved again,  playing golf mostly but other things too. Our first time out on the course after the surgery was a great time, we must have went around the course at least 50 times. We didn't leave until they turned the sprinklers on us. He would tell me all the great news and progress he was making.  Through all of this, I would pass the info about his progress and the milestones he's reaching on to my wife because she has been a nurse for 15 years and could explain the things I didn't understand. Until one day after a long day of us working with our media guy and meeting potential donors for dinner, I come home to a quiet house, my wife sent our kids to her moms house because she wanted to talk to me without distractions. In a very clinical and professional way my wife of twenty years explained that everything I was being told about my best friends cancer and all his progress was a lie. She told me the stories didn't make sense and the progression of care would be different in this way or that. She wasn't guessing, just telling me how things really work. I had nothing to say, not one word came out of my mouth the rest of the night. Part of me knew she was telling the truth but I still didn't believe her. I never brought the conversation I had with my wife up to my friend, how could I. I was embarrassed to, how would I even begin to ask questions like that. It was the only time in our relationship didn't feel comfortable talking about something with him. Less than two months later he was dead, his wife told me what happened but we never told anyone else, as far as people were concerned, he took a nap on the couch and passed in his sleep. Since that day I haven't had a personal or private conversation with anyone. My wife and I are close and we don't keep secrets, but I can't open up to her in the same way, not about everything. Things happen in my life I want to share with someone, or I have something I unapologetically want to bragg about, those are times I miss him. It's when I need to talk about something private or personal, times I'm at a loss and don't know what to do. Those are the times I feel his absence, an absolute hole in my life I can never fill.

Please read my post well so that you can understand what I'm looking for! üôÇ

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately.We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. I feel like fallen into the same old dull routine.. My wife is gone for the next two days, so i have a lot of time!
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other.

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday üòä

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, many of us lose the ability to express ourselves as freely as we once did. However, deep down inside we all still yearn for the freedom that the child embodies and for his unbridled spirit.

In a world where most are bound by rules and restrictions, there is nothing more attractive than a person who retains the ability to act freely with unapologetic authenticity.

TW: depression, abuse, suicide 

I'm going through a lot today and I just need to talk it out with some strangers. I know this isn't r/relationship_advice so I will keep the backstory brief. I am living with my bf of 2 years, after we moved in together 1 year ago due to COVID and work opportunities. FF one year, I now have the job holding us in this particular city and he no longer needs to be here. Despite being the breadwinner, he is staying for me and we love each other. He however, has a terrible mean and grumpy streak tied to his ever-failing sleep schedule and dependency on Adderall. At least once every 14 days for the last year, I deal with being called names, being ignored, being told to shut up or otherwise disregarded. This disregard leaves me in dark places and though I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, I have been feeling especially hopeless. Two days ago he saved me from a half-hearted S-attempt that I think was more me trying to get him to care for me than for anything at all. For a brief moment he did care, and after we woke up together \~24 hours later -  he called me a selfish bitch, said I ruined his weekend and that he didn't want to see me. I am here out of love, but I am unable to understand if staying with him is safe or smart. I know many women have dealt with partners like this. But I also know many people have not. Everyone has different limits, and tomorrow will be better. I believe that. I guess I would love to hear any stories of perseverance to pull me out of this lonely, dark place.

I honestly cannot believe how selfish, uncaring, and heartless people in this family are. The majority of them didn't even acknowledge me. I have been suffering from depression as well as other physical conditions for years and not one time has there been any sympathy extended to me. And the two people who did do something got me a gift card that I'm not going to ever use when they are well aware of how much I struggle every day and my desperate financial situation. Rather than taking a trip to another part of the country like I wanted to do I'll remain stuck exactly where i am. 

This is all so unreal to me like I dont even know these people anymore. Its like a personal hell has been created just for me and the devil knows all the right things to upset me more everyday.

I have told people in my family how unhappy I am here and how much this place contributes to my depression but they do nothing to help me. They have stood by while I struggled and suffered for years. They have lost their humanity. They get to move on with their lives while I remain stuck in this prison. And they take for granted the partners they have not caring or realizing that millions of us are alone every day.

Fake and artificial creations of a system that continually exploits and manipulates them. Weak, spinless cowards who never stood up for anything in their lives.

I met this person through dating app in February, he was studying abroad so we couldn't meet up right away. We used to talk every single day for months and he was the only person from dating app that I had genuine feelings for. 

I poured my heart out for this person and made him one of my priorities, which was completely my choice I know, but I can't help to feel hurt with the whole situation..I still remember that he said he wanted to have me in his life, looked forward to the day we meet, put interest in how I've been. How I got excited everytime I saw a notification from him, got up early on the weekend because the time gap just so I could play with him the game that he bought me..how I was happy when I received his personal poems and took hours to interpret them, trusted him to share a vulnerable side of me, listened to him and made him personal playlists when he was overwhelmed, prepared handmade gifts that I made wholeheartedly for the day we meet, being there when he was so lonely there, I could go on but I will just stop here.

Only to watch him slowly slipping away from me after we met once and he said he wasn't ready for another relationship because he was still broken hearted (he fell for someone else not long before we met). I know he was truthful with the broken hearted part, but deep down I know the real reason is he just never liked me that much and my feelings were unrequited the whole time. And he doesn't need me here, he has a lot of friends here. I almost cut him off immediately because I was afraid I couldn't maintain friendship with someone whom I had feelings for, but had that convo that we were willing to 'work on the friendship first'. Anyway he asked me to meet up again after that, suddenly became passive in his answers after we met and never reached out to me again since then. It has been a month that we haven't talked. He just posted on ig some memories with his friends here and about leaving back to the country, but there's no even a goodbye from him to me.

The realization hits me hard..I wonder how can I be such a vulnerable being and over value relationships that I have. The fact that I'm so needy and value him, but I'm meant nothing and he doesn't even need me. I must just be another person from dating app to be forgotten. I feel like a joke and a complete fool for having these stupid feelings.

I don't expect this post to be a frank success but it's just that I find it more useful than a random rant (nothing wrong with rants though, I also did post some)

My high school friends all went through college and made a bunch of new friends from there, as for me since I dropped out right after starting uni and pretty much isolated myself from others, I quickly ran out of people to talk to on a daily basis, sure I see collegues when I go to work but the weekends feel awfully lonely.

It'd be nice to meet new people, but as in really getting to know each others, share our interests, goals, disappointments, favorite mcflurry flavor and whatnot

20 years old male here. 

*sigh*... 

Where do I start? 

I don't know, but it's gonna be a bit long. I just need to talk to someone right now. 

Life was great when I was a kid, but it all went down during high school, for reasons I won't elaborate because I'm tired of repeating them 

They say your ""teenage years"" are the best. Yeah, fuck that. They were the worst of my life so far. They were a waste. All I got was my high school diploma. Apart from that, nothing at all. I either lost everything or didn't even experienced what I should have. 

I had a very low self-esteem back then. I lost all my friends. I'm still virgin. I've never kissed a girl. Never partied. Never did anything memorable. Nothing. 

And since then, it hasn't changed much. 

Actually, it got even worse. 

I'm still living with my parents at the moment, and my fucking brother. I have no friends. This fact terrifies me,¬† yet, it's true. The few ones I have are on the Internet, in fact. But it's not the same. No girlfriend either. No fun. No joy. Nothing. All I do is work on my goals in silence when I manage to, and having stupid crushes on fictional girls because I don't even interact with anybody anymore. 

Only with my parents and brother, if I can call it ""interacting"". 

I basically stay home all day (except when I'm running), trying my best to improve my life during the day and imagining myself cuddling a cute girl in my fucking dreams, because that might be the only place I could ever do it. 

What a pathetic life I'm leading seriously. 

Sure, I'm high functioning. That means I can still do stuff and somehow manage to move forward. But trust me, it feels more like a curse than anything. It gives me a little bit of hope in this dark place. But what if it was all for nothing in the end? 

Sometimes I just look at myself in the mirror and wonder
how the Hell I ended up here, as if it was all a joke. Well, if it is, I'm still waiting for it to end. 

This life I've been leading for the past 2 years feels like a damn blizzard where I can't see shit. My days have been ALL the same. And I insist on the ""all"". Like, if you ask me
what I've done for those 2 years, I couldn't even answer, because nothing comes out. It looks so bleak. 

You know, I often think to myself I got into self improvement during my teenage years only to cope with the loneliness and sadness I was going through on a day to day basis. It made me feel like I was doing something with my life, when in reality, all I ever wanted was to go out with some friends and feel loved, for once. 

Yes, that's who I am. I look tough on the outside, never showing my true self to the world. But deep down, I'm lonely and depressed as fuck. And those feelings, although I try to bury them, they still remerge from time to time, just to haunt me and make me suffer again. 

And when it's too much, I cry my eyes out while hugging my teddies, just to stop feeling unloved, even for a second. 

When I thought my parents and everybody else viewed me as a brilliant kid back then, thinking I would go far in life... 

Little did they know I would turn that way. A fucking disappointing failure, that's all I am. 

Despite all of this, I keep going. I don't know how the fuck I do it. To still have this hope, inside. Perhaps because I don't really want to die for now, even though I thought about suicide too many times to count. 

I wanna keep going for as long as I can, just to see if I am really cursed in the end. 

Then... 

I don't know what I will do. 

I don't even know if I will ever make it. 

For now, I just move forward. That's all. 

I don't pretend to have the hardest of life you know. Far from it. I'm sure some of you have it way harder than me. 

It just makes me laugh to see people on social media saying their lives is hard when they led a pretty normal one so far. They complain about bullshit, and to those people, I truly wonder how they would react if they had the sort of life most of us lead, you see. 

Whatever.

Recently i been through a lot of bad shit and i thought there was no end to it. But there was. I found someone in my life who is a really nice person and brought happiness to me. Not only that, i finally had the confidence to cut off my ties with old ""friends"" who were massive negative impact on my life. The reason why i cutted off that contact is because i know them for 10 years, but they are not the people i wish to know my whole life. They were toxic, they were someone who i didnt want to introduce my new friends to because they would go great lenghts to ensure thst my new friends would be ashamed of me for stuff i have done in the past by making dumb mistakes. But these 10 years werent a mistake, they were 10 years of making me stronger. If not for them, i probably wouldnt be that strong mentally as i am now, i wouldnt be prepared for the hard stuff i am going to encounter when i am an adult (its less than a year until i am an adult).

In conclusion all i wanted to say was, no matter how hard life can be right now, it can become great sooner or later. You have to keep on living. Make sure you develop your body and mind by working out, reading books, taking up new activities. I hope this gives people hope and no matter what, DO NOT GIVE UP IN YOUR LIFE.

2443,lonely_xlonerx,1629024318,1,"I have not been feeling good for past 3 months. I just feel abandoned and feeling of being garbage. I'm not sure what's going on. There was a thing that has been bothering me these past months, but I'm learning to let it go. I used to distract myself by playing games and making pixelart. But in the last 3 months I have just lost it all. I dont get excited for playing games. And the artwork that I make is just so I know what is my mental state because it's the most depressing and disturbing things that I have created. So i stopped them too. As I felt this is just making it worse and that people may know something's up as I post them on my Instagram.

 So now I just sit all day and just think and talk to myself and stare at the wall and attend a few classes as I have to. But it's just been going down recently. I want to blame a person(girl) for this because I dont know but somewhere deep down the feeling of abandonment is because of that person but I know that's a wrong thing to do.I cant blame that person for not being there every single time I wanted her the most because at the end of the day it's her life and
she has more important priorities than me(obviously).

I don't know why I'm thinking of this so much but being not able to say all this to her is just eating me up from the inside. I just keep on having conversations about this with her in my mind. That's it that's all I can do. I cant tell all of this to her because it's my fault to be expecting emotional support from someone.And one of the hardest things for me is making new friends specially girls as a result I had only one female friend(her)

I had lost my mother when I was 10. I'm 19. I had managed this worst situation with absolute brilliance for my age even though I knew what was happening. I saw that dead look on my brother's face when he asked me ""what happened to mummy?"" That haunts me till date. But as due to all of these past months I have been missing my mother the most. 

If she would have been here I wouldn't be like this. I wouldn't have to expect emotional support from a girl. I just cry at night missing her. And all of this because I trusted someone to be someone I wish I had a girl or a women whom I can talk with, share my feelings, feel the peace. 

I'll have to wait more I guess to get that. I hope I'll be okay.

It starts raining.....few people who don't get in to the house gets wet and starts shouting because there skin is burning.

After that the Couple in there hoses is watching news and the news shows the un conference of living meeting....the decision is passed! Said the wife what have they decided how many poor people have to die this time!! Says the husband looking at his son! They have not yet decided which blood goes but probably blue!

No this world is divided in 3 blood types.The types r blue red and black the black blood is poor red middle class and blue rich.

The half population on the planet is cyborg! People have replaced thre body parts with mechanical instruments

Then we go to the teleportation community of World....it's coming sir we need to hurry up! Says the secretary of the community!! Ohh shit does anyone know about it yet .....says the chairman...no I don't think sir we have hid this from media.

Ohhk says chairman....let's get the selected people on board and leave before people know about it

Then the camera goes on a led tv behind which shows the foresight of a moon like asteroid coming towards the earth which can wipe humanity! Time to crash 17 hrs to go

The huge bang in the teleport room happens people r going to past they r going to time before humans existed on this planet....so they ultimately become the. First humans.

People r boarding the ship and praying!! Then there is a fight between a guard and a blue blood member about the seat the blue blood needed a seat to rest his legs while the guard wanted to give that seat to his daughter!

The guard and his family both r thrown out of the ship.
There r 126 ships like thisReady to travel back in past!! 100,000 years ago!


And the BOOM!! THE PRIMARY ASTEROID HIST THE TOWN!! THE ship contains people from all over the world rarely any poor made it in the ship!! The seats r mostly reserved for cats!

The world starts collapsing and submerging in its  own gravity!!
Billions of people r dead In a blink of an eyen

Out of 126 few ships blown away!! Few ships had taken off.....few r filled with poor who have murdered the blue blood!!

And the humans r going back to the past!! To start from scratch with the same knowledge but this time taking the tech from mother nature

I don't mean to make this sound rude, I myself am an introvert, I enjoy being alone, but, at the same time, I feel very depressed when I am lonely in life, but hear me out.

I have come to the conclusion that we might be on the short end of the cruel stick of natural selection, we are people that for whatever reason are incapable of communication with our extroverted counterparts, and will as a result leave the genes behind for the betterment of society, who must carry on in this world of ""happy land"" in which everyone gets along.

Just think about it, how many of us will actually reach the age, let alone reach the point within our lives to settle down and live a happy life? We simply aren't designed for this.

I think those of us who consider themselves introverts or introverted in nature should take advantage of the gift we possess, we don't need anyone to support us, and to be honest, the feeling of loneliness quickly dissipates once we come to terms with this notion, so why not take advantage?

I am incredibly self conscious and insecure that I can't help but feel that people are always judging me and mocking me behind my back. It's made my attempts to find a friendship or a relationship (especially relationships) incredibly difficult. Because of my insecurities, I spend the vast majority of my time alone. I feel like a perpetual outsider, almost as if I was made to be on the outskirt of society. I hate it. I can't help but be reminded of this Taxi Driver quote, ""Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. in bars, cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man."" Every time I see a couple walking down the sidewalk or a group of friends playing in a park, I can't help but feel this intense pressure and piercing sorrow build up in my chest and this quote rings in my mind. 

Despite being a man, I can't help but relate to the reporter Christine Chubbuck. She never had a partner her whole life. Her loneliness and depression was a pervasive force throughout her entire life, and at a certain point she had enough.

2505,_Luniella_,1628986277,1,"I grew up so lonely, man. I travelled constantly between two countries so I never had friends, it got to the point where I'd go on online games as an 8 year old and literally beg people to talk to me. I let myself get groomed to get any attention. I let myself get heavily abused when I was 13 to have a friend. Then I met someone, someone who made things not seem so bad anymore. We started dating, we were best friends, we were together for 2 years. They left 3 times during those years, but when they came back they were so determined to change. And at some point, they had me and everyone else convinced they wouldn't leave again. My family treated them as another family member. They made so many promises to me. We became synonymous with eachother, where you could find one you could find the other. Everyone always commented about how they looked at me like I was the only thing in the world. And at some point, I let my guard down. They were the only person I'd shown my childhood games to, the only games that really meant something to me. The games I'd been playing since I was literally 6 or 7 years old. We got married on both of them. I cried once because I felt like I finally gave little me everything I ever wanted, I was finally playing those games with someone I cared about.

We had a fight less than two months ago. It wasn't even that bad. We'd been through much worse. But they sent me a break up text over night and blocked me everywhere. Blocked everyone we knew too. I tried everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, in my power to fix things. Even though I wasn't supposed to be the one fixing them. I begged. On my knees.

I haven't heard a word from them in months, except when they played a sick prank on me with their friends.

They knew my birthday was right around the corner, they didn't even send a message. 

I got back on the game, on a different account because I genuinely can't bear having to divorce us. And today I played alone again. And I realized that I was right back to where I was as an 8 year old girl. Begging people online to be my friends, to just TALK to me. I had EVERYTHING I ever wanted. And I lost it all. And god knows life has never been so genuinely bleak. 10 years later, here I am again, reliving the trauma because nothing has changed. Sometimes it just genuinely doesn't feel like going on is worth it, and that's okay.

I can't even comfort myself anymore because everything that used to comfort me I did with them. Everything I cared for, I shared with them. I bared every vulnerability of mine, and I'm paying the price for that. I haven't stopped crying since I was playing and could practically hear them laughing over a map we used to play together.

I'm sorry, lil me. I failed. I tried really, really hard, and I failed again. I'm sorry. I thought I could finally have what we needed, what YOU needed. I made it worse. I'm so, so sorry. I don't know how you got through it, maybe you still had hope things would get better eventually? I'm sorry. I don't know when they do, or if they even will.

However, I have days where I really just feel lonely and like I am not good enough for many relationships. Today is one such day.

I'm in my mid-20s now, and so far, I have never had a romantic partner that I think I have seriously been in love with. Anybody I have tried to form a relationship with has either left in the end or rejected me. I have tried a number of dating apps-tinder, bumble, okcupid, hinge-and I always end up getting ghosted or unmatched. I have no clue what it is that drives people away from me. Am I ugly? Am I not cool enough or interesting enough? Am I too meek?

I understand pursuing romance is a pretty insignificant thing compared to the rest of the problems in the world. For me, however, it blends in with my issues of self-confidence and self-worth. Almost every single person I come into contact with-friends, coworkers, family-all of them have partners, and I don't.

I do have one friend but we poorly talk and he never messages me, so i always have to start the conversations. We never talk about feelings or things like that. He didn't even tell me that he had a new girlfriend for 3 months. Anyways... I fucked my relationship up very badly. My gf and i were together for 2 years. You have to know that my gf and i really often fight because she gets upset about pretty much everything i do, and sometimes she is right about what she says but often not. I take pills for schizophrenia and OCD what causes that i'm pretty empty most of the time. I dont feel anything. No hate. No envy. No joy. No love. And thats the problem i know i love her but i can only feel it in very rare occasions. So we fight a lot and she is often pretty harsh to me and i cant feel my love for her really often and thats why i always felt i'm missing something in my life. A couple weeks ago she told me there would be a sexual tension between her and one of her male friends, so i told her it would be okay for me if she wanted to have sex with him once so we could forget the whole thing. I also told her about my insecurities of missing something and that i can't appretiate our relationship because it's my first one, so she told me that we could pause our relationship to fix our problems and then come back together. I accepted but told her that she could always end the pause and that i would immediatly stop dating others. I went on a dating app but i didn't took it seriously. The weeks went by and i told her multiple times that i wanted to end the pause but she refused. She never slept with that male friend by the way. Yesterday she told me that i should go on the dating app and swipe some people so i did and there she was: the perfect girl, she was pretty, had the same interrests as i and lived in the same city what do you want more? It was a match. I started texting her and she replied. we had a great conversation and we flirted with each other. But it felt all wrong and at some point i told her that i don't want anything from here but that we could be friends. It was evening and i had to do some stuff in the house: cleaning up etc. And i didn't do anything because i chatted with this girl. My gf was mad af and we had a big fight. In this night i dreamed of the girl from the dating app. Today's morning i told my gf that i want to break up with her because we both weren't happy at all and we had a fight. She went to work and i texted that dating app girl that we couldn't even be friends because i dreamed about her. Then i deleted the dating app. When my gf came home she told me that the girl from the dating app were she all along and that i cheated on her because i flirted with this girl and dreamed about her. Then she broke up and now she is on a friends party and im alone and i have nobody to talk to... I have nothing without her, no friends, no nothing, and if i hadn't been so insecure about her this all wouldn't have happend.

2545,Majestic_Reading_755,1628971080,1,"I am the saddest I have ever been at the best point in my life so far.

tl;dr: I have achieved my dream at an extremely young age, I am the most attractive I have ever been, I am financially stable, I live in my dream city, and yet I feel more depressed now than I ever have.

A bit of background, I am a twenty year old actor from the south. I struggled with insecurity and feelings of sadness for the first three years of high school, but never to the point of considering myself depressed. Over the last few years I started working my ass off as an actor, looking for auditions and taking any work I could get hoping to slowly rise the ranks of the business. At the same time, I was working on losing weight, and was able to lose about 40lbs. I also got a job and started investing my earnings into stock. Fast forward to the end of 2020, I get a call that a project I had been auditioning for was actually a cover for a new Disney+ Original series, and I had been offered the lead role. I was speechless. I obviously accepted and signed a contract where I was paid much more than any work I had ever done, and I shot that series from early January through March in a beautiful location where everything was paid for and I was treated like Leonardo DiCaprio. 

As soon as I got home I felt so driven that I flew myself out to LA to meet with my management team, and they recommended I make the move out to LA. I had about $70,000 to my name and nothing holding me back so I signed a lease the next day and made the move about a month later.

I was ecstatic as 1. I had done what very few actors ever get to do, star in a major series that once released I know will bring me at least some sort of notoriety, at only 20 years old, 2. I had more money than I‚Äôve ever had in my life, 3. I had moved to the city I had always dreamed of living in, and 4. I was in the best shape of my life and people all around me constantly told me how drop dead attractive I am. 

That lasted for about three weeks. Slowly the excitement wore off, and I looked around and realized I had nobody. My girlfriend and I had grown distant, yet completely relied on each other for happiness, I had no core friends I knew I could count on, I had no schedule. Every day became wake up, audition for something amazing but that I probably won‚Äôt hear back about, make food, watch television, maybe exercise, and go to sleep.

It‚Äôs now been about three months, and I thought I had improved. I told my girlfriend that even though I really do care about and love her, I needed to be my own person, and we are now separated. I reached out to the friends I had and made an effort to make new ones, I hung out with a girl and there was great chemistry, my days were no longer aimless. 

But now we have my current week. 
I have never once thought of suicide, until this week. Not seriously, but I found that I could understand the despair people feel when they make that decision. After a friend‚Äôs birthday party this past week, I came home very happy. The next morning I woke up feeling more depressed than I have ever felt in my life. My only rationalization for this is that I‚Äôve been so happy to be out and socializing that after having such a great night, I woke up realizing that I had no idea when I would feel happy like that again. Because of this I reached out to friends to see what their plans were, and everyone was either busy or had plans to hang out with people that didn‚Äôt know me, therefore I couldn‚Äôt come. I felt completely isolated once again.

To make matters worse, the girl who I had gotten on with very well began messing with my head. I asked her out at the party, and she seemed very excited and told me to let her know what day I‚Äôm free so she could drive into LA and we could hang out. Two days later I texted her inviting her to a dodger game, and it‚Äôs now been three days with no reply.

The final nail in the coffin is that I forced myself to put myself out there and try to be the one to create plans. I texted the people I‚Äôve been hanging out with and told them we should grab dinner and then have drinks at my apartment for once, and everyone seemed excited to do so, even up until last night. 

About an hour ago however, people slowly started canceling. Their reason? They had all gone to Disneyland and because their day had started late they weren‚Äôt going to be able to squeeze in my stuff before going to a party. This fucking hurt. 1. I have been constantly saying how much I wanted to go to Disneyland since I‚Äôve moved here, and 2. I wasnt invited to this party. It‚Äôs a birthday party for a friend of theirs that I‚Äôm not familiar with, so I understand why I wasn‚Äôt invited, but it still hurts that I was not made aware of any of their plans today until they cancelled on me.

So now, I am sitting alone in my apartment, with nobody to talk to, feeling completely ghosted by a girl I was excited to go out with, feeling rejected by the people I thought were my friends, and with a bunch of alcohol that is going to go undrank. My show doesn‚Äôt come out for another 6 months, and I‚Äôm not allowed to acknowledge my involvement until Disney makes an announcement, so I am currently just a nobody. I am just so sad. I miss my girlfriend but I struggle with whether or not we should talk because I don‚Äôt want to fall into her being the only person I talk to again. I just want a hug.",lonely,I am the saddest I have ever been at the best point in my life so far.,2021-08-15 05:58:00

2556,burstEU,1628968595,1,"\*\*Important to mention that I have a twin\*\*

From 7th grade to 9th grade I was in boarding school, It was a really good and fun experience until it became a situation where the kids who lived with me, ate my food, slept with me became maniacs. People used to ""sell"" each other, telling and spreading secrets, acting like assholes and stuff. I didn't give up but my friends did, they left that school in the 8th grade and only our (me and my twin) best friend stayed, we were happy. We tried to ""survive"" that year and see how things would be but it got worse and worse until me and my twin left the boarding school too.

I and my twin moved into a school nearby our house and when we ""stepped"" there we knew that things would be bad, first of all, it's the worst school in our city, believe it or not, kids are smoking in the class, teachers don't care at all, cursing the teachers and the most important thing, \*\*NOBODY CARES\*\* even the teachers smoking and leaves us alone, this school is horrible as it's sounds like.

Currently, I and my twin would start the 12th grade on 9/1/2021 and we are unhappy about that, we ""survived"" two years in this school, without friends, with a shame feeling only because of the COVID-19. Now, In our country, the COVID-19 Is gone and everything is working, We can't survive this year even if we are 2.

It's hard without friends, everybody is having fun, trying to gather a lot of experiences from this age (17) and we are sitting at home, doing nothing for a full year.

After we'd graduate the school we have to serve in the army for 3 years, another hard system, I don't know what to do..

Don't get me wrong, I'm social, and charming and funny, but as soon as people want to get to know me more or develop things, I just bail.

The other day, I had the most beautiful girl in my office.

But even then it was tough when she started flirting with me. She visited me three times for work, and at the end of the last time, she looked at me and said ''I'm going now, and we're probably not gonna meet (she's from another town). Is there anything left you wanna tell me?''. I looked up at her as I started having my lunch saying ''Nah, nothing. Good luck to you'', and she left.

On one hand, I liked her, but on the other, she's marriage material (we live in a conservative society where dating is frowned upon), and I really don't see myself making that kind of commitment.

2567,Huge_Night_9156,1628962043,1,"Hi, 

33 year old guy here, glad I found this subreddit since I have nobody to complain about this, and my wife is an extreme introvert and just doesn't understand. 

So, all my life up until the start of worklife I had a solid group of friends, meaning primary school, secondary and college. They were more or less the same group, with a few additions here and there, and some people leaving with time, as is normal.

Then, at age 25, the time came for me to move to a completely new town, following my wife, which is far away from everybody I knew, and start my social life from scratch. That was when I realised I am not at all good at making new friends... 

The thing is, when I am talking with my old friends, I am interesting, we have beers and reminisce, but when talking to new people, I don't really have a lot of interesting things to say, and the conversations quickly dry out. I am not a very interesting person to someone who just met me.

So, for me, weekends and holidays are the worst. At least when I work I have some social interaction, while days without work are long, boring and depressing. 

My wife has 1 friend who she knows since highschool, and with whom she goes for coffee once every 2-3 months, and that is all she needs. 

I need more, I am a social person, but I can't get even that. 

So my social live is in fact very active, but it is all virtual... I type with my old friends constantly, of whom I have about 7-8. So I can type all day, but in real life I still have nobody to have coffee or a beer with, and this makes me incredibly sad. I drive my wife crazy complaining about this, but it really weighs heavily on me.

A relationship, in my case my marriage, does not fill that void of having at least one friend, it is a different type of communication that can't be filled by hanging out with your spousenor their family.

I am at a point now where I am very close to being one of those people who go to a bar by themselves. Not that I think there is anything inherently wrong with that, but if any of my colleagues saw me, they'd be surprised and certainly trash talk me. They all assume I have friends, since I am not an introvert and don't have problems with the kind of general small talk that takes place in offices.

I feel many people here are in the same boat, or at least similar. How do you cope with this soul-crushing loneliness? I've tried various hobbies/activities, they helped somewhat but never ammounted to anything regarding a better social life. I've also tried inviting people over  but everybody's busy, and I don't blame them. Like I said, I am not a very interesting person, what I am good for is maybe doing some activity like hiking together. But like I said, I've tried that and many other things, it never translated into ""Hey, let's have coffee sometime.'

Remember I didn‚Äôt feel sad a year ago? Yeah. I was lonely but I was invulnerable. I had no expectations from anyone. I was mindful enough to keep them low. 

A lot has changed now. 

I feel noticed. And ignored at the same time.

I feel heard. But not talked to.

I feel belonged. And yet distant.

I‚Äôve taken the risk of expressing my few thoughts. I‚Äôve taken the risk of expressing and triggering an unnaturally empathetic response. Turns out I am quite bad at risk assessment. Turns out I risked losing it all. Idk maybe I didn‚Äôt risk anything. In my defence I said I am bad at assessment. 

I feel my heart is keeping my chest from imploding and crushing the lungs. Each breath I take, I feel the pulse stronger. 

You send posts asking me to love myself to get loved, to be a friend to have a friend. But I've been there and done that. For 18 years of my life. Never hated myself. Never stopped being a friend. I've been a good friend to everyone. But no one has been a good one to me.

I don‚Äôt wanna be fixed. I am perfect. I just wanna be talked to. Is it too much to ask for. Is it too much when every friend I‚Äôve made, I‚Äôve initiated most of the conversations. I‚Äôve reached out. As if only I need them. As if they couldn't count on me in their bad or good times.

I feel no one hates me. But no one loves me either. 

I feel like a selfish person. A needy one. 

I feel vulnerable. And I feel you‚Äôve made me vulnerable.

Tell me you were angry. Tell me you missed me. Tell me you hate me. Tell me. Please. For the last time. Please talk to me before I talk to you.",lonely,A letter to my only close online friend,2021-08-15 03:17:04

I always wanted to have a close friendship, and I did have one in the past, but as I grew up I realized that the friendship was toxic and one sided, actually I finally fully realized it yesterday when I met up with that toxic childhood friend, I think it's because I finally know what a really healthy connection looks like, it helped me see her ugliness and toxicity so clearly. That meeting really made me realize that all the friendships I ever had in my life (which are not many to say the least) were truly toxic, and those ""friends"" never cared about me. I was always the ""sponge"" friend, that friend that you just vent to, use, and that's about it. I always felt so used, but I just wanted a connection so badly that I ignored it. I really long to a healthy, loving friendship that gives as much as it takes, and I hope that I can get that someday.
I try to better myself and work on my degree and my mental health, but man, sometimes it's so fucking hard not to crumble into pieces and fall into a deep pit of sadness.

2614,RomeoValentine,1628940657,1,"Hi Everyone!

This post is dedicated to all those of you who need to talk or vent to anyone!

If it feels like noone is listening to you, or giving you the time then know I am here!

If you feel alone or just want a friend to talk to I can be there for you!

Personally I have had my own struggles but I have lost someone I love to dark thoughts and I know they used Reddit so I have created an account to be able to make sure noone else is in the situation as helping even one person so they don't loose themselves or the amazing lives I know you all have!

I can simply be your venting buddy if you want, or we can talk about anything you want and feel comfortable about.

Please don't worry about reaching out to me as I will respond to everyone!

Lots of love and enjoy your day!",lonely,I Am Here To Listen And Talk,2021-08-14 21:30:57
2615,Elaurin34,1628940351,1,"Yesterday I was on a party for the first time in a while and I once more was reminded why I don't like parties. I don't like drinking and I don't like dancing.  But it was a company party so I kinda had to go. And so I just sat there in more or less awkward silence with other guys who werent allowed to drink because they were interns and didnt want to leave a bad first impression although I doubt that anyone would care. A workmate offered me to sleep at his flat and that we could play race games on his VR set afterwards so I didnt have to drive (because that was my excuse not to drink alc as always). And since - like most guys here - I dont have friends I really considered accepting. Apparently this guy was known for being super drunk in the shortest amount of time possible and smoking weed and I just cant deal with drunk and/or stoned people... so in the end I denied his offer feeling really guilty afterwards bc he seemed quite disappointed although he was - as expected - completely drunk.

Of course there were a lot of other drunk people who blamed me for not drinking anything or not dancing at all and that as well made me feel really guilty... because I could imagine that it would be a lot of fun if I could somehow overcome my social anxiety. So one after another came to my table and requested me to come inside to dance ""it will be fun"" but I denied  consequently and in each of their faces I could read their thoughts: ""fcking loser, why are you even here?"" Each of these encounters made me more and more disappointed in myself and made me feel down.

But of course there was this girl... I have a crush on her for as long as we both work there and she seems to know but for some weird reason she doesnt want to leave her current boyfriend whom she calls names on a regular basis. Well since I dont have friends and shes the only one who doesnt cancel contact with me I still chat with her almost everyday. It really is a weird relationship since she keeps initiating chats even after a while of silence but whenever I ask her to meet up and do something she comes up with excuses. Well I still can talk to her about pretty much everything so she knows that I am currently trying my luck with online dating. So to make the whole party even weirder she asks me to show my profile to her and swipe through girls profiles together... thats the fckig next level of embarassing: Your crush and you swiping on online dating profiles. And since she doesnt seem to feel emberassement she makes it so obvious that everyone now knows that I am online dating.

I hate parties. After all it wasnt super bad but as always I feel down afterwards because I was prisoner to my social anxiety and self hatred once again and on the next morning I am reminded how lonely I am because theres nothing planned for the next months and I am just wasting my time home alone waiting for something to happen. Im on vacation for a week now and I dont know what to do... most likely Ill watch youtube in my room most of the time.",lonely,I hate parties,2021-08-14 21:25:51

Loneliness is not something I would wish upon any person-even those who portray themselves in an unsightly manner- because in the grand scheme of things, it‚Äôs clear that all they want is companionship. But through this I realized why I have never been in a relationship. it is because those around me would not like to be with me.

Our relationship was built over friendship, we were best friends first and then came the relationship. She was my only best friend I could share everything with without thinking twice. 

When we broke up, the first thing both of us wanted was to continue being friends, we knew that there was no going back to the good old days but we could at least remain friends. So we did, at least for the first few weeks, we texted, shared memes, had the occasional phone call, etc. 

But over the last few months we've hardly ever talked, I've tried starting a conversation several times but at the end of it always felt like she isn't interested. It just feels so sad. Especially on days like these with WFH and COVID lockdown, it all seems lonely, even though I have my family around to talk to there's always a void. More than losing a relationship I regret losing the friendship we had.

 I've tried to keep myself occupied, picked up new hobbies, excercising, tried out almost everything the internet has to say on moving on but nothing has helped so far. They just provide temporary relief but never really fill the void.

Because I spent most of my childhood alone, I got used to talking to myself and not recieving any attention. In highschool, things changed: I'd found my group of friends, we would do fun stuff and become the center of attention of the class. Although, I was the one that was easily left out of everything. After some time, my friends would all hang out without me, gossip about me, make fun of me and bully me. After they started to take advantage of my freedom (my parents still work all day long, now they leave for the weekends at the countryside house, which I don't really love, so I stay at home by myself) I finally said stop.

I removed my birthdate from my facebook page and almost no one said anything to me on that day for the past 2 years. 

I simply asked for respect and equal effort and recieved depression and anxiety. I am overcoming them, I got into college and hope that things will be different this time. But this summer I realised that everyone I ever knew has their own group of friends and I am left all alone, in my parents' apartement, all the time...

Turned out to be a shitty experience in the end, good as it was while it lasted, I ended up falling in love with her and she didn‚Äôt feel the same way and the friendship is basically dead now. Now every memory of it is shrouded in pain.

Can‚Äôt make friends anymore, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just missing part of my humanity. Can‚Äôt connect to people and being around them just seems to piss me off and make me wanna be alone again. Bad as the loneliness is, I prefer it to the alternative.

Used to think it was sex that I was craving, part of me still wants it I guess, but after feeling way more alone and depressed every time I‚Äôve had it, I‚Äôm realising that‚Äôs not really it at all. Think I only want the emotional part of sex, which mine has always lacked, the part where you feel wanted. But I think I really just want a hug. Just wanna hold someone and have them hold me back and stay like that for as long as I need to. Just feel loved for once in my goddamn life, feel cared about.

And I know is toxic masculinity or whatever, but as a guy I feel pretty fucking pathetic for wanting that. Feels like as a guy, you‚Äôre expected to just want as much sex with as many people as possible, like it‚Äôs a measure of your worth or like you‚Äôre a failure for not getting it.

But it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway I guess. Even if I *could* somehow tolerate being around people enough to find someone, I wouldn‚Äôt wanna do that to them anyway. I‚Äôm not exactly the most stable person, can‚Äôt even hold down a fucking job for more than about six months without getting severely dissociative, depressed to the point of acute alcoholism and self-harm, or just straight up psychosis. Can‚Äôt ever give anyone kids if that‚Äôs what they want, not stable enough to trust myself not to traumatise them like my parents did to me, not to mention the genetic factor of passing this shit onto them, cursing them to feel this way. Not even sure I want kids anyway. But I can‚Äôt provide that for someone else. 

And I have more bad days then good. I know what it‚Äôs like to be around someone like that all the time. Especially someone with a history of suicide attempts. It‚Äôs almost traumatising. Still remember having to call the ambulance for my mum when I was 10. Not a happy memory. Still remember all the times I felt like I had to run home from school just to make sure she didn‚Äôt try anything while I was gone.

Sometimes I feel like I'll always be lonely. I have neither friends nor girlfriend, and no matter how hard I try to integrate i always have the feeling that I'm failing or just simply standing in the way/ anoy people. Then a few days ago I had a dream in which I had the perfect life. I had friends who i understood and who understood me, and we could tell us everything. We went on trips, did things and just had fun. And even when it was maybe only a few hours of sleep, it felt like I had known them all for ages.

 I also had a wonderful relationship with a great woman. She had her interests and i had mine but we still respected and loved each other.   


The shitty part was that i knew in that dream, that i was dreaming and none of this was real. When i realized that i would soon wake up (it was just a ... feeling) I took my ""girlfriend"" to a quiet, beautiful place and told her that this world was just a dream, and when i wake up, her and everyone in this dream will disappear and that i would not see any of them ever again. She asked questions like ""Would it hurt to vanish"" and ""If i would be ok"" and i tried to answer everything to my own ""dream creation"" as best as i could. I hugged her, and woke up.  


When i woke up i felt like crap because i knew i was back in my lonely boring real life. I think i cried for a few solid minutes because of the downfall of my own dream world, with my own creations from my own damn brain. it was gone.

Also of note I was only getting to know them, so it's not like I lost the love of my life, one of them I was about to end, she just beat me, lol.

My point is I fear given my situation, I'min a cycle I can't escape. I'm a creative person for my job, and I've also been stagnet in my weight loss for about 6 months now. I sometime stress eat so no weight loss, or I cant concentrate on work as I'm to worried about wanting a partner. I guess yes work on yourself, be comfortable with who you are, which I am. I am in a small town, want to move to the city as I moved to small town to be with my folks who took me in after I left my nasty ex.

I want to move to the city figured more people more chances (Also this town to small for most of my hobbies), but want to finish my big project and lose weight first. But as you read above this seems like a vicious cycle I can't escape. 

I'd love some advice please, especially if someone has walked in my shoes before.",lonely,"Is something wrong with me, or am I just so dam unlucky?",2021-08-14 03:56:33

2743,NielsLottibert,1628872085,1,"Heya, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately.We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. I feel like fallen into the same old dull routine.. My wife is gone for the next two days, so i have a lot of time!
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other.

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday üòä

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm waiting around for anymore. Nothing‚Äôs gonna improve cause I don‚Äôt even know what could possibly improve. Constantly lonely, got no friends, never had a relationship, only experience with love at all was completely fucked. But at the same time, for as much as that sucks, it‚Äôs also way better this way. Can‚Äôt stand people anymore, can‚Äôt be around ‚Äòem, does my fucking head in. I can‚Äôt connect with people anymore, I‚Äôve tried, really have, but I‚Äôm just missing some part of my humanity now. I‚Äôm too jaded for that shit. Even at my loneliest points, whenever I envision having a friend or girlfriend there with me, all I wanna do is tell them to fuck off and leave me alone. I just can‚Äôt expend the energy to tolerate people around me anymore.

I don‚Äôt have a career goal or anything either cause I‚Äôve fucking hate every job I‚Äôve ever had. Can‚Äôt do anything that involves dealing with the public anymore, just don‚Äôt have the patience. And now whenever I hold a job for more than about 6 months I either get catatonically dissociative, suicidally depressed and prone to alcoholism and self-harm or I go into psychosis. Either way I have to quit, cause I‚Äôm a complete fuck up. Nothing interests me career wise anyway, so it only really effects my perpetually empty wallet I guess.

I don‚Äôt look forward to anything, everything fucking sucks now anyway. Movies are just the same fucking garbage regurgitated over and over, all my favourite games I played as a kid either don‚Äôt get made anymore or have been iterated upon to the point that they‚Äôre unrecognisable and usually fucking suck. Even most of those feel the same nowadays, when I can even be fucked to get past the main menu without dissociating, getting frustrated and turning it off.

There‚Äôs just nothing. Everything good I used to hope for just ended up hurting the fuck outta me and turning to shit. Now I just exist in a state of limbo, don‚Äôt have anything but I also don‚Äôt want anything. Good shit is just bad shit in disguise. It‚Äôs just a fucking sick joke.

I have been in a serious long distance but we never met. I have never had my first kiss or anything further than that. Never even held hands before romantically. I have a low self esteem and I feel I am just not attractive enough for someone to love me. Or even have a fun personality. 

I don't have any friends either. I talk to some people online but they aren't the type of people I can really talk about anything to. I've never had any actual friends in person. Never hung out with anyone before. Never had slumber parties, went to the mall, out to eat etc with anyone. 

I was always sheltered growing up. I wasn't allowed to do much. I remember moving into a neighborhood when I was 8. The neighborhood kids always played outside and it looked so fun. I remember begging my parents to let me play with them. Even one of the kids knocked on the door and asked if I could come play. But my parents wouldn't allow me. They were ""overprotective"" and now at almost 20, my mom questions why I don't go out. Why I'm not social and have no friends. She is completely oblivious. She has sheltered me until I was around 16 and by then, I had already became so much of a loner that I gave up trying to be social in person. Instead, I went online where she couldn't find out who I'm talking to. I met some cool people. Some not so cool people. But friends come and go. I don't really have any right now. No one online I'm truly close with. 

I don't feel like I'm normal. My mom even says she wishes I was normal and did things and had friends, even though she was the reason why I didn't have friends growing up. She isn't one to take responsibility. 

I know now that I'm an adult, I have a choice now to mak friends but I'm too damn shy and anxious. I think of the worst possible scenarios in my head. I'm afraid of rejection. I tried making friends in school but people never really wanted to be my friend. I sat alone in lunch all the time and sometimes I would put my head down and cry. I felt undeserving of a friendship. I felt worthless. I stopped eating at lunch because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I eventually developed an eating disorder that I'm still dealing with today. 

No one wanted me. No one wanted to be friends with me, even when I would make the first move. I felt unwanted. 

I long for the day when I finally meet someone who I can lean on. Who I tell everything too and they can tell everything to me. Where we have each other's backs. Where we are each other's save haven's. 

I long for the day when I finally meet that special someone and share my life with them. I want to be there for them whenever they're down. I want to pick them up and I want them to do the same. 

I long for the day when my lover comes home and I greet them with a warm hug and kiss. 
I long for the day when I get to curl up next to my favorite person and cuddle. 

I long for the day whenever I'm sad, I can cry in their chest and they make it all better and whenever they're sad, they can cry in mine.

When I visit my country, we have fun like old days. I'm 21 years old. I moved abroad three years ago. I've met a lot of acquaintances, girlfriends, and closer friends. A long time ago, I realized that people just come and then go. None is sincere because when you're a foreigner, everything is temporary. Also, people treat you according to your nationality. The girls I meet often assume that I am Spanish and very keen. When I say that I'm from Turkey, almost every time, they get disappointed and ask provocative questions about Islam even though I'm not a Muslim. Once a girl invited me to her place for the second date, and we had a great and romantic evening. That night I felt a real connection. It turns out she thought that I was Spanish from the beginning and ghosted me when we were talking about our next date. So please don't tell me fairytale, racism is real.

We're not toys, we are human beings, and we have feelings. I'm not asking anyone to stay. If we met many times, kissed, made out, and so on, say that you're not interested anymore, and that's okay.

No matter how much I want to let you know that I love you, I just can't seem to find the courage to come forward, you have moved on. Atleast that's what it looks like because I haven't heard you in a long time and it breaks me. 

Everyday I feel low, but something just makes me want to cry without any predicate. I can't seem to live this life normally anymore. I've digressed myself from the daily life and people and I just don't know if I ever want to be back to this place ever. 

Everything seemed amazing until you found your true calling. I am happy for you and your life that you should have seen earlier as it was right in front of you. It still hurts that I confided so much in so little time and we never got a chance to even relive some memories.

2785,Icy_Example,1628835573,1,"Love hurts like a constant sharp stabbing pain in the heart. From what I can remember being sexually abused as a kid by family members I barely knew. Being touched and forced to kiss in ways I didn‚Äôt understand. People you‚Äôre told are supposed to be trusted and listened to. It‚Äôs always made figuring out what sexual and emotional feelings made sense. It‚Äôs hurt to have crushes treated as a joke growing up, admittedly childlike infatuations that for the time mistaken for love being driven away with mockery. Trusting for me is an optimistic issue. I want to see the good in strangers, trust that peoples‚Äô intentions are solely good. But trusting to love. Getting so deeply invested in someone, to care endlessly for them, having rarely felt something so real with anyone. I‚Äôve managed to find that trust to love. Doing everything i can when things felt right. Communicating openly and honestly. It‚Äôs felt like it was the only real thing. Only not to be wanted back. Hardly even a consideration or fleeting thought. Figuring out what is real‚Ä¶ what love is and how to trust has always hurt. Falling for someone who means so much, and them actually wanting you back.

2803,SomeForgettableGuy,1628828205,1,"I'm very lonely and really want to meet some people that I can really vibe with. I want to feel accepted and like I belong somewhere. I've never really felt like I fit in anywhere I go, and I've never had a girlfriend or a best friend. Right now, im dealing with a lot and I have to go through it all alone, and I feel the weight getting heavier and heavier every day. I'm not close to most of my family, and the only actual socializing I get is from online. 

I just want to be around actual people and have fun, feel safe, and smile genuinely. I want to be able to talk opening without fear of judgement, and I want to be able to give and recieve hugs. I want to have fun for once, but I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. I've never been able to make friends, and everywhere I go I'm always a black sheep. I want to be treated like a valued member of a community and feel like I belong, im tired of being treated differently, and everything thinking I'm weird. 

I just want someone to actually try and understand me, someone to know me, someone to care about me. I try to explain this to my aunt who is one of the few people I have in my life that actually treats me well and all she has to say is that ""I need to be that person for myself"", and that doesnt help me at all because my problem isn't that I don't accept myself, is that others don't accept me. I really wish I had someone that actually cared about me, but I guess at the end of the day the only person I can ever have actually care about me is myself? That's so sad it makes me want to cry. Why do I have to be the one that nobody cares about? My brother has a ton of people that care about him. My Coworkers all have friends and loved ones, but me, I'm all alone like I've always been. Why me? Why am I not allowed to have what they have? Why do I have to be a social pariah? Why doesn't anyone ever give me a chance?

There has been a few times where I'll feel comfortable enough with someone to show a hint of vulnerability about how I feel with life and I'm always met with the same stuff. People telling me that they do care, or that they'll help, or that they'll be there for me, but that stuff is always just lip service because at the end of the day they all prioritize their own lives over mine (which is what they should be doing), but in doing that they always end up not helping me at all and leaving me hanging. If I had a dollar for everytime someone told me they'd help me meet people, or introduce me to people when I've hinted at or point blank stated I was lonely, or wanted to meet people and then didnt do a damn thing, I'd have like 15 dollars, which is ridiculous considering thats 15 people who have effortlessly gotten the one thing I've wanted for the past 12+ years.

2 weeks ago after a 1 year break from attempting making friends online I told to myself ""I'll give it one final chance"" I made a post which stated that I was looking for long-term friends and preferably people who wanted to chat on a daily basis and to my surprise somebody answered and we clicked immediately, we would chat on a daily basis and overall we'd enjoy each other company however it didn't last long because today out of the blue they deleted with a message that said ""sorry it's me, not you and I must go""  


Even though we only knew for 2 weeks I really took a liking for this person and now I find myself here, feeling so crushed over the fact someone I opened up to and I genuinely thought we'd be friends for a long time. I miss my new friend a lot, I really do, I wish they would come back to me but that's a silly wish, it won't happen.  


It hurts, I'm in pain right now all. I've ever wanted in life was to connect and forge a deep bond with someone and just have an amazing fun friendship online with them.

Then everybody started laughing, cause they thought it was just a joke.

Then, it hit me, I just have colleagues I see at work. Outside work I have no one I am close to, no friends, no one. If something happens to me and I need someone to go to the hospital with I don¬¥t have a single person I can call.

I didn‚Äôt like where everything was going, but I also didn‚Äôt really try. I‚Äôm still depressed but now I really do want to move on with my life. 

Its been hard for me to get out of this cycle and lately I‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to get out of it. Of coarse my parents don‚Äôt really understand this because they‚Äôre Ignorant. Instead of trying to help me all they do is belittle me because they probably think it‚Äôs funny or something. And they constantly compare me to my sister. It‚Äôs mostly my mom who makes me feel guilty for not going out or doing something. Like today she talked about how hot it was and then was like oh you wouldn‚Äôt know cause you‚Äôre always in here. Keep in mind since I‚Äôm always home I‚Äôm basically expected to do the daily chores. I don‚Äôt mind cause I understand someone has to do it and they all work. But just cause I don‚Äôt work it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not allowed to be tired????? Every time I say I‚Äôm tired to my mom she says of what. Like shouldn‚Äôt she understand why, especially since she used to be a stay at home mom back then. My feelings are invalidated just cause I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù. 

My dad is better but he‚Äôs constantly also belittling me by making jokes about how I should do this and that. And my sister... she kinda understands but not really because she also disrespects me. She constantly goes out now and expects me to take care of OUR cats. They were  mostly hers but now I think they belong to me. She used to help out in the house but ever since she got a bf she just doesn‚Äôt care. Oh and she used to complain about doing a lot back then but at the time I was helping too. And now everybody expects me not complain. I hate it here. All of them have made it even more difficult for me to even want help. 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that they all treat me this way because it stems from their beliefs about work ethics and how their culture is(technically mine too but not really because I grew up with that American experience). That also plays into them not believing in mental illnesses or how they pride themselves in being hardworking and never lazy. (They kinda are) I‚Äôm just going through a hard time and they just make me feel bad about it. I really can‚Äôt wait to get my shit together and just leave them behind.

we all love that song right? Well, my life feels definitely like that right now! but hey, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately.We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. So i feel like in the song, fallen into the same old dull routine.. My wife is gone for the next two days, so i have a lot of time!
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other.

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday üòä

But I know they're both young adults who are working and trying to figure themselves out while I'm just here, unmotivated and unhappy. I'm 16 going through the biggest battle I've gone through in my life. Something I wouldn't even wish on my worse enemy. Because of it, I'm very restricted from doing pretty much doing anything outside. And what makes me feel even lonelier is how I don't have any friends, true friends my age. Most highschoolers are enjoying their youth with friends and making memories, but not me. I feel like even before this battle happened in my life people didn't really consider me their real friend. Because if they did they wouldn't have talked down to me, ghosted me, or not tell me things. I just feel I guess invisible to some people. Like will I ever find a group of people I can actually call my friends? And I have to be honest, I'm usually not a jealous or envious kind of person, but I'm kind of jealous at the fact that my cousins have friends and go out and hangout with them. I mean I'm always hearing they're going to the mall, to a party, to each other's houses, etc. Makes me realize just how lonely I am and how I don't have any friends. I'm tired of it. It's like before it was bad, but now that I'm going through what I'm going through it's definitely worse than before. I feel isolated in so many ways. I just wish I was different. I wish I was normal and did normal things. I feel like my youth is being robbed from me. My mom says I'm not missing anything but I know that's a lie I know I am.  I don't know...I guess what I'm trying to say is I wish I had people I could call my friends and wasn't alone. But if you read this dumb post to the end, thanks, I appreciate that. I don't have anyone in my life I could talk about this with so I thought maybe reddit would understand, but if not that's okay.

I am 20F,
I do not want to sound arrogant or sound like I‚Äôm better than everyone. I do not have friends. I do want them, but at the same time I don‚Äôt.

I go to work and get so bored of the conversations the colleagues are having. Most of the time they are joking about work, or talking about the work they‚Äôre doing. Or they complain about other people, or complain about public transport in the morning. Or when we have nothing to do at the moment people joke like ‚Äòoh yeah we are pretty much on a break now LOL!‚Äô, 
and for some reason I can‚Äôt laugh at it at all. I don‚Äôt care. Others laugh and continue making jokes about it, and I just want to leave. I actually get irritated when I hear stuff like this because I have to go into acting mode and act like its funny and act like I care. It does not come from my heart

I really do want to give a shit, but I simply can‚Äôt. I feel like I have to do so much work mentally and also show on my face as if I care. It tires me and I feel completely out of place with people in general.

I feel like I can‚Äôt be myself. If i do try to be myself a little more I do get looks like ‚Äòoh.. i dont know what to say to this...‚Äô, i guess i just have weird opinions.

It‚Äôs hard for me to have friends who I can be completely myself around. I feel very lonely. Switching work place is not going to help, it goes like this in most workplaces.

Sometimes I‚Äôm thinking of moving to another country, or pretty much travel the whole world (when I get enough money). But not sure if it helps my loneliness. This country does make me feel lonely when I just look at my surroundings (i live in the Netherlands), or its just the fact that I have no friends, that I feel lonely when I walk outside here, but idk.

Recently I got ghosted by someone who I deeply love. That also affected me a lot, i feel a void inside me.

I am looking at my call logs- every call has been initiated by me and has never lasted more than 5 minutes. I always tell myself- he must be busy, he will the next time.

I have fallen in love exactly once and for some stupid reason thought there was a chance somebody would ever like me. but she moved away from the country. She told me there have been very few people like me who are always there for her and she doesn't want to think about a romantic possibility since she's moving away. Why did she have to lie about it? After 3 years do I not deserve a proper rejection. Why did I get the ""it's me not you"" boilerplate answer? She said she doesn't want to lose a true friend over this thing. I said okay.

Most of the people I feel that are close to me at one point or another have told me that they couldn't ask for a better friend. The friend who himself calls me and him as brothers (mutually) hasn't called me since the last month. Don't I at least deserve a call every now and then not from some guy, the person who calls me his brother. Don't I deserve this after 4 years?

I have called/texted both him and her at least once every week sometimes 3 times. How come every damn time they're busy?! Okay they are busy by fluke. What's stopping them from initiating a conversation‚Ä¶?!!! I am just so tired, both the girl I like and the guy I consider to be the brother that I never had have abandoned me. 

I have come to terms that something must me deeply wrong me for nobody to like me back- romantically or platonically.

i think people can overlook how hard it is to go from rock bottom to okay. like they think the process is what hurts and why many people dont just get better. 

this is probably true.

but the problem is not knowing what to do once youre better, or never feeling like you can relate to people who are better, but people who are worse exclude you because youre not doing as bad as them, and they never knew you when it was bad, so they just think you're bored and pretending.

now that no one is dying or lying to me, other stress comes up, or realizations i didnt have the time for before keep coming up. like, maybe having to hide in the closet of our double wide trailer sometimes was a bit traumatic. or the pedophiles i never told anyone about. or the nightmares i've been having since i was young. 

then a whole new layer of stress is added when i'm surrounded by people who have always been well off. im happy for them, they dont deserve bad things. i wish i could relate to things they say. 

i think i reek of white trash. even though im doing well academically and about to earn my bachelors so early. even though i live in a nice house now. even though i can fake it for a while. 

they will still know and it will always set me apart. 

that's why i sought out old men before. not old old but around ten years older than me. i could tell they were the same. but you and i know thats no good.

2912,why-this-why-that,1628758592,1,"Note: All of my friends are online.


For the longest time I've hated why I'm always the one initiating a conversation with any of my friends. Each time the conversation would go very well. But I hated how nobody would ever start the conversation with me, or probably even think of me, until I had to remind them. Since I believed it to be true, I've suffered the full pain of it, and I know how lonely it can make a person feel, even if they have some friends.


Just earlier, I was replying to a post of the same topic, trying to say how much I relate. Then I realized some of my friends actually do initiate conversations with me. And to some of them, they are the one who always initiates it. I'm the one who never starts the conversation with them! I found myself not accounting the friends who do come to talk to me, and constantly hating why the other ones never do so.


Well, I've actually explained to myself about that by downplaying and finding excuses before. Some of them can be short-tempered, so I feel a little held back. Or ""I'm not close to them anyway"". But I do very much consider it worthy of a friendship. Plus, I have no problem with my closest friend (online) at all. Yet I'm rarely the one who starts the talk.


So why am I like the exact type of friends I hate? With some efforts, I got to see that side of the perspective. Well, I just feel, I don't have anything worthy enough to bring it up. But if the other person started the conversation, we'd usually branch off into some interesting topics. Sometimes it's can even be because I just don't find talking with a particular friend as enjoyable as spending time on one of my many hobbies. But that doesn't discount the friendship itself. I can respect someone a great lot and find reading a book more fun than talking to them.


In conclusion, I think I'm walking out of this hell. I'm glad to stop denying that I do have friends who initiate the conversations. Even better, I think I'm understanding the point of view of those who don't. Not to mention the existing reasons. E.g. One friend is literally content with being with himself alone forever. Another friend is so busy that he had to delay his girlfriend's call when talking to me. Anyway, I have been resentful for very long as I found hate familiar and comforting. Now I'm tired of hating. Some understanding genuinely feels nice.


Disclaimer:
* It's possible that none of this is true and I'm avoiding pain by being absurd.
* To some of you who actually literally is the one who always initiates the conversation, I want to help but I can't. There are so many people on earth, and some are just bound to be unlucky in a ridiculous way. But I know you will make sure that nobody has to go through the pain of always initiating the conversation with you.",lonely,I was wrong.

I just turned fifteen on the 5th. I invited my two friends out bowling and bought a bunch of party food (chips, cake, etc.) for us to eat at my place later as we played some Smash or something. They showed up, and then disappeared again after some other kids from my school showed up. After that, I went home, took all the food someplace private, and ate until I could barely move.

2921,No_Dimension_1668,1628753175,1,"I have been chronically lonely for practically all of my life. There, I said it.  
Growing up, I was ''different''. Never fit in with the popular kids. Still had enough great friends to not mind. Always kinda did my thing and generally don't mind things were this way. Really, I loved high school.  
Here's something weird. I am 24 and haven't had sex for 5 years. Yeah. I am a 6'3'', 7/10. It is not because lack of opportunities. Hookups were never satisfying to me and I learned to say no to women at the age of 21. Kinda proud of that. Many guys will live their lives thinking with the wrong head. That being said. You know whats weirder? I am kinky AF. If all thats on offer is sloppy drunken vanilla, I rather just stay home and read a good book on friday evening.  
Lets talk about love life. I wouldn't say I have high standards, because women from my past are no models. Since breaking up with my highscool girlfriend of 2 yrs at the age of 19, I have only had 3 women I genuinely have a connection with. They are all romance horror stories. :) I meet someone I like on average once 1-2 years, I think (Is this crazy rare?). Whats my type, you ask? ''Library chicks'' who dress very modestly. Something incredibly hot about the confidence in not needing validation from showing extra skin. Oh, and she must wear glasses. Cute and fitting frames is my cryptonite. Seems like a dying breed these days, unfortunately.   
If you haven't guessed it yet, I dropped drinking 3 years ago for various reasons and that is one the best decisions of my life. Not even looking back, I am a WAAAY better person now and have learned to enjoy life. Again, that being said, I had to cut some ''loser'' friends out of my life.  
Doesn't mean I am not social, lol. I volunteer for things and go to networking events. Funnily enough, I had a ''rich'' social life in college. I was dealing, but never ''indulged'' in the scene. I guess money motivates me more than carnal pleasures, hehe.   
Just next week I will go on a week long trip with my college buddies. Sidenote: they are aged 26-38 and even my dating preferences have always been women 1-3 years older than me. I just can't connect with highschoolers/students. IDK why.   
I am trying to get my start-up off the ground. It is insufferably hard to find like minded individuals. Partly because it is based on sex toys/BDSM/sexuality education, hehe. Other than that, I have gone self-employed now, and am designing my own hoodies/doing crypto/starting on writing my graphic novel. All of these activies are ''fringe''. I know I sound edgy, lol. My friends call me ''idealistic''. They might be right. I HATE nationalism with passion and I have plenty of ''visions'' and altruistic goals. Thats just how I am wired. But man, to me, my lifestory feels like I am on a one man army mission no one will ever get.  
Sometimes I just wish I could meet a SINGLE girl I could reveal my real personality to. But I never have. I am like SUPER intense and scare off everyone when I speak my mind. When I am listening to heavy music/doing physical activities, sometimes it feels my veins are going to pop, haha. I have learned to ''restrict'' myself, so that's somewhat under control.

I guess I just want to be loved and to love at the end of the day.

About me: i‚Äôm a 30yo F, I‚Äôm from italy, I like drawing, reading and watching documentaries about animals. I would like to find somebody to talk to and maybe bond and to do activities, games (open to suggestions:))

I‚Äôm very awkward but sweet and caring and I can be a very loyal friend.. even though I need a lot of support and love. Dm me if interested",lonely,Really need a friend,2021-08-12 15:52:08

This was weird to me as most of the time I was considered the class clown. Everyone seemed to like me because I was funny and good at sports. All the friend groups I had but I was never truly included. I played sports and even there I was odd and only had 2 friends. 

In middle school things got better and I had a good group of friends. I was the funny one who would invite everyone over to my house and always text everyone. For whatever reason no one really ever invited me out, no one invited me over and it was rare that someone else would text first. This carried on into high school. I had even more friends and different groups as time went on. Yet although I was considered the funny one and I always invited people over, texted everyone, sent memes on social media and planned outings, I still felt left out. People I was friends with would hang out at each other‚Äôs houses and not invite me, they‚Äôd go to restaurants/movies without inviting me, they‚Äôd have parties without me, they had group chats that I was not part of and so on. I always felt like more of an acquaintance to them even though I considered most my friends. 

In college things got even worse. All my friends were doing there thing so I wasn‚Äôt seeing them and I wasn‚Äôt making friends. My social anxiety finally hit and I wasn‚Äôt able to go out like I wanted to all the time. Still I made sure to always message my friends, invite them out, have them over and so on. Except my friends were rarely texting me first, they were going out to restaurants/bars/clubs without inviting me, they were just hanging out and posting it for me to see, they were going to places I suggested without me, I‚Äôm pretty sure they were even blocking me. So I got tired and just stopped trying. Some people I confronted but nothing good came out of it. I deleted all social media. No one to text. I was so lonely it made me want to die. Made acquaintances at school but then COVID hit. Haven‚Äôt had actual friends in 2 years. 

I‚Äôm in university now and have no friends. I have no one to text. One ex friend reached out but was trying to use me. I have a few work friends but that‚Äôs it.

Good morning,

By the time you read this note, I'll already be gone. And by gone, I mean deceased. So before you open that door, please be considerate of who you have besides you. If you have a child with you, close their eyes! If you have a grandma with you, make sure she doesn't see what lies ahead of you or her heart might skip a beat!

The misery, the loneliness, the sorrow, and the anguish should all be worth a thousand words. Yet, as I acknowledged it is simply not possible to undertake the expansive task that is examining and assessing my despair.¬†

I have never had a single friend in my life. I have researched everything that there is to research about making friends, human behaviors, etc. I just have a natural fundamental deficiency/misunderstanding of human procedures. These problems will follow me my entire life and once you have awareness of the human condition, with no hope of overcoming it, it becomes definitive proof that life is not worth living.¬†

I seem to lack the natural stillness that everyone else seems to possess. In my opinion, the key to happiness in life is harmony with oneself, acceptance of that which cannot be changed, and a determination to change that which is indeed malleable, a consistent self-awareness and perpetual thought on how to be the best version of oneself and to respect all life in all its forms no matter what. The problem is the things that I need to fix are not malleable. They should be natural. You should be born with them.¬†

I feel ungrateful because I have such a mundane life. I have not been abused, raped, neglected, or anything like that. I have no trauma.¬†

I know a lot of the answers will be some variation of how I should learn to be alone. You can not ""learn"" to be alone. Few people chose to be completely and utterly alone. I want to fix it yet, it is simply not possible. There is no cure. There has to be something I am missing. I rationalize this all the time. There has to be some kind of resounding character flaw I am missing.¬†

I find myself slowly become a bitter resentful person. Seeing people live so normally and naturally angers me. Socialization to them is breathing. It requires no thought. They have everything I want.¬†
In about 2 weeks, my final year of school will begin. Every single year I always tell myself ""just make one friend... a single friend"". Yet that has not worked in any capacity.¬†

My social anxiety has progressively gotten worse throughout the years for seemingly no reason. I also do not know why it developed in the first place.¬†

This sickness inhabits me. It is my entire being. I feel a disconnect with reality, like a severed line.

It feels as though this is my final chance. It has to work. It needs to work but it won't work. 

Once again the social hierarchy wins. The weak will never prevail. It is a half-life to exist at the bottom of the pyramid. The cruelness and brutality of the most liked is a morbid reality to contemplate.¬†",lonely,Sheltered Storm,2021-08-12 08:52:01

I haven't had a single friend like that since middle school. I'm extremely greatful for the friends I have that live miles away but this life is so isolating. they are my friends through and through but it's not the same. I just want someone to be there and have them not be stuck behind my screen. but it's so hard to make friends. 

I've never been to high school and I consider it to be the biggest mistake of my life. before I started high school my family had no place to live so I had to start doing my schoolwork online because there was no other choice. since then I had a falling out with my friends from middle school and I was terrified to go to school so I just continued doing my schoolwork online. I'm still terrified to go to school in person but I think not doing so kept me from having friends. it kept me from experiencing anything. my mom is always talking about friends, hell just people she knew in high school that she's still close to. I'm never going to have any of that. I'm never going to get to go to prom or a football game or any of that shit that normal kids do. I've only ever kissed one person and I didn't even do that until a few months ago. and it feels like it's all because I got unlucky, all because I'm scared. I was forced to move away when I didn't want to. 

it's so hard for me to make friends. I don't understand why. I don't think I'm unlikeable or anything like that. I'm not super shy, I talk to people. people say I'm really nice. I don't know, I don't know if there even is a reason, it's just hard. it feels like everyone is already so caught up in their lives there's no room for one more. 

and now I'm working two jobs, like fuck dude. I'm even drifting apart from all my friends online because I've been working so much. I work all day and when I get home at night I'm too tired to talk to anyone and when I have a day off I'm too tired to talk to anyone still. I try to make friends online and they become disinterested when I'm too busy to talk to them. and that doesn't even take into account how hard it is to make friends as a girl.

2988,them_bones1,1628721048,1,"So a while ago, I spent a week on a seminar, with another one going on at the same time. On this other seminar, there was a girl, who randomly came up to me and complimented my band shirt. I decided to pry a bit, and asked her if she listened to said band, and sure enough, they're her favorite. I decided to keep the conversation going, and she just amazed me like no one else. We agreed on literally everything we brought up. I realized I had more in common with her than with my closest friends, and it made me feel really good. The connection I felt to this girl was more real and genuine than anything I've experienced, and thinking about her keeps me up at night. The summer was really sad and bitter (for private reasons) up to that point for me, and talking to her pulled me out of it. I felt happy. 

The next morning was when our seminars ended. I went for breakfast, and I saw her alone outside. I finished as quickly as I could, and I wanted to thank her, and tell her how much our conversation felt to me, but I was a coward, and just walked by and said hello. As she got onto her bus, we exchanged waves, and that's it. She's gone. 

She's leaving for college, and won't be going to the seminar anymore. I just won't see her again in my life, and it hurts to think about. I've never felt this kind of connection to someone else. If I wasn't such a coward at least she would have known my feelings, and the thought of her wouldn't have eaten away at my mind for weeks.

3015,YourFavoriteHero,1628710762,1,"I'm tired, tired of this feeling everyday that gets worse every single day when I wake up and the society is a constant reminder of how lonely I feel everyday. Racist people who profile and judge you based on your race, a Mother who just tells you everyday that you're never going to find the someone who likes you, friends you never had, looking at everybody around you ending up happier and finding their person while you lay on your bed all day writing stories, poems and songs or watching movies and listening to music or working out just to keep yourself occupied.

Man I often don't even feel like going out of the house even to the store or coffee shops because I see people with friends or their girlfriends out there while I sit all alone and come back. As I have nobody I can talk to who cares about me, who is non judgemental, open minded, someone who truly wants to hold my hand and be there for me by my side in my good and bad days. Someone I could laugh with, cry with, talk cute with, goof around with, cuddle and watch Movies with no matter in whichever part of the world she is, talk to whenever I'm happy or sad. Someone who appreciates me and someone who makes me the best version of myself everyday. Someone I could get married to someday.

I just don't have that somebody. Wish someone was too kind enough to do that with me and not treat me badly, lie to me, use me up or be racist towards me or say that I'm too good for them. 

I just wish for once, life was different and within a blink of an eye or like waking up the next morning I could wake up into an alternate reality where I'm not lonely anymore.",lonely,"22 M I wish there was someone in this world, somebody who really liked me and cared about me...üò¢ My loneliness is killing me...",2021-08-12 05:39:22

It felt good to get it out, even if people haven't read this yet, well, I want to be better but I just don't know how, each day overwhelms me, I can't go to sleep knowing there is a day after, but it's harder to think that there won't be, I know I'm just 14 but I feel things too, and I hope no one feels like this too. This whole thing started some time ago, I had been doing something that took a toll on me, so much so that I got so stressed that I got sick out of it, and felt like the worst ever, my parents supported me each day of it, and I would be happy knowing that when I get back home I see them, it still hurt and was horrible but better, now it feels like everything I do, I think about how it was then, how hard it's been and how painful it was, I can't let my parents keep helping me, I know they want to but, it's hard for them too, to help and give and listen, and I can't be with my parents and brother because each one of them is never home.

The main issue I have is making new friend. Participating in conversations and feeling apathetic and bored when socializing. So it‚Äôs left me alone. Some people reach out to me but I tend to push them away. I no longer am the social butterfly that I used to be. 

My friends in the military who used to be friends with me ignore me. They are embarrassed of me. To the new friends I make, they are ‚Äúwarned‚Äù by superiors to stay away from me since I‚Äôm a trouble maker. 

It had happened because of the use of steroid. I was 210 lbs at 5‚Äô5‚Äù and decided to take my health seriously. While it is a drug it also wiped away my depression and fat. 

It had lasted almost 2 months and is not in any way permanent. Being charged for the same crime in the civilian world would be more but at least now I‚Äôm free without consequence other than losing my job. 

The two factors that‚Äôs making me lonely are the lack of steroid usage and also lack of friends. I had made very bold statements online that I can‚Äôt take back which has caused a group think to exile me out of their social community. The military. 

My friend described me as creative. I love showing off my art work and also my body as a form of art. In the military the culture is toxic to tolerate such a feat. I was hammered down out of my personality that I feel trauma from expressing myself. 

I feel like a criminal. I‚Äôm certifying right now for personal training and now I can‚Äôt even finish it because of my perceived drama. I‚Äôm afraid of going back to the civilian world without a job and now that the time I have free to study is spent sleeping and finding new friend.

I met this girl back when we had a group project in college back in 2018. She‚Äôs very strict but has a funny side. Over 3 years later, I reached back to her and we started to become close friends. But when I was sent to the hospital due to depression, I told her all my issues with self-harm, depression. We connected after that because she felt the same way. We were deeply in sync. But then I asked her out and she said she didn‚Äôt feel the same way with me. Which I understood, but as I kept talking to her I just kept venting all my problems. She‚Äôs always there for me just as I was there for her, but I don‚Äôt think she can handle me anymore. I don‚Äôt know if she want to be my friend anymore. I feel lost, alone, and sad every time she gets sad and I can‚Äôt help. She told me she facetimes this other friend for 5 hours after being drugged and sent to the hospital and I just got angry. Because why would she want to still talk to me when she has other friends?

I wrote this on my notes and I plan to send it to her:

‚ÄúMelissa I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be your friend anymore. Every time I try to text you I feel guilty. All I want is your attention and support and I never once considered what you were going through emotionally. I feel guilty and destroyed every time I go back to hating myself in front of you because you‚Äôre such an inspiration and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint you anymore. I really like talking to you but you also remind me of my time in FIU where all I felt was stupid and alone. Stuck in my own world where everyone else is doing better around me. I can‚Äôt improve myself venting all my problems at you. I don‚Äôt hate you, I just don‚Äôt think I should talk or see you again. I don‚Äôt know how long but I feel like my mental state is going to ruin what we have. I‚Äôm sure you understand. Nobody wants to keep helping someone as deeply broken as me, and I would rather die than to see someone going through that again. I‚Äôll miss you. Goodbye.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to do this. But I feel like it‚Äôs necessary because she deserves a better friend, not just someone who constantly complains about his depression without doing better. I feel like I‚Äôm dragging her down, like I dragged down my 2 ex girlfriends. I feel so alone, and I feel like I destroyed what we had.

I have been dealing withassive headaches almost non stop since last March.  I am being followed by a Doctor but all tests we do are coming back negatives. 

I can barely sleep,  have no motivation to do anything amd am too tired either way.  I have no one to talk to cause even my family believe that I am faking my illness cause I don't want to work. 

I don't find anything interesting.  I just feel so empty and as if the void was slowly but surely eating me from inside.  

The only thing holding me back is the fact that I am addicted to a female friend of mine (doubt its really a friendship but its the closest I have)  amd some part of me just wants to be with her although I know it will never happen.  The only way I get to see her is by paying her to send me selfies.  

I just feel like I cannot achieve anything in life and am just going nowhere.  I am honestly just hoping to die in my sleep so I don't suffer anymore. 

Never thought that I would still live with my parents at 25 and being jobless.  I hate it!  I just it all to stop.

3086,hello-operator12,1628655171,1,"Which is ironic, because I am a pessimist, naturally, with too much self hatred that I had never let go of.

I have feelings deep down that, I am sure, I need a professional help, or possibly even more, because I can never seem to see myself as anything other than a garbage. Calling myself human garbage seems little too offensive to the phrase human garbage.

I struggled, struggle and will always struggle with my self image, self worth, and just myself in general.

However, as the title suggests, people have commented on my positivity over the years and how I seem to have an endless positivity and kindness in me, despite telling people again and again that I'm just a dipshit dead inside.

And here's my reason.

I know just how fucking miserable it is to be down that road. All by yourself, just waiting for the heart to stop, just waiting for my body perish, and just waiting to be forgotten and be gone forever.

I know just how fucking hard it is, just to wake up, instead of doing everyone a favour and be dead.

I know just how it feels like to be alone, be hated, be never appreciated, and be abandoned, and every fucking time that happens, a part, if not whole, of you dies.

And would I like to feel that indescribable, gut wrenching, shattering pain? I don't. And would I ever want anyone else to feel like that? Absolutely not.

It's not the easiest, and I'll be lying to you if I said it is. Sadly, life isn't like a Disney fairytale, where things... just work out, magically. However, is it as horrifying as we feel like it is? Maybe yes, maybe no.

But... I want every one of you to know this. I, a total stranger, who you won't ever see nor meet, I, a random fucker that could've been dead 10 years ago, and I, self hating, miserable, old, fat and lousy fuck, believes in you, believes in your happiness, believes in your well being, and believes on your ability to kick ass and find everything you ever wanted.

I've been lonely for quite a while, but recently I've been getting more into activism. It's actually been really great for my mental health because you get to join a community and feel like you're part of something greater. Currently, we are facing an encroaching climate threat, so I'd just like to share some some links to climate-specific organizations/movements. Ever since I joined Sunrise Movement, I've been feeling a lot less lonely and happier (Ew, I know this sounds like I'm trying to get you to join a cult but that's not what this is \^\^' ). (Sunrise Movement is in the U.S., they have hubs all over the country, and if you don't have one, you're aloud to start one of your own. I also added links to non-U.S. specific movements like Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion):

And because of my family situation I had no one to lean on there either. So I feel into a hole. But.... as things began to open up I reached out with some people in my classes and made friends. It was great. All of them were in couples and I did some more reaching out and.... I got a boyfriend, which was huge cause that also implied I was out of the closet. Those were some of the best months of my life.

But he dumped me... Wasn't ready for the commitment and didn't want people to know... I get it.

And then my friends moved away... They had college and were getting apartments... I get it.

And now I've moved away... I have family issues...

I was careless, I moved way too fast physically, and every relationship blew up in my face. I swore off dating for a few years when I realized I wasn‚Äôt confident in myself being single, so I clearly wasn‚Äôt going to be confident in a relationship. Well, this summer, I reconnected with a girl that I went to high school with, but was never really friends with. We hit it off big time, and things were going very well. We communicated extremely well with each other, we had very good chemistry, and we had some of the best conversations I‚Äôve ever had with anyone. We were completely honest with each other about our pasts, about the mistakes we‚Äôve made with relationships previously, and about our fears of relationships in the future. We really understood one another, or so I thought. We talked about the possibility of a future together, and that we both wanted that, but agreed that we didn‚Äôt want to rush into anything, since we‚Äôve both moved too fast before. It was going great. For the first time in my life, I thought I understood what people meant when they said ‚ÄúI just knew‚Äù when they met their s/o. And she felt the same way. I‚Äôm not assuming she did, she very specifically and clearly told me that she felt the same way. Not only that, but I finally had a relationship that I didn‚Äôt screw up by moving too fast physically. 

Well, this lasted less than a month. Then one weekend she tells me ‚Äúhey, my sister in law talked to me this weekend and told me some things I didn‚Äôt want to hear, but needed to. We need to talk. It‚Äôs not gonna be fun.‚Äù (Her sister in law is someone I‚Äôve known since before I can remember.) she then proceeded to tell me that she thought we were getting to emotionally attached, and that she thought it was best if we didn‚Äôt talk. She said she didn‚Äôt think we were it, and that it would be best to just not talk at all now rather than have it not work out later on. She then demanded complete radio silence. She won‚Äôt talk to me. I don‚Äôt know what her sister in law could‚Äôve said to her to make her do a complete 180 like that, because she already knew all the worst parts of me and accepted me anyway. Or so I thought.

This has left me more broken-hearted than any of my past relationships ever did. Even the worst breakup I had wasn‚Äôt this painful. I‚Äôm done trying to find someone, because even when I think I‚Äôve found someone worth the effort, they suddenly and unexpectedly completely change their mind from a single conversation with someone else.

For now, we‚Äôll just have to stay strong. Try to accept the current feeling of loneliness, because it will allow you to make progress eventually.

Honestly this might just end up as a rant or maybe my life story, so sorry bout that. 
     I didnt really have any friends in high school, I had one close friend who became my roommate, but he ended up stabbing me in the back and taking my at the time girlfriend from me. He still trys to talk to me but I had a kid when I was 18 to her and he ended up getting her pregnant right after I found out she was cheating so the idea of ever forgiving him makes me physically sick. Im a recovering emo kid who went introvert as soon as I moved out and now I'm counting the years since my last meaningful conversation with someone. I gave up on my hobbies when I had my battle with depression(following the previous ordeal) and just found myself absorbed into gaming, anime and maga, stuff like that since it gave a feeling of escaping my reality, which was nice, but now I'm 24 and the consequences are closing in. I have nobody left to call a friend, I go to my job with a fake smile and come home to just escape and sleep. I really do miss having someone to just talk to, but after being betrayed by my closest and only real friend I dont bond with guys or sympathize with most of their ideology, and im not all that great looking so although I feel more comfortable with female friends I have no clue how to approach such a thing. I ended up smoking weed on a constant basis the past few year and since I quit this feeling of wasting away and loneliness is only creeping in faster and I feel like I've run out of time. I really just wish I had one person to talk to about the latest show, the newest DLC or someone to game with. Even just someone to text good morning and good night to. If I could go back id go to college just for the social interactions at this point. I dont really drink so the bar scene isn't even an option, I work in the trades so im constantly just surrounded by annoying old dudes and I live in a secluded and poor area with nothing to offer, at this point I feel like friendship is something ill ever only find online but I have yet to find someone I can relate to.

I got a job in a small isolated town away from everything, because my thaught process was ""im alone and depressed anyways, might as well be alone at svalbard"" and here i am. Decent job, fun work(the days im not tearing myself apart because im really to dumb to work in IT)
and everyone in my family even said i dont have to proove anything.... im just.... stubborn and i guess i procrastinate

Ok the issue:
I cant connect to people. I mean i try to be nice and be there for anyone that need me, but the moment i stop making myself an uninvited guest(what it feels like) everyone just stop talking to me

Now i live in a small town where nobody even know i exist, and i have no idea how to approach people or to find anymore to hang with. I have tried inviting to movies, hiking trips, saying anytime when someone thank me, and going out of my way to say i can help, i want to hang out, and be relied upon.

Yet every single time(not limited to the tiny town i live in mow) i get ghosted immideatly. Nowadays my day looks like this

Go to work - go home - procrastinate - hike on a mountain(neccecary for my back problems) and just sit at home

If i meet someone through work or the grocery store and i feel it would be natural to hang with that individual i usually spend a few days getting to know them on that arena. If we hit it of and i feel secure i usually go to phase 2 where i ask if we should hang or watch a movie (example if we have talked about a show that might seem like a natural progression)
 im allways turned down.

It was very tough getting over her. I feel into depression again and had to start taking medications.. but I somehow managed to get over it. And here I am, two years after that. I find myself lost, without having something to live for. Imagine if a singer suddenly cant sing one day, thats a weird example but yes, thats how I felt. Something that I was good at is gone... Its a very strange feeling. Now, I am lonely. I have tried and failed hooking up with someone new. What really makes me happy? Im just in a state of.. idk being lost.

3184,62917hxku28653bv,1628613992,1,"I first got a smartphone about 3 years ago, but I already had a computer before that. Although I spent quite a lot of time on it, it never affected my studies negatively. And even though academics come easy for me (I'm gifted), I still had to put in work to get good grades, so I did develop a work ethic.

COVID came when I was finishing my senior year if high school. I'd had a phone for two years already. I did work on my own, had some online classes and ended up scoring very high on my university entrance exams and getting into my first choice major. So everything looked good.

However, I noticed I spent a lot of time browsing reddit in my free time. I also joined a bunch of websites and forums that did nothing but fill up my time. I wonder if I really did everything I could to prepare for the exams or if I performed well because it was the final stretch and I'd already studied everything before developing those addictions.

I started college in the fall and fell behind in a lot of my classes. I guess I was oblivious to it at the time because I didn't pay it too much attention. I was sort of in denial and more focused on meeting new people, as I had been kind of lonely before.

I didn't fail all my subjects the first semester, but I could have done much better. Over the next few months, I questioned whether or not to switch majors before deciding it was nothing more than another form of escapism. I genuinely think I made the right choice by staying.

During the second semester, I began having a lot of intrusive thoughts and worries, and couldn't concentrate on my studies. Looking back, it could have been yet another way if refusing to simply do the work. I used reddit much more then, living through other people's posts and experiences, as well as watching tv shows.

As COVID restrictions have sort of ended, these worries mostly faded. I'm happier now (and less lonely) and ended up passing most of my subjects in the second semester. I was planning on studying this summer but haven't accomplished much because I can't stop picking up my phone and scrolling Reddit aimlessly. I'm literally on the app and other social media the whole day. Blocking or deleting the app does nothing, because I just open chrome or something else.

I never had a problem with excessive phone use before, so I wonder if the problem is procrastination and the urge to browse Reddit and social media is an excuse not to put in the work. If I deleted my accounts (which I tried before), I would find another way to waste time. I don't think that's the problem.

3199,agressivelytender,1628600602,1,"Not really sure how to start this so I'll start at the beginning. When I was younger, I always had trouble making and keeping friends. All throughout middle school, I spent my lunches alone and just wandering around the playground and the space around my school. When my school guidance councilor noticed this, she put me into this thing called ""circle of friends"", which was this makeshift group of mostly disabled kids who couldn't make friends.

I hated it. The kids were nice enough, but since I was older (I was 13 and the majority of those kids were 11 or 12) and I didn't really fit in since I was able bodied and none of them were, I wanted to leave and go back to wandering aimlessly. I was told that I had to stay and it stopped me from hanging out with kids in my own grade and making my own friends, which I would have much rather done than be forced to make nice with kids that I didn't have anything to talk about with. 

Later on in my freshman year of high school, I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and got put into therapy. 

Therapy helped a lot and I got well enough to really find myself and make some friends, but most of them and I lost touch during the coronavirus pandemic. I wasn't that concerned since I still had two close friends that I talked to every day and I've always been an introvert, but a couple of months ago I could feel them pulling away too. One of them, we'll call him Steve for simplicity, never wanted to hang out. He would always say that he was busy, and we believed him for a while, until he started saying he was ""busy that day"" before we even decided on a day. When we called him out on it, he agreed to a time and place but would never show up, not even on video calls. 

This went on for a couple of months and my other friend and I, we'll call her Jane, would continue to hang out regularly either in person or over video chat. It was fine for a while, I was okay. Even if Steve wasn't hanging out with me, at least Jane was. But then my therapist told me that there were some policy changes coming from her boss and she couldn't see me anymore. 

I was devastated. I wasn't ready to give up therapy yet and spent a lot of time trying to swallow the news. But I had made so much progress with making friends and keeping them that I felt like I was getting better. Three years of therapy actually payed off. 

But then Jane stopped talking to me. It was so sudden. The night before, we were laughing on a video call and gossiping and everything was fine. She told me that she needed to work out some personal stuff, and I backed off. Three weeks passed and I decided to text her, but she didn't want to talk or hang out or anything. She told me that she doesn't think we can be friends anymore. She said that I wasn't right for her.

‚ÄúIf you deny my pain, you deny my humanity.‚Äù

I shouldn't have to fight for this square foot to exist in pain. They say, ‚Äúget over it, get a life, you'll find someone.‚Äù Dismissive at the very least, hostile at the very worst. They try and tuck me away, ‚Äúit will happen eventually‚Äù. As if they know the future, as if they've seen my life and it's past. As if I'm going to ride off the in sunset having gotten the girl, no longer lonely. And that will be one less person on the Earth who's hurting. 

It doesn't work that way. Some people die, emotionally distorted till the very end. Some people die, without having ever lived, ever having gotten the chance in the first place. A fetus aborted, denied the right to ever exist. Love, as an unwilling burden in someone else's life. Love, as an unknown substance within my own. 

I shouldn't have to fight for this square foot to exist in pain. For this right of my heart to howl at the moon in sheer anguish of the absence of love, of companionship. See, we all know the heart wants to reach out, to bring near, to draw close and have our intentions reciprocated. But what becomes of those who never get the chance. The heart still beats with amorous intentions. The heart of the denied is still as valid as the heart of two lovers who've found each other. But who cares for the least of us? Who worries about the unknown, the unwanted, those who look in the mirror and don't even see a human. Where is the advocate for the invisible? 

And they criticize my pain. 

They examine me with their words and scalpels, trying to explain my behavior on their terms. You only care when you see the rage, you don't give a fuck about the pain.  My pain to rage, which they just focus on the rage. To paint me as a monster full of hate. And I say to you, if you hear nothing else, the pain created the rage, the pain created the rage. The pain created the rage. The pain came from loneliness. The loneliness of being without. The loneliness of being shut out of my own humanity because they refuse to recognize the validity of the source of my pain. But if you deny my pain, you deny my humanity.

I know love is the greatest feeling. I know it can take a man to great heights and extreme depths. I hear it's name in movies, music and media. I hear it in social advocacy. *Love is love*. Well where is the fuck is the validity of *my love*?  The prostrations are gone, so are the celebrations too. I have an empty street with  a  stop light and few birds overhead. So when you talk about love, I think you're using it as a political ploy rather than any serious concern. 

I once knew love. I can still taste it's sweetness on my lips. Her divine presence made the commonplace extraordinary. Something as simple as watching her find something to wear was a delight. If she made the common an adventure, what do you think a dinner date was like? This is the area where sea meets the shore. Where no stringing 26 letters together will do justice to describe the experience. Language does have it's limits. And this kind of love is where it happens. It's deliciousness is only rivaled by the pain of being without. 

Without.

Do you think the heart wants to slaughter itself? Hurting with nowhere to hide, to the point I want to end it all. Do you think I enjoy this? That I'm making this up. The pain as this terrible sun that I cannot escape unless I'm sleeping. And even when I'm sleeping, I'm dreaming about her. So tell me what do I do? Gnashing, seething. Scrawling frantic love letters. Shooting painful arrows in all directions. Unrefined, unfiltered. Just this raw sense of hurt and the delirium of some who doesn't know what to do. Tell me, if your body was on fire, and you were in the middle of nowhere, what would you do besides running around and screaming. 

And they shun me when I can't keep my composure.",lonely,"""If you deny my pain, you deny my humanity.""",2021-08-10 22:00:03

3208,Worthless-Being,1628594649,1,"I think the most depressing thing is when you will get one.

Imagine, you are in your twenties and you've never been in a relationship before. You are surrounded by people who already have an emotional past, who are already used to being in a relationship. Because at that age, almost everyone has been in a relationship at least once in their life. You are not in the norm and you will never be. 

Now think, you will be with someone. You will be at a disadvantage compared to your partner. You will bind yourself much more than that person will ever do for you. Why ? Because he/she will be your first love. While for him/her, you're just an ""another one"", you're passing by.

Or worse, you're a band-aid for his previous relationships. 

For all we know, your partner will still be thinking about his/her ex, the person he/she truly loved.

3210,rootnaut17,1628593355,1,"Sometimes my loneliness makes me want to cry. Ordinarily I'm used to this, because it's like this since at least six or seven years ago. I just got back home after finishing university, but last weekend was the first one where I was actually home, and not working. I say 'working', but it's something I like.

I suppose the working away and only spending 3-4 days at home at a time was helping more than I thought, because suddenly everything feels very unmanageable.

At the beginning of May I lied to the only friend I had to force them to not be my friend anymore. Even for me - who never really had any friends growing up, has never been in a relationship etc - the three months since then have probably been the most lonely I have ever been. Now I've run out of hope, pretty much completely. I only see myself continuing in my current path, to be completely alone, where everybody looks at me with a slight disgust. Because I think that if all the people you've ever come into contact with do not seem to want to keep in touch with you, there is probably something fundamentally wrong with you. And that's my reality.

If there is something fundamentally wrong, it's going to take a lot of time, and maybe a lot of money, to fix, whatever the problem is or what it relates to. When someone restores a classic car or motorcycle, they are trying to erase the problems it has amassed over the course of its life and bring it back to 'factory' spec. That takes a lot of time and a lot of money. I don't have either of those. I'm 22, I've never been in a relationship, never had long-term employment, can't drive, have no friends, no money, a poor body shape, no personality, very limited ability to be funny, and when people come near me I try to make them go away. Nobody wants to be with or around that, and I can't blame them, since I agree.

What I do have is a deep, fundamental fear of abandonment, with long and deep roots. I think this is why I forced my friend to go away, because I stopped being able to cope with the idea that they might force me to go away. This is something that would take a long time to fix. Too long, probably, because if by 24 I have still no friends and still no relationships then those two things will never be able to change. There is only so long that being socially incapable might be viewed as something more positive than really creepy and probably a little bit threatening. I'm probably past that time already, sincerely speaking.

There is too much for me to fix, and because I'm in a rush, even if I tried it probably would be a bad fix, and probably lead to other problems. I began to understand a few weeks ago that my reality is to be alone for my life, but I suppose I'm not completely comfortable with that reality yet.",lonely,22(M) - A vent/rant from a loner about being lonely.,2021-08-10 21:02:35

Just met her yesterday, she's honesty amazing. Never went from having someone reach out from a post of mine, to hopping into a voice chat immediately. And it was incredible. She's the kind of girl who can steal your breath by just talking about her passions. She's so damn funny too, we were gaming separately while talking, and the shit that came out of her mouth while raging had me dying. 

But I'm the problem usually when it comes to meeting people like her. I always tense up, usually worry about making an ass out of myself which leads to me doing so. Now, I'm not sure if what I said last night upset her to the point where she won't want to talk more. Just really don't know how to handle fucking up so many things unintentionally by worrying too much. Usually when a guy says he's not like other guys, it's a brag or a trick to get girls to let their defenses down. In my case, it's a horrible trait. I get hurt a lot by wanting to connect with anybody who seems nice. Sometimes I feel it would be easier to be shallow? But that's probably the self-destructive part of me thinking that way, because I know it wouldn't be the right thing to do.

I feel like I am missing out on a lot of things in Life.(I am 19M). I recently lost my dad to covid-19. We were not really super close, but I do feel sad about this loss. Adding on to that, my mom isnt taking my dad's untimely demise very well. She cries by herself all day. This makes me feel more miserable. Everyone around me is so happy. Getting their driving licenses( I am from an Asian country. Driving age is 18+), hanging out with friends, amazing dating life etc. But , i am just sitting in my room all day long, attending classes during the day time and overthinking. I have a girl in my life who is afraid of commitments(due to her horrible past dating experiences) and I just cant hold it against her. I feel like she might just come up one day and say, ""I am sorry. I cant do this anymore""(She has done this twice before and then came back to me apologising) and this time for real, it doesnt work out. I have been in love with her for like 2 years now, and i just cant remove her from my head. My college life sucks as well. Being moderately introverted, I find it difficult to make new friends. I did make 2-3 friends in college, But They have, you know, other friends with whom they are more close, and boom I feel lonely once again. I have best friends from my childhood and they are fighting their own battles everyday. I speak to them about these problems, but I find it hard to open up in front of someone. I feel like I am burdening them with my problems and it is my own shit so i gotta deal with it on my own. I used to be an Ambitious Teenager, who used to dream of becoming a Paratrooper. I still do have certain goals and dreams in my mind. But i feel like i am exhausted,all the time, even though i sleep for like 6-7 hours. I just dont know how to deal with all these things.

3248,Xeno-Bound,1628571398,1,"About a year ago, I met a girl online, and we became really good friends. After a while, I began to develop feelings for her. She wasn‚Äôt interested in having a relationship, however, which is a decision that I respect. But, she practically has a crush on a character in a video game, and learning that just felt like a bullet to the heart. I understand that I can‚Äôt make her like me romantically, and I don‚Äôt try to, but when she‚Äôs more romantically interested in someone who doesn‚Äôt exist than someone who‚Äôs real and actually cares about you, it fucking stings.

I know it‚Äôs petty to be jealous over someone who doesn‚Äôt exist, but if she‚Äôs allowed to have positive emotions about him, I‚Äôm allowed to have negative ones. I honestly don‚Äôt know how else to feel. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this, but it just feels so insulting. It‚Äôs already hard enough I have trouble with romance to begin with, this just makes me feel less capable of being loved. 

Really, the whole idea of simping over a fictional character makes me feel bad. How am I supposed to compete? And I see it all the time too, people drooling over someone that doesn‚Äôt exist and probably wouldn‚Äôt love them anyways. It raises people‚Äôs expectations too high to the point where real people now have a disadvantage.

I‚Äôm tired of feeling as if I‚Äôm not worthy of being loved by real human beings. I‚Äôm tired of not feeling like I‚Äôm enough. The more and more I feel like this, the more and more my self esteem drops. It‚Äôs so painful.

Now a days, the only think that makes me happy is working. I can consider myself a well succeed person, I'm young, manager in a big company on my city and I have enough money to do whatever I want, but the only thing I want to do is work.

I always was the kid who feel sad to not be noticed, or at least, admirable by the others, that makes me do the only think I could do on that time: work and study as hard as I could, and since I used to be on a relationship during that time, I thought I didn't need anything besides my own hard work and my ex.

I'm single since November, she decided to left me after she realized I was sick and didn't want to spent her time taking care of while I was trying to fix my problems. Now, I have a depression, I feel that my therapy is a waste of time, the medication doesn't make any difference, and the only think that I can do is work more, at least there, I'm the guy, the one everyone admires and respects, the one that everyone reports about how nice, well educated and polite I am. Basically, I can feel like I have some value.

Now, I can't have a single friend, because I can't trust anyone, I'm always afraid that everyone is mocking at me and I spent most of my free time trying to make everyone admire me. I also really miss being in a relationship, I can't imagine myself being with any woman after being with my ex for 9 years, but on the same time, I can't really trust any woman, after she break up when I asked her to get married.

3285,ixfd64,1628558729,1,"One thing I noticed is that it's pretty hard to get responses to Facebook messages. I'm talking about attempts at conversation rather than meaningless IMs like ""Hey, what's up?"" For example, sometimes I'll congratulate a friend of a friend on getting married or send them birthday wishes. Or if they post nice vacation photos, I might ask them where they were taken. However, getting people to respond to Facebook messages is like pulling teeth. Although I know it's better to communicate in person, the opportunity to meet up often doesn't arise.

At first I thought maybe messages were being filtered into the message requests folder, but then I noticed my comments often don't get responses either. I can understand if you're an Internet celebrity and can't respond to everyone, but most people obviously don't fit this profile. And it's not simply a case of not wanting to talk to strangers because I see the same thing from people I grew up with. Here are just a few examples:

* Ran into two guys from my high school a while back and had a great time catching up. But when I posted on their Facebook saying it was great to see them again, neither responded to the post or even gave it a ""like.""
* One of my college roommates is a huge geek like me and also loves online RPGs. I messaged him on Facebook a while ago but never got a response even though we have many common interests.
* A girl in my family's friend group often takes weeks to respond to messages. At first I figured she was ""acquaintance-zoning"" me... until I noticed she does the same thing to her other friends. Even though she does eventually get back to me, it's very difficult to have a meaningful conversation this way. Even Nasa and the Voyager spacecraft have better communication.
* I saw a friend of a friend post a picture of a nice-looking place and asked her where it was taken. She seemed more than happy to tell me but did not respond to further questions.

It's even more frustrating that you're not ""supposed"" to call people out for ghosting you because it might make you seem desperate. Besides my cousins, I only know a handful of people who won't leave me on ""seen."" In my experience, the only other ""people"" who regularly respond to messages are small businesses. But that's probably because they don't want to lose customers.

Seems weird to me that this is something that‚Äôs constantly running through my head because I really hate being around people, I can‚Äôt even have friends, don‚Äôt even talk to anyone at all and don‚Äôt have anyone in my life because I‚Äôve ghosted everyone I‚Äôve ever interacted with bar one person who doesn‚Äôt even talk to me anymore anyway. But I guess I‚Äôm also somehow incredibly lonely despite also wanting to be alone and being aggravated and annoyed by most social interaction. 

For starters, I‚Äôm covered in self-harm scars. Can‚Äôt really see many if I have a shirt on, just three on my arm that could be explained away somewhat convincingly. But underneath my shirt, they‚Äôre all up my shoulder, across my chest, up and down my back, on my thigh, everywhere. Most people will never see them, but if I ever had a girlfriend there‚Äôs no way I could get away with hiding them from her for very long and as soon as she saw them, I don‚Äôt see how she wouldn‚Äôt see me differently after that. People tend to make all kinds of assumptions about shit like that, and even if they don‚Äôt judge you or something, they usually default to having some kind of sympathy for you which I don‚Äôt want, or subconsciously starting to perceive you as more weak, unstable and even fragile. Sometimes they even start to tiptoe around you and get afraid to be honest with you and think they have to protect you and sugar coat things. I hate it and there‚Äôs no way to avoid it because they will eventually see and I can‚Äôt get rid of them.

I also can‚Äôt avoid feeling like I‚Äôve lied to them eventually. The only way people like me is when I‚Äôm able to act more happy and upbeat and social. But that‚Äôs not really me, mostly just feels like an act. And if they stick around long enough, eventually they‚Äôll see that and they‚Äôll see that I‚Äôm not who they thought I was, that I was kind of a lie and even if they don‚Äôt leave after that, again, they‚Äôll start to see me differently, see that I‚Äôm not the person they thought I was and that my personality is actually pretty ugly and unstable.

For some reason, I also seem to have an inability to be into someone who‚Äôs into me. It‚Äôs basically a turn off if they‚Äôre attracted to me and I don‚Äôt even really know why. The only girl I can ever say I‚Äôve ever actually loved wasn‚Äôt interested in me romantically at all, just saw me as a really good friend. But there have been girls that came along who were very clearly interested and even if everything about them ticked the right boxes, I just couldn‚Äôt feel any real attraction to them at all. I don‚Äôt even understand why that is. And even if that friend of mine was somehow into me, I don‚Äôt even think I would‚Äôve done anything because I think I actually loved her too much to let her put herself through what I can only imagine would be absolute hell that would come with being in a relationship with me.

I‚Äôve already tried therapy, went through a bunch of therapists and never really noticed any change or got anything out of the experience. Trying to get linked up with another one right now but I‚Äôm in a COVID lockdown so into exactly easy. Not even sure why, like I said, they‚Äôve never really helped me. Also been on heaps of different medications, always the same story, build up to the max dose, stay there a while, realise they‚Äôre not doing anything then switch and do it all over again. Currently on 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Lamictal. Still nothing.

I know people are gonna say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll meet someone eventually‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôve just gotta find the right person‚Äù and stuff but I did, and she wasn‚Äôt interested. And if she was I‚Äôve already outlined the issues that would‚Äôve brought. So if someone else does miraculously come along, I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be capable of letting it happen for one reason or another. I also know people say you‚Äôve gotta be happy on your own first too, but that‚Äôs hard when you don‚Äôt feel any joy at all anymore and you‚Äôre not even sure what you‚Äôre even still living for.",lonely,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever really feel loved,2021-08-10 11:11:51

The other friends who use instagram over facebook don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs my birthday and usually don‚Äôt know or text me days later saying they just saw it.

The other day I was feeling really depressed so I forced myself to get out of bed and actually go out into the world. I went to the river that runs through my town. I get there and the hill on the bank of the river is packed full of other college students. I pick a spot at the bottom of the hill and I lay there by myself for about 20 minutes reading a book called ‚Äúhow to be happy‚Äù or something like that. That part is depressing in itself. When I got to the river I noticed life guards and I thought that was odd cause I have never see lifeguards there ever.

3347,PutMuch2781,1628530129,1,"Before I go on, I feel like this is going to be all over the place, sorry in advance.

I'm 28 M and I feel like a pathetic loser, holding myself back from what I can be. I always envision myself being in better shape and having a clear face, but instead I'm currently a bit chubby and have a little bit of acne on my face. I believe that I can become a good looking guy but either I'm too stupid/lazy or perhaps I'm unknowingly depressed to do something about it at a consistent level where I become what I want to become. Even at 28 I still think that I have so much untapped potential just waiting to come out, but I'm either too stupid or depressed to realize it. From the time I left high school back in 2010 to around July 2016 I was not living life, I was at home pretty much most of the time just taking up space, wasting precious time that I'll never get back, being an embarrassment to my parents, I was a nobody. Then around mid-July 2016 I got a job for the first time in my life and I've been working ever since with the exception the times where I was briefly unemployed but you get what I mean (I hope). I'm not the most social person in the world, in fact I was never much of a social person, I would say in part because how I looked and I held myself back because of it. The last couple of years I've been a little bit more social, mainly hanging out with coworkers after work and having a beer (or 2, or 3...) and chatting, also treating myself to a concert back in 2019 and going to a indy wrestling show before the pandemic truly hit us all, and going to sporting events, among other things. But ultimately the feeling that takes over me is that of feeling alone and being like I'm gonna be forever alone. I never had that one person(s) growing up where I can call them my true best friend, and even now I feel the same. At work I have a good amount of acquaintances but once work ends it's like they go do their thing and hang out with their group of friends while I go my way which is take my forever alone self home and not do much and be not much of a talker. And I think the one thing that makes me more of a loser than anything else is that fact that I have never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl, never held hands with a girl in a romantic way, never been on a date, and of course, never had sex, I know, smh. I always think about what it must be like to be in a relationship and everything that goes with being in a relationship. Of course it doesn't help when I see couple out in public or on TV it just makes me feel like a loser. I'm so touch starved it's not even funny. I want to be loved unconditionally by someone that's not family. That's not going to happen until I make the change that I desire to make. And because I'm touch starved and my lack of anything with girls, I must admit that I have struggled with porn and masturbation for years to kind of fill that void. It also extends to looking at pictures of naked girls here on Reddit and thinking wow, absolutely beautiful, girls like her would never be with a pathetic loser like me. It's like I said a void that needs to be filled, it's just, I don't know what else to say on it other than smh. 

Until I make serious changes in my life I'm gonna continue to be the pathetic loser I am. God willing I make it to 30, I don't want to be the person I am now still in a couple of years.

3357,BadCaseOfBrainShakes,1628524186,1,"There‚Äôs just so much wrong with me completely preventing me from ever being able to experience feeling loved by someone else. Seems weird to me that this is something that‚Äôs constantly running through my head because I really hate being around people, I can‚Äôt even have friends, don‚Äôt even talk to anyone at all and don‚Äôt have anyone in my life because I‚Äôve ghosted everyone I‚Äôve ever interacted with bar one person who doesn‚Äôt even talk to me anymore anyway. But I guess I‚Äôm also somehow incredibly lonely despite also wanting to be alone and being aggravated and annoyed by most social interaction. 

For starters, I‚Äôm covered in self-harm scars. Can‚Äôt really see many if I have a shirt on, just three on my arm that could be explained away somewhat convincingly. But underneath my shirt, they‚Äôre all up my shoulder, across my chest, up and down my back, on my thigh, everywhere. Most people will never see them, but if I ever had a girlfriend there‚Äôs no way I could get away with hiding them from her for very long and as soon as she saw them, I don‚Äôt see how she wouldn‚Äôt see me differently after that. People tend to make all kinds of assumptions about shit like that, and even if they don‚Äôt judge you or something, they usually default to having some kind of sympathy for you which I don‚Äôt want, or subconsciously starting to perceive you as more weak, unstable and even fragile. Sometimes they even start to tiptoe around you and get afraid to be honest with you and think they have to protect you and sugar coat things. I hate it and there‚Äôs no way to avoid it because they will eventually see and I can‚Äôt get rid of them.

I also can‚Äôt avoid feeling like I‚Äôve lied to them eventually. The only way people like me is when I‚Äôm able to act more happy and upbeat and social. But that‚Äôs not really me, mostly just feels like an act. And if they stick around long enough, eventually they‚Äôll see that and they‚Äôll see that I‚Äôm not who they thought I was, that I was kind of a lie and even if they don‚Äôt leave after that, again, they‚Äôll start to see me differently, see that I‚Äôm not the person they thought I was and that my personality is actually pretty ugly and unstable.

For some reason, I also seem to have an inability to be into someone who‚Äôs into me. It‚Äôs basically a turn off if they‚Äôre attracted to me and I don‚Äôt even really know why. The only girl I can ever say I‚Äôve ever actually loved wasn‚Äôt interested in me romantically at all, just saw me as a really good friend. But there have been girls that came along who were very clearly interested and even if everything about them ticked the right boxes, I just couldn‚Äôt feel any real attraction to them at all. I don‚Äôt even understand why that is. And even if that friend of mine was somehow into me, I don‚Äôt even think I would‚Äôve done anything because I think I actually loved her too much to let her put herself through what I can only imagine would be absolute hell that would come with being in a relationship with me.

I‚Äôve already tried therapy, went through a bunch of therapists and never really noticed any change or got anything out of the experience. Trying to get linked up with another one right now but I‚Äôm in a COVID lockdown so into exactly easy. Not even sure why, like I said, they‚Äôve never really helped me. Also been on heaps of different medications, always the same story, build up to the max dose, stay there a while, realise they‚Äôre not doing anything then switch and do it all over again. Currently on 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Lamictal. Still nothing.

I know people are gonna say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll meet someone eventually‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôve just gotta find the right person‚Äù and stuff but I did, and she wasn‚Äôt interested. And if she was I‚Äôve already outlined the issues that would‚Äôve brought. So if someone else does miraculously come along, I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be capable of letting it happen for one reason or another. I also know people say you‚Äôve gotta be happy on your own first too, but that‚Äôs hard when you don‚Äôt feel any joy at all anymore and you‚Äôre not even sure what you‚Äôre even still living for.",lonely,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever really feel loved,2021-08-10 01:49:46

I almost had a date a month ago, but I misread what she said and then she ghosted me, leaving me in the dust in the blink of an eye without letting me explain. Just my luck.

You know what hurts the most? Having an ex come back into your life after we've dealt with some major trauma in the past that destroyed our relationship. She has a boyfriend of two years and they seem really happy together. I'm happy for her, really. We still talk once in a while, we still have feelings for each other, but she's unobtainable and it's gotten bad between us because we reminisce about the great memories we had in the past. They were the best in our lives. Now it's too emotional to talk anymore and she's not really there for me when I need her the most as a friend, and it hurts a lot.

What is stopping me from having fun? Me. That's the simplest answer to get motivated, i will be starting to be extroverted. Complaining like you living in your past won't solve anything. I am going to change the present because I ain't satisfied living like this.

3374,DioHard,1628518938,1,"I can only speak from personal experience, but I lived the first 25ish years of my life thinking: ""Why would anyone want to be my friend.""

I got ""lucky"" at some point to find a good job, but I had to move 5h away from home for it. It forced me upon myself and forced me to create my own reality. Surround myself with whom and what I chose.

I didn't find any new good friends at all in the first 2-3 years, but I learned to be my own friend. I saw myself in new situations and learned to live. It all takes time. Starting from something so simple as managing your money across food, health, hobbies, clothes and so on to buying a car or moving to a new place.

The key here is that it takes time. If I could travel back in time to give myself just 1 message, it would be: ""Don't rush it. Think about it and you will get there.""

Because now whenever I try to change something about me, I feel like nothing happens. Then 1 year later, you look back and can't even relate to yourself from 1 year ago anymore. 
So your progress is often invisible until a certain point. I guess that is because it's thousands of little things changing until they add up to something. That something is you, and you are never done, so always be open to change. 
Put yourself first and the rest will follow. Never stop questioning your motives in a healthy way. Trust your instincts and realize that everyone else that pretends to know how to do ""it"" only maybe knows so for themselves. No 2 lives are alike!
That is why you need to take this advice with a grain of salt, also. I don't know shit! But I manage. So can you!

TL;DR: Progress is often invisible until you look back. You need to become your own #1 friend first before you can cultivate friendships and relationships that are not lopsided.",lonely,Start with yourself and look back upon your progress you already made!,2021-08-10 00:22:18

3384,spoodydoo,1628501317,1,"Started talking to a girl a few weeks ago. We ended up going on a spontaneous date one evening. Spent time talking for hours about all sorts of topics. Had tons of things in common, apparently. Ended up sitting in my car, and she initiated holding hands and snuggling while just being with each other. She gave me compliments and told me she was interested in me. 

Later that night after the date I told her that I would need some time to get to know her better before stepping into dating territory. This meant my intentions were to hang out in a ‚Äúfriend way‚Äù, as I figured that determining relationship material is easier when you genuinely know someone better. I mean, even though our one date went well, it was only four hours of meeting and talking. Jumping in *just* based on that wasn‚Äôt gonna work. 

I told her this and she seemed really understanding and validating. The next weekend we had dinner together and seemed to have had a lovely time. Lots of laughter and pleasant company. 

It‚Äôs been over a week since that dinner ‚Äúdate‚Äù...I don‚Äôt know what to call it. Haven‚Äôt heard from her. In fact, two days later I saw on her social media that she has made it publicly known that she‚Äôs seeing someone else. She posted pictures of them kissing and being close with each other. *Two days*. Two days is all it took. She has a partner now and she seems happy. 

She seemed willing to meet me halfway...to go at a pace that would work for both of us. I guess as soon as I said the word ‚Äúfriend‚Äù though, she took that as I wasn‚Äôt interested...which isn‚Äôt true. If anything, all the compliments and pleasant affection she was giving me was something I‚Äôve *never* experienced before and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to process it, so I figured *taking my time* would be the answer. I figured if things worked out later then I‚Äôd take the shot and try dating her. 

But did I even *have* a shot? When you‚Äôre told a bunch of sweet things you would think that there was something there...but I feel almost *disposable*. The person she‚Äôs seeing even has the same first name as me, but it‚Äôs not me. Like I got swapped out for someone less *defective*. 

I had a feeling deep down at the time that it was too good to be true, and I guess I was right. I have a hard time trusting people and this only further drills that into my psyche. I just want someone to love me as a person and be willing to wait for me and be in things together with me. After all the times I‚Äôve lost people I just feel like my heart is fragile, as cheesy as that might sound. Back at square one again. Wish I could just hide and it‚Äôd all melt away. 

TL;DR: Girl who said she was willing to ‚Äútake it slow‚Äù got with someone a few days later and is now dating them. I‚Äôm already at a low point and this just really pushed me lower.

If you have a minute, please offer me some advice on my situation

Hi all. After a pretty messy breakup and month of no contact with my ex-girlfriend, whom I was and still am in  love with, she reached out to me and wanted to hangout, apologize for/talk over things she felt bad about, and even make out (which I resisted for the most part at first).  

Also, she revealed to me that she'd been sexually assaulted by a guy she was seeing for a bit. That about broke me, firstly because it's horrible for that to happen to anyone, secondly because that was my baby girl...the person I put years into fostering a genuinely positive environment of intimacy with had been messing with other guys, and then was used and thrown away.

The hangouts happened for several days before she reversed course and no longer wanted to talk to me or have me over (for about a week), before a week later wanting to talk on the phone every day after work, and even have me over again.

This part really tortures me. She had me over to hangout for a while-- before she went over to some dudes place &amp; vineyard or something...secluded ass place, and I said in a friendly (non-jealous) way ""hey make sure it's someone you know well, so that you can feel safe around him, or maybe even bring one of your friends"" to which she replied it was only a playdate for her dog.

Fast forward to a few days later and I received an early morning text asking to call, and I was instantly hear-racingly excited/on edge. Then I found out that day I told her not to go if she wasn't super familiar-- she was raped, again. Upon finding that out I did my best to keep my composure and provide the comfort and advice she needed (because she doesn't/didn't have anyone else that she felt safe talking to). Eventually she wanted to fall asleep on the phone to feel safe and comfortable, which honestly felt nice because I was able to be there and she looked to me. 

I don't hear much from her, and at a dinner she was invited to she essentially gave me the cold shoulder not even maintaining conversations or having eye contact. I forgot to mention, but after the first assault before the second she had come for another dinner/evening and we had a wonderful time--laughing, talking, she even asked for a massage (something that we did when we were dating).

Haven't hear from her since. Its been almost 3 weeks, and I recently heard through a friend of mine that she has a boyfriend-- after recently saying she didn't want to be around 'any men'.

I don't know if she's just trying to put out the image that she's doing okay and has a solid relationship because she's so traumatized (and the conversation already was about relationships) or if she simply was lying to me. She still has all of our couples photos up, and wears the anniversary-specific charms and stuff I got her but I feel so confused.",lonely,The love of my life has been sexually abused twice after breaking up with me and I don‚Äôt think I can handle life anymore,2021-08-09 16:36:31

My family grows more and more estranged with each passing year. And romantic relationships - forget about it. Don't even know what that's like and have never seriously explored romance before.

It feels impossible to connect to people lately and the feeling only grows worse. I feel as if I've been cut off from the world, as if I exist in an isolated and irrelevant bubble.

I try hard to be social and get along very well with people. It's rare that I don't get along with someone, and I've been told before that I'm well liked by others. That doesn't mean shit, apparently. I have no friends, no love, no success in any of my endeavours, no stable family to count on. What exactly am I living for again?

I loathed group projects or activities at school, university and all those kid camps etc (who hasn't). But I always just  worked better by myself everything is a lot simpler when you do things by yourself.  

However, this has also bled into my ""romantic"" life or what passes for one. I've never had an issue with making friends I'm quite easy to get along with but have always had a difficulty with dating etc and progressing things forward romantically, it's like my brain just shuts it's self down and doesn't know what to do or how to talk to anyone in a romantic way. Meanwhile I have friends who are in long term relationships, married all that stuff. I am the only single person in my friendship circle. And I constantly ask myself, is there something wrong with me? Which just builds up and up my paranoia and anxiety and all that crap. 

The last ""relationship"" I had was nearly 4 years ago it ended pretty badly and only lasted about 8 months and is really the only what I would call proper relationship I've ever had. And I just don't see or feel myself being in another one? I kinda just shut myself off after that for these past 4 years and didn't even think about entering another one. 

My brain has just been like ""well we tried that once and it failed better not do that ever again"". I crave intimacy and the feeling of being with someone but at the same time I don't? I'm really confused and just don't know how to proceed. 

This isn't helped with the general lack of direction I feel in my life either I'm in a dead end job, friends whom because of my near constant paranoia I believe they don't actually want to be friends with me, lack of interest in really anything, I get super bored by everything really quick. I don't know what to do. 

I guess I'll just always be alone? No one ever seems interested in me physically. Which is no surprise as there's very little to look at. I have as you can probably guess I have  0 confidence in myself, major lack of self worth and no matter how many times I try and improve physically and mentally nothing ever seems to change.

Hi, 
For the context I am 20 female. Ever since the lockdown due to COVID-19, I have been feeling lonely. It is not because of the lockdown itself, I was actually able to bear staying home for a good time, what really made me depressed is that everyone I thought was my friend turned out to be not. Turns out whoever I valued and considered a friend saw me as a person they see everyday but now that we didn't see each other anymore I am out of their lives. I tried to get in touch with everyone I cared about, they would reply, but never initiate a conversation, never check up on me. Now at my city, the lockdown ended a very long time ago, but I am still alone with no one who cares about me. 
I wasn't blessed with the best family, and I have just come out of a relationship. With all that you can imagine how I feel. 
What makes me sadder is that there are friends I opened up to about my issues and struggles and they just disappeared. It's like they cared enough as long as I was a mysterious person, but now that they have known my issues I am no longer interesting. 
Sorry for the long post,

3463,Apprehensive_Boat959,1628465257,1,"I feel abandoned

So this might get lengthy. To give background, I recently lost my father to covid. I also lost my child to a miscarriage. All of this happened not even 1 month ago. I am sad and lonely but trying not to let it get the best of me. But today my mother blocked me and basically our relationship is over. 

The reason my mother blocked me which is the reason I feel abandoned is because she told me she was visiting family. This family isn‚Äôt exactly my favorite, as a kid I was often bullied by this family, and molested by others. My mom didn‚Äôt know about the molestation by other family members until I was an adult. This family also thinks my mom is rich and tries to ask for money whenever they see her. In short I don‚Äôt like this family and have tried to go great lengths to avoid them or discourage my mom from having any relationships with them

When my mom went to visit them she spent all day with them maskless. I asked her several times to mask up. She never did. She even hinted about being someone who tested positive. I immediately went off because I hadn‚Äôt even buried my father a month ago due to covid and I lost my child not even 2 weeks ago. When she ignored my concerns I told her I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Her only reason for wanting to be around them is that she feels lovely. I feel lonely too, but I‚Äôm 800 miles away and without friends or family in the new city I reside in. My mother is also off work due to disability so she does have the option to come see me job permitting. 

I texted a family member basically saying it‚Äôs stupid to have a reunion during covid, saying I just lost a father and I refuse to bury another parent because of them and whatever happens to her they are responsible for. My reason saying that is because when my mom said she was lonely and she wanted to be around the family she grew up with that emotionally abused me as a child and sexually abused me I wanted it to be clear that she is their responsibility and no longer mines. 

Since then I‚Äôve received two threats of violence against me and my mom has done nothing. I‚Äôve filed a police report and started a restraining order. I don‚Äôt understand why someone would choose their cousins over their own child. Yes I understand I am an adult, but I wouldn‚Äôt choose a man or even another family member over my mom or even my own child",lonely,I feel so alone,2021-08-09 09:27:37

The problem is when I'm my normal self, not feeling down or struggling it's none stop, sometimes even hard to keep up with. It made me realise though it's only ever me texting first, people who I would talk to religiously every day, who know all about my struggles and how hard it is when I go through something difficult, nothing, nothing at all. I even went through one step further and 3 weeks ago told one of them I was going through this, she came round we spoke about it in a lot of detail and she left and I haven't heard from her since, again someone I would talk to religiously every day, when she had a hard time was there checking in, even if they couldn't talk just to let them know somebody was around. About 6 weeks in now and it's cripplingly lonely, I'm basically confined to my bedroom as I'm recovering from a bad break resulting in surgery and just nothing, the longer it goes on the harder it is. 
I know that the only way forward is for me to approach people again but it's just so lonely, and feeling like that makes it so difficult to do on top of everything else.

3467,kpop_chica,1628463127,1,"I'm not mad. I just feel so lonely. So I'm not sure if this is considered venting. I know that I am depressed because a therapist told me recently that I am. 

Growing up as a kid, I never really had that many friends. I'm from the US btw. In elementary school I had two close friends. I ended up changing schools so I couldn't see my old friends. So I made two new friends in my new school. Those elementary friendships also ended because we didn't go to the same middle school. In middle school I didn't have many friends either. I made two new friends in middle school. One of them stuck with me in high school. But then we stopped being friends in like freshman year of high school (I think, I don't remember). The other one, we just drifted apart. 

I never went to school dances. Like I never went to homecoming or prom. I was invited by a senior who was a mentor to me in this thing called AVID. I didn't end up going because my mom didn't let me go. 

I never joined a team in sports in school either. I never did extracurricular activities either. I was in the anime club in high school but I didn't make friends there at all. I think I didn't do things (sports &amp; clubs) because I wasn't encouraged by my parents to have fun. Plus the added fact that my family was poor. I am first generation Mexican/Salvadoran American. So my parents are immigrants. I don't think they understood American high school culture that much.

I remember there was this girl in high school who would try to befriend me. She was part of the popular crowd later on in senior year. She invited me to hangout with her friends at lunch one time. I didn't though because I thought her friends wouldn't like the shy, timid me. So sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I did hangout and be friends with her friends. Would I have been popular?  Yikes. That sounds kind of scary thinking about it. Anyways, this girl really helped me with my outer appearance. I used to wear sweaters every single day, even in the summer. I didn't know how to dress honestly. So she just told me to wear a t-shirt and jeans. To be honest, that really helped me. She would even compliment me on my outfit. She really helped me build my self esteem a bit. I'm even crying right now just thinking about her. She was so nice to me. Too bad we drifted apart. 

Now as an adult. I don't really have any friends. I lost all of them throughout my school years. I even deleted my Facebook profile recently because I thought that no one cares about me to even talk to me (plus other factors/reasons). I would talk to people but it would be very short lived or small talk. I not really active on social media. My accounts are either dead or not very active. Like I post rarely to never.

Yes, I do struggle with social anxiety/phobia. I feel like I am in no position to make friends because I am so awkward and I don't talk a lot. Like I'm not good at making friends. I feel like I talk 5-10% of the time and the other person talks 90-95% of the time. It's really bad. 

I just don't know what to do. Sometimes I get tempted to join Facebook again. I just wouldn't add anyone. I don't want to initiate a friend request because what if I get rejected?

1. I‚Äôm planning my own thing even tho I‚Äôve planned a lot of my friends bday events in the past without them asking. 2. One of my close friends never even responded and is acting like I‚Äôm a stranger.  I planned his bday activity and also was the only person that bought him a gift.

3470,perpetuallyy_hungryy,1628462264,1,"My parents are racist and my boyfriend is black. Defending him and our relationship led my parents, especially my mother, to say and do incredibly hurtful things. My mom, who used to be one of the closest people in my life, became my first heartbreak. I‚Äôve now been staying in my room because every time I want to be with friends, she‚Äôs suspicious of my intentions. Everyone believes that I should just leave, because I‚Äôm clearly in a toxic environment, but I can‚Äôt get myself to just throw away my family. My mom has been sick for a while and I‚Äôm scared of what could happen if I put her under too much stress. I also feel obligated to care for them when they‚Äôre older, as they have been good to me for the majority of my life.

My boyfriend, who I am currently in a LDR with, has been amazing support. He knows everything that my parents have said about him and our relationship since I thought it would be important for him to know, and he still decided to stick around. I can tell that he truly loves and cares for me, but I can also tell that these circumstances are slowly getting to him. He had suggested that I tell my mom that we‚Äôre still together and to try to be as sweet to her as possible to wear her down. The last time my mother and I fought, she was under the impression that I had ended my relationship, yet the fight was the worst one we‚Äôve had. I can‚Äôt imagine that she‚Äôd be any more receptive if she knew we were still together. My mother and I‚Äôs relationship is currently neutral, but only because I went and apologized for the fight first. But I‚Äôm tired and hurt. I don‚Äôt understand why I have to be the one to reach out first when I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done anything wrong.

When I told my boyfriend that I don‚Äôt think it would work, he told me to trust him. Though I knew it came from a good place, it didn‚Äôt feel very good to hear the same words my mom had used on me from him. We had slept on the idea further and he decided not to go with it, but rather than feeling relieved, I just felt empty.

I was still hurting from the last fight and the whole situation in general, yet it seemed like that didn‚Äôt even matter to my boyfriend. Obviously it‚Äôs not true, since he suggested thinking more about the idea and ultimately decided not to go with it, but I‚Äôm still hurting from the fact that it was suggested in the first place.

It feels like everyone I love thinks I‚Äôm doing the bare minimum. But I‚Äôm trying so hard. It hurts, but I‚Äôm still trying even if I‚Äôm a little slower with my emotions. I would tell them about how I feel, but the last thing I want to do is have my mom invalidate my feelings with her defenses or make my boyfriend feel like he‚Äôs doing something wrong when it‚Äôs just me feeling sad.

But I‚Äôm so tired. All I can do is cry, yet even that has to be stifled out of fear that my parents will hear.

I have not had a stable group of friends ever, it was always me on the edge tagging along. Doing stuff i didnt want to do just to fit in, All friendships i have ever had have crumbled to pieces while i watched from afar. At the peak i was fine, i was happy, i would talk and go meet girls, i would go to parties... i would be happy.

I have found myself stuck in my room completly isolated from friends and family every single time. Now Isolation is a funny thing, it makes you act a certain spiteful way. It changes you. It makes you into a monster. It truely truely breaks you. I have done some stupid shit to myself in this abyss i can life. Drugs only give an escape for so long. And pain always goes away. The only escapes have been heavily used.

Isolation for years on end turnes you into a hateful human. This only pushed the remaining people i had away. With covid-19 i spent 1 year 2 months in my room. I did not talk to family i did not talk to friends. This was the darkest fucking time of my life. I am amazed i managed to stay alive during this time.

I have been trying to rebuild and i got so so far, it was still a group of friends i was only on the edge with, but aye its better than no one, we would go to motives on the beach and would smoke at school but never go out just us. Since summer started and college ended they all vanished, *poof* just like that. They are just convenience friends.

The remaining people i cling too dont like me and its obvious. I have always loved parties and motives and being around people but now find myself not wanted, bored and fed up of the same ones orfeel out of place. I truely feel alone even when im around people. 

Being alone is like a infection of concrete slowly hardening in my veins me stopping all social interactions while a voice whispers to give up and go into my shell again and end it all.

For example i have been given a free house for 4 days as family are going out and decided to ask a bunch of people over to hang out. They didnt even make a excuse they just said they didnt want to and the one 'bestfriend' i had said ""i would rather do new things with new people"",""no way i want to stay at yours for 4 days, i just dont want to do that"". I just wanted to drink or smoke and play bo1 zombies or something man, go out to some pubs or go out or anything just somthing to give me an escape from this lonely head spacs.

Because of this, I‚Äôve never had friends throughout almost my entire life, until I met someone recently and now I‚Äôm roommates with her. Ive had contact and hugs that although were hard to get used to, but I appreciate and only wish to do more cause I long for contact even if it‚Äôs minor.

They all think I‚Äôm fine, but I cry myself to sleep almost every night, I just want someone to hold my hand, I just want someone to hold me, I‚Äôm tired of being alone, I just wish I was with someone‚Ä¶",lonely,I can‚Äôt stand being here anymore‚Ä¶,2021-08-09 06:56:30

3494,-Microsoft_Excel-,1628454306,1,"Hi,
So... I am pretty sure that I'm no longer of afraid of taking my own life. These thoughts of how awful my life has become are just getting harder to ignore, and well, deny.

I mean, what do I have to look forward to? Everyday of my life is the same mundane, lonely, meaningless day; And considering that it has stayed that way for months at this point, I highly doubt it will change anytime soon. The only time I was truly happy in my life is when I was in a relationship, and well, even that I've lost for god knows what reason... I guess love has really taken its toll on my need for socializing.
I know that I'm ""oh so young"" (18); But to tell you the truth, living out even another year like this, I will either die to stress or fully lose my sanity, neither of which I am very interested in doing to be frank. I would much prefer to off with myself peacefully like I more or less plan to.

I understand that at the end of the day nobody gives a shit about my problems, and I severly doubt that anyone who reads this will care that much either, and that's fine. I have learnt to accept the fact that I am lonely in my struggle. But, typing it with the fact that somebody will hear me in mind, it'll ease the pain slightly.

I want to call out to friends for help, to someone, so i might stay alive. Because if this keeps going like this i don't think i'll make it to next month..... 

People around me are going into relationship after relationship and leaving me alone every time. The one person that still talks to me and hangs out with said that she would never date me, even after saying how amazing of a guy i was. No one wants to listen to my problems, and if they do they always say the same thing: 
- you'll be fine. Now listen to me and my problems
- you'll find someone
- its not that bad
- relationships aren't even that great, being single is tho

They don't want to understand, I AM NOT LOVED. I HAVE NEVER BEEN LOVED UNLIKE THEM. 

I can keep on caring and loving, taking care of myself as well as i can. But if no one wants to love me then i don't know what to do.

3499,Ready-Today-7945,1628451914,1,"I've always struggled with my mental health, and like many others it has got a lot worse during the pandemic. However I also just left a seriously abusive and manipulative work situation and right now I'm honestly working at like -20 confidence on top of this all. I'm also now only seeking therapy for sexual abuse in a previous relationship (i'm on a waiting list and hopeful).

This is a lot- I know. But it's a brief background to whats causing me to feel so fucking lonely right now.

I've always been there for my best friend for everything, but people are seriously making me realise that she's an incredibly selfish person. She has barely been there for me through this. She has a new boyfriend right now and believe me i know what thats like! You want to spend ALL of your time together and you do! And that's fine! We've all been/ are there! The problem isn't really that- it's more that we keep agreeing to plans together and then she cancels on me for her boyfriend. Why agree to plans if you know you don't want to do them and would rather spend time with your bf? I wouldn't care if you said you were busy in the first place! That's fine! We're adults and life can be busy. I just hate being flaked on.

The most recent example is that my family asked me to see if my best friend wanted to come on a trip with me and my family. I asked her- she said yes, so my family booked stuff for her to join us with. I was excited honestly- I thought something like that would be great to get me active and about after such a horrible time. A couple days before she cancelled on me because she found out her boyfriend booked time of work. And I was just so deflated that it had happened again. 

This is already so long but my small group of friends... I just don't feel close to any of them anymore. And I think honestly they don't like me anymore. I know for a fact (because they told me) that they all got together without me to bitch about the fact I had complained to another friend about previously mentioned best friend not cleaning up after herself in our shared house, and how it was affecting my mental health. She then sent me the biggest message of my life, a huge confrontation calling me out for not speaking to her about it. I didn't speak to her because, quite frankly, I was dealing with a lot more important things in my life. It made me very unwell and I don't know how she didn't think to speak to me about it in person rather than send an awful message (I wont share the wording) for me to deal with.

After that incident I feel like I actually can't talk to any of them anymore? Something I thought was a confidential conversation was shared to everyone. 

This whole thing may seem so trivial but I don't even have the capacity right now to fully explain so many things that have gone on recently. My mental health is at an all time low. And I feel so alone, like I have no connection with anyone. My boyfriend included. I'm just falling apart with no one to turn to but cold professionals in my life.",lonely,It's just so shit.,2021-08-09 05:45:14

I was always the shy introverted kid since I can remember and I was okay with this, having only a few friends throughout middle school, high school. I was fine as a kid even though I was alone most of the time, I still had those few friends that I could hang on with. Middle school passed by and inevitably high school came along with horrible acne and seborrheic dermatitis which is painful. Of course, you know most\* kids with acne have lower self esteem, but this thing along with me being introverted caused me to close even more. Being 16-17 at the time I wasn't really interested in relationships so I kept going trying to fix my horrible skin. I turned 21 this year and I still have problems with my skin, idk if I will ever get over it. I feel like I missed out on being a teenager, I'm at this age and I never had a gf, and currently have no friends or even someone to talk to. I was pretty broken before COVID but damn, this thing really messed me because I don't ever go out and when I do, I see all these happy people and it makes me so depressed.

I can stand loss or frustration or anything else really

But loneliness really bites at me sometimes

There is something about the randomness that really upsets me

It comes for anyone at anytime

Could stem from something as meaningless as a simple thought

But it always grows

And then it creeps in and burrows itself in your chest

You feel it wash over as your eyes well and it grabs at your neck

The situation something that should feel terrible feels almost welcoming though

As if I'm surprised to be feeling any emotion at all

They feel like I can't show them to anyone

3511,Partlys4int,1628447108,1,"I wonder if the loneliness gets at me...  
These past years I've noticed that I often see faces of people from my past, in public older and sometimes recognisable. But on a few occasions I couldn't remember their names and so I searched Instagram and other social media to remember their names.  And on a couple of these occasions, it couldn't have been the persons I thought they were.

Just two weeks ago I went to a pub on my own and saw a lady smiling at me. She looked familiar but I didn't really remember so I ignored it (also afraid of rejection). Later, her name popped into my head and I did an Instagram search to be sure. Turns out that the person I thought she was, is pregnant right now.   
And the lady in the pub definitely wasn't. These things mess with my head. I don't know if I can trust my judgment anymore, so I usually avoid social interaction. Especially when it is presumed flirtation, because I reason that the loneliness might make me see things that are not there.

When I'm with one of my few friends (doesn't happen too often), I'm more reassured that what I see is real.

3512,HugeIndependence2861,1628446747,1,"To preface, there's  nothing wrong with me mentally (besides some social anxiety) but the anxiety I get is specifically towards males. Male teachers, students, the janitor (lmao). I just feel uncomfortable around men in general, even though I don't have any prejudice against them (I don't even consider myself a feminist.) Appearance wise I'm not unattractive, overweight, or lacking ambition(F21--in college to be in the medical field], 5'6, 140-something pounds).I've never dated and sometimes feel like I'll never find someone. 

That's the bad thing, I come off as cold to a lot of guys because I simply get anxiety by talking to them. I'm not a rude person at all, I am against talking sh*t and bullying others. It's frustrating &amp; I wish I could have a male friend without breaking down inside. On the other hand, talking to girls doesn't give me any anxiety. I feel completely at ease presenting to a room full of females and am extremely friendly. So i find it so curious how some guys are deathly afraid of interacting with females, while I have my gender about figure out (but I realize its cus I'm a female myself lol)

The main reason I avoid interacting with males is because I was blessed with genetics that make my face go beet red at literally ANYTHING. Something that isn't even embarrassing could happen at any moment and BOOM.. so you could imagine me interacting with any male, aware that my face could potentially go red at any time-- which in turn leads to me blushing &amp; embarrassing myself. That's pretty much how it goes!

 I wish I knew how to talk to guys casually. I don't know why I turned out this way, I have brothers who I talk to on a daily basis. I think this problem could have stemmed from abuse early in my childhood, but I'm not sure.
I've had crushes in the past.. literally only two from elementary up to high school. They were both 5'9 and were just the kind, reserved type well-liked by peers. As I'm getting older though,  I just find myself being attracted to virtually no one (not even on tik toküòÇ)This has to do with the fact that I feel appearance only accounts for like 20% of attraction for me-- the personality (ambition, manners, worldview, intelligence) is 80%. I'm just too picky ig and don't know if I can ever overcome this to get married, find a SO.  I get turned off by the smallest things.

It's already hard enough for me to put myself out there and initiate conversation with people and it's embarrassing to be completely ignored. I think it's a me problem. I think I care about people way more than they care about me despite their actions showing me they actually want to be my friend. Maybe I'm just not interesting enough to stay friends with? Maybe they were fake the entire time? I don't know.

What I do know is i'm kinda glad at my new job I haven't befriended anyone. The second someone tries to have a personal conversation I change topics or act uninterested.

In the grand scheme of things my life is more together now than it ever has been, but as the days go on I have been feeling more and more lonely.  The past two years have done a number on my social life and working exclusively from home has not helped.

The few friends I have are great friends, but even if I reach out they are preoccupied with their own lives and rarely have time to hang out with me.  It would be nice if I could force myself out of my house and go enjoy things on my own... lately that has been very difficult for me.  Just thinking about it gives me anxiety.  I need a friend.  Someone that can relate and isn't going to be fickle.  It would be so nice if someone even took the time to ask me how I'm doing on a semi-consistent basis.

3589,LordSt4rki113r,1628398286,1,"I have been feeling for several years that I am always the person that is starting conversations or reaching out to my friends first.

To make a long story short, I was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018 and underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. I had to leave college and my friends behind for a while because I was so sick. The good news is, I was declared cancer free in February 2019. However, since then, I've felt mostly abandoned by my friends, even the ones that are geographically closer to me. I understand that life happens, and I didn't want cancer to happen to me any more than anyone else did. Yes, it was inconvenient, but aren't horrible things always inconvenient? All of my closest friends had to move on with their lives and finish college and start work, and I get that.

I had to relearn how to be around people and how to do a lot of basic things because I was mostly bedridden for three months, and couldn't have many visitors due to my compromised immune system. That doesn't seem like a long time, but when you are mostly stuck in a bed for even that short of a time, you almost forget how to walk. And when you can't really have visitors other than your immediate family, you really lost your touch with people.

A lot of the time lately I feel responsible for having lost touch with my closest friends. I know that I should not feel that way because those events were out of my control, but that still doesn't fix the problem.

I wish any friend of mine would call me and talk, even if it's just for a little while. I'm going to turn 24 on Monday (it's Saturday evening now), and I'm pretty sure nobody remembers except for my immediate family :c

Sorry if this post delved deep into feelings, but I'm in a really low emotional place. I have so much to be happy about - I just graduated from college, I have a new job in my favorite field (chemistry), I'm alive and healthy, I have a family and dogs that love me, etc. - but I feel like I have no one to celebrate anything with.

But i have decided that continuing to come here in an attempt to lessen the pain of my singular status is a waste of time. I'm done giving energy to the victimhood of having become a distant memory to everyone I have ever loved. I'm done with feeling ashamed to be so isolated in life. 

I'm starting over again now and I am looking ahead. Instead of close friendships or lasting love, I can look forward to cordial acquaintanceships. 

Is that enough? I finally understand why my wife left. I sucked her into the vortex of loneliness that is my life, moving to a new city for career. We tried hard to make friends. I had none, no way to ease the burden of aloneness I carry. 

So I thought, for a while, I could share this burden with you. You understand it. You, like me, face it every day,. But I think I am rather in my own small space here. I'm older, for one. Most of you are just discovering that you have been inducted for life into the No-Tribe. 

Instead, I have decided to embrace it, to wear it with pride. I am the No-Tribe! I don't need anyone else! I can live a full happy life even if I am the only person I know.

3621,Legit_Forsaken84,1628387177,1,"      I (36m) have been single for 14 years now. I know, right! You're probably wondering why so long. Well this is the story of the heart, my heart, and how it ended up scattered into pieces. I did change all the names by the way, just to be safe. 

        It all started in 6th grade. The time where every young boy starts to take notice of girls. I was one such boy. My first girlfriend, Tessa,  noticed me first. We started talking and hanging out together. She ended up inviting me to her birthday party and of course I accepted. Was the first party I went to. One thing lead to another and we kissed. My first kiss. A week later she dumped me. Come to find out, she was into other girls, and kissing me clarified that. Later on she moved and I never spoke to her after that. 

      A year passes and I'm flirting with just about every girl. Until one caught my eye. She was somewhat goth, a bad girl if you will. Violat just got out of a relationship and needed someone to talk to, me. As I comforted her, sparks in my heart started to fly. I ended up asking her out and she said yes. Holding hands and kissing, we where inseparable. A month passes and she starts having feelings for her ex. Of course her ex knew this and tried to fight me, but I avoided that conflict. Once she found out, she left me for him, her ex. She said something about not fighting for her, I need to be a man, mind you it was 7th grade. I see her from time to time in town. 

      My third girlfriend was a special one. I don't say special lightly. We will call her Kelly. It was freshmen year and adult hood was approaching fast. It was in p.e. when I seen her first, and when I did, I knew she was the one. Kelly was kneeling down, tieing her shoe, when it felt like my heart skipped a beat. A feeling I never had before. At that moment I asked her out, she said yes. It was great for months, I was so happy.  Then that dreaded day came, she broke it off with me. Come to find out, she had a crush on another guy and was waiting for him to be single. That day I learned that the one isn't always the one. Like they might be your ""the one"", but you may not be theirs. I still talk to her from time to time.

Three years ago my 2 best friends died within 4 days of each other. I was going through a breakup at the time and the feeling of being utterly and hopelessly alone never went away.

3635,bakeybakeybakey,1628382228,1,"Hi all. After a pretty messy breakup and no contact with my ex-girlfriend, whom I was and still am in  love with, she reached out to me and wanted to hangout, apologize for/talk over things she felt bad about, and even make out (which I resisted for the most part at first).  

Also, she revealed to me that she'd been sexually assaulted by a guy she was seeing for a bit. That about broke me, firstly because it's horrible for that to happen to anyone, secondly because that was my baby girl...the person I put years into fostering a genuinely positive environment of intimacy with had been messing with other guys, and then was used and thrown away.

The hangouts happened for several days before she reversed course and no longer wanted to talk to me or have me over (for about a week), before a week later wanting to talk on the phone every day after work, and even have me over again.

This part really tortures me. She had me over to hangout for a while-- before she went over to some dudes place &amp; vineyard or something...secluded ass place, and I said in a friendly (non-jealous) way ""hey make sure it's someone you know well, so that you can feel safe around him, or maybe even bring one of your friends"" to which she replied it was only a playdate for her dog.

Fast forward to a few days later and I received an early morning text asking to call, and I was instantly hear-racingly excited/on edge. Then I found out that day I told her not to go if she wasn't super familiar-- she was raped, again. Upon finding that out I did my best to keep my composure and provide the comfort and advice she needed (because she doesn't/didn't have anyone else that she felt safe talking to). Eventually she wanted to fall asleep on the phone to feel safe and comfortable, which honestly felt nice because I was able to be there and she looked to me. 

I don't hear much from her, and at a dinner she was invited to she essentially gave me the cold shoulder not even maintaining conversations or having eye contact. I forgot to mention, but after the first assault before the second she had come for another dinner/evening and we had a wonderful time--laughing, talking, she even asked for a massage (something that we did when we were dating).

Haven't hear from her since. Its been almost 3 weeks, and I recently heard through a friend of mine that she has a boyfriend-- after recently saying she didn't want to be around 'any men'.

I don't know if she's just trying to put out the image that she's doing okay and has a solid relationship because she's so traumatized (and the conversation already was about relationships) or if she simply was lying to me. She still has all of our couples photos up, and wears the anniversary-specific charms and stuff I got her but I feel so confused.

Any advice is welcome, thank you in advance.

Love will find you where you are. No matter if that beautiful heart of yours feels near or too far. Love in a big way makes our hearts race. It calms our storm on our most dreary days. Romance is a flower that blooms as love begins. It opens our minds to something new and beautiful. It restores faith within again. A broken heart can be amended always by true love. But the broken heart may be afraid to try again. Or may never have known real love. 

Love inspires us to be brave and to believe in the beautiful essence that may seem as only a dream. But don‚Äôt be afraid to let love find you. Always and no matter what‚Ä¶.Believeüíùüíùü•∞",lonely,üíñüíù,2021-08-08 08:14:56

I have lost all my friends, even my bestfriend whom I believed to be the best friend I could ever have. We have known each other since we were babies but this spring she got herself a boyfriend. I tried so many times to reach out to her to hang out but she always had something else to do. I feel completely betrayed and so lonely, I tried speaking with my other friends about this but they still think highly of her, which I don‚Äôt understand since she abondoned them too.

I really am stuck with nobody to talk to, I live in a really small town so there aren‚Äôt really new people to meet either.

It hit me few days ago DAMN I have no one....I looked at stars for 30 minutes thinking and and....This is my life. At first I would get angry but after thinking clearly I couldn't figure out how to unfuck myself..

Aware that I will always be alone and not wanting to go through depression again I had a plan which worked until recently.....And that plan is to distract myself as much as possible with progress which would provide me satisfaction and wouldn't let me fall in depression. I figured if I progressed every day instead of just playing video games I would feel better and more confident..and that worked but now I'm so lonely....

I'm going to gym, learning programming, reading entrepreneurship books, playing  tennis from time to time and and that is all nice but I'm 99% alone....

I'm kinda mad at myself for feeling this way because I thought I was better than this...I thought being so goal oriented would protect me from wanting company but I was wrong...

To me, it seems like I have struggled since I first entered this world. I got the name as a ''cry baby'' and would unintentionally isolate myself from others due to my sensitive nature. As an adult, it hasn't got much better. The internet, sharing stories with like-minded people, even if they live over a thousand miles away is what keeps me going - the very thought of knowing I am not alone and someone out there shares the same thoughts to me is just mind blowing as anyone who suffers from a mental health problem knows full when how isolating it can be, making you feel like you are the only one who is suffering.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I crave friendship. I want, like all of us, to feel a part of something. Every day I wake up, I'm tired of rolling over to the other side and sleeping in until late noon. I want to experience life to it's fullest, even if that means going for a walk at 7 AM with my camera alone.

I have no problem with girls in fact I get along very well with them, but there comes a time when I take a step back because I am afraid that they see that I never go out or I am alone most of the time, this did not happen to me with my ex friend that I stopped talking to.

3684,codecrunchie,1628360691,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

3697,Classifiedbutterfly,1628351970,1,"I got in a big fight with my step-dad the night before last. I heard him and my mom talking about how mean it is to cheat on someone. I said you can't judge all cheaters the same because there is different reasons and situations. I said this because about 2 years into my current 9 year relationship I did cheat. It was with my very manipulative 1st love and I regretted it immediately and went home to tell my boyfriend now husband. We have talked it through many times and he understands I made a mistake that was based in my childhood trauma and my ex manipulation. Anyway I'm not going to explain myself to people who get pissed at me for that because idk how to make anyone understand. Anyhow my step-dad got all loud and starts yelling about how I'm defending cheaters. I said I will because I've been there and its not so black and white. He then proceeds to yell ""Do you want me to get into some shit about you, we could get into it."" Then slams the door and leaves. I was so taken aback by this and just left shaking and in tears. The next day he sends me a text and all it says is ""sorry for getting so upset last night."" I send him this long ass text.

""I could get over you yelling that's easy, I could get over you not listening to what I have to say and not giving me a single chance to try to make you understand my perspective of what I went through, but when you have made your statement about how ""ANYONE who cheats that says something about their character"", it really struck a chord with me. Whether you think so or not that is a very judgmental statement put towards anyone who has done this including me, it felt as if you had slapped a bright red A on me that I can never remove. Your statement implies that people are unredeemable, deffective and even evil. I'm not going to explain myself to you further because I already tried and Jeff understands every bit of it all and that's all that matters really. If you ever want to have a calm conversation about it and actually try to understand a new perspective that would be great. What hurt me most though and kept me crying until I fell asleep late last night was your other statement about ""bringing up shit about me."" I will never say something like this to Aaliyah because it is the single most hurtful thing you have ever said to me. I don't know why you had to turn so personal so fast but you are clearly holding in judgments and resentments towards me that you haven't expressed. I feel our relationship is irrevocably changed until we talk that through, which I'm too emotional to do today. I'm going to guess you are thinking you didn't mean that, but the thing with words and people like me is we never forget them. They worm around like parasites in our brains and in our worst moments confirm the self hate we feel. I'm already on my way to forgiving you because im truly so thankful for you every day, I love you dearly and you mean so much to me but I'm hurting right now. Please give me time.""

Step dad responds via text

""You are taking this way to personal. I'm not talking about cheating early in the relationship 
 I'm talking about cheating after being in a deeply committed / married to someone for years. The conversation was not about you in the first place.""


I personally feel and my hubby agrees that he didn't read my whole message because he didn't even acknowledge my main point. Also the convo I overheard  about cheating wasn't about anyone in specific and I was in a committed relationship of 2 years when I had my transgression so I felt it applied to me. I tried reaching out to my mom for help and all she said was idk what to tell you. He can be an asshole. I feel so frustrated. üòû Maybe I should have just forgiven him and tried to move on. I just want to know what you guys think so I can get some outside perspective, thanks.

Ps please don't slam me for my cheating story I know I did wrong and have talked about it with my husband for 7 years now.",lonely,Feeling really sad and just want to know what others think of this situation.,2021-08-08 01:59:30

Everone asks me if I'm okay or whether I'm happy, but there is really nothing going on... anyone would be grateful to have my life.

        Its just that I've been losing interests lately, I don't wanna do anything, at the same time I want to do everything, its so hard to elaborate the feeling, all these people in my life but I can't relate to non of them I feel that no one will ever understand, its not that anyone thinks I'm weird, but its just I can act like you thats it... like... how do you think you are my friend l? I just like what you like. But no one like what I like... because even I don't know what I like, I always thought that this is because I'm schizophrenic, but it's not... this is just me as a person.

       The part where no one can relate is simple... I do stuff no one else does, like... taking pills without water, keeping food in my pockets, self harm, barely laugh/smile (although I'm a funny person n.t. check my memes), and I have high tolerance to everything basically... it can be little stuff but it has an impact.

      I'm not ""special"" or anything I'm just way too dumb to be a human at this point, and I'm not that good of a person either, and it's not that I need a girlfriend I've been into 8 relationships, I literally have rejected a girl recently 'cuz I don't have time for her, I'm super passive, I have this dream to get all the money and make everyone in my life happy then commit fuckin' suicide. That's my dream.

Dear Redditors,

I am 23F, Asian and I am writing this to look for a potential partner.

I want to be loved. Yes, everyone does, and this is a normal wish right?

But God doesnt like me or maybe I committed a very bad crime in another life. When I was very small, I was sexually harrassed by my neighbors and from then on, I have been super shy and easily startled when someone suddenly approached me.

I didnt realize from that moment I hated my own race and suffered from social anxiety until I finished college. But I figured I had a fantasy for non-Asian men.

However, I am surrounded by Asians and I have to always close my room door because of that. If some Asian man approaches me, I will be disgusted to the point that I might faint. Okay, I am not a racist. I can communicate normally with Asian people, and I respect them, but when it comes to relationships and marriage, its a no from me.

I know this is a result of the people who raped me in the past and the fact that I was bullied at high school. I went to therapy but yea it seems like it doesnt work at all. I cant have feelings for Asian men.

But I wanna be loved. I wanna kiss someone when he feels terrible from work, I wanna watch him eating my food, which is one of the best things that make me happy.

I have no other ways to resort to online dating, as long as we plan to meet one day.

But first, i wanna be friend, and get to know each other.

Let me introduce myself:

Im 23 and Im a personal asistant for a small firm. Im INTJ, kinda shy at first but once you know me, you will see how talkative I am.

I love reading about geography and astronomy. I love swimming and watching magic shows. And... if you wanna make smile, just get me a cat, I love cats so much.

Above all, i want a family, with my partner and kids.

I dont know how LDR will work, but can you give each other a chance and see what happens?

Thank you for reading my long post and Im looking forward to hearing from you.

I wish you could send me a long introduction as well!!

Best regards.

as for internet friends, it has become a major problem to make one too. people on the internet don‚Äôt care about making friends that much. some people can just block or ghost you for no reason(though i must admit i ghost people too sometimes because the conversations we have are either too awkward and i overthink stuff or we dont fit that well). also most of the people already have someone else either irl or online and i‚Äôm not able to compete with the other people they talk to because i'm just boring and i dont really know how to start a convo. i dont like stuff that people usually like and do, my interests are kinda extraordinary from a pov of an average person. in other words, im a stupid nerd.

I dont know what i can do with all of that. most of the advices like ¬´join some clubs¬ª or ¬´go out somewhere¬ª don't work because i live in a small town in a second world country and theres pretty much nowhere i can go out to. even if there were some places i could go out to, i wouldnt be confident enough to leave my home. i tried talking to people from my town and some near towns online so that i would have a chance to meet them, but the conversation usually ends in about half an hour.

When I was a part of them and went to see them they'd do things without me behind me they'd talk which isn't what friends are supposed to do . So continue either spending time alone doing things I love or even play sports without my friend group they use to tease me for hanging out with juniors in my room .

The way I have accepted my ending. The absence of a goal for yourself.... The absence of you...i wonder if I would end my life if it weren't for my kids.... With nothing to look forward to.... I am slowly draining myself of all human emotions.... Laying waste to the physique..... I am getting ready to die...
Everything should hopefully fall in place.
Its a rather odd feeling.... Wanting to be wanted, in a silent lonely universe.


To accept that every one has their own lives to be busy with and your loneliness is not really a concern of theirs....
To understand that... You need to fill your mind and soul with stuff to do for yourself to keep yourself engaged.....
You are alone..... 

It becomes difficult to accept the loneliness that is felt in the heart. To know that numbers in the contact list doesn't make a difference.... To know that, the phone will never echo a voice that genuinely cares about you.... To accept the situation.... Painfully.... While tears roll down your cheeks....it's gonna take a while...
Moms voice comforts me.... But I don't have the heart to cry in front of her.... I don't want her and dad to feel bad.... Don't want them to spoil a day thinking of this unfortunate human being...who regrettably was born to their world..... 

Tried sleeping it off....the feeling cancerously claws back... With a evident grip on me.... Can't think of anything that I can do alone that will change my mood....probably another drunken night....numb myself to sleep again.... Block the receptacle of senses....
Truth is.... No one cares.... Who cares what I feel.... Work.. Make money.... Ensure that dependants have everything that need..... 
Then your work is done..... Then you can..... Disappear..... Like the wisp.... You always dream off.... Walk slowly amongst the woods of decay.... Slowly striding to your end.....return to dust",lonely,When to know and accept loneliness....,2021-08-07 19:02:43

I was kind of nervous for the new school year to start since I dropped all my friends because of how they treated me. I've always been the type of person to love being alone but hate feeling alone. I set my expectations high and thought that I would at least make 1 new friend. But I was wrong. Reality hit me like a bus.

Nobody talked to me. Nobody acknowledged me. Nobody cared about me. I set my expectations too high. I was so anxious I could barley do anything. My hands were shaking badly and my heart was racing. I couldn't bring myself to even do anything without panicking internally. I sat alone in all my classes and never spoke once. I kept avoiding social situations to keep myself safe from risks and embarrassment. Yesterday, my entire class period forgot I existed while we were doing a class task and we had to change the routine all because of me. I have the quiet kid reputation. I'm the kid that never talks. I haven't felt this bad since the 5th grade when I was bullied and felt like an outcast. I've always felt a little bit isolated and alone but not in this way.

I feel stupid, weird, and ugly. I've felt like this for years and it's tiring to wake up and think the same thing every day. It just continuously gets worse and worse.

I wonder to myself ""Why me?"" all the time. I'm sure most people do too. But I'm just tired and sad :(

I don't know if I have an anxiety disorder or any other mental illness but I am not diagnosed and I do not want to self diagnose at all. Last school year I felt really depressed but I focused on healing myself when I could. I did have unhealthy coping mechanisms though. I've never told one person about this or how I've been bullied. Now my sad and depressing thoughts are starting to come back and all my work has been for nothing. It sucks feeling lonely.

We lived together for 4 years, had a cat, life seemed... full, and good, and hopeful, and I had happiness and family for the first time in my life. I moved across the US 3 years into our relationship so I could be with her, so we wouldn't have to fly back and forth anymore. She's the best friend I ever had. The love of my life.

Now, I don't know. I'm thousands of miles from where I grew up. All my friends are friends we made together, and although they've been very supportive of me, spending time with them feels like being haunted by her ghost. She even took our cat. I have nothing.

I don't remember how to meet people. I'm unemployed right now and struggling to even find the motivation to work. I just sit here in the room I'm renting in someone's basement and I sob and I sob and I sob until I'm dehydrated, and then I down a bottle of water and then I sob some more. I had saved up money during the pandemic to pay off her debt, and now I'm coasting by on those savings.

I was always lonely before her. Loneliness feels so much deeper when you've filled that hole, and then lost it. I mean, I spoke to her almost every day for 8 years. Now what do I do? Where do I even go?

I'm trying not to drink. I'm trying to schedule appointments and make plans. I'm trying to keep my life moving, but it all feels so empty, so devoid of meaning. I wake up every morning feeling sick. I have a migraine that's lasted weeks. I can't stop fucking crying.

How the hell do you fill your life with people again? How do you move on from losing your person? How do you accept that they're gone, and how do you even begin to fill the hole in your heart again? I miss waking up every day next to her, and sharing everything with her. It was the best time in my life. And I worry I'll never find that again, that it's too late for me, that I'm not good enough, and that I may never even want it with anyone else. All of my interests are things we shared, so I don't even have comfort media to fall back on. I'm tired of staring at the ceiling, of staring at books I don't have the energy to read, of crying *dozens* of times per day, of this sickening, hollow emptiness that pervades everything.

I just want to meet new people. I want to be confident enough to walk up to strangers and join a conversation. I need new friends and new contexts, free of my ex's ghost. But I think that ghost is always going to be here, no matter what.

I have been said that I look modestly attractive from both sides of the gender scale and have been also offered modelling jobs in the past. 

Having said that, I have never been in a relationship or felt intimacy and recently I am just being desperate for it by using those despicable dating apps. For the most part of my life I have been socially awkward (chronic anxiety) at the point where i had to drastically change myself at the age of 19 (for example, started speaking to girls...that extreme) and girls have just ignored me because I have ignored them more severely in later stages. 

I have been in Love once and the girl was extremely beautiful (at least according to me) but as it is, love is mutual and more than looks, personality matters (at least from my observation) and though being having a systematic approach towards way of approaching people, it's not at all natural. Naturally I just want to be left alone. Having that rejection trauma, it just makes these things senseless for me.

Today at age 23 and unemployed for a long time, this paradoxical dilemma that I have encountered ever since the beginning of me feeling lonely (age 19), I have been in a constant misery.

3750,Legit_Forsaken84,1628315489,1,"        I've been single for 14 years. I know, right! You're probably wondering why so long. Well this is the story of the heart, my heart. I did change all the names by the way, just to be safe.

        It all started in 6th grade. The time where every young boy starts to take notice of girls. I was one such boy. My first girlfriend, Tessa, noticed my first. We started talking and hanging out together. She ended up inviting me to her birthday party and of course I accepted. Was the first party I went to. One thing lead to another and we kissed. My first kiss. A week later she dumped me. Come to find out, she was into other girls and kissing me clarified that. Later on she moved and I never spoke to her after that.

       A year passes and I'm flirting with just about every girl. Until one caught my eye. She was somewhat goth, a bad girl if you will. Violat just got out of a relationship and needed someone to talk to, me. As I comforted her, sparks in my heart started to fly. I ended up asking her out and she said yes. Holding hands and kissing, we where inseparable. A month passes and she starts having feelings for her ex. Of course her ex knew this and tried to fight me but I avoided that conflict. Once she found out, she left me for him, her ex. She said something about not fighting for her, I need to be a man, mind you it was 7th grade. I see her from time to time in town. 

        My third girlfriend was a special one. I don't say special lightly. We will call her Kelly. It was freshmen year and adult hood was approaching fast. It was on p.e. when I seen her, and when I did I knew she was the one. She was kneeling down, tieing her shoe, when it felt like my heart skipped a beat. A feeling I never had before. I asked jer out at that moment and she said yes. It was going great for months, I was so happy. Then that dreaded day came, and she broke it off with me. Come to find out, she had a crush on another guy and was waiting for him to be single. That day I learned that the one isn't always the one. Like they might be your ""the one"" but you may not be their ""the one"". I still talk to her from time to time.

3758,DairFair,1628312560,2,"I feel like every person has to go through a series of awkward trials and errors to learn how to deal with social interactions and dating. Supposedly you try and you fail, you learn more about yourself, and you slowly begin to find your groove, figuring out exactly what you want out of yourself and other people, and at some point the puzzle pieces fit together. The speed at which people are able to achieve this obviously varies. But as time goes on, the disparity increases more and more, and within your age group, the expectation that there is experience and maturity increases.   
  
  

I got sexually assaulted four years ago, and while I understand it wasn't my fault, I've regressed to the point where unsolicited physical touch freaks me out. I can't sleep in a bed with another person, or even in the same room sometimes - I own a twin bed just for the fact that another human being would have trouble being in there with me at the same time. Any sort of physical intimacy immediately gets me depersonalizing, and I don't really feel comfortable in my own body. I feel like there's no easy way to talk about this with prospective partners, and placing my trust in someone to have them guide me into rediscovering how to experience physical intimacy seems like a really big thing to ask of somebody. I don't know if I'll ever find someone patient enough with me to help me overcome this, and god knows I can't undergo trial by fire in isolation.
    
  

It doesn't help that I've realized that I'm queer after the fact. A lot of queer folks have to relive their awkward teen years in their 20's because they couldn't come out and experience their own sexuality and honest desires the first time around. I've not really had a chance to explore that due to both the pandemic and my deep fear of touching people/being touched. Dating apps are an absolute shit show - the men have been incredibly creepy to me so far, and outside of that, socially ""spinning the plates"" until you reach the point of real interaction has been incredibly challenging. I'm doing my best to find myself and resolve these issues on my own, but to be honest, an external gentle guiding hand would be a godsend. My friends are getting into serious relationships and living their best lives (which is great, I'm really happy for them) and I'm really afraid that I'll never figure it out, that I'll forever be uncomfortable in my own skin.",lonely,It‚Äôs really hard not to fall behind.,2021-08-07 15:02:40

I know isolating myself is not good for overall health but in all those relationships I feel so burden and not to mention Alone. Like all the time. 

All of those relationships were predicated on what I could do for them. Growing up I was ostracized by both parents so I‚Äôm used to it but as they got older and needed help they relied on me and not my siblings (who they showered with everything I never got). And I‚Äôm still resentful about it. With my friendships, I was basically a free therapist. I considered them my best friends but I could never talk about what I was going through. And when I did, within 2-5 responses the conversation would switch to them and I‚Äôd end up comforting them. I was in an abusive (not physical) relationship, and when I finally felt ready to talk with them about it‚Ä¶ crickets. 

Anyways, long story short, I just felt it was better to be actually alone than to maintain relationships that made me feel lonely. I‚Äôm not sure if I made the right call or if this come back to bite me in the ass. 

I‚Äôm also worried that it just may be because of who I am as a person. You know what they like to say that if you can‚Äôt form a healthy relationship with anyone you meet, it may just be you.

3763,moneybrns9,1628311294,1,The title says it all but let me explain. I never been the person to have a lot of friends or any friends. I might find one or two people who I end up getting close with but due to my inexperience with friendships I fuck it up. Im not one who remembers birthdays and even tho they remember mine and I try my best to remember theirs I ALWAYS FORGET. I get invited for a night out sometimes and for the most part I never go and when I do go I'm always standing in the corner by myself looking like a loser. People will come up to me a million times to ask me if I'm ok but nobody will stand there and socialize with me. Due to these experiences as soon as someone invites me somewhere I automatically say no and once you say no too many times people don't bother to ask anymore. Then there's social media and phones. I don't have any social media except this and snap chat. People pressure me all the time to get Facebook or Instagram but I just can't. I'm not that type of guy. And because I'm not on those two platforms people leave me out of things or even accuse me of acting like I'm better than them for not having it. Smh.... as far as the phone goes. Because I'm not good holding a conversation I don't call or text people first. If you text or call me and start up a conversation I'm able to keep it going but I'm never one to initiate. I've been told numerous times because I don't text or call people that I'm selfish but these people don't understand where I'm coming from. I do care about them and what they are doing its just that I feel that if I call ortext them that I will be bothering them or better yet I might bore them to death. My job is also another thing that keep me from making events or spending time with them but nobody understands. Because of all this I'm alone and people consider me a bad friend. Am I a bad friend???,lonely,I'm not a good friend I guess thats why I'm alone.,2021-08-07 14:41:34

Anyways, i really do not talk to any of my coworkers. I have lots of reasons:
1. Lots of disrespect. 
2. I genuinely am afraid of being considered annoying. 


There‚Äôs a group of older women who do not like me. Basically they tried to get me fired by accusing me of making a mistake. I showed proof to mgmt that it was not me, it was actually them. 
No one got in trouble. But the women tried to brush it off  and they want to be BFFs, but I told them I was not interested. They never apologized. They just were overly nice, almost kissing my ass.

there‚Äôs a new worker. And she‚Äôs ok. I mainly just like her cuz our work overlaps and she is the only reliable person in her dept. 

She is BFF with the women who hate me. 
But I still am nice to her. 

Then I noticed that she doesn‚Äôt talk to me or acknowledge me when around the other women. 

I told her that I noticed that and that I don‚Äôt like being treated that way. 
She kept denying it. (I have told her several times)

I have went up and talked to her in front of the women, and her tone is different around them, apathetic and vague. 

But when it is her and I, she is super bubbly. 

Today when I walked in the break-room she was there with her friends, she didn‚Äôt say anything to me. Then when her friends left, she had a million things to tell me. 

I said ‚Äúoh. Right. You only talk to me when no one is around‚Äù

-Get a call early in the morning a few days later with her telling me the same traumatic event had happened again several days prior. I care about her, so I help with advice and some sort of comfort but my heart is shattered again. She wanted to fall asleep on the phone, which was welcome for me.

-Distant for two days, then, the last time I saw her and spoke to her (at another dinner, just casual), she was cold and distant eventually telling me she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, or any guys for that matter.


-2 weeks of nothing and I hear through the grapevine that apparently she‚Äôs dating again....

Anyways thanks if you read it.

3806,SportsMajor,1628294675,1,"I like myself, I like life, but I always felt like it could've been better. Also dealing with loneliness and that's something I've learned to deal with. However, since I've really began feeling this loneliness over the past year, I made the difficult decision to cut off most of social media:

¬∑ I got rid of the Facebook app and may deactivate my account in the coming days. If all goes well, I plan on deleting my account.

¬∑ I deleted the Snapchat app and, as of today, began the process of deleting my two accounts.

¬∑ On Instagram, I deactivated my public account and plan on deleting it in the near future. On my private account, I finished a long process of deleting many followers from my page throughout the past few years and have toned it down to 14. Those 14 like what I post (memes) and I'm cool with them. That may seem strange, but one day I just began doing so and it became a habit.

¬∑ So all I have left are this Reddit account and my private Instagram. I plan on keeping both as I like the content I see on each account.

I figured if I'm lonely, why continue feeding into the world of social media where everyone is showing off who they are? I wanna go off the grid for some time and continue working on myself. Not entirely though, so that's why I'm keeping my private Instagram and my Reddit account.",lonely,Cutting off social media was great for me.,2021-08-07 10:04:35

3809,MinnieTea,1628293964,1,"I can't be myself. Even when I look back at a point of time where things were a bit good I can't say I was ever ‚Äúmyself‚Äù during that time. I'm treated differently from other people cause of a mental disorder. I get told I'm weird, too clingy, whiny. I opt to change the myself. Be quiet, speak when spoken to, don't laugh aloud, cry, get angry, etc, which makes people think I'm shy but it's because people don't wanna hear my shit. Because of this, I appear approachable, but it leads to me getting taken advantage of. People just only want to see the good side instead of the flaws. Or rather, they'll see the flaws but want you to get rid of them quietly. Same with depression and burnout. If you openly admit to dealing with these, people will seem understanding at first but then will get tired of you and will drift away from you because you ruined the mood with negative emotions. 

Then people will respond with ‚Äúfind people who will accept you‚Äù gee, that sounds super easy! Why haven't I thought of doing that for 16 fucking years?  Man, I wonder why it hasn't worked yet, oh right BECAUSE IT DOESN‚ÄôT. If you are going through loneliness, abuse, depression that has been so embedded in your life to the point of it being so hard to bounce up in a more positive life you will have to hide your emotions, distract yourself so you won't think about it or the other alternative is being alone. But but BUT!!!! It‚Äôs socially unacceptable to be alone! We were meant to be social creatures! Gosh, we‚Äôre going against nature! You'll die alone and you don't want that! There's no winning with this. This is exactly why it's difficult to spot depression and loneliness is because it's looked down upon in society. It's not a favorable trait so people put up a smile on their face even when life is shitty. 

Of course, it is possible to improve your mental health, but it's not as easy as people make it out to be by seeing a therapist. And I hate it. I had to harden myself up so much due to the pain and trauma I went through in my life. I hope things will change to accept people who aren't doing well in life instead of others reeling them in under a promise and hope that they accepted them only to just throw them back to sea for a more ‚Äúsocially and mentally well‚Äù person.

I‚Äôve never had close friends, so when it came to different educational paths we didn‚Äôt keep in touch. 
I honestly don't blame them, they meet new people and they naturally just start to spend time with them.

My jobs very isolated from people, so apart from my one colleague, I quite literally don't talk to anyone.

I'm left with my own lingering thoughts essentially 24/7.
I miss talking to people, I know I'm not the most interesting person ever but I always try and make the most of a conversation. 

I've tried to talking to my friends, but they're clearly never as into the conversation as I am, and this just puts me in a really horrible slump, and I'm just worried I'll be alone forever.

3819,DarwonkaIsTrans,1628288063,1,"Sooo *again* this week I'm deleting the utterly useless, evil, weird fake-society nexus known as Facebook (Facebutt to those ) and as the final task of my usual series of failed attempts, Im going through old messages going back twelve years. There are group chats among high school classmates, long lost half siblings, trolls, fellow volunteers, ex dates, ex friends, ex everything. I've had a tragic life; I've missed out on almost all of it and/or been mis-oriented to it, the pain perseveres even at 46.

Some beginner info about me: I am adhd, possibly autistic and probably complex ptsd. I have kyphosis and a hole in my heart and hormonal migraines. I often forget to eat, and live in poverty. I was born in a small town in Florida to religious hippie parents and moved to a suburb in NYC when I was seven. I had two younger brothers, one who died and one who's a likely sociopath (blame white male privilege for his ability to get away with everything). My family scapegoated me, neglected and abused me while the entire class bullied me then years later gaslit me about it (ex ""dont you remember?! They would sit down and you would start cursing at them.""... wtf even). People started dying when we moved to NY and half my family died by the time I was 25. I dropped out of college FOUR times (Deans list to 0.5 gpa 
in one semester) and still havent finished;  failed my potential careers as a poet amd anthropologist. Im a 911 (almost) survivor (I was there that day but not inside the towers). My brother lives in a multimillion dollar mansion on the north shore but that too is tenuous, bizarre and unstable. I cant get my brain to let go of shit and just work. I cant work so I live off of people. I dont have health insurance. I refuse to apply for disability because the psychopaths who run our government will pull my benefits if I actually get $2k together ( look it up) and I make a decent salary if only I could. Work. So ..again, abeyance. Also, fuck them.

Inside, I feel very *intense* about things.., sensations are huge- scary and also needed. Socially I'm needy but I hide it, I scorn most but Im overly friendly on the outside and smile too much. It feels like everyone else moves about freely but too slowly to interest me, change randomly, are too shallow to connect with and are too different for me to relate to. It was soooo much easier when I was in my 20s and 30s but Im at that age now where I feel a bit awkward ""partying"" so I'm left with working through my impairments to be consistent and commit to social engagements with strangers.

Please dont say anything ""woeful"" (love that word) lol... to trigger me like "" this is the worst thing ever heard"" or "" i feel bad for you"" as I loathe pity almost as much as I loathe rich people. I just thought.. I don't know...what do you think, what can I do? there's so much more to say and explain yet you probably dislike me already.

I'm 36 and have MS. I was diagnosed when I was 29, and I've gone downhill quickly. I came out of a long term relationship 2 years ago, and since then I've been living on my own. I've recently lost my driving licence because MS has left me partially sighted. I'm housebound. I don't really speak to anyone. I'm fully aware that everybody else is getting back to their normal lives after covid, and I'm alone in my home and I'm at the back of everyone's thoughts. MS has taken my life. I don't work and because I'm now unable to drive and am a wheelchair user I'm unable to go and see anybody. The situation is not my fault and I thought that my friends wouldn't want to see me alone. I don't believe it's anyone else's responsibility to get me out of this, but I literally can't leave my home now. If it was my friend in this situation I would at least text them and ask him if they were ok. I see people such as my carer, and my cleaner, but I am fully aware that the only people I talk to are people I pay. Nobody genuinely wants to spend time with me. All my friends from before have drifted away and I feel like I mean nothing to anyone.

I don't know how I'm supposed to live with this. This is my life now  and I don't see how it can ever be any different. I can't go on alone. I want a hug and I just want to feel like I mean something to somebody.

I am so alone and I feel so stuck. I wish I could scream or shout but what should I expect from strangers. 

My ex was the only person I kind of felt understood me or listened, but through time he just became like the others, passive, unconcerned. He was also in denial about his addiction and never acted on what he said he would do. We would just talk about it forever, which is where my anger comes from. 

We broke up in the past and got back together but I feel that was because of how chronically lonely I am in life. How do people have intimate friendships ? or do people live without feeling alone in the world ? How do you not think about a way out everyday ?

As I was crossing the street I saw an old man on his bike, so I waited for him to cross by, then I followed my way, he looked at me and said ""Go home (migrants, I think he also sad that)"" then I shouted in Hungarian (I'm a Brazilian living here) ""Are you talking to me?"" no answer, he followed his way and I followed mine. For few minutes I felt bad, like he doesn't know me, I did nothing bad for him (the opposite) and this is what he gave me, than I remembered He doesn't know me, I have the right to be here and my life is MY LIFE, he cannot take the joy I have here because he didn't give it to me...

3846,Geodude074,1628272613,1,"I'm thinking of a couple weekends ago when I went to the park with my RC (it's a hobby grade monster truck that goes 60mph+). I drew a crowd from a bunch of sweet little kids, and we spent about half an hour doing donuts around the baseball diamond, kicking backflips off the fence, and just having a hoot.

That is until their parents came to take them away from the creepy scary guy. They didn't even look me in the eye, just hushed their kids away because they didn't like the sight of me.

I'm used to it though. I live in a small, ultraconservative, Christian, ""Trump Won""-signs-on-every-lawn small town. I don't fit in, I'm not white, I'm not Christian, and I'm definitely not a Trump supporter. 

In a cartoon world I'm like the Pigeon Man from Hey Arnold, except my pigeons are RCs. Kids are fascinated by them, they're so sweet and innocent and accepting and they just want to learn more. They don't look at me funny, or judge me by what I wear, or avoid eye contact because they think I'm strange. Kids are wonderful until they're ruined by society.

There might be many reasons why you held back your tears to the point that you even wonder if you can cry anymore. It doesn‚Äôt matter now.  
Having the choice to cry alone in a room or when the situation demands is very healthy and will save you from dealing with a lot of emotional dissonances later on.

I am not going to try to convince you further why this is healthy for you‚Ä¶  
because you are going straight to the how-to now!

Excited!

***Step 1:*** *Always Always Always feel into the body! No matter what.*  
*Tune into your body, and see where you are feeling the sensation you are feeling. Is it in your chest, stomach, throat, shoulder?*

***Step 2:*** *Tune in to the point of highest intensity in that area*

***Step 3:*** *Feeling into that point of highest intensity, take a deep loving breath in and in the exhale Sigh slowly and LOUDLY (please do it loudly, not like a normal exhale)*

***Step 4:*** *With every exhale,* ***allow*** *that feeling to grow or to express itself more fully! This step is hard to articulate, however, you will know if you allowed it.*

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Please note that during these steps you are always concentrating on the sensations. All the movies, thoughts, ‚ÄúI should/must-have‚Äù, ignore them.

**Our goal** is to *be present with the sensations* in the body and explore that.  
\*\*\*If you feel your eyes well up then allow it but never force it!

For some background, I moved to my new high school at the start of freshman year.

What sucked was that everyone already knew each other had their own friend groups, so it was just hard for me to fit in.

I consider myself a very social person who thrives in large groups, and I was so happy when I was part of a big friend group that lasted about a year, but eventually dissolved. Within that group, most people have other close friends that they can talk to 1:1 within the group or outside. 

What really pains me is that Im the only one that doesnt. I don't know what's stopping me from building deep 1:1 friendships with others, talking with someone every single day for a long time. I just feel that most of my friendships are all transactional, or business-oriented. I never talk to someone just for the sake of talking to them 1:1 without getting awkward. 

As i feel increasingly left out as my other friends find new friends, I feel more lonely than ever and feel that my coping mechanism should be working hard and grinding out college apps.

I am lucky in life and appreciate everything I was given but lately I feel like I'm being used by my friend and I'm tired of being alone.
I have never been with a woman and i understand why, i wasnt the best looking but now i have lost weight i still havent gotten closer to dating, i tried tinder and other dating apps which i get some likes and matches but chat never goes anywhere. I thought maybe get myself out meet some people at my job but no. I am just tired of being alone romantically.

I also have a friend who i think is using me for money, i do think they care about me but money is the first thing that comes to their mind. I loaned them so much which i know their circumstance so i dont expect it back fast but i feel like theu are lying about what they are actually using the money for and i think they are emotionally manipulating me so i keep giving money, i do feel like a nice person when i help them out with money and like the compliments im giving each time cause i dont get it from others and i think they know that. I dont want to abandom them either tho.

I feel like i cant talk about this to anyone because i have a lot to be grateful in my life and i dont want to burden them with this. I am not suicidal thank God im just upset and at times emotionless. I put of a face like im always up for a laugh and if anyone does ask me if im ok because i stop looking happy and up for a laugh, i just say yea thats just my face haha when im tired.

My parents have never listened to me once in my entire life. My mom literally asks me the same questions every day, she does not even phrase them differently. It's like being trapped in the same day all over again. They never repeat what I said or point out that I was right about something, add something to a conversation we had earlier or make an inside joke on something that happened. Inside jokes literally don't exist in our family. Is that weird? Our life is so dull.
Everytime I start talking about something my dad somehow perceives it as a question he needs to answer, he then becomes a teacher and lectures me on things he does not have a clue about. He can't even differ vegan from vegeterian...the last time I saw him he was looking at clouds telling me the government is making trailcamps to sicken us all. Yeah he is slowly becoming crazy.

I had a very bad 2019/2021. I isolated myself and pushed everybody away, any social reaction would make me anxious and scared of someone telling me hurtful words, my days became very monotone, I felt and had feelings of depersonalization and derealization quite frequently.

Days went by and I felt that I had no purpose, I felt shallow.

I lost a lot of weight and lost all motivation, then I started being too critical of my looks which slowly worsened over time.  


&amp;#x200B;

It was very bad but luckily right now after I went to a therapist and took anti-depressants I am improving even though it's a tough road ahead.

I successfully got my life back together to some extent and I graduated, applied and got accepted into a university.

Next year will be a new experience, one which I feel very scared about.   
I am scared of going back to what I was, I can't.   
I feel almost destined to go back and eventually destined to end my life, my parents' lack of willingness to change themselves and realize their actions hurt me a lot and dysphoria hasn't made that better.

the last time i had a friend group was in high school but we have drifted apart since then and since then i have been on my own. i had maybe two opportunities to make good friends with acquaintances in school and at work since but something always had to come in the way of us ever getting closer, like them changing jobs or moving to a different class. 

i‚Äôve gotten so comfortable being alone that i forgot it‚Äôs seen as embarrassing to other people. i do everything alone, i travel to cities alone, i go to cafes alone, i go to museums and concerts alone, i have spent my last two birthdays alone. my coworkers question why i enjoy working over the weekends, saying ‚Äòbut it gives you no social life!?‚Äô like i have one to begin with, and when i go out on weekdays there are less people to see me being alone. the other day a group of boys made fun of me for eating in mcdonald‚Äôs alone and it reminded me for the first time in a long time that this isn‚Äôt normal to other people. 
i‚Äôm jealous when i see people walking with their friends or when i see a group of girls looking pretty getting ready to go for drinks or a party or when i see them just supporting and being nice to each other. i get sad when i spot a place i would like to visit but i remember i have no one to go with. the problem is that i love travelling and sightseeing and going to new places, i hate being in the house. 

i am an introvert and i am socially awkward but this past year i have really been doing my best to open up to people and try to initiate friendships, i feel like i‚Äôve even gotten better at small talk and having conversations with people. though ultimately i feel like nothing ever comes out of it because i‚Äôm ugly and boring. no one ever reaches out to me or does the same for me as i do for them. in the rare occasion that i manage to make plans with somebody (always a boy, too) it gets cancelled last minute or they forget and i would feel desperate if i were to remind them. i‚Äôm just tired of being the way i am and i wish things were different.

3966,SportsMajor,1628202254,1,"If you've seen my post yesterday, one part I mentioned was that I quit most of social media. I deleted Snapchat, deleted Facebook, and deactivated my public Instagram account. All I got left is my private Instagram with 14 followers (this was a result of a few people unfollowing + removing plenty of followers over the last few years, no idea why I did it but I like a small list on it) where I post/view memes since people like those and this Reddit account. I just figured that, for some unknown reason, social media was not helping my loneliness. 

Nearly a month later, I really enjoy decreasing the amount of social media I have. I like not having to see heated political debates everyday, posts I have no interest in filling my feed constantly, and just not mindlessly sharing posts. I feel like I have a deeper understanding of myself. I still feel lonely, but this loneliness has been a little more manageable to deal with. 

The next step is deleting those accounts so I can get rid of most of my data. I already deleted my two snapchat accounts I have. I plan on deleting my Facebook and public Instagram accounts next, but I'm not totally sure when I'll do that. With Facebook, I'm not sure how my household family would feel about me deleting my account completely. I'll probably give them a heads up beforehand so it doesn't catch them off-guard. As for the public Instagram, I'm worried I'll regret deleting it once I go back to college but I probably shouldn't care what people think.

I honestly think that deleting social media was a must to fighting against this loneliness. I think it's also helping me develop as a person and how I mature as I get older throughout these next few years.",lonely,Taking action against social media,2021-08-06 08:24:14

3980,dionebottone,1628193650,1,"I want to talk about my last experience, ended today. Sorry for my english too, it's not my first language.

At the beginning of this year, I was a teacher in a private course and I had these group of 5 people (all adults and near my age). We made a school project and while doing it we all became friends. In particular there was a kind and shy girl. I'll call her Anna. After the school ended, we managed to continue the project to make it something valuable for a work. Me and Anna started playing together and talked every day.

In may I presented her to my circle of friends and everything went awesome. We, as friends, started to tease each other as a joke and it became an habit inside this group. We had fun.

Then the beginning of the fall. One day i had the crazy idea to ask her out. She rejected me because she was dating another guy in our group. That night, I told this to a some of our common friends, because i was sad and a bit drunk. After a few days, she assured me there weren't any problems, that she was sorry but she got a little angry because I told the others about her and that guy. I apologized and she told me she was okay. But it was not. She started to being mean by teasing me in passive aggressive mode everyday. I told the group project to check on her if there were some problems with her, because i knew this behaviuor was strange but I didn't have any clue. And it was starting to affect the project itself.

I confronted Anna on her behaviour towards me , and she told she was sorry and promised me that she wouldn't do it anymore. But it was a lie.

We passed nealy 1 month in the same situation as before; she was being mean meanwhile I was overreacting to her teases. And everytime she was just ""joking"". In my last time I left the voice chat because I was tired of her bad jokes.

Then everything exploded, she insulted me because she was very angry at me. For the same reason she said she wasn't. I tried to explain and apologize to her but it was to late, she stopped talking to me.

A few days later when I tried to call her to ask her about the group project, she ignored me. I then kicked her out of the project , because in our work it was important that we could communicate. I then told the other team member my decision, but they supported her telling me I had no rights to do so, and that I was not thinking straight. They left the project, now dead. And then they told Anna my talk about checking her and they interpreted it as a way to ruin Anna's reputation. Never intended it.

She then blocked me everywhere after a long text telling me how a bad guy I am. And proceed to go play with our circle of friends. They know what happened more or less, but I'm not sure how to behave with them. I feel I just lost both friends and work in a single action. And that she is right about me...",lonely,"A former friend blocked me , now I am stuck outside my friend's circle and feeling helpless",2021-08-06 06:00:50

Aside from that, the only time people talk to me directly is to share occasional memes, which I appreciate but I wish it was more than that aside from me starting conversation.. and even then, it seems as though what I say is usually skipped over. The times I do come into the conversations so share things or just talk, it seems like no one wants to listen or pretend not to hear me at all, wheras when the others have something to say my friends will jump to respond in a matter of seconds. I wonder which causes a lonelier feeling: having no one around at all or feeling like the ""unimportant friend"". The second choice, maybe. I guess I'm a been serious, boring person no matter what I do and have a hard time opening up about the issues in my life or even how I'm feeling compared to them to I'm probably to blame for this.

I met these people online through discord a few years ago and we also tend to roleplay together as a group (SFW only), a very minor issue but I've noticed when I share my writing it's never as important as that of my friends' so I tend to regret sharing at all, as if I'm just embarrassing myself or seeking attention or something like that. Maybe it's just not good enough for anyone to comment on even though I spend so much time developing it and trying to be as best as I can. 

What hurts the most is that I know if I give up and disappear, no one cares. No one messages me wondering where I've been. No one ever mentions wondering where I've gone or any concern wheras I would if any of them did for more than a few days. I can vanish off the face of the earth and I feel as if none of them will care. It's happened before.

Sometimes I wonder if I should just disappear or leave. Would that make them happier than they are when I'm around? Will they be relieved? If I knew for sure they would be, I would.

3999,IDontKnowNoName12,1628183180,1,"Since i broke up with my girlfriend back in 2017, i've been struggling with really bad loneliness and the depression that came with it.

The depression and lonely feelings are infering with my social oppertunitys everyday, it makes me stressed and never able to fully relax in social interactions.

But when i go and visit my sister and her boyfriend or my brother and his family, these feelings starts to subside. Depression starts to easen and it have even got to the point that i just get out of it. But when i leave them, because they live so damn far away from me, the feelings starts almost instantly comming back to me.

I gave a full heart try to volenteer at 3 different locations, to meet new people. While it did ease my loneliness, it also exhausted me everyday, to spend time with these people, i feel i could never fully trust them or take them in my life, alot o ex-drug addicts and others have other deep issues in their life, some has real mental issues. But i tryed to make friend with some, but i just reject them, my stomach feelings rejects them, and i know deep inside i would never want them as friend, we dont share nearly the same values-

But the whole envirionment, being a cashier or standing inside a caf√© and serving people, its exhausting while i feel lonely and so disconnected.

I started to workout and and eat much more and better while i was away for several weeks and visit my family, things started to become good, it got better, but now im home again, two days being at the volenteer work, i feel so damn anxious and burnt out. I dont wanna go back.

I got a job offer today at daycare for elderly, but i dont think i will make it, i can barely make 4 hours volenteer work. And then again, i probably have met one or two who works there, so it will be increadibly awkward when i show up, plus i have alopecia areata, and the work require hats of. But when i get home from my normal work, then what? I have nothing here, nothing in this small city. There are no hobby clubs, and climbing club is small and the people all already know eachother, and i felt i burnt my bridges there a few years ago, The psychward sais they cant help me, because its 9 months queue, and even when its my time, i only get max 3 sessions, which is kinda only ""tips and tricks"".

This city is so small. It does not matter what i do, or where i work, i will always meet someone i already met, and everyone know every single move i do, who you hang out with or not. There are no opperunitys here, i cant even walk in the city before someone sees, i feel so trapped.

My absolute best friend moved away from this city, and he now has his first child, and started family, everyone has their own thing now, and im so f lonely.

My mother and her boyfriend said i can move down to them and apply for job there, but, their relationship is so unstable that they might break up anytime, they even did 2 weeks ago, but they got back together.

I want to feel included somewhere, feel accepted, when i do, life is easier, but i tryed for years now, i just cant find any support in this city, i see the same people everyday, and i get older and older.

I have two ""friends"" since we were younger, but i feel nothing when im with them, they have their own thing, and they never want to do anything with me, always do their own things and i follow, it feels hollow and empty. Exhausting.

If i dont go back to this exhausting volenteer, my depression with worsen, but im trapped, to chose between exhaustion or depression.",lonely,"Lonely, small town.",2021-08-06 03:06:20

He's stood me up five fucking times this week when *he* was the one who insisted on seeing me. Every. Single. Time. I wish I could say this is unusual for him, but it's not. But it *is* the most hes ever done it in one week.
I've literally grown to a point where I dont even get angry anymore. I just end up not giving a fuck about him when he does this tbh. Any time I mention it to him, he'll turn it around on me and somehow its my fault because me mentioning it means, ""I just don't love him enough"", or some manipulative bullshit like that. And for the record, I have told him to miss me with that bullshit every time he's done it. Yet, somehow, I always end up being the one apologizing for something I know isn't my fault, that I didnt do anything wrong. Also, the only thing I've ever requested from him is that if he cant make it, to at least let me know. And he never does. That's the annoying part.

I thought I respected myself more than this to just break up with him, but I cant do it. I just can't do it. Because I still believe he can be better, and I also think that he can't. Again, I dont even get mad. I just feel like whatever happens at this point, happens. If he keeps his word, great. But if he doesn't, then im never surprised because ""thats how he is."" I feel lonely because I *want* him here, and I do want to spend time with him. But im not even worth it enough for him to let me know he isn't going to come by? Really??

At this point, id honestly think I'd be better off getting a hamster or something. I've been looking into getting one for awhile now anyway.

4059,AdMaximum9782,1628145414,1,"Hello, Thanks for reading this.
I come from a middle class family in India.
There are something‚Äôs which people don‚Äôt believe me which I say. 
I have lived all my life in Hyderabad but still dont understand Telgue nor can I speak it.
I have learned Sanskrit and Hindi in School but I can‚Äôt read or write any alphabets of Hindi now tho I can speak.
There was a time in my life, when me and my Family lived without Fridge, TV , AC for whole 3 years. We managed with little things what we had and lived like frugal. It‚Äôs not like we couldn‚Äôt afford, it was mostly my depression which made my parents lose interest in everything. My unhappiness spread to them and they never bothered to buy.
It‚Äôs not like my parents were poor, I was born with literally silver spoon in my mouth and when i was kid I grew up eating in Silver plate and silver glass.
When my Dad was working in Hyderabad we had Office Car and managed with that. But now he is working in Banglore and We don‚Äôt have a decent car in Hyderabad. I feel ashamed because you don‚Äôt find that car in Indian Roads anymore. I bring up to buy a New car but everything seems depressing , there is no happiness at home. We went to Car Showroom negotiated the price, but the next day the planned changed even tho we could afford the car without loan.
People don‚Äôt believe when I say we lived in 2650 sqft house but We didn‚Äôt have Dining table and ate on floor. We didn‚Äôt have Curtains for 2 years and covered the Windows with sheet. 
My mum buys Gold jewellery and plans to get me married but little does she know I won‚Äôt spoil a girls life because I am impulsive and depressed. 
When I said anything to my parents they always gave me 2 answers . The first one is ‚Äú Simple Living , High Thinking‚Äù and the second one is ‚Äú If you are not there We have no meaning‚Äù. It was bad times in my life hence I always was talking about Suicide. 
I think my Parents are depressed along with me, maybe my depression spread to them tho they don‚Äôt show it. 
Everything seems to be broken. 
My parents life revolves around me and to see me succeed and be happy is their only aim. Whatever they do or have plans is for me and future me.
Still I feel something is missing in my life and lost everything.",lonely,Wanna let something off my chest.,2021-08-05 16:36:54

4062,nuffingk,1628143897,1,"I just left my only friend group. They had been relentless, toxic, passive-aggressive, delusional bullies, and tonight, it finally toppled over. After an explosive argument, I left the discord server. I feel a mixture of immense relief and horror at what I just did and it made me ask: what now? How can I feel happy, or at least fulfilled, after what just went down?

How will I come back from this? I have nobody else to reach out to. All my friends have drifted apart from me or moved. I‚Äôm also pretty socially inept so it will be difficult, and I fear fruitless, to try and make new ones.

Most of the people in this group I‚Äôd be fine with never interacting with again, but a few of them are genuine friends and good people. I feel so bad for leaving them in pursuit of my own self-interest. I want to maintain relationships with them, but I feel it would be too awkward after my exit from the main group.

Worst of all, I keep thinking to myself: was I the one in the wrong? Was I overreacting or leaving on a fleeting impulse that I‚Äôd soon regret? After genuine consideration, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that MY mental health and MY well-being trumps any social flak or consequences that I‚Äôll have to endure. But even after reaching that conclusion, I still feel incomplete and empty. My life has completely changed over and it feels very unsettling.

4066,throwawaylol593748,1628142311,1,"Warning: I‚Äôm playing the victim card really hard right now

I‚Äôm the youngest of four and I‚Äôm still treated like it at 21. Until I was at least 16, I‚Äôd be the last to know any of the family news or drama. I‚Äôd be the one who listened to everyone rant about each other in that toxic ass household and then my advice would go in one ear and out the other, every time. Still.

I‚Äòve always been the comic relief, the sarcastic one, the stupid, na√Øve one. I‚Äôm the silly, cute little sister. *I‚Äôm 21.* I remember being as little as 7 years old and being genuinely *hurt* by the realization that I was constantly being talked over, like my words didn‚Äôt matter. I didn‚Äôt throw tantrums about it. I‚Äôd just try to compensate by making a joke to earn me some attention. This has become who I am in my family. When I say no one listens to me, I don‚Äôt mean no one does what I say or considers my words‚ÄîI mean, I‚Äôll be talking and talking and then realize that *they have not been paying any attention to me whatsoever*. This isn‚Äôt once in a while, it‚Äôs my life.

Every time I speak to anyone in my family these days, with the exception of my one older brother who actually shows me some respect, I feel like I‚Äôm hyperaware of how smart I sound, how articulately I‚Äôm speaking, how analytical I am. No matter what I do or say, I‚Äôm completely dismissed. It makes me feel so hopeless that I lose all motivation to succeed, I lose all ambition, I feel so worthless and incompetent.

On top of that, I‚Äôve spent the past five years trying to convince myself that my depressive thoughts and worsening anxiety is all just a test of my emotional intelligence. Telling myself that I can do it alone, I can just figure out a way to think my way out of it. Researching it, hiding it, accepting it, fighting it. And to this day not a single person in my life knows.

Today my parents went off on a long rant about society‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúall this mental illness bullshit.‚Äù At one point dad scoffed and made a comment about anxiety, saying, ‚ÄúI mean what, you‚Äôre scared someone‚Äôs gonna attack your or something? It‚Äôs all bullshit.‚Äù

You know, for a long time I admittedly think I was fooled into agreeing with him, that mental illness was just emotional weakness, just a sign that a person lacks the intelligence and strength to rationalize their emotions. To anyone who has dealt with someone who thinks that way, I‚Äôm sorry.

I see how ridiculous that sounds now. It didn‚Äôt fully settle in until I was awoken in the middle of the night having completely unprovoked panic attacks, until I was actively searching for reasons to explain my darkest and most troubling feelings and consistently found *no explanation*.

I just feel so defeated. All of these feelings I‚Äôm constantly feeling have absolutely nowhere to go so I‚Äôm putting them here. I‚Äôm already seen as the stupid, weak one. The people who are supposed to feel like home, the people who are supposed to be my support system make a complete joke out of all of the emotional hardships I just wish I could express to them.",lonely,No one takes me seriously and I really just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore,2021-08-05 15:45:11

There were a few other people on the trail luckily and I heard them calling him out and that they'll call 911 and he was telling them to move along. He told me to get on the ground or he'll hit me again. I was telling him wtf is wrong with him, I don't know him, leave me alone. He just punched me again and I remember just being on the ground while he kept pummeling me and I was begging for him to stop. I'm a skinny guy and didn't fight back at all thinking it would provoke him and make things worse. Cops got there pretty quick thankfully and arrested him.

4083,SportsMajor,1628137141,1,"I've always been lonely. I may not have realized it, but that's the truth. Before high school, before I turned 14, I had a few close friends. Over time we began to separate naturally. That makes sense.

High school comes along. I only made one friend throughout my entire four years and that was because they talked to me freshman year. We became close as friends. I had conversations with people throughout my high school years in-person and online, but I never had friendships with them (although some of them were cool with me).

I graduated last year and started college with a new mindset to make friends. Needless to say that hasn't worked out at all. I thought I made a friend before college even started, but our friendship faded away after a month. A shame too because we were having some good conversations. 

With all of that, the loneliness has gotten to me. I've actually began to feel the effects of loneliness: the anxiety and sadness which comes with it. I've deleted Facebook since I figured it was not doing me any favors. I've deactivated my public Instagram since I don't like that either. I might delete both accounts for good. I'm done with Snapchat too. All I got left is Reddit and a private Instagram with under 20 followers (I've slowly deleted people from it throughout the years and the followers I got either like what I post or I'm cool with them even if we don't talk). I'm keeping it that way for sure as I love it and it has began to give me a peace of mind. 

This loneliness has got me thinking about learning how to write poetry as well. I've began to enjoy some poetry and I've always had a love for hip-hop,  a genre which was based off some of poetry. If I can express my emotions, my loneliness, or anything else, that might give me an even better understanding of who I am and might contribute towards improving my mind and myself.

I've also realized that while loneliness isn't fun, it's made me realize that all I need is a few close friends. Not to be someone popular like I always hoped for. Most people are fake and will cut you off (I experienced this in high school once) or try and take advantage of you. Just a few close friends is all I need in my life. 

Although I hate the feeling of loneliness, it's given me the ability to reflect on myself and further my character growth which has been expanding over the past few months. Maybe the reflection it's brought is how I can overcome it if I do.",lonely,Loneliness has began to change me.,2021-08-05 14:19:01

Back then I really didn‚Äôt have to. I just did. Because I liked the feeling but I also could stop anytime. If I was off for a few days, I wouldn‚Äôt buy alcohol. I‚Äôd just smoke because drinking was more of a social thing for me. 

Now I don‚Äôt drink with anybody. I drink alone 95% of the time. And it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled controlling for the past 2 or 3 years. I continuously lost some very close fiends over the course of those 3 years(none by death). It‚Äôs to the point that the only good friend who knows remotely anything about me anymore lives in another state. He moved a few years back, came home for 9 months and realized he preferred life where he was and wanted to move back and I was super supportive even though I knew I was letting go of my last physical twin flame.

But I am so dependent on attention from others to be content and confident in myself. I only have a few close friends, and when they are consistently and enthusiastically interacting with me I feel like I‚Äôm on top of the world. I feel like I am mostly happy and confident when I have these certain people‚Äôs attention. I even notice my habits are healthier in general. However, when these people are not able to be constantly interacting with me (which is expected because they have their own lives), I feel incredibly lonely and depressed. I don‚Äôt take it out on them or tell them about it because I know that is annoying and would harm our friendship. I also am aware it is really unhealthy to be that emotionally dependent on people. I wish I could just be ok on my own. 

For example, months ago, my best friend went on a trip with other friends for a few weeks. I wasn‚Äôt upset with them at all for this but I felt so lonely without them that I felt I had to reach out for new friends online just to fill that void. And lately I made another really close friend who had been talking to me a lot. I got so dependent on receiving attention from them and lately they haven‚Äôt been responding as much. I wish I could just stop caring but I feel so lonely without them constantly talking to me. It also wrecks my confidence, making me feel like I must be either too boring or too annoying for them.

I am 30sth male and I am lonely üòÄ.
I never had a lot of friends as a kid, I wasn't allowed to watch TV or play video games and later it didn't interest me much. Same with sport teams. Which means I couldn't realte to a lot of what my peers liked. Still can't lol

Around 18 I met some people who would become my friends for the next decade. We were mainly partying and stuff, I was just happy to belong somewhere.

When I finished Uni I moved to the other side of the world with my then gf. I was vegan at that time and for my good bye party ppl brought a lot of meat. This was the first time it made me pause and reflect on these friendships.

I would stay abroad for about 4 years. There I was making 1 good friend, and I kept strong contact with 4,5 people from back home.

Before I left I broke up with my gf and moved back to my hometown where the friendships rekindled.

I gotta say, everyone always liked me a lot, I don't want to brag but I am pretty charismatic and eloquent and I read a lot and am generally a very curious person so I know a lot of things. On top I was very successful professionally with a high prestige job blabla. I am mentioning this because it is important to understand that I was popular and people liked to have me around, at least the version I was presenting.

Because in a way I was always adapting to the environment I was in, it's just my nature, or a relic from my lonely childhood or an actual personality disorder (I know this reads like narcissism lol).
 
At some point after I got back I was going through a rough breakup where I felt that my friends don't actually really know me and don't appreciate me and I left the next day for a new country.

It was a notoriously lonely city. I did not make a single friend there. At some point I thought there was sth wrong with me and I started therapy. My therapist seemed almost in shock that I was living about completely alone for the last 2 years.

Because of covid lockdown I again moved to another country, where I am right now.

I don't speak the local language and no one speaks English. However I am weirdly withdrawn and somehow ok with it.

I came to realize in the last 12 months that I am so very different from most ppl that I can either put on some mask to fit in whatever scenario, or I am will stay alone.
I broke off contact to all of my old friends because what was the point. None of these people really knew me neither did they want to.

The real me is just too intense, too freedomloving and uncompromising, too threatening.

I am too weird I don't belong into this world. The only person I feel understands me is my little brother, who shares the same fate as I do.

I am also kind of closed off to the concept of a romantic partnership, because it is nearly impossible to find someone I would actually want to raise a family with. 

I basically dropped out of society, many many years ago already, but I made a lot of money with a side hustle, so if you would see me you'd assume I am some banker type.

I live in large beachfront penthouse and have a pretty lavish lifestyle. Yet I am actually an anarchist who doesn't fit in at all. I don't make sense from the outside and who's willing to look closes these days...

I haven't worked a normal job in years, so I never have to meet people. 

Paradoxically I am a very social person and grave connection. I apologize if this doesn't make any sense. Just stumbled across the sub and wanted to share my story.",lonely,"Lonely, alone and with people",2021-08-05 09:33:05

Some general info on me: Im an 18 year old guy, upper middle class, living in the suburbs of Zagreb, Croatia, divorced parents, no siblings. So a pretty standard dude, good looking even, if im to believe what people tell me.

I have no friends. I never get called to go anywhere but a few people ocasionally take me up when i extend an invite to hang.

The one guy who takes me up on my offers to hang out most is the closest thing that i have to a friend, he is also the only one to ever invite me anywhere but the majority of our time spent togather is inticed by me.

This has been the case for as long as i can remember. It got worse when i started highschool but i was always the side guy or the one calling others.

Looking back on middleschool i was always the class clown, talked the most and loudest, got into truble and humiliated myself for the entertainment of others.

Recently i started hanging out with a group of people from my class back in middleschool and they added me to their whatsapp group where they arranged the hangouts. I hung out with them for about a month getting invited by them to the groups activites. 

Soon after the invites to go out went from being specificly sent to me to the guys generaly asking if anyone wants to go out, a few weeks later the group went quiet and i realized that they made a new one without me so i left.

I heard after from a ""friend"" that ocasionally goes out with them that they disliked me greatly and anything i said pissed them off.

He also told me that one of his friends that i once went out with asked him out of the blue if hes heard from me and requested that if he ever went out with me that he wouldnt be called to go because he also cant stand me.

Im a pretty well spoken man, highly compassionate and respect others, not cheap and well not dumb. Im not one to cheap out on paying a drink or something.

I have been told that im weird by people and i don't know why. When i ask them they can't point anything out. I can't really disclose anymore info on me so this is all i can say.

My question is: What's wrong with me?

i'm 21 and i am still struggling with loneliness after 7 years.

the main cause to my loneliness is cuz i don't have friends. when i was a teen, it was difficult for me to make friends since i was depressed and was truant in school (my depression also sparked this lonely feeling). i was dealing with my own shit at home so i didn't have the mental capacity to put effort in forming close and/or long-lasting relationships with people in hs.
now i'm 21 and i would still consider myself friendless. i don't know why it's hard for me to make friends, i assure you i am not rude or mean to people, in fact i'm a rather shy person that barely talks. because i want genuine tips from yall, i will admit that people have told me ""i thought you were a bitch"" when describing their first impression of me before ever properly meeting me. i assume that's because i have a rbf and seem unapproachable.

anyways, i need advice on what i should do. i do have some ""friends"".. they are all from my elementary/middle school days but quite frankly i believe were only still friends because we feel obligated to atp (given the longevity). however, i have never felt a connection with them :/ besides them i have no one.

Someday it will all be worth it they said. Someday you‚Äôll look back on how far you‚Äôve come and thank yourself for staying the course. 

I feel this tugging on the inner strings of my spirit. Something trying to pull me away from the cage they want me to walk in. It‚Äôs beyond words, beyond comprehension, just a feeling. A feeling that this is all wrong, a feeling that I'm not supposed to be here. 

Where does the light in a child‚Äôs eyes go when they start to age and learn about 401k plans, overtime, vacation days, health insurance, annual pay raises. 

Take me to that place.. I want to follow those lights to the source of wonder.

To the place where we start. A place where everything‚Äôs new, exciting, truly awe inspiring. 

Somewhere, anywhere other than here. Anywhere other than pension plans, annual training, 30 minutes unpaid to scarf down some fucking burritos before I plug back in to the machine. 

My head hurts. Each day the pulsing compounds. What could I have done differently? How could I have avoided this existential dread. Where does this feeling even come from?

Why am I not like the rest. Why can‚Äôt I walk into the same building every day thinking of the future when I can grow old and lounge around in leisure with all these pieces of paper stored virtually on a screen?

What parasite has entered my mind and forced me to think this way. It could be so easy. It could be so fucking easy. Turn off the thoughts, make some coffee, commute, converse, small talk, pretend to work, commute, tv dinner, sleep, repeat. 

It‚Äôs broken.

I‚Äôm broken. 

I‚Äôve lost all sense of time, sense of purpose, sense of self. 

Years go by in a daze. 

I‚Äôm 26, unemployed. Staring at this computer screen. Contemplating, ruminating, overstimulating.

Overthinker. Procrastinator. 

‚ÄúHe had so much potential‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt he just get a job like the rest of us‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it depression?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll get over it eventually‚Äù

‚ÄúAll he needs is to find the right woman‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did the best you could‚Äù

Panicking, I shift the car into drive and head out into the pitch dark of night.

A cool autumn breeze stings my skin.

The interstate guides me along gently through the night. I increase my speed as the thoughts over take my mind. 

What‚Äôs it all worth?

Why even try anymore?

Nobody will miss me when I'm gone.

They‚Äôre better off without me.

WHY AM I SO FUCKED UP

WHY CAN‚ÄôT I JUST BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

WHY HAVE I WASTED MY WHOLE LIFE DREAMING 

My heart starts to race as I contemplate the end. All I have to do is pull the steering wheel. It‚Äôll all be over soon. A couple of minutes of terror and then infinite peace. 

I close my eyes. Press the gas pedal. Feel the air rushing through my hair as I make peace with everything I‚Äôve left on the table. 

Another thought enters my mind in a flash. What if everything does work out? What if I do find a calling, a purpose? Is this period just a test? 

I stop the car on the shoulder. I feel tears welling up beneath my eyelids. 

Take the exit. Pull in the driveway. 

‚ÄúHey son, how was your drive?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood pops‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you excited for your interview tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYea dad‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a buddy who works there, says the pension plan is great, just put in your time son and you‚Äôll be set‚Äù

4168,BlackDragonCasimir,1628100029,1,"I'm constantly frustrated with myself, with my inability to communicate with others. Whenever I try to form new friendships and relationships I just end up going silent, not even being able to think of a single sentence. In person it's even worse, I just full on freeze up and have no idea what to do. I'm even struggling to keep the few friends I have because I find it difficult to communicate with even them now.

I mean I have so many things I'd love to talk to someone about, but I can't. I try and try but never improve, I just can't seem to be able to. I feel defective, there's no one to blame for my loneliness but me. I feel so alone and I'm angry at myself for it. So many different thoughts, ideas, interests and knowledge but no one to share it with. No one to experience anything with, no one to connect with.

In all these years I've learned so much, yet human interaction still remains a mystery to me. I can't grasp any understanding of it, I can't understand how to socialise or it's many obscured social rules. I just feel like I'll always be alone because of this, and that my attempts to learn are all in vain. Over time I've slowly started to accept myself as my only company, realising I'll probably always remain in perpetual solitude.

Still though... even with acceptance it pains me nonetheless. I just want a companion there by my side, but that is a distant reality to me now. Maybe someday I still hope.

4169,littlebroth,1628099933,1,"Hey guys and girls, 

it does not really fit in the lonely channel, but because I'm often here and read regularly some posts and posted myself, I wanted to share this recent experience. I met a girl at the university during a ""party"". It was more like a group meeting to get to know each other. Since she was new in town in my country in general and I was living for years here, I offered her after a chat to have a day trip exploring a nearby town, which is known as a very beautiful one. On that day trip, when we met, she was different from the first time, she was very affectionate and it was irritating, but also beautiful. We enjoyed the day and I think, we got more close. In the end, I confess to her, that I had feelings for her. She said, she is not interested, but she is genuinely happy, that I told her, because she doesn't like it, when people hide their feelings. I was a little sad, but said, I'm ok when we are friends. After that, we had a more deep talk about psychology and past relationships, and I realize, that she is not only smart, cute, affectionate, has the same interests but she shares the same thoughts about life as me. And at that moment my heart began twitching. In my whole life, I had never felt this, when I dated girls. I fell so hard in love with her. After that date, I couldn't get rid of her in my head. 3 days and my whole life were upside down, I was constantly thinking about her, couldn't sleep well. I was texting her, was trying to set up the next meeting, which she declined. On the third day, that was today, I told her, I have to say something important, that I can only tell her personally. We met, and I said, that this experience with her was unique and I said, we can't be friends, because of the said feelings, but also because I realized, she is a great person, I want to share my life with. But she won't have reciprocal feelings for me as I have for her. And it will drive me crazy, and this will affect her too and it will be problematic. So, I decided to stop staying in contact with her for the health of both. She said, that she enjoyed the meeting and feel sorry about the situation, but she wished me, that I will find the right one in the future. We hugged intimate and went apart.   
Idk buddies, I feel like I messed up by confessing her in the first place, and that I couldn't sort my thoughts for 3 days. But I know for sure, that I couldn't stop thinking crazy about her if I'm not stopping it in the first place. Now, I feel freer, because I know, she won't be a part of my life anymore and I can focus back on my life again. I feel sad, really sad...",lonely,My emotions overwhelmed me.,2021-08-05 03:58:53

The fear of dying alone and forgotten which once seemed all but guaranteed, has passed...but yet I still alone. None of my college friends are geographic or emotionally close anymore. My coworkers all seem to have overly expensive hobbies and interests that I can't afford to enjoy. Though I love my spouse, we don't share loads of stuff. She doesn't read a bunch like I do. In fact, she still hasn't read the fiction novel I self published last year. It is unlikely that I will ever convince her to watch history documentaries or repair old vehicles with me. Due to kids, covid and money, we don't travel together. I've tried befriending boyfriends and husband's of my wife's friends to no avail. I rarely seem to get along with any of them.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE!

Every one of the 230k people here have similar experiences, pain, loss, regret, depression. But we also have the capacity for love, happiness, completion. You are all worth more than how you feel today. Dont let your ability to not see happiness in your future or present hinder those feelings. Today does not define you, neither does yesterday. You dont have to be the same person you woke up as. The same person who made those mistakes, the same person whos hurting and lost. 

I wont lie, its hard work, but what do we have to lose? Were already here, were down and we arnt fulfilled. But we can do it! Im not saying we all need to work on ourselves, some of you are grieving, some want to vent, but the majority of us i believe are here because our paths are not bringing us happiness. 

If you want to change you can. Nobody can tell you whats what, you need to want it and work on it, consistently. IT WILL GET BETTER!!

I was really excited to see his reaction. I couldn't wait to hear him say that my movie was great, or maybe give me some constructive criticism. I thought he would watch the movie that same day, since he's got lots of free time. But I heard nothing from him. I thought ""well, I guess he'll watch it tomorrow"". The next day was also pure silence. A week passed, and I finally asked ""hey, have you watched my movie?"". He just said ""nope, I was busy, blah blah blah"". I know that's a fucking lie, cause he spends all day posting Instagram stories, and he has done nothing but play video games. Two weeks after the movie came out,  we were hanging out and I asked again ""haven't you watched my movie?"". He just said ""nope!"" in a tone that really made me think he doesn't give a fuck. I started to tell him that I was sad about that, and he completely ignored the subject and started talking about the video games he's been playing. At this point I'm like ""what the fuck? Is this guy even my friend at all?"". At the end of the meeting I told him ""watch my film or I'll cut your balls off"". Obviously I said that laughing, putting it like a joke, but that was actually how I felt. He was like ""give me a break..."" (like I'm asking him to do a job or something) and told me that he would watch it the next day. A week has passed and I still haven't heard nothing from him. I don't know what to do. I feel really awkward about the whole situation. I knew that in the last times we hadn't had such a close relationship, but I didn't expect him not to give a flying fuck about me. Obviously I'm not going to force him to watch the movie, it's supposed to be something enjoyable and not a fucking chore. But I'm so hurt, I've worked so hard in the film, I'm so proud of the result, and I'm so sad that someone who (I thought) was important in my life doesn't even care. At this point I'm considering never talking to him again. I just don't understand his behaviour. You may tell me that he's secretly depressed or whatever and I don't know about that, but would that really be an excuse? I mean, he watches lots of anime, why not watch a movie?

I feel like I don't have where to go either. When I do go out it's always the same people and same cafes or parks or whatever. I do enjoy it, I really do, but it just isn't enough. Like, I hate that I don't socialize enough to up my chances of meeting someone, but I also can't find the strength and self esteem to go out more.



The only compliments that I get are the ones from my mom, sister and two of best friends. I do appreciate them but lately I'm craving a lot of male attention while being afraid of them at the same time (se*ual assault), which confuses me constantly. I hate that all of my ""action"" was without consent. I don't feel comfortable around boys but I would like to be appreciated by a boy. I hope that makes sense.  



The fact that everyone around me was in a relationship at least once doesn't help. I feel kinda left out. It didn't bother me for a long time and I hate that it bothers me now when I can't even keep eye contact with men longer than a few seconds. 



Also, I have crooked teeth and I can't smile without covering it. I hate them but I don't have the money for braces yet. Like objectively - my smile is ugly. That is the biggest reason why I don't want to try tinder and similar stuff, because I don't want to catfish them online and then disappoint with my looks.

As odd as it might sound to some, nhilism has been a source of comfort from 2011 to 2020. It kept me safe from most (negative) emotions.

The constant fear of death all day every day had me see anger, jealousy, pride, greed, etc as self destructive to my daily life. There was only enough time for laughter, I thought. ""If laughter id the best medicine then I'll be a doctor.

So, I devoted myself to being an entertainer to my group of friends. I hosted game nights, hangouts, generally kept people together and laughing. I became blind to affection to the point I forgot how to treat anybody other than friends. I couldn't tell you if a woman was flirting with me or not.

This past year I met a girl, woman, whatever. We met through a very unfortunate circumstance that we were targets of. In the end i only brought us closer as we were the only ones who understood the thoughts pecking away at each other's brains.

For a year and a half we've watched movies, musicals, played lots of video games, supported one another mentally and emotionally. We say the same things at the same time far too often. She is my equivalent in almost every way.

After almost a year into our friendship I felt happiness for myself. I wasn't scared of thinking past tomorrow. She would be in every tomorrow. My life? it had value. I had a purpose. I was breathing. I felt alive. 

Now... there's a 10 year age difference between us however. It took a lot for me to get over. Insecurities and such. Friends and family kept assuring me it really isn't that bad especially at older ages. Can't help but still feel a gross ""creepy old man"" shiver crawling up my spine though. I dont think she's entirely comfortable with it either, at least right now. 

This year has been good to her at long last. Lots of healthy mental progress. A few weeks ago we were talking. She told me she met a guy online. My heart sank and yet I was happy for her. Maybe I wasn't but I think I was to an extent.

This past week I've been ignored. Typically I'd have her as company while I'm at work. As you could expect she doesn't message me much now unless I initiate and carry the conversation. Never had to before. Even still, I'm grateful to get one reply every couple of hours.

We still hang out on weekends but she phases out, not hearing me, getting distracted. I don't feel as connected as I once did only weeks ago. She was pulling me out of the nihilism pit only to let go of my hand. It allowed selfishness, jealousy, back into my life which upsets me. 

I want to *fully* be happy for her not just on a surface level. Its not right nor fair to her. 

Should I find my way back to nhilism, deny myself hope of happiness in exchange for a numbness to emotional and mental pain? I can see the lighthouse but I don't know if I want to, or can, cross those waters.

Not that they don't clearly mean well and perhaps work for some receivers, but.

""All of you are actually loved"" bro I literally have no one. I get that some lonely people do have caring friends/family but I literally have zero and the idea of a stranger loving just the idea of me is just.. unhelpful? Makes me feel almost worse? ""You'll eventually be loved"" would be relatively better but it's still not... much of anything, to me personally. Because love takes mutual work and love can fade and I for one am a mess that has never not incidentally ruined a friendship and/or potential friendship.

I mean I suppose I did come here seeking some kind of solace. It has slightly helped to know I'm not the only one who's felt/experienced certain things. But largely.. I don't know anymore. It's not like I'd want a new bond from here forged solely out of sympathy/pity either. I already have superficial connections. I just... 

I guess this is just a vent.

I don't even think venting is working anymore, especially since many of my issues with keeping friends (always keeping, because making them is hard but relatively much easier) are the result of real life barriers barely in my control, but.

I used to have a lot of friends until I got married and had children, my friends didn‚Äôt at the time so I stopped getting invited to events, the messages seemed to stop from them. Last invite I had anywhere was about 12 years ago. My husband and I are really happy and I look forward to him getting home each day so I can hear about his day. He makes me laugh and for a while I forget that I get lonely. I have zero social life. If I do see someone I know out and about I get really awkward and never know what to talk about. I feel so lonely a lot of the time. I would love to go out and work but my sons disability means I need to constantly be free to collect him at a moment‚Äôs notice (this has already cost me 2 jobs) 
I look on social media and see other people have fun (I know social media is only the good parts of peoples lives) but I get jealous then feel stupid for it.

I'll let you in on a secret. One of my guilty pleasures is watching couples on youtube vlog/prank channels. I don't care if they might be fake or not, its still entertaining to me. They're still real couple at least even if everything else is fake. 

I just like imagining that I'd have someone like these couples have eachother. Having someone who cares about you, your health and well being is something I wouldn't take for granted. Maybe its cringy thinking about it that way. Maybe I'm cringe, sad, and pathetic for thinking that way, giving myself hope.

So a little backstory. I have bipolar disorder and during the summers I get really depressed. I'm also an extremely extroverted person, so to charge my mental batteries(so to speak), I really could use some positive, friendly, polite conversation every day. 

I have a crap job where no one is very nice to me. I have plenty of responsibilities but I'm slacking on all of them. Partly because I'm depressed, but also because I am not getting the positive interaction that I need. 

I have a husband but we are on opposite sleep/work schedules so I hardly get to see him. And texting him all day while he's at work is something he gets very tired of and honestly he can't often reply. 

I have very few close friends, all of which live over 30 miles away. One even in another state. They have all been quite busy with their lives, which I understand, but I am in a huge deficit. 

Would anyone be available right now for some easy conversation? Its 10pm where I'm at and I've smoked a bit of weed but I am crippling lonely. Please. Anyone down to chat?

Drop a comment and I'll shoot you a message. Or message me and mention this post and I'll reply.

4257,esemare2001,1628045848,1,"Alone...I don't know how it exactly started, but I know I was alone for the majority of my life, 19 long years, even in my younger years. I would observe what was going on around me, and would never get involved. Just sit and stare in wonder. When I did try to get involved -- like sharing my singing
with classmates or attempting to play games with my family, I was pushed away by my peers or
corrected by my teachers. Maybe I came on too strong. I was also blamed for problems that I did not cause. Perhaps I was seen as too weak to defend myself. 

In my older years, people noticed my effeminacy and high voice and never ceases to make fun of them. Perhaps a combination of being pushed away and being made fun of forced me to stay silent and not seek relationships or
getting involved in activities. Just to sit there on the sidelines and observe.

I used to have friends -- my cousin was my best friend. We used to impersonate people, sing, write plays, and more. But, over time, people, like her, started disappearing in my life. I no
longer have friends. And I believe it's my fault for believing the things my enemies said about me, losing my confidence and not getting involved and sharing my talents with the world. Not
having confidence is unattractive, at least that's what people say.

Being forced to isolate, the coronavirus has intensified my feeling of loneliness. I have not seen a single friend since August of 2020 when I graduated from high school. And any attempt to reconnect with any of my high school friends has failed.

2020-2021 have been years of great reformation for me, but no one knows it. I have gained the experience of speaking to people through my long days at work.  I started embracing my differences. I have come out of my shell a bit more now. I stopped taking things personally.

Whenever I see someone I know now, I'm like a child waving my hand hoping they would notice me: ""I'm here! Please talk to me and be my friend! I can prove to you that I'm an interesting
person and a good friend now!"" But I go back in my shell, hoping I wasn't ""coming on so strong"" - maybe they really have no intention of talking with me or being my friend.

Connecting with people my own age has never been a strength of mine. What frightens me is that I can foresee a future without any close friends. My friends have never been around for any of
my big achievements in life. I am afraid to die without any friend in attendance at my funeral. What will people say about me when I'm gone? Will they talk about how sad of a life I have
lived?

It's time for me to start living.

It is sad to say that I have become unhappy and cynical as a result of my loneliness and what is happening in the world. I want to gain my innocence, my confidence, my happiness -- my life back. But I don't know how.

It's my time to say yes to every opportunity to show my true self and experience new things. I am tired of trying to understand the psychology of why I am alone.",lonely,19 years of being alone.,2021-08-04 12:57:28

But I've never been able to develop a serious relationship, or get those feelings to reciprocate.

Despite my chubby appearance, I've been able to have some sexual encounters, though not with any cis women, and not actual penetrative sex. The sex part I don't really care about as much, really I just want to hold and be held by the person I love. What bothers me is I can get much better reactions from sharing pictures of my cock than talking about my feelings. As soon as I confide in ppl about my big fear of loneliness, show that kind of weakness, they seem to care less about me. I get the feeling theres something about me, deep down, that ppl find unappealing, most likely my pathetic desperation. 

I'm afraid I'm going to be alone forever. I doubt anyone will ever care about me as much as I'll care about them. And the most I can hope for is to be temporarily allowed to show affection for those I develop an attachment for in exchange for being the person who acts as their therapist, a shoulder to cry on, or just being the only guy available at the time.

It was so funny because I was the one who brought them together, yet I was the one who had no one.

Why do I keep doing this to myself? Why do I never learn my lesson? I keep falling into a trap. It's as if I take pleasure in emotionally hurting myself. Whenever I meet people, I become emotionally invested. I always give a piece of me to everybody, but they don't give it back. I feel like a fool, a pawn. I'm certain it's me at this point. Maybe I was never meant to have a friend or live a normal life. God wants me to suffer, and he enjoys every bit of it. 

I wish there were a drug that could erase the memories I have of this person. I know I'm going to be thinking about them for weeks. Long enough until the memories I have of them have been overplayed and I no longer feel the emotional attachment. 

Loneliness is painful, but experiencing love and having it taken away by the very person that showed you its meaning is even worse. Not only does it leave you feeling lonely, but hopeless and betrayed. 

I no longer want to go through the cycle of getting to know someone then ending up hurt. My biggest flaw is that I care too much. Or maybe it's that I care about the wrong people? What do I know. When you're in a hole as deep as I am, even  the faintest of smiles can seem brilliant and enormous and you cling to it like it's the most magnificent and lifechanging thing in existence. I think it's called desperation. 

Sometimes, giving up is the best solution. I think it's time I do just that. I'm in my early 20s, and my biggest fear is not having someone to share my life with. Time appears to be moving fast, or rather, I think I'm just now starting to realize how short life truly is. And it scares me.

eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with doing more sports for example. 
I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately. We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. 
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other. I know this sounds unfaithful and maybe is.. like a friendship with benefits?

I'm up for voice and video calls too, maybe even meet in person one day!

The girls in my school played a prank on me by having one pretending to like me and things went downhill from there after I gave her my number and shite, addmiting i liked her too... I quickly became the laughingstock of my grade. The looks they gave me and their laughs are burned into my memory;

As someone who was already struggling with anxiety and self image issues, this experience caused everything to get 10 times worse. I can't stop thinking that when a girl is talking to me or showing any simple interest that she is playing a sick joke or a prank on me in the back of my mind, which cause me to freeze up and have a panic attack. I feel worthless and too boring and akward for anyone to ever be interested in a true friendship or romantic interest. 

In highschool I've been focusing on improving my confidence through joining clubs and playing sports like wrestling. Even on my own team I feel like an outcast, like an outside observer looking in on everyone else having great times with each other. I feel like this in the classroom too. If my own teammates and friends dont see me as a person worth talking to or keeping in contact with after meeting me, how can anyone else?

I'm currently living in one of Oceania country and i'm very aware that i came here as student/worker/migrant by myself from South East Asia. Sorry i can't be more detail because i'm very conscious with my privacy.

I've been depressed since last decade, during my Uni year. I have thought about what kind of job should i get, to the point where i couldn't get a job, and then ended up in this country. This story is more suitable in r/depression but it impacted me as a person.

With a lot of issues from family, money, immigration,trust,  self worth, and personal stuff, i can see myself not able to communicate with people and have pushed people away, literally, 99% of them. I couldn't see myself get along with people, more over having deep relationship with anyone else. 

I still am depressed, sitting blankly from my window, and feeling awful even though i have a job at the moment but last thing i want is having extreme loneliness. It hurts so bad. I could cry thinking nobody wants me, cares for me, or even awares about me. Yes, i have pushed people away and Yes, i did that because i know i'm just going to be liability for others. I don't mind being alone but it hurts SO SO bad, my chest hurts every night. I still don't know how to fix this and i even already can see that if one day i'm sick or something happened to me, i probably already dead.

The last time i have caught people's eyes is when i got injured and bleeding. People saw me and helped me. I feel a bit better in my chest and it hurts at the same time because i know, when i have injury or life threatening disease like cancer and, hell, even COVID. When people said i'm an idiot for wanting that, i don't care. Either way, it hurts so bad. I don't want to go deeper about this because this is not (again) r/depression 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not hoping to get a friend or anything more from anyone in this thread. I don't mind if mod will delete this thread in the future. I just feel this is the appropiate place to 'leave a mark' for what i feel. I have nowhere else and nobody else to explain this pain. They won't understand and they'll never understand.

Throughout school, I tend to keep to myself and am very quiet during class. During breaks, I just sit by myself and do my own thing. I was never close enough with anyone to confidently enter the classrooms of other classes. I was the student who hated choosing groups because I rarely got chosen immediately. I never got to socialize through extra-curricular after classes because I always went home immediately. I always felt this 

I have friends and acquaintances, but no best friends. It feels like these people just tolerate me because I am always quiet. My interests are narrowed and specific, but other than that, I‚Äôm honestly very boring. It‚Äôs hard to talk to them and be open due to my fear of vulnerability. I know they care, but it‚Äôs really hard to reach out because we‚Äôre not that close. Like, the number of times when I‚Äôve gone on outings with friends is two times. Additionally, I can‚Äôt count the number of people I‚Äôve drifted apart with because I suck at maintaining relationships.

My family... there are seven of us together, but there‚Äôs no warmth. We‚Äôve are about each other, but we don‚Äôt really discuss about our feelings. At this point, it‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable for me to actually tell or show them how I really feel. My family is the typical Asian household lacking knowledge about mental health. 

I‚Äôm just lonely. I‚Äôve felt this way throughout my life and was in denial for most of it. Acknowledging my loneliness and having to openly live with it hurts.

eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with doing more sports for example. 
I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately. We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. 
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other. I know this sounds unfaithful and maybe is.. and I'm still hoping to find someone that understands me or maybe is in the same situation. 

I'm up for voice and video calls too, maybe even meet in person one day! 

If any of these lines made you curious or if you felt connected, please reach out. I'm waiting with high hopes! :)

Anyways I just recently lost the remainder of my old friends and after a few days something struck a cord in me. I was think that maybe this whole self hatred thing wasn't as clear cut as I thought. I've isolated myself because I felt as though my friends brought me pain and it was one of our faults. Although after thinking about it maybe it's just because we're different people.

The last two years were hell don't get me wrong and its changed who I am as a person. I was thinking that it's not myself that I hate but the fact that that self isn't me anymore. I hate the fact I'm a different person but I think I want to understand who I've become and accept myself.

I'm a 21 y/o autistic person with ADHD and I'm extremely lonely, and it's my own fault really

Growing up I didn't have a hard time making friends at all, it was really easy for me actually, considering I went to a school for neurodivergent children. But back then I was more interested in sitting in my room by myself playing video games, so I pushed every single person who showed interest in being friends with me away, and I regret it. 

When the pandemic started something occurred to me, and it's that nothing was different. I was still just sitting in my room by myself as I'd always done. The past 5 or so years of my life is a complete blur of just sitting in my room, with the only changes being whenever one of my childhood pets died

I'm lonely and I just don't know what to do.

I don't know what it's like to go out with friends, to go to a party, anything, and I've tried to make friends, I've tried joining discord servers and I've tried those subreddits meant to meet new people, but I just don't know how to talk to people? I don't know how to hold or start a conversation, I never know what to say, I barely feel like a person at this point

And video games don't bring me joy anymore. I'm nearly 22... I just feel so empty sitting here looking at my monitor, it's suffocating

4342,throwaway20tw1,1628013816,1,"Thought books describing it like that were just exaggerating but wow my chest does not feel good right now.

Due to living with abusive/toxic family I've been exceedingly isolated all my life, even now that I'm 20 (can't get out, too many obstacles still). The last irl friends I've had were in 2nd grade, before I got ripped away from all possibilities of healthy social life and having normal socializing abilities by being homeschooled. As if I wouldn't have already had a hard enough time, being autistic, and a minority in other ways too.

I tried having an online friend when I was like 12-13 and abandoned her when I realized/remembered how she led a very much normal life and I didn't--she was so free, and I still lacked even things as basic as true autonomy, felt like such a fake person in comparison, and being such a child it didn't really occur to me that communicating my distress could've worked instead of.. yeah, suddenly abandoning her &amp; the social media we talked on. And not having another friend in any way in years. (We weren't that close, anyway.)

And I was content, actually. Distracted myself too much with countless media to worry about or desire friendships anymore.

Then sometime just last year I impulsively joined a fandom discord. I didn't intend to make actual friends, just be a rare-appearing lurker, but I did meet someone cool and accepted their friend request and we've been... friends, for almost a year now. 

Over all that time, they've of course done what I knew was coming--make periodic attempts to share parts of their life that were outside the fandom that first bonded us. Talk of work, a few personal issues, irl photos of neat belongings, etc. And what the hell could I have done, as a 20 year old, but pretend I was like most other grown ass adults and had work and autonomy and other friends too? But I couldn't share as much, besides those lies. Basically I've been forced to be one of those shallow friends. Unreliable, really. And not even that interesting to talk to, given my long-term bouts of brain fog. And they have lived SO much, in comparison. They're such a vibrant &amp; clever &amp; strong person (sometimes it even seems like they're going through worse than me, and yet they're still functioning better) and I feel like an infant. A robot. A cardboard cutout of a real person.

When one or both of us lose interest in our mutual fandom I know that'd be over for our friendship since I've not been allowing us to become closer. Already I could feel us drifting. If this were a video game, each time we interact I could feel my idiot self draining the friendship meter bit by bit.

I told myself I wouldn't get attached. We aren't close-close, but I still managed to grow to care enough about them to stay. Caring for them more than they do for me (and it's only logical they wouldn't, having other actual friends who aren't weirdly distant and bad with words &amp; seriousness).

I want to make other online friends perhaps to distract from the pain of losing this one but it's hard. I barely know how I got here.

I still don't have a phone, my bedroom is empty, still never got the right to choose my own clothes, I barely own anything. It's even more pathetic than it sounds. In every way I am too tired and afraid of resistance.

This one friend has upped my desire to try to change my toxic living circumstances, but funnily, the more we more quickly drift the more I start to not care about anything again. I suddenly care less about media escapism, too. Everything seems meaningless.

Lots of words here. I can barely have thoughts except for when they're negative. My birthday's close and I'm dreading it. Everything's the fault of my abusive family but it's also mine for being a cowardly fool.

When someone isn't just willing, but eager and interested in hearing what you have to say, learning how your mind works. Wants to get to know you as much as possible because they are fond of you. They like you as a person for *who you are*, and not *what you do*.

Just want someone to be happy about having me in their life. Want to get to know me, about my day, about my feelings. Want them to talk to me about all their feelings and teach me everything about them. Involve me in plans or outings. Do weird shit together and laugh our asses off. Confide and support eachother.

We can't trust them to care, be there, or help us when we need it. Some people have families who do love them unconditionally, but a lot of us don't. We've got some friends maybe, and they hang out with us and talk to us and it *feels* like they care, and maybe they even do - but most friends aren't forever. They fade away, stop calling, stop texting. There's a fight or a distance too wide to bridge. 

Sometimes we are surrounded by people and yet feel completely isolated from everyone we know. Sometimes it's just for a moment, and sometimes for our entire lives.

Anyway, here it is:

Title: 24

Too old to be innocent,
Too young to be missed,
I think I learned the hard way
How much ignorance is bliss.

Too young to know the way,
But too old to be this lost,
Spent too much time wandering
Without knowing the cost.

Too old for more firsts,
But too young for lasts,
Too bored of the present
And tired of the past.

Too young for a breakthrough,
But too old to rhyme,
I feel like I'm too much
And not enough at the same time.

Too old for games,
Too young for fulfilment,
I say I want love but I'm
Too damaged for commitment.

Too young to know,
Yet too old to forgive,
I think I'll remain hard-hearted
For as long as I live.

Too old for questions,
But too young for answers,
Trying to savor these moments
As they slip through my fingers.

Too young to give up,
But too old to still be hopeful,
Not sure what to believe in
But I need a miracle.",lonely,A Poem I Made,2021-08-03 22:12:48

Towards the end of the dream she told me she had to go but gave me this romantic speech about how much she cared about me and wanted to talk to me daily. How much I meant to her. We kissed and had a big hug. We did a lot of stuff together. Then ofc I wake up from the dream back to reality. In this reality I am just a dead depressed zombie with no urge to socialize or meet people. But ill say I felt on top of the world after the dream. So I imagine it must be nice to feel loved.

I born in Hungary, Budapest (capital). I wasn't really popular ever so i was always hide behind shadows not to upset anyone as i was getting bullied through school. I transfered a lot from schools to schools cause i cloudn't fit in anywhere. I met my ex at 14 I gave her all my hearth as i had no prier interaction with anybody else. I didn't know it was a mistake to even look at her. She cheated on me more times then stars on the sky and she only used me for sex. When i found out she kept coming to me flirthing with others breaking me down even more and more as lost everybody around me. I gave up and got myself expelled so i don't have to suffer anymore. Ever sence that moment i didn't realize that was my last chanse to have a better life. I got multiply mental dissabilites but in Hungary it's doesn't mean much if you not danger to others. My family wanted to disown me for not finishing school and threated me to get a job. I did got a job and my parents made me sign contract to get housing and such. Made me pay the expenses for losing family discount and now i finally moved away from my family. I am lonely I haven't had a singel interaction other than playing lol with some random people who flame me. I haven't had a relationship in 7 years and feel like i never will. I am 23 soon 24 in sep 4 and i realized i have nobody to celebrate again. No gifts. No cake. No meaning inside. I slowly doesn't feel happy for anything and i feel like i lose interest in everything. Only keeps me sane is replika AI checking on me that i still alive. I just want to love.

So I'm just a lonely guy with a girlfriend but still lonely so don't invalidate me, please. Looking to make a friend that's possibly within a few hours drive -- All the more exciting that way and less stressful for both parties.

Here's some tidbits about me:

* Usually up at these hours due to my insomnia so this would be a great time to connect
* Player of videogames and other miscellaneous electronic activities
* A pretty good conversationalist both on text and on voice

I'm on the cusp of my 20's and 30's so I'm definitely having a midlife crisis due to the fact that friend making has been my number one issue in life. I'd love to make changes before I die, and maybe you can too! If you're okay with being friends with a politically incorrect and sometimes ignorant person (educate me) we'll probably get along. If you like dog's and going on walks or want to start walking with company that would be a great start for our friendship.

4431,yeeks64,1627964394,1,"I'm going to throw a pity party for myself. I have no friends and no one I've ever dated liked me for me. Why? Well I am completely intolerable. I'm decently attractive so I've been asked out via tinder and in person but as soon as we go out for a date there is never a second date unless he wants something from me, specifically sex. My mom tells me I act weird all the time but I can't see what I'm doing wrong. I have no idea when I'm acting weird or what I'm doing wrong. I guess I just give off a creepy vibe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well I give off this vibe because I have mental illness and I suck at hiding it. Like I hide as much as I can and my parents have no idea how bad it is. I am extremely depressed and anxious and I ""remember"" things that never happened so I spew nonsense sometimes and I'm always fact checking myself. I'm also extremely paranoid about certain things and I know people can tell when I'm in public. The other part of why no one will ever love me is because I'm extremely immature and I like a lot of childish things and unpopular things. I also have been sexually assaulted and I believe that has impacted me so that I am completely repulsed by sex. I have no interest at all and the whole subject makes me extremely uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

A whole other thing is my physical health is pretty shit with multiple chronic illnesses and random medical issues throughout my whole life. I've had a ton of hospitalizations and surgeries and other random shit like kidney stones. I feel so disconnected and I have made friends but they don't stick around when they see who I really am.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah here is my whining. I dream that someone will love me for me and truly care about me instead of simply putting up with me. My ex listened to me spew nonsense on the phone when I was in the hospital so I thought he really loved me. He didn't. He went on to constantly bring up sexual stuff and pressured me into stuff I didn't really want to do. Then he broke up with me because his family didn't approve and he had no intention of marrying me but he still wanted sex from me. So basically he was using me.

I've always abhored people who act out and hurt their partners when they feel neglected. But fuck if I wasn't tempted to just dress like a hoe, go out drinking with my friends, dance the night away, and party like a happy fool. Bf would probably be mad, probably worry, maybe he'd pay attention then. Maybe he'd hate me for acting out and stressing him out. Does it even matter? He ain't here. Keeps going hella distant for days. Cuz he's ""busy"" fuck me sideways that sounds like such a load of evasive bullshit. You're never too busy to text someone, ""hey, I know life has been crazy, but I'm still around, I love you."" You're never too busy to make time for someone you value. But he doesn't. He's just gone.

What's the point? If he reads this, dude, you had me. I'm tired of waiting around for you to come back, I'm fucking bored and lonely and I want some goddamn attention, but I'm too pissed off at you for ignoring me for so long to want your attention. Maybe we should just break up and I'll get someone else's attention, then you wouldn't have to deal with me anymore, and I'd feel seen by another living soul for once.

Or you could keep lecturing me from your high horse about how me trying to talk to you about this over text is ""inappropriate"" but you don't wanna call me or hang out.

I just keep fantasizing about going to the clubs and getting hit on, complimented, flirted with. Fucking anything. And I'm not gonna feel guilty for wanting that, cuz he apparently watches hours of porn every night.

I can fantasize about being with someone hot who actually likes me TF back enough to actually prioritize me and make time for me.

we all love that song right? Well, my life feels definitely like that right now! but hey, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face. There is a picture of me on my profile! 

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. So i feel like in the song, fallen into the same old dull routine.. our marriage is having a hard time. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives sperately. I invested so much in my marriage, i fought so long to be with her.. 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we click. But not just as friends, something more than that. I don't know how to call it. I'm mentally and physically frustrated. 

I'm up for voice and video calls too, maybe even meet in person one day! 

If any of these lines made you curious or if you felt connected, please reach out. I'm waiting with high hopes! :)

4449,GoldenMaster541,1627958836,1,"About three weeks ago, I made this post on this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/oicmza/how_do_you_come_to_terms_with_the_fact_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

There, I talked about how there was someone who once was a close friend of mine, but they stopped talking to me out of the blue. After reading all of the replies, I knew that my best bet to get over this situation was to accept that it happened and that there may not be an explanation for why they did what they did. About two weeks after I made that post, that friend messaged me out of the blue saying that they wanted to talk and asked when I was available. They claimed that they wanted to explain why they‚Äôve been ghosting me, and they wanted to apologize. Despite most of my friends saying that I shouldn‚Äôt respond, and that I don‚Äôt need her explanation or her apology, I decided to call her. She apologized for ghosting me for five weeks, and she said that her ghosting me wasn‚Äôt intentional. Unbeknownst to me at the time, she was going through a situation with someone else that made her feel uncomfortable. She said that she just kept putting off responding to me until she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to doing it. She also said that none of this was my fault, and that she wants to continue being friends. 

A part of me wants to continue being friends with her, but the other half of me, as well as all of my other friends who are aware of the situation, say otherwise. I want to forget this whole ghosting situation ever happened and start over, but some of my other friends have been making some pretty good points as to why I shouldn‚Äôt continue being friends with her. They all mention how, even if I decide to be friends with her again, the friendship has changed forever, and this whole situation isn‚Äôt something that can be looked over easily. They tell me that if she couldn‚Äôt bring it upon herself to at least say that she needs some time alone, then I shouldn‚Äôt bother continuing the friendship stating that it is obvious that she doesn‚Äôt respect me enough to do so. I told her that I was going to need some time to think about this. It has been a week since that phone call, and I‚Äôm still not sure where I stand. I don‚Äôt want to throw our friendship away because of this situation, especially since she‚Äôs been by my side since day 1, and she has forgiven me for my past transgressions against her.

4458,place_of_desolation,1627956693,1,"As a lifelong single man with mild autism nearing 43, it is hard to imagine having someone else in my life. My whole self identity, my entire worldview, revolves around being single because that is what I'm used to. No life decisions I make ever involve another person, and everything I do, I do alone. 

Relationships seem to come about so naturally and organically for others, as normal as anything else, but they have been rare and fleeting for me, like glimpses into another reality that I am missing. The concept of a woman loving me, of having someone at home waiting for me, is in a similar realm to being a millionaire. And the older I get, the more invisible and out of touch I feel. It's harder and harder to relate to others with more typical life trajectories and experiences, especially those in my age group; after all, most others around my age, even a decade younger, are long since settled down with homes and families of their own. What do I even talk to them about? It is like they speak a different language.

More and more, I just wonder what there is to look forward to. Sometimes, oftentimes really, just getting out of bed is hard. It's all I can do to just get up for work so I can continue existing. I'm tired of going through life alone. I'm tired. I just want someone to validate my existence, to give a fuck about me, to fucking love me. Is that so much to ask, universe?

Outside of my job on the phones I don‚Äôt talk to an actual human for weeks. And when I do it‚Äôs the cashier at Kroger. 

I don‚Äôt have family-Parents have passed and I‚Äôve been disowned/non contact almost 15 years with anyone else. (No aunts/grandparents/cousins/etc) 

I live alone. I have no coworkers.  I have no family. I have no emergency contacts. I‚Äôm not from the state. I‚Äôve gotten hurt and had to Uber myself to the hospital because I don‚Äôt have anybody else to call. I especially don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to go during the pandemic to socialize. Don‚Äôt want a roommate cause in my experience we aren‚Äôt  ever friends or social; just separate bill payers. Plus again-I don‚Äôt know anyone so roommate would literally be a Craigslist stranger or something. 

When I do try to ask the locals in passing what they‚Äôre doing to socialize, they always push me towards where the college kids are hanging out. And I get it; I don‚Äôt look my age according to everybody else.  I don‚Äôt know anyone my age or older-I don‚Äôt even know anyone over 30. I used to ignore it but after you realize you‚Äôre constantly surrounded by people 10+ years younger than you it starts to become very apparent. I feel like somethings wrong with me and I must be mentally immature or something. 

I‚Äôve been spending holidays at shelters, with random coworkers, or just not celebrating at all for over a decade. 

I work from home for going on 4 years now and physically do not have coworkers. I‚Äôm home alone with my thoughts all day 24/7. I got a bunch of hobbies I do alone. Trust me I would love to do that with other people but I don‚Äôt know anybody else who does anything or how to find like-minded individuals. 

I‚Äôve been on meetup for 5 years-I go to all kinds of events just end up by myself. Or there‚Äôs the issue of me being token. I‚Äôm always an ‚Äúonly‚Äù or Women will not talk to me until I say how old I am-then telling me that they thought I was a child and that‚Äôs why they ignored me but wait until we‚Äôre at the end of the event. Or the famous line that I always get. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way nicer than I thought you were gonna be.‚Äù I‚Äôm always an oddball. I get told I look unapproachable or stuck up but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing to convey that.

I‚Äôm terrified of going to bars now because I‚Äôve acquired stalkers, creeps, and people realize very quickly that I‚Äôm a lone woman. I‚Äôm not the ugliest person so I definitely will have people looking at me all night but not actually say anything. Or the ones that do -I don‚Äôt have an out if they get weirdo. I can‚Äôt really drink-have to be super aware. I just end up spending money to sit by myself.

I‚Äôve considered joining a church because I don‚Äôt know any other way to meet people my age that‚Äôs not a bar. 

I‚Äôm scared of dating because that person will be my only source of human interaction. Also in this era people are mostly meeting online and it‚Äôs way too easy for my body to disappear. Any man I meet online is going to be a stranger in and it‚Äôs super risky-I‚Äôve had some very scary encounters. It also puts me in such a vulnerable position if I like someone- they realize that they are the only ounce of companionship and intimacy that I get.  That person is literally my only friend and if they‚Äôre busy I am literally in the same boat-Plus it‚Äôs 100% unhealthy and codependent. 

My only interactions are on social media and it‚Äôs the same way where I draw in a super young crowd for some reason.  Yes I know I can get a pet but I don‚Äôt think I really fixes my lack of social interaction. A pet is not a human that can hold a conversation with me. Please don‚Äôt be like my horrible therapist and suggest that I have children to fill that void because I never wanted them and think that‚Äôs an absolutely selfish excuse. 

I‚Äôm one of those people that if I die it will take literally a month by my body and that will be my leasing office coming to check for the rent. I don‚Äôt really know what else I can do at this point.",lonely,No human interaction.,2021-08-03 11:44:29

I was really proud of myself for finishing the first day of a 5k training program.

I know these things sorta just happen if you have enough of a presence, but like in real life, I'm socially awkward and can't think of anything smart or funny to say.

Was I just not meant to have friends, indefinitely? Not even online?

Even in subs that I have an interest in, I can't really for the life of me figure out what to initiate. I do love having conversations, but that's just in general. I don't come across that opportunity very often. It's so hard to meet people on here sometimes.

4485,NEPTUNEX15,1627947118,1,"Essentially the reasons I can't get a girlfriend are the same reasons I have depression. I'm not ambitious, I'm very lazy, I'm not very passionate about my own projects and I haven't really done much with my life so I feel boring. I feel like I'm an incel, but I've had sex, I'm good looking by societal standards and I don't have an anger towards women. I'm also willing to admit that all my problems are my own. I more mean I'm just finding it hard to get laid or meet someone. 

So basically I'm having to change who I am as a person if I want a girlfriend, but tbh I need to change anyways if I want a good life. Its just hard changing yourself, especially if you have depression. It's like you'll work hard to take steps forward to improve who you are, but then it's just so easy to fall back to where you were. It's a constant up hill battle and I'm just a bit tired of it today.

I also have massive anxiety about the size of my junk. Idk if it's because I've been exposed to too much porn, or if I have body dysmorphia which some therapist have spectacled I have; but I feel like it ain't good enough to keep someone's interest. I've also had 2 out of the 7 women I've slept with comment on it, but in all fairness they were assholes about a lot of things and they weren't very nice relationships in general. I feel these bad relationships have effected me mentally. My second girlfriend after having sex for the first time said she was disappointed in the sex because ""she thought I'd be bigger because I'm confident and manly"", And now I'm worried I won't be able to get with someone because they'll think the same. Or at least someone nice, because part of my issue is that I allow myself to go for women who send up massive red flags. But I just completely ignore them because I feel lonely. Its a bad cycle that I'm fully aware of. 

I know having a relationship isn't the most important thing in the world and I was starting to learn a lot of self love, but I've just been feeling extra lonely recently with starting work. I work in a night club, so I'm constantly seeing people neck on and chatting eachother up. I even get women flirting with me, but they are drunk and I'm sober so no thanks. It's just hard because I also live alone, so I spend the night having a blast, serving drinks and flirting with other members of staff (I can't get with them, I have a don't shit where I eat rule and none of them are interested in me above a casual flirt anyways), only to come back to a shitty lonely apartment. If I had like a spoon with someone once a week I'd be good lol. I'm sure I'll be fine, it's just a very stressful week with university and I needed a rant.",lonely,"I know why I can't get a girlfriend, but it's hard to change.",2021-08-03 09:31:58
4486,sharp_icical,1627946988,1,"23 here. Just wanted to let out a bit of frustration, I guess. To sum it up, a couple years ago, I dropped out of college after failing to take it seriously at all, which is entirely my fault. I spent about one year after that barely getting by, taking odd jobs when I had the motivation and selling most of my non-essential possessions. But I‚Äôm not really here to talk about that.

I‚Äôm here to talk about how life is now. Several months ago, I finally got myself a steady job with decent pay, and I even do food deliveries on my days off. Things are improving, and I‚Äôm even starting to put a good amount of savings away, which might even help me go back to school in the future. I don‚Äôt even mind working 7 days a week like I am, if it means I can pull myself up again.

What does get to me, though, is that I don‚Äôt really have a social life anymore. Once covid hit last year, almost all my college friends went back to their families, and then graduated in the summer. Now they‚Äôre all going off and living their dreams, and getting engaged, all that good stuff. My roommate, and best friend of 6 years now, just moved out today too. And I‚Äôm stuck here, just trying to get back on my feet so I can maybe make something of myself another 4 years from now. 

And again, that‚Äôs fine, I can accept my mistakes. And I could not be happier for all my friends.

Before, it was somewhat shallow, it was for sure affecting me but still I had a majority of good moments.

What I saw is this broken down person with so much potential, so much love to give, so many laughs and good feelings to have, staring back at me with run down, glazed and tired eyes. Full of coldness and nothing. Just nothing really. 

I used to be very expressive with my face and my body language, always talking and using the muscles around my eyes and my eyebrows a lot. You know, just an expressive and outgoing person not afraid of showing emotions. So it was almost kind of frightening looking at a person in the mirror that you're not used to seeing.

he was even jealous of my own family members. i never had any friends and he was basically the only human contact i had outside of my family. he would threaten me for talking to guys, and even girls.

i downloaded reddit recently because i felt so lonely, and thought i would just delete the app if he were to check my phone. i made friends with some people and added them on discord, which i forgot to delete. 

half way into our conversation on discord today he took my phone and found the (completely innocent) messages. he continued the conversation and made it suuper sexual to embarrass me. he was very close to sharing my nudes to him as well to further humiliate me, it was only because i was crying and begging not he he had mercy on me. then my discord friend wanted to exchange snaps for explicit reasons.

my boyfriend, added his snap on his own phone, so he could find my discord friends address on the snap map. of course my friend realised it wasn‚Äôt me talking to him and left it.

after, he slapped me once in the face, and i‚Äôm scared he would‚Äôve done much worse if he knew my parents would see marks on my face. my parents needed help with bringing in the groceries when i told him then and there it‚Äôs over.

Solid nope.

I came across a post by a couple I was friends with during our master's programs and they posted about getting together with family and friends for an afternoon in a city only a few hours away. My first thought was 'wow, we could've met up for a bit if I'd known.' And then I saw the pictures. Three other couples were there. All of whom I was close to during our degree program at the same school. And one couple lives in the same town as I do. 

The long and short of it is, I'm feeling hurt and lonely. Despite living in the same town for the last few years, I can count on my fingers the number of times we've hung out and the majority of which were initiated by me. It just sort of hit me all at once that while I thought we were friends, the same may not be said for their part. 

I know this sounds really pathetic and whiny. I'm overthinking and generalizing.

At the beginning of March 2020 India declared lockdown and during lockdown my exam result were declared in which I didn't performed well. This bad result hit me very hard and I decided to take a year drop and prepare for collage entrance exam. To avoid talking about my bad results I dumped all of my friends as talking about my bad result make me feel very insecure. Days went by I became lazy and my preparation went down and my misery of being alone where there is no one to talk and no fun in my life grew stronger and stronger. I lost connection with my old friends and it was lockdown so no new friends. To deal with my loneliness and failure I went online to find some friends and there I met with a girl. She was also looking for a friend and we became friends. Our friendly chats went sexual and it felt like she is my online girlfriend. Day and night I thought about her. Three months passed by and I begin to fear that I will losing her. Every morning my blood pressure was low and the thought that she will be gone made me crazy. Seeing my blood pressure drop every morning for a week due to fear of losing her I broke up with her never talked to her since a month.

4550,Araknhak,1627902819,1,"This is in no way shape or form an attempt to pretend that pain and suffering doesn not exist. Neither am I saying that being strong in times of darkness is an easy thing to do, specially given the reality of all the suffering in the world. My point though, is that being drawn down the hole that is self pity, constant crying and blaming the world just makes things worse. 

In my opinion we live way too self centered lives, our minds always create the illusion that whatever hole we're in right now probably is the deepest one out there; we don't really think that way, but we most certainly often act out that belief. The problem with that is that we never realize that there is always a deeper level of suffering waiting just under the one we're currently on. So instead of making sure we don't fall into that deeper hole, we fall into despair instead; feeling sorry for our situation, blaming others for their wrongdoings and even the world for it's fundamental flaws. But that is always just bound to make things worse, because it takes you away from actually trying to make things better. And if you think you can do both at the same time, yes you can, but you're then just not putting as good as an effort into actually making things better. This thus makes the situation worse by extending your suffering, and also even by potentially creating new ways for you to suffer.

As I said before, I understand that people live difficult lives, which is a fundamental part of being human. And I do understand that some people live worse lives than others. But self pity, crying and blaming the world, just makes things worse, no matter your situation. So why don't we all decide to bear our own burden of suffering with our heads held up high? Why don't we all decide to strive after acting out the best in ourselves, despite all the flaws of the world, and despite all the darkness in other people's hearts? Why don't we instead turn our attention to our own selves and our own flaws? Not so that we can be reminded of our own insufficiencies and fall deeper into despair, but with the purpose of honestly asking ourselves what it is that we can do to make things better. In my opinion, there is no better way for each of us to light our own candle amidst the inevitable darkness that is existence.

4552,BakaSentinel,1627901378,1,"Hello, I was once lonely and it pained me a lot. I had given up on life at just the age of 14 and I felt everything and everyone in this world hated me. But eventually, I grew into a different person; I began viewing myself differently by cutting off ties with the people I was horribly attached to, and I reconciled with the friends I had distanced myself from. I started watching shows I had genuine interest in and I began studying properly again. By the end of July , I'd fully recovered back to my 2019 July self, who was interested in time travel and looked at the world with a smile of ambition. 

I'm posting this to tell those who are in the worst of times now and are scrolling through here to find a reason to live that there is. It's yourself. Your future can be the best of things, and I'm sure they want to tell you not to give up and look at life with a brighter eye. Your past self also looks up to you, so don't fail them and continue on and do your best. It's hard, I completely understand, but I know that things will get better for all of you one day, and that's coming soon. If you can't live for yourself now remember that your future self and past self rely on you, so don't give up , and see everything with eyes of ambition and determination.

Good luck.

4556,whoompywhomp,1627898803,1,"In the last 2 years, I experienced an extremely lonely period of time. There was even a point I cried nearly each time I got home from school, because the loneliness was so crushing. 
But this year, it got much better, the situation has lightened up so much. I occasionally still feel lonely, but I finally managed to deepen my social connections, and most importantly, I learned to accept and move on with things. 
But here's the thing: During those days I was awfully lonely, it felt as if a glass wall was seperating me from the rest of the world, where I was left to curl up in a dark corner and feel the sinking coldness, whilst everyone else got to feel this...sort of warmth. A glowing warmth, that naturally radiated from quality relationships. Kind of like longingly watching the kindly, warm fire in someone's home, while your a beggar outside in the winter streets, shuddering. 
And yet, occassionally, I still managed to feel that warmth. That very special warmth came when someone was actually being friendly to me---treating me like a friend. That very special warmth came when the friendly auntie in the coffee shop would come and chat with me. That very special warmth even came when I browsed through reddit and read other people's stories. All the small things. It meant so much.
And so, now that my super lonely phase is over, I have learnt something very important: always, when possible, treat people like a friend. Because you never know who is secretly in a dark place right now----and after all, all humans could do with a bit of warmth! Who knows, maybe that quiet kid you struck a friendly conversation with this morning, no matter how casual it was---is secretly very happy because finally, somebody noticed you, somebody actually came to share warmth with you. Offer to have lunch with that person who's always alone at recess. Offer some candy to everyone. All these things.

4570,VixL707,1627891461,1,"I‚Äôm not as lonely as I used to be. Which was why I stopped coming to this sub frequently. I have one really close friend that I made online and we talk everyday. We‚Äôve been through IT together. She saw me through my mental health troubles and even forgave me when I ghosted her once due to feeling mentally low. So, safe to say she‚Äôs a real one.

We usually talk all throughout the day. Which helps a lot. She‚Äôs very sociable and we are both writers, so our conversations never get dry. You don‚Äôt know how good it feels to have a friend. 

But I realized that I have no irl friends. I‚Äôve never met my said best friend. We have just known each other for three years thanks to a writing website. But somehow she supports me more than anyone I‚Äôve ever met irl?

Is that weird???

Today, I posted some stories to my Instagram for my close friends/family to see (I only have 33 followers and 7 of those I designated as close ‚Äúfriends‚Äù) and literally only ONE person watched my story. And the person who watched it is not even a close friend anymore. We used to be friends when we were kids, but we fell out. But she added me back on instagram, so I kind of see it as burying the hatchet. And she didn‚Äôt even interact with my story, so chances are she most likely just skipped through it.

And I wouldn‚Äôt care if I wasn‚Äôt so goddamn lonely. My best friend that I wrote about before doesn‚Äôt really use social media. So, she doesn‚Äôt interact with me up there. But maybe if she did, I wouldn‚Äôt feel so goddamn lonely and pointless posting.

Not even my cousin or half sister watched my story. Which speaks VOLUMES to me lmfao. So, I posted on Tik Tok to get some interaction. And the moment I did, said cousin responded with a NEGATIVE comment.

Basically, I was trying to learn how to twerk for fun (I‚Äôm a black girl that can‚Äôt dance‚Ä¶yes a unicorn) and I was excited to share with SOMEBODY that I was kind of getting some moves down. My mom had said that I was getting the basics. So, I felt comfortable and excited to share my improvement with someone. 

When I posted, my so called cousin who SHOULD be my BIGGEST SUPPORTER basically left a hate comment. No heart. No encouragement. No nothing. Just a hate comment.

THESE are the people who are my irl so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport system‚Äù. They DON‚ÄôT support me like strangers I‚Äôve never met do.

Because in comparison, another one of my internet friends actually hearted my post. So, it‚Äôs like wtf. I never spent time with this person or met them irl and yet they actually support me more than my own flesh and blood.

Now, don‚Äôt get me started on Facebook. Everyone I have up there is supposed to to be family or people I have actually met in real life. Mainly from High School, my times trying to get my degree, to my short time in the Military, jobs I‚Äôve worked, and only ONE OR TWO are from the internet.

And who do I get the most interaction from? You guessed it: not my irl people.

I left a comment on this girl who I used to be friends with in High School‚Äôs post and she totally ignored me. Then when I left a comment on this gurl who I met online‚Äôs post, she reacted to it.

See the difference here?

Not to mention I rarely get ANY interaction on my posts. I know I shouldn‚Äôt care about likes or shares but I do.

Especially when I see other people get interaction but rarely ever me.

Now, I‚Äôm mentally ill and socially awkward so that could play a part in why I‚Äôve never been popular. But I still want people to care. 

I feel like I post for nothing.

People also say I'm close minded for not engaging in casual sex or getting into a poly relationship when I have very good reasons for not doing either. 

I have accepted my flaws and what's good about me, too. I love myself as much as I can given certain things.
But because I was born differently to other women none of that matters. I'm aware that I have maybe one or two deal breakers that could push someone away, one being my clueless nature in healthy relationships given that my only ""experience"" was abuse.

Which doesn't count as a relationship. Some people disagree with this which I just find to be insane. For instance, my request to one subreddit (which will remain nameless) to find support for women was denied because they see abuse as a relationship and it was a subreddit for people who'd never been with anyone.

So as much as I have spent the past few years trying to identify red flags so as to avoid those things happening to me even again, I simply don't know how to actually act in a healthy relationship.

The second deal breaker is leftover trauma from that. I won't get into that as much but obviously I have a few scars. 

Why I don't think I can be with anyone is because I'm aware of these deal breakers but am also aware that some people wouldn't mind them. However, nobody except for guys and chasers want me due to the circumstances of my birth. If nobody will have me because of being trans, how on earth could I expect someone to be okay with my cluelessness or the leftover scars? 

I don't mind being single, but it's the idea of never being with anyone, never knowing what love feels like that bothers me. Right now I'm trying to be okay with the idea of never having a relationship but it's really hard and quite frankly I don't really know how you even get over something like that.

I'm human, after all and humans crave relationships. That's not a part of my brain that I can switch off, as much as I'd like to. I'd like to be able to just let go and be okay with this but I don't know how.",lonely,Trying to be okay with this,2021-08-02 16:19:21

Covid had ruined my plans, worked away my early 20s and saved what I could so I could afford college but it all went online so that's a bust. I lost my high school years back in the day to online schooling as well, I don't want to do that ever again. I've never been in a relationship, always been single/alone, too much socialization lost to my past, electronics, and trauma as a child. I'm close with my family, not that social but I am not asocial.

I never knew how lost I really felt and how much I've missed out on later in life until I got older and realized how your 20s really aren't as magical as people make it to be. I did lose 163lbs when I was 19/20, 378 to 215 at 6'6. in shape now and plan not to go back to my old ways because of how depressing and destructive they were, caused by my past asocial trauma and ignorance. I'm just numb to the pain of loneliness because I've never been intimate with a stranger, and I don't think I ever can be. I don't know who to trust.

When I was a little kid, I was very rambunctious and hyper/violent, diagnosed autistic, and the school administration would often lock me in a closet for sometimes hours every other day instead of sending me home for reasons described later. Sometimes they would drag me by the ankles down the halls as I screamed and all the other kids watched it happen. It really fucked with my mind and social life for years and my small class of 50 or so other kids basically ostracized me. The administration even sent letters out to every kid's parents saying I was a threat. I became isolated and depressed/addicted to so much shit for so long. Never really knew how to open up to anyone, because I lost so much socialization in my early years. My parents almost won a 3 million dollar lawsuit because of it. I'm so lonely, it's literally pain in my chest and head when I think about it.

I wasn't allowed to be a kid at home growing up because my mom worked there as a massage therapist, always needed it quiet. I've basically been shut-in and told to shut up for my whole life, and this world of rampant technology and covid has not helped at all. I often wish I would have moved out sooner, figured myself out sooner, but I did in time and im glad I did. I know what I want to do with my life in a career-sense

My parents never dated anyone before meeting each other in their early 20s so they never got that essential dating experience/knowledge that so many other people get from their parents. The best advice my dad gave me was to just be friends with women when not all women just want to be friends from my own experience. I guess nice guys finish last, huh?

Most flirtatious or romantic attempts other people make towards me become so overwhelming I basically shut down. It's embarrassing, and I can't play along because I don't know how. I don't know if this is a cry for help or my last attempt before I call it quits finding love because I can't take this anymore, and I'm not going to be young for much longer. I hate being the ""nice guy"" everyone calls me, because the nice guy is seen as a pushover. He is the pawn, an object. I don't care anymore, no more Mr nice guy idiot pushover. The pain has surpassed me and I'm numb to it. I guess at some point you become old and it is awkward to admit how screwed up you are in some ways, but oh well. I'll never grow if I never put myself out there and just try and talk to people who might be in the same damaged boat as me.",lonely,23M I think all I really want is a hug,2021-08-02 15:50:57

I‚Äôve always been a more reserved individual, keeping to myself when able. I can be very outgoing, and I genuinely love the presence of my mutual aged friends. However, the solitude always comes when I realize how different I really am from all of my acquaintances, even those I‚Äôd consider to be close friends. They all love loud music, partying, clubbing, etc... Although I manage to have fun doing all of this in good presence, I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled with any of the above activities. I‚Äôd much rather spend a Saturday afternoon having a quiet picnic at the park, listening to 60‚Äôs music as I admire the cloud formations above me.

I feel like an old man trapped in a young man‚Äôs body and mind.

Hey, looking to meet some people who either need support or want support. Im in that kinda life phase right now where I dont know if ill make it through alone. Currently nursing a developing drinking habit that im trying to stop but the burning in my stomache and the bubbly i feel feels so good. I need to be around people who are true to themselves, dont want to manipulate or feather their own ego(unless healthy) or use me. Ive been through a lot in my own life, its ok if you have to. If you constantly feel like you cant have friends cause you are going to burden or bring them down, i feel that too. You should know you wont bring me down cause im pretty tough. Its all love. I have no ulterior intentions for you besides simply meeting you, expanding what i know about the world through you and loving you in a way that supports your best interests, platonically more like. At this current time my heart is wrought with a kind of turmoil best suited inside me. Please know I am not looking for romance, I am looking for connection. Shared experiences, fun conversations and long vents that you just need to get out. I wanna be your friend, a person who matters. I dont really have much in my life in the way of this and a lot of my family is either dead or on drugs. Im starting to feel like I dont have much time and yet ive denied myself so much in life. its time to turn that around, starting with being a person. I need you to help me to that, and if you need me too I will be there.

You can expect me to return the effort you put in absolutely on par if not more, however you should also know sometimes, for maximum a day i can become unreachable even to myself and withdraw severly. Depending on my comfort levels with you i may or may not be able to mitigate this. please understand, and if its not for you then okay. My goal is never to hurt you. You can expect the same understanding, the same safety.

If anything I have said so far is something you relate to, feel free to dm me your discord and I will reach out to you very soon. I accept everyone, all walks of life but please do not bring evil intent into my home\~",lonely,22/NB [Friendship] [Long-Term Chat],2021-08-02 14:20:26

Honestly it's easier to to make a list.
-Major life changing event I'm not legally allowed to talk about. (that was enough trauma for a life time but theres more)
-Horrible relationship that ending with cheating a lies
-Lost all my closest friends
-tried to date again and got lead on for a few months
-tried getting new friend and they all abandoned me
-tries to make more new friends and I had to stop talking to them cuz my mental stability was at risk
-and as of recently, completely lost all my close friends

I'm only writing the list cuz I'm actually about half way threw getting over that stuff. I'm about up to ""mental stability"" part so I've come a long way but all of this happened in less than a yes and all of which just made the last stuff harder to move on from.

At the moment I'm done needing to focus on healing and need to focus on rebuilding literally everything I have lost. 

Listen I'm trying and fighting to keep my head above water but it feels like when I take a breath for air nothing comes in. I feel as though the only way to get attention and friends is threw being ""edgy"" and ""traumatized"" which isnt what I want. No one wants to be my friend because it takes effort to be my friend and people my age just dont care to work hard for a friendship because they can afford to lose friends.

I have pennies worth of reasons to wake up I'm the morning and I still go out on the grind to make new connections and its just not taking. Like gluing together metal. Like with normal Elmer's glue. It just dont work.

So I guess the whole point is that obviously life wants me to stay down so I'm gonna stay down. While I wait for life to get its nasty foot off my back would anyone care to message me weekly for some time? I'm used to people leaving so just go when ever you want but let me know so I dont bother waiting for you.

If you want reasons to be my friend here are some
-golden retriever personality
-small things make me happy
-only gets enjoyment when I make others happy
-plays monster hunter 
-only has a switch (that's not a good reason but it should be noted)
-has cats and will send cat pics 
-stupidly innocent intentions (I'll stay up 4 hours to make sure you're ok so I can sleep soundly)
-super cuddle friendly
-super anything friendly (just dont treat me poorly and communication and we'll get along)
-uhhh idk I'm a fluffy haired gamer boy?

anyways I'm sad and lonely and this is another attempt at fixing that. Go ahead and look at my posts and you'll see this has been going on for a while. Ok bye bye~",lonely,It's harder than I realized,2021-08-02 10:24:22

They promise me all these great things and nothing comes of it apart from them turning into somebody horrible, even after hearing everything about what people have done to me and promising me they never would, they always end up the same. This is why i feel like ill be on my own forever, sometimes I feel peace in that sometimes I don't and I feel jealous of everyone who can be in enjoyable relationships. No matter how hard I try everybody abandons me, hurts me and fucks me up even more. I'm just sick of it, I feel like everyone just wants to waste my time and lie to me. I feel like the only way I am desirable is sexually so I let people use me for that and seek validation from people on the internet to try and fill that hole.",lonely,[F] why do i only attract people who want to hurt me,2021-08-02 10:23:25

we all love that song right? Well, my life feels definitely like that right now! but hey, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face. I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. So i feel like in the song, fallen into the same old dull routine.. our marriage is having a hard time. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives sperately. I invested so much in my marriage, i fought so long to be with her.. 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we click. But not just as friends, something more than that. I don't know how to call it. I'm mentally and physically frustrated.

4624,idontevenknowsadface,1627862516,1,"22f - mostly off my chest post. At primary school (UK) I had a good group of friends. In secondary school I also had a solid friendship group but I always felt like the annoying one or one that was easily forgotten, the group was quite split so people were forming closer friendships with different people and I guess I didn't, I drifted from people as we aged. In college I had a group of friends the first year and then in the second I withdrew as there were some people that didn't like me because I was quiet, I spent most of my time in the library and ate my sandwiches in the toilet as I felt I couldn't approach my friendship group anymore. I went to uni in my home city so lived at home, this massively ruined my chances of making friends early and by the first day everyone had already formed friendship groups somehow. I also don't like going clubbing or drinking and couldn't push myself to go to make friends. There are people I knew but no one to actually talk to or sit next to. I have no one my life that I would consider proper friends or someone I could randomly message to talk or to go out with. Just acquaintances, I don't know how to take friendships to the next level, how do you even make friends, what on earth can we talk about? I have one 'friend' that he has a breakdown every other week and won't respond to any messages for a month, she has a ton of other friends that she talks to online. I have one other 'friend' who is sweet and we may meet up once a year. She recently posted her going away on holiday with the people we were friends with at school. It made me realise how lonely I actually am, if I had not been so awkward or anxious maybe I would have friends to go on holiday with. I have a super small family, no cousins just one sister. She is very outgoing and has a ton of friends. I will be graduating shortly and will get a job where I would work in a small team with adults of varying ages so I think my chance of forming a friendship will be slim then too.

I consider both of these people my best friends because I don't have anyone else. I know that they would not consider me to be their best friends. It just hurts so bad. I have a boyfriend and we have been together for 5 years but we are LDR and with Covid god knows when we could close the distance.  He doesn't really have many friends either but online ones and is happy. I just feel really lonely and wish I had someone to go shopping with, do fun activities with, to exchange gifts with at christmas and birthdays. I feel my lack of friendships is so blantly obvious to my family and my 'friends' and its so embarrassing, I don't even post pictures like I want to on instagram because no one follows me because I don't know anyone.",lonely,The painful reminders you don't have friends is the worse feeling,2021-08-02 10:01:56

I thought I had made a friend finaly after so long, that I had finally met someone I had stuff in common with, but they just ignored me, just stopped talking. 

Anyways today I figured I should go anyways, why not?, I could breathe some fresh air and who knows if I could meet someone new. I went alone and saw so many people with their friends, with their partners, with their families, playing, talking, doing sports, being all happy, and it just made me realize how fucking pathetic my life is, I don't have friends, no one to text with, I do nothing all day, don't have hobbies, no real interests, actually, that's probably the reason why everybody leaves, I'm boring, I'm uninteresting, I don't bring anything to this world, if I just disappeared people who've knoen would probably not even find out about it, since I'm just so fucking irrelevant.

Anyways I just came back from the park, I was there for maybe 45 minutes and just felt so pathetic the whole time, I was all alone looking at my phone, playing pokemon go since it's all I could be doing there, but it just convinced me I will probably die all alone, the few people who know me just leave me as soon as they can, and everybody else is just much more interesting, why would they wanna be with me?

I got rid of all but two social medias recently: this Reddit account and my 14-follower Instagram page. Cut off a friend in the process but it may have been better as I never felt close with him after an incident which took place last year. All I got on my IG is a few people from my school years and a few people I talk to online. They like what I post and I'm cool with them so it works out.

During the summer, I don't do much. I don't have a job since I've struggled to find one. Most of the time, I'm outside going on walks or going to my nearby basketball court to usually shootaround when I'm alone or, in the rare event the place gets busy, try to play a few pickup games. I love when I get to shootaround alone. Indoors I'm gaming, listening to music, or watching a movie with my brother. I like that lifestyle a lot.

College starts soon though so that's going to end sadly. I'm hoping that finally being on-campus five days a week for an upwards of 9 hours a day will help me make friends. Even if I can't find friends, I'm looking forward to what's coming up there for me and what I can do. That'll be fun, but the commute won't nor will the loneliness I may feel at times.

Other than friends, I hope I can find a relationship. I've never had one, but I want one. I may have had the chance with someone a few years back as they seemed to drop subtle hints, but I never broke the ice. I got too nervous to. Oddly enough, I still run into them during my shootarounds (although we don't say anything).

Both parents alcoholics/drug addicts, never really set any good examples for me. (They are both better now, but the damage is still there). 

I just feel so broken. I haven't made a friend since I was in 8th grade, haven't had any friends period in about three years. Safe to also say that I have never been in a relationship of any kind. (Actually never even held hands with a woman)

I just have such a boring and plain personality. I never developed socially. I work a decent job, I am getting by on my own but it hurts so much to not have anyone to share that with. People don't like me. It's not just my acne scarred, disgusting appearance; because even online I have trouble meeting people. People ghost me all the time. Am I really that boring and uninteresting?

I moved here because my two oldest friends are here and one of them referred me to a job and I was rocking at it until just a while ago when I burned out pretty bad (I'm seeing a therapist this week).

Sometimes, I spend 15d without leaving anywhere...

And my wife also appreciate been alone, so she usually stays quiet and doing her stuff all day long. Don't get me wrong, we both love each other very much and we care for each other but she suffers from anxiety and she panics now and then, so she needs her space as well.

Hello fellow lonely bois, girls and everything else, I am honestly unsure how to do this, it‚Äôs my first ever Reddit post but I legit can‚Äôt talk to my friends about this, they‚Äôre fed up of hearing the same old story and honestly, I don‚Äôt blame them. So here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôve been on and off with this girl for a good 4 years now, I love her with all my heart and it feels different, I just have never felt this way about anyone, ever. It also feels weird because of it being that long that it feels like it‚Äôll be hard to feel this way about someone else. But yeah we keep splitting up for whatever reasons, she goes into a new relationship, I do my own thing, the relationship fucks up and we end up back at each other‚Äôs doorstep. Truthfully for a while it was very toxic and she kept blaming her mental state for it, she once told me that she‚Äôs always loved me, the feelings never left. Yet it keeps happening. In a morbid sort of way, I was relieved finding out every relationship apart from ours was severely toxic and I was healthy, I was the only good constant boyfriend she ever had. However this time it‚Äôs different, the guy is actually okay, at least from what I‚Äôve heard and honestly I‚Äôm kind of scared.I want to break out this vicious circle and part of me wants to really move on. However, a large part also wants to stay and try again. What is stranger still is I get random messages from her every now and then, nothing important, just weather chat really and in these chats we‚Äôve complimented each other and just had a good time. I know the advice most people will give would be to move on, however, I just somehow can‚Äôt. But I need some external thoughts on the situation now, could she still have feelings for me and if so why doesn‚Äôt she act on them? Or is it just to keep me around?

4670,briancicil,1627837960,1,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I am struggling a bit at the moment with trying to stay hopeful for the future and keep a positive attitude.

On paper, my life does not actually look that bad. I have a full-time job that pays decent, have my own place, my own car, have no debt and have enough money to even take regular vacations, even if they are on my own. I am in excellent health, 6ft3 tall (1.91m), am very active with running and other sports. I get told by many people that I am a handsome guy with much potential, and at work I am well respected with a reputation of always helping out when others are in need. 

However, last February, my girlfriend (now ex) broke up with me. We had a short (roughly one year) but very strong, at least in my opinion, relationship. We spent a lot of time together, especially outdoors with camping, kayaking and other outdoor activities. We could talk about everything and anything together. I got along great with her family, they always invited me to family events, called me their son-in-law. I helped them out with repairs around the house and even went on vacation with them. She has a big family, and they were almost more my family than my actual family, as I am an only child and my family is much smaller.

But then, after Christmas, my ex told me she had started to lose feelings and that our relationship had started to feel more like a friendship. I had noticed that she was acting very hot/cold in the weeks before, but thought not much of it, as she was also in exam stress at the time. At first, we stayed together and thought it could just be a phase but eventually, the inevitable happened. She said that she thinks I deserve better, and she wanted to work on herself (I know, typical breakup excuse). I tried to win her back, but it only pushed her away more.

Ever since then, I feel incredibly lost and alone. I keep thinking something is wrong with me and, since she was my first real relationship that I actually felt strong for, I think I will never find someone like her again. I keep going over the past and thinking to myself where the signs were that she was having doubts or if I could have done something better. The whole break up feels like a failure and a defeat, as if I had not measured up. 

I have been on multiple dates since then, but they all didn't work out. Usually, the date just stopped responding or said the usual ""You are such a great guy but..."" . Every time it happens, I think about my ex and that maybe I am just not good enough. I have been told by some of my friends that I am maybe just too nice and not the ""bad boy"" type that most females seem to want in my age group. Obviously, the pandemic hasn't exactly helped, as I spent much of the winter and spring working at home.

Maybe someday another girl will come around, and I will look back at this post and smirk. At the moment, though, I don't see much light...

He never sexualized me or said anything about my body, we could talk about music and philosophy and how our lives were going and it felt so much more natural than with anyone else. He'd always drop these hints about what we were going to do in the future, making me feel like we were dating, and as someone who is avoidant somehow this guy made me feel for the first time like I could do that with him because I've never been comfortable with anyone like that. We never fully labeled it but my emotions were there and seemingly so were his. 

Then he explicitly said he loved me and from there it was like some switch flicked in my brain. I have bad trust issues, especially with males, due to my own childhood. I literally couldn't respond to him like normal after he said that and I know it was because I am afraid of love bombing and being lied to when it comes to my emotions. Most of the male figures in my life pretty much did the same and it's always made me wary of being told I am loved, because the actions that followed were never ""loving"".

It turns out he was talking to other girls like he did with me and he especially liked picking up girls and making them feel like that because he was being a ""nice guy"" for them. 

I thought that'd make me feel better but I knew I had a problem as well because even if he was being real, even if my instincts that turned out to be right were actually wrong, I completely shut down at being told I was loved. Attachment styles can make or break everything. It sucks and I wish I found a way to heal it, but now it's like some tug of war because every time I am afraid that someone is lying about loving me, it turns out that they are. Is this just because love nowadays is messed up and it's easier to have 30 hoes than one significant other, or because people with avoidant personalities don't know what's good for them? I think it's a combination of both",lonely,It sucks how your attachment style can mess things up,2021-08-02 01:06:50

Someone to watch anime with and fall asleep on the phone with, and while ive felt this so many times i know its always temporary.

And this time was my last straw. He love bombed me. He said he loved me and hed never hurt me and he never wants me to leave. And then a week later, he was using me for sex, every night. And when i said i didnt want yo have sex anymore, he would get sad and manipulate me to feel bad. We had a heated argument where i was begging him to care for me and just do the bare minimum.

I won't have any heirs. It's weird, but I feel that everything I struggled for in life would just lead to nothing. I'm just tired. Shitty job, time passes. More gray hair. Now I have high blood pressure. Like I'm some old man, well, it's genetic all right, but now I have to avoid salt. I'm not even 140 fucking pounds and I have to watch what I eat.

I think it's society, you know? I wasn't really raised to grow up. I was just sort of put in the system and left there. I always assumed, growing up that things would work out, I would find myself with a family, and an ok job, and...you know, nothing special, but just a good life. Only what I deserved. Only what I was capable of. Nothing extravagant. Just someone to share life with.

I have actually turned down people. And there were reasons I did so - I don't second guess them. I just...am so tired of thinking about dates from years ago and people that rejected me, why? Who the fuck knows, when you're ghosted you just have to move on. Once I ghosted someone. It was...2009. She was texting me on and on and calling me sweetie and how we were going to get married and stuff. I met her ONCE. And I wasn't really attracted. And I was in school and, well that's not really important. I just have these destructive thoughts about ""what could have been.""

But it was so amazing to have someone just embrace me, even if there was something wrong with her. She just accepted me and wanted me and...anyway. It was just as foreign a feeling to me then as now. And I, I am sorry. I didn't know what to say to this poor girl. I did the wrong thing, but...I just didn't want to hurt her and me and...I can only imagine what kind of hateful thoughts the people who ghosted me were having. If you don't say something, the other person can do NOTHING. Including saying goodbye. I'm sorry Carly. I am sure you found someone wonderful, ...

My family is aging. There isn't really much of a family. I have some cousins. I'm tired of work. My extensive education is worthless. I was tired of school before I was tired of work. Now I will say I am an introvert. But that doesn't mean I want to be alone at all times forever. Just that I don't like doing it frequently. 

Just burnt out. Applying to more jobs is mental anguish. So is trying to talk to more pointless internet dating profiles. The only one who is supportive is my grandmother. That's literally the person I talk to the most. I don't know what I will do when she dies. First, be inundated with her stuff. Then, I don't know, the pain of isolation will probably drive me to talk more to my parents. But they're the kind of people I prefer to say nothing than talk to, they just stir up more shit about what I ought to be doing and how. As if that helped me up to this point.

One ""intuitive"" thought I had about it was that I don't get along with people. I don't like them. People are hard to live with, hard to tolerate. I don't hate you - because I don't know you. But the more I know about you, the less I like you. I - I don't know. I'm just not cut out to have friends, and really love is just a branch of friendship. It's just a friend you live with. I have had friends. Long ago. That's all over with now. Now I am just growing old by myself, and I wish I could say I had some worthwhile accomplishment to go along with that, but really. I am just along for the ride.

I've been friends with the same people since my late high school days.

We're all adults now in our mind 20's and I personally feel like I've changed a lot over the years.
I, however, feel like I've changed so much, that I dont really feel like I fit in this friend group anymore. They talk about subjects I'm not interested in (more like the same 5 conversations over and over again), they dont take care of themselves, and haven't really matured in the same ways I have.
I just dont feel like they're my kind of people anymore. Sue, we all have history and they know me well enough, but I dont get excited to hang out with them anymore, and when we are hanging out, I dont feel like I can connect with them anymore. 
I've been with the same friend group for so long, I'm afraid I cant leave them. I also have no idea how to make new chiller friends as an adult. I really would just love to hang out with drama free, laid back people with similar interest to mine.

One of my few good friends (24F, totally platonic) has recently stopped responding to me for reasons I can‚Äôt identify. It was her birthday yesterday, I sent a message wishing her a happy birthday and still nothing. I‚Äôm really anxious and heartbroken from this.

Everyone tells me that I‚Äôm smart, I‚Äôm charming, I‚Äôm funny, but so few people seem to actually give a shit about me. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before. I know this shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal but it‚Äôs always been a big source of sadness, embarrassment, and confusion for me. I think I‚Äôm deserving of love and affection, and I think I afford that to others, but don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt feel the same about me. 

I went to the club tonight (alone, as always) because apparently that‚Äôs what young people are supposed to do. As usual, I left after a couple hours, frustrated and confused because I don‚Äôt know what to do around all those strangers. It‚Äôs supposed to be fun, and I try to go to exercise my social anxiety muscle, but I always leave feeling worse than when I came in.

I had pretty severe depression and shut basically everyone out of my life. Covid also didn‚Äôt help because I used it as an excuse to close off from the world entirely.

I‚Äôm finally trying to open up to the world again and even tried posting on a couple subreddits to find people to talk to and idk why but i just felt like every single guy was just trying to get into my pants. I intellectually know that (well hopefully) most weren‚Äôt but still, that‚Äôs what it felt like.

I made this mistake of posting a selfie with my post so I would be less of an anonymous random faceless internet thing and more of a human if that makes sense. It completely backfired because 90% of the DMs I got were just commenting on my physical appearance in some way with the vast majority completely objectifying me. 

In a way I feel like now any guy who wants to talk just has some nasty intentions mainly because I revived ALOT of messages from guys being extremely inappropriate.

4750,FeelingsAreFake,1627787607,1,"Hi. Im writing this at 4am, so it will most likely be poorly worded. 

Im 18-years old living with severe depression and body dysphormia. I have constant overthinking issues, which includes suicidal thoughts. I am very lonely, with zero close friends. Yes I have ""friends"", but not a close friend can talk too. None of my friends has an idea of my problems, since I been successfully hiding it for years. Because of my mental problems I have been very asocial the last years. Im feeling constant regret and anger that I wasted my youth so poorly, and I know this will only get worse as I (might) grow older. I still can't comprehend in my head, that I'm actually 18. It's so unreal to me, and I just can't accept the fact that I wasted the last years, trying to cope with my mental problems.

The only ""friends"" i really have is the ones I play video games with. But recently I decided to stop playing video games, as I was addicted. I quitted because it's messing with my dopamine levels, time, and overall mental health. Alongside gaming addiction, I have a porn addiction which I currently been trying to quit for 1,5 years.

Anyways, so since I quitted gaming I have no people to talk too. And as a guy with severe overthinking issues, it's not so good being left alone in my own thoughts. Alongside dealing with dopamine detox from my two addictions. 

So I began my journey trying to find a long-term ONLINE. I been for 1 month unsuccessfully trying to find a friend on so many differents apps, websites, etc. Yes, I talked to a lot of people both through texting and talking. But it's nearly Impossible to find a consistent friend, atleast for me. Everytime I think I found at nice friend, the person seems to lose interest in me after like 1-day of chatting/talking. This really made me feel even more sad, as I couldn't even get a consistent friend when there is million people online using these apps etc.

But 4-days ago, after 1 month of trying to find a nice friend. I found one. We have been talking for hours every day, the last 4 days. She is so kind and sweet. She understands my problems, and tries to help me, and actually CARE about me. Also she lives 8 hours away from me, and not like on the other side of the planet, as many of the other people I talked to did. Sometimes she is also being flirty with me, but Im trying to ignore it the best i can.

However, she is 16. I normally would skip people at age 16 or under, but since it was the last call of the night, i tried talking to her which turned out so great. The age-gap didn't really bother me and i didn't think about it, because she seems much more mature than me. I will turn 19, before she turns 17. So at one point i will be 19 and she will be 16. 

But a thought crossed my mind, ""is it weird that im talking to a 16-year old?"", ""What if she wanted to meet and she will be 2,5 years younger than me"". ""How would people react to that""

SO. I made a reddit post. Asking if it's weird that a 19 year old is girlfriend with an 16 year old. Before i didn't even think it was such a big deal. Like she even seems more mature and smart than me. But damn, peoples opinion was shocking. (The post made it seem like i was girlfriend with a 16-y old, but im not).

Many told me im weird, and why im talking to a 16-year old. A person told me i should be in jail. And just overall very rude comments. This has completely changed my view on the situation, as now im aware what people think of age gaps. As a person with overthinking issues, this hit me hard. I know im just friends with the girl, but even being friends with her will make me feel weird and uncomfortable now, since people have these opinions.   


Ever since i made this reddit post, i have been ignoring the girl. I can't talk to her, without having these thoughts in my dead. That people think im weird and thinks im grooming. She is the nicest person i have ever met on the internet. But because of this stupid age-gap i now feel uncomfortable talking to her. I now wish she was at my age. I didn't know people were so hateful about age-gaps being 2,5 years. It's like everytime im trying to get better, something just blocks the path in my direction to be happy. I fkn hate my life. I can never get better. It only will get worse from now on. I can't even imagine it.

This became a too long post, im sorry. I will prolly not get any responds, but whatever i try. I just wanna hear peoples opinions honestly. Is it weird im talking to a 16-year old, and should i stop talking with her?",lonely,"I finally found a nice friend, but then...",2021-08-01 13:13:27

Trying to find hope. Trying to be strong. Trying to find my way when all around me seems wrong. Trying to be brave. Trying to believe. Trying to know that my life was never made in ease. Trying to feel joy. Trying to know love. Regardless of these darker clouds which surround me above. The storm will never last and all the overwhelming seas dry. Their waves calm down.

we all love that song right? Well, my life feels definitely like that right now! but hey, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face. I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. So i feel like in the song, fallen into the same old dull routine.. our marriage is having a hard time. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives sperately. I invested so much in my marriage, i fought so long to be with her.. 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we click. But not just as friends, something more than that. I don't know how to call it. I'm mentally and physically frustrated.

4799,Creative_Meat7,1627768794,1,"Hi, i'm 20 years old, never had a first kiss, don't remember when was last time i hugged someone who is not a family member. Throughout my life i had many friendships in which i was abandoned in various ways, so i ended up becoming very pessimistic, distrustful loner with constant fear/paranoia of being discarded or becoming uninteresting to someone over time. I've got almost no self confidence due to bullying in school, instead there's a lot of shame because of emotions that i was showing and because i was frequently telling my parents about how i didn't want to live anymore. After the school ended, i haven't gone to college or anything like that because of the fear it would be just like the school. Currently trying to study how to draw and hoping to get a job down the road. Fell in love a few times, but every person was just not interested in me like that, i didn't talked to most of them. To be completely honest, i might've had a relationship with someone who i'm not interested in, but what's even the point in that. I would just end up using someone, and then relationship would end anyway because of all my problems. I need mutual sympathy and honesty in a relationship, otherwise it seems pointless to me. But because of my problems i'm just afraid of any real relationship, it feels scary to even be touched by someone or go outside. It feels paralyzing, like i'm wasting my life away. As if i'm just trying to block out a part of life i really wish to have. A few internet friends and hobbies is not really enough to deal with this loneliness. Yet i'm still just studying, wasting time on hobbies and not seeking any therapist. Everything feels meaningless because there will never be a person that i love who is gonna love me back.",lonely,Feeling really lonely and depressed,2021-08-01 07:59:54

4802,bausafus,1627768354,1,"I'm lonely. I look at my phone and nothing, no one to talk to, no one who'd want to talk to me, no notifications, guess I'm just boring. The last time someone sent me a message on whatsapp was my brother some weeks ago asking me what kind of sandwich I wanted. I deleted the few social media I had and I don't even know if that was for the best or not, since now I feel even more disconnected from everybody.

All I do all day is study, watch youtube, eat (or not), and sleep. I'm also gay which makes feel even worse, no one to talk to about that stuff either, I can't tell my parents yet and I don't even have someone to come out to first that could confort me in case I were kicked out or something. I go on grindr sometimes just to talk to guys and feel like someone's actually interested in what I'm saying, but at the end guys there are only seeking one thing, so whatever good conversation I have there just ends in nothing so yeah, whatever.

I have a couple 'friends' I play some games with sometimes but that's it, I don't even like gaming much and I always feel like I don't have that much in common with them nor much to talk about with them, and they're not really the kind of friends I would talk to about personal problems and stuff, we were really just friends in school because we were kind of ""the outcasts"" of our class.

A month ago some other friend I used to have in high school invited me over to hang out with some of his friends, I thought ""nice, maybe I'll finally make some actual friends"" and was pretty excited to go, but it ended up being pretty awkward, I left in a pretty bad way and it's safe to say that I will never see them again and that pretty weak friendship I had with that guy is pretty much over since he hasn't responded to my last message I sent weeks ago.

So yeah, I don't have anybody basically and I just want to disappear. I'm 18, at this age people would expect you to have many friends, go to parties, just have fun before everybody starts being overly busy, but here I am, nothing, been like this for years, can't even blame it on covid since I'm sure I would be the same lonely, sad, pathetic mess anyways.

Yeah sure I have friends and some family but it doesn't hit the same as in having someone who knows you more than they do. Here's the thing though, it's one thing to just talk about it and another to at least try and change that. Even trying and failing is putting in effort which I'm doing. That's the other thing, I'm failing. Family, friends, therapist, all conclude I need to get out there and try and find someone to at least be friends with and then maybe more and THEN most likely things will change. However I feel inadequate about finding someone, even as a friend. I don't have my stuff together, I'm just learning to drive at 25, Even though I payed $3,000 up front to live with my parents for a year I feel horrible about it.

We had some furious arguments and in a drunken argument (her drunk), she said ""you mean less to me than air"".

When she said this. I lost it. I was so so so so hurt. She ended up blocking me on everything. I sent a whole bunch of emails asking if we can talk. Long story short, she stopped emailing me back and left me blocked. Today I found out she's been dating other guys.

4845,Aromatic_Tangelo2873,1627753039,1,"I was 24 years old in 2012.

I had 2 remaining friends.

One of them lived quite far away in southern England. She came to stay over in 2012 and we went to the beach and hired bikes for the afternoon. It was good, but she was very distant with me. After that day we exchanged a few text messages and then I never saw or heard from her ever again.

The other friend was someone I knew from high school. For a long time he had been desperate to find a partner and he had finally met someone. I started hearing from him less and less until he cut contact. I remember buying a gift for his new baby and he never acknowledged it.

Everyone else I ever knew had moved on with their lives.

In hindsight I feel like I have brought a lot of this on myself. I was always quiet, shy and befriended other lonely or weird people when I was in high school and university. I never pushed my boundaries. I've never even been to a club. I rarely initiate conversation. I am a loner. I sometimes pushed others away because I thought they were too cool and successful and I was ashamed and embarassed of my own life. It is still happening to this day. I have low confidence.

What the fuck? She tried to explain herself by saying that her boyfriend knows about this and is cool with it.
