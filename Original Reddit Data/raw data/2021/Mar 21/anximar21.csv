I was on 100mg of Zoloft which was not working well, so psychiatrist recommended tapering to 50 mg and then switching to lexapro.  Only thing that bugs me is that the lexapro is only 10mg.  

They are basically the same thing right?  So how is going from 100mg of and SSRI down to 10mg of more or less the same thing going to help anything at all?

For far too long, you have preyed on our lives and made us your victims. We will not allow you to do it anymore. 

For many of us, you are a constant drain‚Ä¶ always bring us down, forcing us to hide from our true selves.

You‚Ä¶

Make me *shake* as if I were standing outside in the cold.

Have me *sweat* like I‚Äôm wearing a winter coat in 100-degree weather.

Take my *breath* away, as if I just ran a marathon.

Cause me to *overthink* like the decision I‚Äôm about to make is a matter of life or death. 

You are an inconvenient curse on my life.

Close to my whole life, you have been with me.

Loose shirts are my go-to, so the pit stains don‚Äôt show. A lot of times I‚Äôll space out at social gatherings because you start distracting me. I even fidget: kick my foot, play with my hair, play on my phone‚ÄîANYTHING‚Äîto distract myself without causing attention. Because you make me think everyone is judging me, I must hide how you make me feel.

I always wonder why I was unfortunate enough to have you. 

*Why me?* 

Over the years I have come to realize that I am not alone. Many people experience similar inconveniences because of you, and we all hate it.

But in all honesty, if we all take a moment to really think about it‚Ä¶ you mold us into the wonderful people we are today. 

You‚Ä¶

Give us the **motivation** to get things done.

Help us be **prepared** because you make us playout all the bad possibilities of a situation in our heads.

Teach us to be more **thoughtful** of others because we recognize what anxiety looks like.

Make us more **appreciative** of good days where you are nowhere to be found. On these days we can see that everything is okay.

Yes, it would be easier if you weren‚Äôt around, but since we have no choice: It‚Äôs best to look on the bright side.

So, maybe, *just maybe*, you‚Äôre not all that bad. Maybe we are not cursed beyond repair. We might be different because of you, but not doomed.

We need to choose to not let you run our lives; no matter how persuasive you are to doing so.

4,babe982,1617194269,1,"Hello everyone üòä I‚Äôm new here, this is my first post. I‚Äôm not native speaker, so sorry if I make a mistake. 

Some backstory, I was diagnosed with panic disorder about 3 and a half years ago. It was bad at the beginning (I had agoraphobia and hypochondria as well), so I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed medications (very small doses of Xanax and a mild antidepressant), which I took for 1 and a half years. After that my psychiatrist decided that I‚Äôm doing really good and we tapered off the medications.

Most of the time I can manage my anxiety pretty well and lead a completely normal life, but there are periods in which it gets harder and some of my symptoms come back (mostly physical symptoms and an occasional hypochondriac episode). 

Here‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm writing here: me and my fianc√© want to start trying for a baby soon. We are in a good position for a baby and feel ready for it. We stopped smoking together, started taking vitamins and I purposely gained a bit of weight (I was very slightly underweight). 

What worries me is my anxiety during a potential pregnancy and with an infant. What was your experience? I talked recently to a friend who had a baby soon, she was also diagnosed with panic disorder. Told me that during her pregnancy she felt so much better because her attention was turned towards the baby. 

For all the moms here - how was it for you? How were your anxiety levels during pregnancy and after you gave birth? Did you have thoughts such as ‚Äúwill I be a good mom despite the anxiety‚Äù and how did you manage them?

He knows I am schizophrenic but has never seen me in psychosis before, only with me when I was delusional or mildly hallucinating a few times over the 10 years I've known him.

We stayed at his and I began hallucinating at 10pm first just auditory, scratching and the floor and walls and banging randomly on surfaces. I told my friend to ring my mum as I started to get scared and he locked the door to stop me from going out if my brain did slip like it did.

But under my paranoia from the hallucinations I became delusional and started to believe my friend was planning to harm me. He locked the door and kept looking at the sink where knives where, it was probably an accidental stare but I took it as if he was going to stab me.

I kept quiet knowing my head plays tricks on me for 10 minutes until I started visually hallucinating, his eyes would flicker red to the rhythm of the scratching, I truly believed he had lured me to his flat, was controlling my hallucinations and he was going to do something really bad.

So I ran to the sink and got a knife, waving it in front of him screaming gibberish at it. (I wasn't going to stab him at any point I just wanted the door unlocked) and he Rugby tackled me. Took the knife off me and we fought for 5 minutes until he overpowered me and waited for my mum.

He text me saying I cut his back and he needs some time away from me. He won't text me back or answer my calls now.

1st thing is that life is 10% and how you react is 90%
Everything is a yin and yang bad and good. and bad and good is only a concept.

Some people think some things bad are good and good are bad etc.

I feel a lot of people deal with anxiety is because they dont have a base for life 

and or they are living under somebody elses mindset and insecurities.

 (I also get paranoia but im really overstanding to a lot of things i am not shallow but i know the way i put my words make no sense sometimes.) 

But bases i guess is the word is important. 
A lot of people come into life not knowing why they are here or what they are doing.

You habe to balance between irrational and rational. Emotional and logical. 

-Some things ive done which im not gonna tell people how to see things but im gonna give insight on how i deal with things like anxiety, depression, paranoia, hate, bullying(dealt with terrible bullying by people i loved.)

Try to be balanced and you have to have a sufficient mindset. (I think thats the word or a strong system
Inside) 

Anxiety is caused by feeling like ur doing somthing wrong. Not knowing

Depression is being pressed up against a wall and not knowing or having wisdom upon it. metaphorically

Always put urself 1st with thoughts and emotions and make uour self a priority. Even in groups of people and practice it but dont be egotistcle. Have some basic human knowledge or manners i guess or ediquite  

Let go of ur standards for ur self snd that can be hard because that is also letting go of a base. 

Practice mindfulness. 

Spend days off the phone and breathing a lot and drink tons of water lemon water is good as fuck. 

Stress can be hard also. Ur gonna Want to truly get better inside to get better. 

U can make ur own systems. 

Like if u want friends. U have to be uncomfortable but u dont habe to always talk. Or do the normal things. U can wear certain types of clothes or do certain routines everyday.

- low self esteem / self attack
- loneliness the disability to engage with people
- judging oneself all the time 
- assuming the worst case scenario all the time

42,FlowerCrown123,1617172688,1,"A little background on how Prozac went for me:

I have really bad social anxiety. 

\- I didn't eat outside of my home for two years because I was paranoid that everyone was watching me/judging how I eat. 

\- I couldn't walk in front of a small group of people without hyperventilating in a cold sweat and always thinking what everyone's thinking of me. 

\- I overthought about everything like a mf-er, I couldn't sleep. Overthinking gave me a terrible stomach ache and I couldn't focus on anything (Which was terrible bc I already have ADHD and already couldn't focus)

\- I couldn't try new things because I was afraid everyone would make fun of me. I had test anxiety and would break down and not be able to finish my tests. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I started on 10mg for a month or two. It helped my anxiety but not by much. So I got it upped to 20mg. 

After the 20mg started to build up and kick in, I felt amazing, euphoric, more confident than I ever have. I literally felt like I was God, I would say routinely to my mom and online ""I am god."" I felt like nothing could stop me, I wasn't scared of anything. Social anxiety? Who's that? I would talk to my mom like ""I'm so much better than everyone. Everyone is so pathetic"" Looking back on it it's kinda scary.

I had an insane superiority complex for about two months, looked in the mirror and I saw the most beautiful person ever lmao. I started seeing everything in black and white and not caring what anyone thought. The whole world around me looked like a chessboard.

Which in the moment it felt amazing. Then it crashed down into feeling extremely numb. I couldn't cry at all. I realized I hadn't cried for months. Sometimes I would get this weird feeling deep inside knowing normally my body should be crying, but it was like Prozac was superglue in my tear ducts.

So I got back down on 10mg, my anxiety started coming back. And I was always agitated and irritable, plus I would black out a lot.

When my mom would wake me up I would just turn into a demon and violent (I'm not a violent person) and say callous things. A few hours later I would forget it ever happened.

So now my doctor just prescribed me Lexapro. I haven't started it yet, but I'm hoping it'll work better for me than Prozac.

46,IKnowMyNoodles,1617170247,1," Hello everyone,

Three years ago, around late March of 2018, I started ""brisk-walking"" outdoors in my neighborhood for one hour per day six days per week.

It has revolutionized my life.

I had mild-moderate undiagnosed depression, low GPA in high school, a video-game addiction, a Porn addiction, anxiety, and other problems. I started walking originally because I thought it might help me to grow taller since I read that exercise can increase one's height.

Two months after I started ""brisk-walking"" - walking outdoors at roughly 3.5 mph for an hour straight without stopping - I suddenly had the urge to quit video games. I began to believe that video games are a negative influence that have hurt me throughout my life and given me nothing - or very little - in return.

So, I quit video games over the Summer of 2018. Consequently, in my Junior year of High School, which was from 2018-2019, my GPA was much higher, I gradually overcame my depression, and fought against my Porn addiction (without successfully quitting it, though, honestly).

If there is a single Life Hack that will help you to get out of the dark pit that you are currently it, ""brisk-walking"" for one hour per day for six days per week may be it. Your life may improve in other ways as well in addition to overcoming depression.

So, give it a shot. Start out small, perhaps, and just try going on a one hour walk for three days every week. Then, eventually, scale up to six days per week.

I found this lifehack roughly three years ago, and I feel that it would be remiss of me not to share it to as many people as possible who are struggling.

Now, you may be thinking, ""well, isn't it possible that many of the positive effects you experienced, such as quitting video games, a higher GPA, a lessened anxiety, etc, would have happened anyway? Whether you had walked or not? How do you know that walking is what caused your life to improve... could it have been something else?""

Well, for all I know, yes, it could have happened regardless of whether or not I walked consistently, or my life-benefits may have come about because of something else I did. So, to share further, other things I have tried (and currently practice now) are: NoFap, eating a healthy diet, reading fiction and non-fiction books in my spare time.

Let me know if you have any questions; I would be happy to help you.",Anxiety,A REAL Life Hack that will Relieve your Anxiety,2021-03-31 16:57:27

48,fme222,1617169913,1,"Hey, sorry if this ends up long winded and rambel-y. It's almost 2am so I know I'm going to wake up regretting the typo heavy mess written below.  It's sorta a  2 part question  - 
Part 1) My husband has had a history of mostly anxiety and a bit of depression (never diagnosed with either, had a incident in school once that led to police escort out but parents took him to the pastor instead of a Dr and he just kinda kept it to himself since). He gets the usual signs like fast heart rate and days where he's just very withdrawn. But one thing he gets about once or twice a month since we've been married (about 7 months, didn't move in together until married, but he said it's only happened a few times before we were married, not as dramatically, but he also had a less stressful job before we were married) are what I'll just call ""events"" we aren't really sure if they are anxiety attacks or panic attacks? First few times it happened were right after we moved in together and had a few heated arguments in that first month (all super typical petty stuff), but even after we got over that first month or so and got our newly wed pretty arguments out of the way he would be totally fine watching TV or taking a shower when this ""event"" would suddenly happen. It's hard to describe as it's slightly different each time, but he suddenly seems to get very withdrawn, mop-ey, and just like shuts down for 20 minutes. His eyes will be closed, he can't talk or move. If standing he will slowly fall down. Sometimes he says his legs/arms go numb and he cant feel or move them at all (even after he's mentally seems to have back, he will talk to me and ask me to touch his legs or move them but can't feel) or other times they seem numb-ish but also very painful (I assume sorta like when it legs fall asleep, u don't feel the normal sensations, but do feel pain shooting through them). If I try to move him I can see his full body jerk in pain. The episode only last about 10-30 minutes however and then he starts to be back to his normal self. He doesn't like to talk very much about it afterwards, just saying he thinks it's anxiety or work stress getting to him (he's a manager of a large entertainment complex that just opened, very stressful position with 15+ hour days sometimes, works 6 days a week).  Has anyone ever experienced panic or anxiety attacks like this? Has meds or anything helped? 

2) husband said he would like to see a doc about his anxiety/depression, he hasn't seen any pcp  since he had a pediatrician and now he's in his upper 20's. I helped him make an initial new pt visit with my pco who is a PA. He goes, gets blood work (slightly anemic and slightly low vit D) and brings up the anxiety (Unfortunately with Covid I can't be at the apt, so everything I know about the apt I know from what he says, and as much as I absolutely love this man he's never been very good at re-cap details to me lol so this is the best gist I've got of how it went down) and she didn't do a full psych evaluation there, but said she can arrange to do one and get him medication (which he turned down then, but regretted after getting home) or her (and his) preference is to go get a more formal psych evaluation elsewhere. Hubby feels a bit more comfortable with going to a specialist, but we are finding many aren't taking patients or have wait-list 8+ weeks.  We aren't really even sure if we should see a psychologist first or a psychiatrist. Maybe both? Some places require you see a psychologist first before they even let you see the psychiatrist on the next visit. We found a psychiatrist across the street from his work with amazing reviews, but we have to be on a 8+ week wait-list. Another one close to home may be able to see him in 2-3 weeks. Would it be weird to see the closer one now but then still see the other one once a spot opens, then after that decide which to keep with? Do they prescribe meds after just a psych evaluation? If say the first one sees him and prescribed something can the pcp or 2nd psychiatrist continue that med? Would the 2nd one tend to just stick to what med the first gave or would he want to prescribe his own first choice of med? Or do psych evaluations simply just ""confirm"" the anxiety diagnosis to give back to the PCP so that the PCP can now pick a med for you? (I saw a psychiatrist in college to get re-diagnosed for ADHD but my old PCP did all the prescriptions, he simply just re-confimed my ADHD from childhood to adulthood ADHD before she was comfortable re-filling my adderall after I took a break). I know nothing of the normal process and it's so hard not being at the apt with him for me to learn this all first-hand (for stuff like this I'm the one who tends to organize apts and manage stuff, so I feel so out of the loop) 

TLDR: 1) hubby gets 10-30 min episodes where he just shuts down and almost seems paralyzed and/or in pain, is that a symptom of a anxiety attack? 2) pcp wants him to have a pysch eval, what type should he see, can he be on the wait-list for multiple (one to be seen quick vs highly rated with long wait-list), how would meds be handled if he checks out multiple?",Anxiety,Are my DHs near paralysis episodes anxiety attacks?

I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation. I feel very alone in this. My hope is that someone, somewhere can understand where I'm coming from. I'll try to make this as concise as I possibly can!

My Father works and lives abroad and before everything happened in the world, he would come visit us once every month to sometimes once every 2-3 months (it was more to do due with his workload and deadlines). Every single time he would visit, I would get extremely distraught emotionally. Before he moved abroad for work, he lived with us and almost every single day if not every single day the home was filled with huge amounts of negative distressful energy because of him; from arguments, fights, bouts of yelling and lots of emotional and verbal abuse towards me and or my Mother. This went on for 23 YEARS. I have horrible, traumatizing memories of being worken up very early almost every single morning, by horrible and stressful yelling coming from him past my bedroom. I honestly do not know how I managed to live life before he moved out to live &amp; work abroad. Now, every single time I was literally JUST made KNOWN that he's about to come visit us - I would burst out in tears and become very uneasy, extremely anxious and very, very emotionally distressed and distraught. When he'd come visit us, it was the same treatment and I begged and prayed that he'd be normal and pleasent but needless to say that never lasted long (at best - he'd be ""normal"" for 1.5 days at most). When his visits back became very stressful to me, I would literally be in such emotional distress to the point of feeling very, very suicidal every single day of the remaining visit till he'd fly back.

It has been 5 years since he moved abroad but since everything going on, he hasn't managed to visit us in literally 15 months. That is due to many logistic reasons mainly, among others. This time has made me appreciate the time we had apart. I realized that him getting this job to work abroad in general was a blessing in disguise for me because it made me realize that I need this distance for my emotional well being and that of my Mother as well (it is also very hard on her and she's been so much happier apart from him). This wouldn't be the case if he wasn't this emotionally agressive and verbally violent. 

Now I feel it all again because suddenly I was told he can come. I feel very overwhelmed and distraught. I do not want to feel this way. I have literally no where to go and I know I have to just endure it. He doesn't really know I feel this way because he's expressed through these 15 months that he feels SO lonely over there and has no friends and he's all alone without any family. So, he's been extremely stressed to get here for 15 months which makes me feel very guilty to feel the way I do. But I cannot help the way I feel.

I was in Therapy a few years back and mentioned these feelings in the hopes that I could somehow heal and find a way. Although my Therapist was VERY understanding to the way I feel, I still feel lost and do not know what to do other than literally panic and feel very emotionally distraught just knowing he's going to visit us. 

Because of this unhealthy dynamic between my parents, I realized at this age (late 20's) that I never grew up to witness what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. When I was younger, I dreamed of being able to one day have a romantic relationship and would day dream of one day being able to be on a date. However, the last few years I was in Therapy...I realized that all those positive feelings about romantic relationships have gone and now I honestly feel very emotionally distressed even by the THOUGHT of having any romantic relationship. It doesn't bring me any joy. It's to the point where I'd rather be single than even engage in dating. Please keep in mind I have never even gone to a date much less had an actual bf; all of this feels sad to admit at my age. I have honestly lost the desire to date and form romantic relationships. In Therapy when I mentioned this, the very same Therapist was again extremely understanding and compassionate. He even said he does not doubt what I feel and that given the details I shared - he said no WONDER I feel the way I do. Which made me feel less alone. But now I cannot afford Therapy anymore (I haven't gone in literally over a year) and again I feel very stressed because of all of this.

I don't know what to do. 

I wish there was a perfect way to articulate these feelings I had been trying to share above and apart from what I tried to share - the only analogy that comes to mind (emotionally) that's close to my feelings, every single time he visits - it's feels akin to me being visited by my abuser. Which feels horrible to say about my Father. But my immediate physical &amp; emotional reaction is exactly that. I feel the need to burst out into tears like I am being forced to be close to my abuser. Which again, I feel very sorry to even say that.

I would like to be very clear and say I am sorry if I'm coming off wrongly. I love my Father and am very, very grateful for him; he works very, very hard for us. I sincerely hope I do not come across ungrateful in this post. And, I wish I knew what to do when I feel these feelings of such emotional distress &amp; anxiety to the point of having such intense sucidal thoughts and feelings.",Anxiety,PLEASE HELP - What Do To If You Feel Extreme Anxiety &amp; Emotional Distress From A Certain Family Member?,2021-03-31 16:23:54

Basically I‚Äôve had HOCD, zoophile ocd, religious ocd and others but ever since a few weeks again I got this thought, ‚Äúwhat if one day I randomly developed into a pedophile?‚Äù And this caused a major trigger I my ocd because I was TERRIFIED of becoming a pedophile.

A few weeks ago, after one of my shifts, my asthma started acting up really bad. I was wheezing, my body started feeling really week, and I really couldn't do anything too physical without coughing a storm. I told my boss how i was feeling and he told me that I could take as much time as I needed (he's been really nice about it).

That's been about two weeks ago. Last week I was supposed to be on vacation with the fam, but I stayed home because of my sickness. The loneliness really got to me for sure.  And during that week long staycation, I started to develop anxiety and extreme insecurity over my sickness.   

&amp;#x200B;

""What if I go back to work and I end up forgetting everything?""

""I'm so weak for getting sick, I should be better by now.""

""You can't even drive, thats how bad  you feel? You're pathetic.""

Not for me but for himself. Also I‚Äôm looking forward to focusing on me again and peace &amp; quiet though I will miss him very much. 

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll feel 2 weeks from now mostly I want to stay and see if he can overcome this and get healthy and a part of me is drained checked out can walk away :( it‚Äôs a mixture everyday hopefully head can clear when I‚Äôm not around addiction. 

Who has experience with a partner or family member going in for opioid addiction (norcos/percocets) and detoxing off of suboxone?

I don't think my anxiety has done much for my self esteem, but it sure has convinced me that all problems in life hinge on my actions. Obviously its important to try to be a morally good person. But like this morning I kicked a piece of wood from the sidewalk unto some dudes yard and though ""jee I sure do hope that when that guy mows his lawn he moves that stick or it'll set up a final destination like scenario where someone is gonna fucking die.""

I was leaving somewhere and there was this dog in a car with no windows rolled up and I told some people who I knew who weren't leaving the area about it and they promised they'd keep an eye on it and get it out of the car if need be and I ended up just sitting in my car looking at the dog anyway because not only did I want to make sure the dog didn't die the terrible death of being in a car, but I also didn't wanna insult my friends by going back inside. Eventually the owner came back out because she started to worry about it too and so the dog was ultimately fine.

I watched a some videos about political issues today and I thought ""Golly, its a shame the system in my country unjustly benefits people like me, I guess that invalidates all my problems in life and means that I deserve to live my life in unending self inflicted misery, and must dedicate my whole entire life to solving all problems ever, yeah good job thats a fucking helpful mindset""  Like even typing that now it feels like kind of a rational decision. If the world really is so bad why shouldn't I dedicate all possible resources to fixing it, my own goals be damned? Someone told me my problems were still valid today and I laughed at it inside my head, but even then it isn't like I spend all my time, or really practically any of my time doing anything to better anyone else's lot, not that I have the know how at the ripe old age of 19. Should I though? I can't help but feel that in this day and age people my age online know infinitely more about what they ought to be doing than I do, or their acting like it.

I look at the head of my penis and its like the astronaut's helmet, and im like ""Penis? More like penSUS""

So about 6 months ago I moved to Los Angeles in order to further my career. I graduated college with a B.A. in Film and thought that that last year (even through covid) would be the right time to move to LA to work in post production. I grew up in a mid size central valley California city, and even though I always claimed to hate it for this reason or that reason, it's always been home. Even when I moved away for college (Oregon) it felt foreign to me. After graduating college I moved back in with my folks, which was only supposed to be for a few months as I saved money to move to LA, but they ended up going through a pretty nasty divorce in which I felt obligated to help my through as she had to talk to lawyers and real estate agents, and her English being pretty rough. During this time I started seeing a therapist and was eventually diagnosed with depression and major anxiety disorder (I think that's the right wording) and was prescribed Lexapro and Klonopin. Well everything eventually worked itself out and I moved to LA in October. The problem is that even though I've been here through that time, it still doesn't feel *right*. My first week here I had to go into a closet and get into a ball and cry for an hour. I tried setting up a routine to get into, but it still feels foreign, and I still find myself in that closet crying at least a couple times a week. I'm here for work and even though things have been slow, I've been hoping that they'll pick up post covid. It's also been really tough to form a social life in a time where it's nearly impossible to meet new people. If I move back to what I consider *home* I think I'll feel like a failure and I don't know what my job prospects will be as I ended up getting a very specific degree in college.

So I don't really know how to start this apart from with i'm really struggling! Just a bit of background I've been suffering since 2019 with neurological problems that are still under investigation so I'm pretty sure a lot of my anxiety/odd thoughts stem from that I've seen a psychiatrist and a neurologist both are in agreement that plays a massive part but still doesn't make it easier.

Anyway I suffer with pretty bad head pain most days and I feel like that stops me from being in my head? (if that makes sense), I feel almost drunk and floaty and my thoughts feel incredibly loud almost like my imagination is on over drive and I can't turn it off. I'm recently finding that because of that I can't engage in anything anymore for more that 10 mins and I constantly find myself feeling bored and fed up. 

Anyway this is where my anxiety comes in, I'm sure its just lockdown and being away from people for so long but at the moment I""m so scared and keep having panic attacks about 4 times a day about my future and well feeling bored? I'm 26 currently and everyday I struggle to keep myself occupied because of my head but also being trapped inside and doing the same routine day in day out, because of this my brain keeps imaging me in the future feeling the same way, I keep picturing myself at 40 struggling with the same feelings or I find myself trapped in my imagination worrying about fake scenarios where for example where feel bored with my girlfriend and no longer experience any joy from life. Its got to the point I start freaking out about going to sleep in the same bed over and over again every night. Its leaving me terrified about my future and I can't focus on my present anymore as its always in the back of my mind anytime I get a quiet moment. 

Anyway I have no one else to talk to about this and I just wanted to know if anyone else has ever worried about the same thing, about the future and being bored doing the same things over and over until we get old and never feeling happy or content again? I mean I keep telling myself its not true and i've not felt this way for the past 24ish years but it keeps getting harder to believe and I feel like i'm going crazy :( 

P.s. I normally adore life, used to be excited about everything it had to offer, never used to get bored as my mind always had so much to offer, either getting excited to learn or imaging fantasy worlds and the future always seemed so bright as I had a million and one things I used to want to do.

When I woke up the next morning, I must have been having a nightmare or something because I think she was touching the back of my head where my burns were and, out of pure fear, I whipped around and sat up and slapped her hand away, had one hand on the collar of her shirt and the other was in a fist above her head, and I was looking at her ready to attack like some rabid animal thinking someone was trying to attack me or grab me, and she started screaming at the top of her lungs.

Her yelling is what snapped me out of my daze and I finally realized what I was doing. I tried apologizing profusely, saying ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry sweetie, I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you I promise"", but she just kept calling out to her mom and they both stormed downstairs and grabbed her. I stammered trying to explain myself, sa and what happened and instead just went back into the basement and stayed down there all day until I left for work, avoiding all three of them, and crying angrily for most of it.

I ended up finally moving out about a month later and didn't even say goodbye to her because I was too afraid I'd do something on accident again. It took me almost a year before I showed my face around them again, and she didn't even remember who I was. I guess I should be thankful for that.

I don't get those kinds of nightmares much anymore but it's the main reason why I was never in relationships long, even up to now. I was too afraid of hurting someone. But I plan on paying for her college debt anyway, so at least I did one good thing for her.",Anxiety,"Thanks to my PTSD, I once made my niece cry on accident and it still tears me up inside even though she doesn't remember it ever happened",2021-03-31 10:43:52

For the past month or so I have been messaging someone who I adore. We have met once for context. 
We message each other, call each other multiple times every day and I really feel like I‚Äôve developed strong feelings for her (which she has also confessed too) 
The issue I have is that she often reads the messages and then will go hours without replying. It makes me go crazy inside, I start to worry if I‚Äôve said something wrong, if she‚Äôs gone off me etc. I completely overthink things to the point I feel physically sick. If I don‚Äôt hear for her before she falls asleep I have a real hard time sleeping as everything just replays in my head.

I have become sensitive to the sun, phone and computer screens, artificial lights (especially fluorescent lights), and sudden changes in brightness.  These light sources/changes cause me to become dizzy, unable to focus, and increase my anxiety significantly.  I have occasionally become nauseous.  I do not experience headaches due to it as far as I can tell.

It is severely negatively impacting my life.  Whenever this occurs, my anxiety heightens exponentially and I am afraid I will have a panic attack.  It is impacting my school work and social life.

* Hydroxyzine HCL or Pamoate
* Bupropion/Wellbutrin XL

Most Hindus are very tolerant and tbh, guys from my community haven't been helping the case. 

I have friends across all communities and thanks to my dad's job, I've seen more of our country than most and while I do realize a lot of the hate is mostly online and when I go out, people aren't out to kill each other but I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety and unrest.

I see my future in this country and my love for it cannot let me abandon it, but all that I see online remains in the back of my head.

Dunno if this is a trigger warning so I thought that I would just play it safe.

I thought I'd share a weird habit that I've had as long as I can remember. So it used to only occur when my parents were out and were a minimum of 5 minutes later then they had said they were going to be (obviously stuck in traffic or some other minor issue) my brain would just start going through all of the possibly instances, which always ended up with them dying in some outlandish accident I always assumed that this was just normal and part of worrying about loved ones, but I got some strange looks when relaying some of this to friends. I bring this up as yesterday night I was having bizarre thoughts of going to University (I applied the same day and this has been causing stress for me over the past few days) my thought process ended up with me watching helpless as my friends died in random attacks on what I imagined a campus would look like and that I would end up alone.

 I'm mtf transgender so the idea of me having to hide myself is already causing me distress as I don't think anyone would want to be friends with me if they found out (who would want to be friends with some who can barely stand to look in the mirror)? I have always had trouble meeting new people as I'm shy, I prefer to stay silent in the corner at parties but don't like to turn down an invitation as I feel rude, but I don't like not receiving and invite just makes me feel unwanted. 

Loneliness and isolation seems to be the main trigger for this depressing rabbit hole. Is this kind of catastrophizing normal? I'm not sure myself, it makes my current friends uncomfortable so I try not to speak about it (that and I also have major trust issues due to poor experiences with close friends in the past)

The big culprit for me is dishes (and dirty clothes, but we won't talk about that rn). I hoard dishes in my room, then I get anxious about hoarding them, which causes me to get overwhelmed/embarassed about the idea of cleaning it all up and beating myself up for being such a slob, and so it spirals out of control.

What's helped me a lot lately is that every time I leave my room, I take one thing with me. One plate. One bowl. Even just one piece of cutlery. I apply the same rule to garbage and pick just one thing up when I walk by. It helps to gently tackle the issue, especially when I feel too exhausted and overwhelmed to try and do it all at once.

168,nowheremanplans,1617134755,1,"Just want to vent a bit. Went to the park today with my girlfriend and her big group of friends. I was extremely quiet the whole time and left early. I felt in my head and thought that everyone (including my girlfriend ) was thinking that I was a complete freak. Paranoid thoughts that my girlfriend is with me as a joke and that the whole world can see it. This sort of thing is sadly not unusual for me but each time it happens it makes me feel awful. It's frustrating as I, perhaps naively, consider myself pretty good socially. I think I know how to be charming, I think I can be pretty funny etc. but it only seems to show in certain situations. In small groups of 2 or 3 people that I consider safe.  


A bit of backstory before the venting. I am 23 and have been with my girlfriend for 6 months. She is from another country studying here, and we met on Tinder. I don't have many friends (something which plays a big part in the way I feel. I have two fairly good friends from university and one from my job. I don't see them too often as they don't live nearby, I speak to them sometimes but not that often.) I've had feelings of social anxiety and self-doubt for as long as I remember, but it first became a problem when I went to university at 18. Since then I've been trying to 'fix' the issue. The main problems for me are paranoia and self doubt. I feel like I missed out on my youth (which has some truth, I missed the 'teenage experience' of going out when I was in school, though I did have a pretty normal university experience of partying and a group of friends), and I feel a strong panic that I'm wasting my life. I guess there is some belief in me as my worst fear is that I am wasting any potential that I have.  


I can't explain what happened with my girlfriend and her friends. Well, I guess I probably can, it was social anxiety and that's probably all. I remember some tweet saying ""social anxiety is basically conspiracy theories against yourself"" and that's precisely how I felt. Brief moments of 'clarity' where I could 'see' that my girlfriend is with me for any reason other than love or attraction, and that everybody else there knew it and was part of the joke.  


I felt like I am the most boring, airheaded, socially stunted, weakest, and strangest fucker any of them had ever met.  


I had nothing to say and no energy to pretend otherwise. I wanted the ground to swallow me up and for them to forget I was ever there. I wanted my girlfriend to leave me alone but I also felt hurt whenever she did. I wanted the rest of the group to ignore me but then felt hurt whenever they did. I recognise that I was putting them in a position where there was no winning, yet I couldn't even begin to change this (or even know how to).  


I can't be satisfied with just being the quiet one but I also can't be vocal. I felt so in my head. Whenever anyone offered me a road back to social inclusion I felt that it was too risky. I hate the idea of being patronised or that people are taking social pity on me, and I will stubbornly reject any generous offers out of that pride. I am caught between my ego and my anxiety. My anxiety won't let me buy into the idealised version of myself I have such affection for, and my ego won't let me try to build from the bottom up.  


Something that fed into my paranoid thinking was the way my girlfriend seemed to treat me like a child. The way she laughed when I mumbled my response to her friend. Little things but an overwhelming feeling that I am being 'used'. Like I am a  joke that she's only with to help adjust to life in here. I try to counter by thinking that no one would be with someone they view as a joke. But the aggressive response I receive is that I have no real idea what humans are capable of. People have been used like that before and they will be again. People have been cruelly considered less than human and they will be again etc.  


I don't know what the reality is. I am pretty sure that it was all a paranoid nonsense. That no one would do something like that for the simple reason that it would be boring and 6 months is way too long to do that for. That if I did notice anyone looking at me strangely, in a way that flagged them as part of the 'grand conspiracy', it was really them reacting to me acting oddly because I was socially anxious. I tell myself this and it does calm me down.  


What really bothers me is the fact that it happened at all. I feel embarrassed, weak, pathetic, and strange because I reacted so freakishly to a very minor activity that 99 percent of people (in my mind likely not the case) would have no trouble with.  


I don't know how to act now. I am embarrassed to see her friends again as I think they will be thinking that I am a weirdo. I do want to open up to my girlfriend about it but I am a bit scared to do so as I fear she will feel frustrated and lose attraction for me. I feel a strong sense of frustration myself as I have talked about it to everyone close to me for many years, including my girlfriend. It feels neverending and that this will plague me for the rest of my life.  


I also feel guilty as though I've brought this on myself. I worry that I am too self-pitying, that I want this to be the case, that I don't put enough effort in, that I am narcissistic and that's why I think everyone is thinking about me, that I am a little boy who never grew up. Basically that this is my fault.  


Part of me is screaming to go back to therapy, and I do recognise that it is worth another go, but the rest of me is pessimistic about it's chances of helping me as I've been before and not found it too helpful.  


I feel a bit teary eyed because I feel trapped. I feel like I can't hide these feelings. It'd be impossible now anyway as I have not hidden it well, and I recognise that it would not be healthy as I need help. Yet I also don't feel like I can really share these feelings. I don't feel like I have anyone to share with anyway. I am slightly hesitant to share with my girlfriend due to my fears about her losing attraction to me combined with my paranoid thoughts that she is using me and is with me as a joke. I don't feel like I can get any useful guidance from my mum or dad. I don't feel that my sister will be helpful. I am also very hesitant to open up again to the few friends I do have as I don't feel comfortable doing it and I didn't find it too helpful when I've done so in the past. Even if I do open up, I feel like I won't be able to express myself properly and also won't trust the response I get. I just feel completely trapped.  


I don't know what the answer is or whether there is an answer. I don't know what the reality is. I don't feel completely hopeless despite all this, but I just don't know how to move forward with my life. I don't know why I seem to hate myself so much. The only thing that seems to feel right is writing about  it here. I've pretty much run out of things to say but I don't want to finish it as I don't know what I will do next or what I should be doing next. I don't know whether this is a social anxiety attack that I'd do best to ignore and move on, or whether this is yet another wake up call that I can't ignore.  


I feel teary eyed yet I am not really close to tears. It's like I am not fully feeling. It's there but it's foggy and there I don't feel connected to it. I wish I would feel distraught. I wish I could have a big old cry and release this emotion. But I don't feel capable of it and it would feel fake. I feel like I could chuck on the TV or listen to music and probably would be able to forget that it all happened. That feels wrong and I have a vague understanding that I obviously need to do something different. Something healthy. I just have no real idea what that would be.  


So instead what I'll probably do is hide myself away physically and mentally. I'll probably have a conversation about it with my girlfriend where I reveal a sanitised version of what I felt. She'll say I'm being silly and that everyone thought I was fine (including her), and I'll drop it and forget this happened. The feelings will linger with me for the next few days and weeks until I will be unable to recall exactly what I felt. During this I'll ebb and flow between numbing despair and blunted satisfaction. Until one day an invitation like this will come up again and I'll take it, filled with a faithful confidence and an underlying of hidden bold acceptance of the inevitable result, and the same thing will happen. It's a cycle and I don't know how to break out of it. Do I give up taking the invitations? Life would be boring but safe and there is a big appeal to that. But, having lived a large part of my life doing just that, I know I can't and I will force myself to pray for something more. So, once I work up the courage again, I'll take the invite and take my bruising. That seems to be my life.  


I know I'm being dramatic and I know I will feel pretty calm about it all tomorrow (in fact after just an hour or two I feel pretty calm already) but I am absolutely sick of this cycle. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this.",Anxiety,Sick of the anxiety cycle I'm in,2021-03-31 07:05:55

180,coldhoundoom,1617132547,1,"There's symptoms that point to it. 20-30lbs overweight. Eating a lot. Urinating a lot. Occasional numbness/tingling. Possible oral thrush.

But at the same time, I feel like all my symptoms, except for being overweight, can point to other things. Eating a lot was an increased appetite after going on testosterone, then binging and getting used to scarfing down so much. Urinating a lot could be because I drink a lot because of dry mouth (adhd meds) and I'm less tolerant of warm weather (testosterone). The numbness and tingling happens when I sit in odd positions that put pressure on/cut off circulation to the limbs/extremities that go numb. 

The oral thrush I'm not even sure about, I just had a rough past few weeks and didn't brush much so it might be due to that.

Has anyone ever dealt with night sweats from their anxiety?

I‚Äôm scared I have cancer. I‚Äôve been having sudden night sweats since the beginning of the month. My doctor has done a bunch of tests and says nothing is going on and it‚Äôs likely anxiety. 

I have a lump on my collarbone that is squishy and convinced myself it was lymphoma. I have an autoimmune disease that ups my risk of that particular cancer, not by a ton, but still an elevated risk. He ordered an ultrasound of the lump and it came back as fatty tissue. 

I felt better but about a week after this, the sweats started. I get a sweaty, damp chest. Sometimes head. And between my thighs. 

I am very overweight and working to lose my weight. It actually seemed like these started during a night that I wouldn‚Äôt let myself indulge in sweets. Woke up sweating the next morning. Then I ate sweets the night after and woke up sweating again. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say I am DRENCHED. My shirt by the chest is damp upon waking, sometimes my hair and underwear because of thighs sweating. Bedding isn‚Äôt usually too wet. If it is, it dries almost immediately after I get up. 

I‚Äôve been nervous and clammy all day, or cold. I can‚Äôt even tell. I am feeling panicked a lot of the time. Actually my anxiety has been so bad the last few months that I recently started taking Lexapro. 5mg. I‚Äôve been sweating longer than taking the meds so it‚Äôs not that. 

Has anyone hear suffered the same? My dr said that in another month if it‚Äôs still going on, we can do more tests, but he felt extremely confident it is nothing serious. 

My anxiety is very bad. Breathing very shallow all the time. Mind racing to catastrophic thoughts. Like I am convinced/extremely scared I do have cancer. So everyday my anxiety is pretty bad. Constant dread. Etc.",Anxiety,Night Sweats,2021-03-31 05:33:22

195,coltonkemp,1617128989,1,"I‚Äôm a journalism major in my final semester of college. In this class called ‚ÄòMedia as a Social &amp; Ethical Institution,‚Äô we talk about the current state of the media, why for-profit media is killing community journalism and poisoning national news. I literally just love these discussions we‚Äôre doing. The topics are interesting to me.

The only problem is that I am sitting here on this stupid laptop waiting for someone to add something (ALMOST NO ONE EVER DOES), and then the discussion moves on, even though I have a point that I wanted to say. 

Then, I actually do start chiming in and over half the camera off. Anyone actually responding is just the same 2 or 3 people over and over so it feels like we‚Äôre taking up the whole discussion. The teacher starts to guide the discussion to try and get more people involved.

THEN, I start this horrible anxiety.

‚ÄúAm I talking too much?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid that kid just grin?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they laughing at me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they‚Äôre private chatting and making fun of me?‚Äù

THEY AREN‚ÄôT BUT THATS MY BRAIN FOR YA.

So this anxiety eventually wins and I shut up for a little bit. Then, complete silence. No one answers these questions. No one discusses the topics. Most don‚Äôt even have their cameras on. I can not stand the silence; I‚Äôm pouring sweat because I have built this whole scenario in my head and I *know* it isn‚Äôt based in reality.

I just hate these kids man. ‚ÄúWe got our participation for the day; time to turn off the camera!‚Äù Like, why are you guys here?! People probably can‚Äôt get seats in these classes because you jackasses are trying to pass on a technicality?!

NOT TO MENTION, the fact that I get punished for not doing the little weekly synopsis because it‚Äôs mindless, busy work and I just don‚Äôt have it in me most days. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sure they all are done with all their stupid synopses and have shiny A pluses for the semester and will just move on, having not retained anything or expanded their mind at all.

TL;DR: Participation points and mindless work should not determine our grade. The teacher should see who cares and is making and effort and who isn‚Äôt. Kids just suck and I hate it here in this stupid brain of mine.

I don't really know what kind of genre I need to avoid cause now it seems like any movie or show makes me anxious. I loved watching the television when I was a kid and I watched anything and everything... It hurts that I can't really finish any movie or show in one sitting or like ever.


Today I was watching a kdrama that was about how the life of a psychopath serial killer affected those around him. This genre is a trigger for me but I love crime and thriller stuff. Always. I listen podcasts and even watch documentaries. 


But today while I sat and watched a 30 min episode, I tore all my finger nails. I've been trying to grow them for a few months and I even painted each nail a different color... I don't tear till they blead but it feels weird with small painted nails. They look ugly... After the kdrama I decided to watch a movie. It's about a guy who wakes up to a different face/body. I watched the english version of it years ago and I remember some bits and I also remember that I cried a little bit. I couldn't finish the today's movie. I think the thought of it making me cry made me anxious...


I'm just ... I feel so tired every single day from all the anxiety. I have gone for therapy and taken meds too but it's like I know I have to live with it. I know I can control it but I miss my old life. The one escape from reality I had by watching anything is going away from me and I don't know what to do.

214,Readinger31,1617121268,1,"So a technique that‚Äôs often useful to me to manage my anxiety is when I find myself very anxious and worrying (whether about something specific or nothing at all), if it truly doesn‚Äôt need to be dealt with any time soon, I put off worrying about it until a specific day of the week (Saturday for me), then give myself permission to let go of it for the time being.

I find that this allows me to let go a good deal in the moment. And by the time I come around to my ‚Äúworry day‚Äù, I find that the things I was worrying about were so insignificant that they either solved themselves or I forgot about them entirely.

I DON‚ÄôT suggest doing this with problems that need your attention within the next few days, or problems of bigger importance. Otherwise you‚Äôll come to your ‚Äúworry day‚Äù and find your anxiety cranked up to 15/10 as you try to solve a lot of big problems really quickly.

I just need more clarification on How to achieve self-love and growth, in the same direction?

This is my story:

I struggle with decision making a lot, and I know it‚Äôs part of being a human and creating my own life, but I just wanted to share how I‚Äôm feeling and maybe some people will relate to this. (btw, I‚Äôm not native English speaker, sorry if there is any mistakes)

It‚Äôs been 2 years that I‚Äôm unemployed because I had a severe anxiety, very bad symptoms that I don‚Äôt want to share here, but let‚Äôs just say, it stopped me from living a normal life (having a job, going out, living alone, learning something new etc). Now I live with my parents, they have financial issues so it is not like they can pay for my medication easily (I am taking antidepressant)

Here is the thing, I read a lot about neuroscience, growth mindset, on how to unwind anxiety, and it‚Äôs making my life so much better, I feel like I‚Äôm on the right path. Part of unwinding anxiety is to be able to find beauty in making mistakes, it‚Äôs about being curious about life experiences and perceiving failure as a teacher.

But what I struggle with, is finding a job, and finding a job is truly important to me: I ll be able to meet new people, to learn new things, and have my own money to buy things I like and travel where I want, make my dreams come true (in short).

Self-love part of story :

I am recent Marketing graduate, I am not sure If I really like marketing, but I struggled with anxiety and depression during the time I was at school by reason of not feeling like I belong to a certain lifestyle, for example: most students in that school speak French fluently, and I had trouble with that.

At the end it felt as if I am studying to fit in, and to be seen as great, accomplished woman. But I couldn‚Äôt find any joy in it, I got lazy, then thrown myself into bad habits, then got depressed and tried to escape and avoid any action in terms of my career (I hated presentations, I avoided internships and hated all of them). So now I feel like stuck in this choice, cause my parents paid for my school (so much), and I don‚Äôt like it.

Example of job offers I avoid:

I got sales representative job offer in a large company, I don‚Äôt know how the recruiter liked me, because I clearly don‚Äôt have the skills for it.

I said no to this job, and I feel really bad about myself, because I don‚Äôt want to look like ungrateful and immature but at the same time, I can‚Äôt be very unkind to myself, I am literally taking medication for ignoring how I feel.

She got up from the sofa to get a glass of water when she suddenly felt nauseous, holding her stomach in an effort to try not to vomit. Right then, she started feeling dizzy and stumbled back, falling onto the sofa. She lay there, confused. She was alright just moments ago, what happened? But this was just the beginning. The beginning of the end. She looked up at the ceiling and realized that nothing appeared clear, even though she had glasses on, things still looked blurry and out of focus. Her arms and legs began tingling and feeling numb simultaneously, as though someone were repeatedly shoving thin needles through every pore of her limbs. She started shivering, trying desperately to hold herself together but then began having hot flashes and sweating seconds later. She was completely out of breath and either hyperventilated or gasped as if someone cut off her supply of oxygen. She tried to get up off the sofa, but she physically could not. She was like a writhing corpse. She tried to move her face but realized she couldn‚Äôt even do that. She felt like she was having a stroke, half her face felt paralyzed - frozen and numb. She was crying so hard that her entire face was red and tears kept streaming down. Her entire body continuously convulsed, and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She would try to stop shaking for a second, but then it would just start back up again mere moments later. The constant uncontrollable muscle spasms were tiring her out. She kept wondering if the madness would ever end. She tried to fall asleep, balled up on the sofa, hoping every second that she could just close her eyes and wake up the next morning. What she would have done for a tranquilizer, right then and there. For four more hours, this went on, until she fell asleep. Four hours of agony where death would have felt like blessing from this hell she was trapped in. The next morning, she woke up in severe pain.

228,mustnotsleep--,1617118353,1,"I tried posting this in a few other subs and it got deleted. I figured this might be a good place to share it.

In early 2020, I started a CBD/hemp business. I'd been making CBD products for myself, family, and friends for years, it was something I was passionate about and spent years learning about, so I figured I would try turning that into something bigger. I'm disabled, have never been able to work a typical job, and I needed something to do with my time, plus a way to bring in some kind of income would be great. I've never been able to feel like I contribute in any way. My wife and I have been eager to start a family, we've only been waiting for more stability before we bring a child into the world.

I only saw positives in my decision to start up. I'd be making options for affordable, high quality cannabinoid products available to those who rely on them, helping my own mental health by doing something productive with my days, and taking stress off of my wife (and myself) by bringing in a bit of a second income. I figured this would either take off or it wouldn't. The worst that could happen is nobody is interested in our products, right?

I was wrong. *Very wrong*.

It started slow. We were only using whatever we could save after rent, bills, food, etc to build the business, and it was only my wife and I. Once we had enough product ready and our website set up, we started posting on Facebook, Instagram, etc. For the first few months, we got 2-3 sales per month, usually family, friends, or people that friends/family refered to us. Over the next 6 months, that grew to about 1-2 orders per week.
I absolutely loved talking with customers. People were interested in our products, wanted to learn more, wanted to know about us, why we started, how CBD works, which products would be best for them, etc. Things were going great, but we weren't seeing much growth. While I loved what I was doing, I knew we needed to grow for the business to survive long term.

I partnered up with a few small farms and started offering hemp flower. Customers had been asking for it since we opened. We stayed away from this originally due to the stricter restrictions on selling flower, payment processors not accepting hemp flower vendors, and a few other reasons. In the end, we weighed the pros and cons, decided to work through the cons, and made it work.

Our mission has always been affordability, so I did this in a way that made the most sense at the time: work directly with the farms during the growing process, harvest, dry, cure, and trim our own flower. This means we were saving around 75% of what we would be paying for cured, trimmed, retail ready hemp flower buds by doing the work ourselves.
Throughout the fall (September-November) I spent every other week at the farm working. My wife stayed home because she works a separate full time job, and to keep up on any orders we got when I was away.
This allowed us to offer high quality flower at a lower price point. 

I was proud. Legitimately proud of myself, probably the first time in my life I've allowed myself to feel that. We weren't making a huge profit, we weren't big, but you know what? I'd wake up to emails thanking me for what I do. People would tell me how our products have helped them. I was doing *something* after nearly 25 years of thinking I never would. This was the absolute best couple months of my life and I would give anything to go back to this.

December 2020. We had released a new strain for pre-order, scheduled to ship out on Nov. 30 - a strain of hemp flower high in THCa. I posted about this on a subreddit dedicated to these strains. I didn't realize the how many people would be interested. Before the end of the week, we had received over 300 pre-orders. Here's mistake #1. I should have immediately closed orders. I have *no idea* the amount of work it takes for two people to package up this many orders. I told myself, ""it's okay, we can handle it. We have time"".

For the most part, we did. We worked 12-16 hour days, we got the packages shipped out by Dec. 2. A little bit late, but we did this as quickly as we possibly could while allowing a few hours for sleep. Then, I started getting emails that packages were stuck in ""pre-shipment"" status on tracking. We bought the labels through our website and scheduled   USPS pick-ups. We waited a few days. Still, about half of the packages weren't scanned. After a week or so, some people reached out to let me know they received the package even though tracking never updated. Still, I had around 40 people emailing that they hadn't received anything and tracking hadn't updated.

We decided to give it 3 weeks before sending a replacement in case they were stuck somewhere and would still be delivered. A few few of them were, but no luck with the majority of them.
USPS couldn't tell us anything since tracking never updated. It was pretty much ""Yeah that happens sometimes. Sorry. Good luck"".
We had to process around 35 replacement packages  on top of our regular workload, sending out thousands of dollars worth of product that we had already shipped out, and get back to too many emails to count every day. 90% of the time it was only myself working - my wife was busy at work.

I got extremely overwhelmed. Every day, I'd get new emails that someone didn't receive a package. I was behind on shipping replacements as is and they kept piling up. I got behind on regular orders. After taking a huge hit financially due to this, I couldn't close orders. I had to keep something coming in to keep the business afloat. On top of that, packages were *still* going missing. We started going in and handing the packages to postal worker personally. Still, we had packages not being scanned.

Customers were mad, understandably. When they called USPS themselves, they were told ""This just means the seller printed a label but hasn't shipped the package"". Posts were popping up on Reddit, people began speculating if we were running some kind of scam. I explained the situation, I posted almost weekly with updates, I was trying to be open with everyone. I posted notices on here, and in 3 places on our website, explaining the delays and added a 5-7 business day processing time so people wouldn't order from if they needed something urgently. I hoped people would see all of this and only order from us if they didn't mind waiting longer than average.

I was working almost 24/7. I had no schedule, I didn't sleep. I took naps here and there for an hour or two - usually when I'd fall asleep at my desk after being awake over 48 hours.

During this, my mom died from Covid-19. Not long after, on a trip to the farm, I tripped and dislocated my knee that I already had surgically repaired in 2018. I walked on the injury for a couple weeks before seeing my orthopedic surgeon, finding out I likely tore most of the repairs, and will need the surgery done again. The first time I couldn't walk independently for over 4 months, I didn't have full function of my leg for over a year.
Finding out that I needed to go through this again was essentially the straw that broke the camels back. I was done. I had been pushing back any thoughts of my mom, I didn't let myself grieve or process the loss until this point.

I closed orders and stayed in bed for nearly 2 weeks. I had work to do, but I didn't care. I didn't care if people were mad. Truthfully, I didn't care to live, let alone keep my business running. I entirely lost my passion for CBD and hemp. I slept 14+ hours daily, would wake up to customers telling me I'm pathetic, I'm disgusting, that I should give up, that I make this entire industry look bad, among other things. I had people finding personal information about me and threatening to post it on Reddit. I still do. 

A few days ago, I was called a f**g*t, told ""you've pissed me off, now you'll learn a lesson"" by another CBD/hemp vendor. People have posted ""buyer beware, don't buy from them"", ""they're a scam"" etc in every subreddit we've ever posted in and on our older posts. Just last night, I logged into instagram for the first time in months and I had been tagged in the comments of multiple posts, such as a post where another company was talking about shipping orders out same-day. Someone tagged me and said ""take notes, you could learn something from this"". People have been picking apart everything we do/say, even going so far as posting about the business name because it has the word ""honest"" in it. They say we wouldn't have chose that if we were actually honest.

I did eventually get back up. I got help, I got into grief counseling, got back to work, but I still don't have my passion for this back. We're still working on catching up. People are still mad.
We brought on a couple people who have business experience and they took over for customer service and management, but it's taking time to get things back on track. I'm starting to think we won't be able to.

When you google our name, these ""buyer beware, scam"" posts come up. Any positive review about us is downvoted. People are disputing their orders even after they've received it. Anyone who says anything good about us is attacked. I can't even attempt to explain myself, because I'm hit with ""why are you on here instead of working?"" Or ""lol it's always a sob story with you, just ship the shit out! Not too hard to put stuff in a box.""

I shouldn't have let emails go without a response. I shouldn't have slept my life away for weeks without shipping packages. I made mistakes, but damn. I'm not sure if I do deserve the hate I've got. I feel like I deserve criticism, I deserve to be held accountable for what I've done, but the personal attacks are excessive.

Lesson learned: When you're struggling, tell someone. Don't wait until it gets to the point that you're stuck in a deep depression. Reach out. There's no shame in needing help. There's no shame in admitting you're not doing good.
If I could have told *anyone* how much I was struggling, I could have had this entire situation resolved months ago. I could have gained some trust back, I could have kept my passion for my work. I wouldn't have countless people convinced I'm running a scam.

And of course, this fear has progressed into, maybe close family and friends (that I've never been afraid of eating in front of before) have misophonia and they didn't tell me so if I eat around them maybe they want to murder me.

And this fear has progressed even more because are people murderously angry at hearing me drink water too? I've been sneaking water in the bathroom at work.

This all sounds ridiculous and I know that but it really is becoming a problem in my life. I've been not eating at work because of this fear. I work an active job as a housekeeper (part time due to mental health) and I passed out yesterday afternoon because I was afraid to eat on my break and I had only snuck one glass of water.

Please give me an idea for how to conquer this fear because I've tried just reasoning with myself and I'm not getting anywhere.

So, I just started dating this guy last August. He's amazing and fun and the exact opposite of my ex. There's absolutely nothing about him I don't like and we are both very serious about each other. I have a therapist and am taking Prozac and I'm working on dealing with all of my issues regarding my self-worth and everything like that. I grew up in a verbally and physically abusive household and my ex (who I was with for 8 years from the time I was 16) was emotionally abusive to me. I'm still recovering from all of that.

My biggest struggle so far with my current bf is that I don't have any confidence in myself at all. Any time we have any issues that I cause, I regress to this feeling that he's going to leave me. We never fight, thankfully, and just talk things through, but it still doesn't stop these negative thoughts from overwhelming me that he is going to hate me because I make mistakes and am not perfect. I have ADHD and that has been my experience with most relationships (romantic and otherwise) so it's what I expect. And it gets to the point where I actually feel sick with worry. It bothers him, but I'm honest about it and express how I'm feeling and why. He's extremely supportive and understanding.

I just don't know what to do. I'm taking the pills. I talk to my therapist. I know that he will make his own choices and worrying about it when small things happen doesn't help, but it's intrusive thoughts that tell me I am annoying, and worthless, and awful, etc that play over and over in my head any time he gets even slightly annoyed with me. Anger and annoyance that I cause someone else translate for me, emotionally, that they are going to just leave me and that I will deserve it.

My therapist wants me to practice ""mindfulness"" which she described as letting a thought come and go without dwelling on it. I'm trying but haven't really been successful yet.

I have online friends - some are just people in my Twitter timeline who I just meme a bit with, and others are close friends who we play games, support each other, watch videos together, mail packages to each other, and I hold them dearly. Whenever there is conflict with them (Whether I am at fault, or the other person is) I get crippling anxiety that is so bad I cannot do anything productive and feel physically sick. This goes for IRL friends too, but I just left highschool and went to college during quarantine so I did not have irl friends at the moment to use as examples right now.

The most recent event is being ignored by a now-previous 'mutual' who I felt close to and enjoyed his company. I understand we were not close by any means, and just ditching me out of no where with no fault of my own means it was a good thing for this person to have left me as they are problematic, but it still tears me up inside. It gave me harsh stomach pain and the anxiety was so devastating. 

Normally this can last up to two weeks with a minimum of three - ish days. I was able to cope better than usual because 1- we were not as close as other people who left me were (Most proved to be toxic to other people later on, I mean it IS Twitter, so I know the reason people leave me is most likely not a fault of mine) 2 - I have two good friends who we are now on discord together and we do a plethora of stuff together, 3 - I have an idea of why he left and it involves a clash I had with another person online (I do not believe I am in the wrong at all in that scenario).

I just want to re-iterate this phenomena happens to my IRL friends too, otherwise I'd just not talk to people online. Most recent I had irl friends from my previous job suddenly vanish in August, they blamed me for... Generalized behavoir and did not say anything specific, and looking back on our relationship it was so toxic and hurt me. As in showing me unsolicited porn and using slurs for a minority I am apart of. Even still, losing these horrible people hurt me in ways so bad I became dysfunctional.

My few ideas of this phenomenon is 1) I was heavily abused as a child and made to feel that everything wrong was my fault, and this is a remnant of that thinking. I also used to have a deep fear of being abandoned, so this also may reside in my mind somewhere.

2) I am atypical. I have Aspergers, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and more that I believe are irrelevant for this post.

I did 4 days of work, clean up and helping with reno on a small bathroom from a house built in the 60‚Äôs. The first day I showed up the walls had already been taken out and there was screwing in the gypsum ceiling, dust was falling all over the place. 2nd day new gypsum was put over the old one so some dust flying around, 3rd and 4th was setting up the tub and floor. 
The home owner was wearing no mask and had his kids over after school, the guy I was working with/ for was only wearing a thin cloth mask, I had a p100 3 of the 4 days, a p95 the other day, it‚Äôs what I had at home. They seemed zero worried so I followed their lead, I‚Äôm no expert, just a helper. Everyday when I‚Äôd finish I dusted off and threw my stuff in garbage bags (I‚Äôm also an artist so I‚Äôm always weary of dust) and drove home in my work clothes. Get home, straight to the washroom, threw my stuff in the wash and took a shower. I was mainly doing the work for research, I‚Äôm a painter and wanted to learn to redo a bathroom since I have to redo mine soon. In doing more research I‚Äôve learned to what extent asbestos is everywhere especially in houses built in the 60‚Äôs in Quebec. I got a flash of the guy I was working with saying, careful, that‚Äôs the old stuff when I was working on the ceiling. I checked in with him recently and he said that yea, it may very well have been asbestos but that it‚Äôs fine because we were wearing masks, he‚Äôs old school. This sent me into a total panic, research says that washing your asbestos clothing contaminated all your clothes and shoots particles everywhere! We had the air tested and the guy told us we were at 0.026 particles that seemed like asbestos. When I asked what he meant by ‚Äúseemed‚Äù he said they were black (75% of my clothing is black) and we had been running washes non stop for 3 days straight. He then tried selling me on some negative pressure thing and told me that I had to send him everyone who was in contact with the job site, seemed like a scare tactic.

I'm not sure how I'm supposed to start, so I guess I'll just begin somewhere.

I finished school about 2 years ago, after that I went abroad to study a new language for a year and I guess I was sort of hoping to see that I'd be able to re-invent myself and find new friends. However, I didn't really do any of that. At some point I was just constantly at my apartment, doing nothing really. And somehow I managed to get through an entire year of basically just that.

I met people in my class and there was a really nice girl I became 'friends' with (we don't talk anymore though, I'm not big on texting so with her living in another country it just didn't work), but my anxiety kept pushing me to think that none of them really liked me. I've always had this problem, even with my lifelong best friend where I almost started to sabotage our friendship, thinking it was going to end either way.

Now to my current problem: I've been trying to get myself to enroll in university, I was just always unsure of what I wanted to do, but lately I've had some more time to think and I came to the conclusion that it's probably just because I'm too afraid of meeting new people. I take ages to really get comfortable with someone and I'm too insecure in my talents up to the point where I gave up on dreams because I thought I'd never be able to do something like that anyways. 

Somewhere in my mind I know that it's just the anxiety talking, but how can I get myself to believe it? I love learning new stuff and making things, but if it's not perfect on my first try, I'll just think I'm too untalented.

My anxiety has been at its peak for a while now, because I need to do something, but instead I spend every day distracting myself and procrastinating as much as possible.

I guess I don't really know what I'm trying to say or get out of this, but has anyone had a similar experience? What did you do to start actually doing something?

255,Itseffingcold,1617107761,1,"I thought it was completely normal feel that tight feeling in my chest when I was ""uncomfortable"" when people would approach me and trust me with help they knew I was capable of doing.

Every time someone would invite me to go somewhere I would get upset internally and fear the results, or if I did go I would clam up and not be able to focus the person I was with, but with all of the noise and surroundings that were triggering me.

It affected my sex life too, I couldn't commit to any women because when it came time to get intimate, I would fear nothing but what could go wrong. That I wasn't good enough, that I would get an STI, or that the protection would fail. It lead to me not taking chances in the effort of furthering my relationships, which caused relationships/friendships to fail.

My hobbies also suffered, all I could do was dwell on what would go wrong, or if things didn't go to plan. My video game systems collected dust because every time I picked up the controller all I could think about was all of the time I was ""wasting."" The same went for my car hobby, I never wanted to wrench on anything because of the fear of being unsuccessful, so I just... didn't indulge myself. 

Right before the pandemic started, I decided it was time to talk to someone about what was going on, I knew what I was experiencing wasn't normal because my relationships with friends/co-workers wouldnt develop, because I always physically felt terrible, like I was always on the verge of a panic attack.

I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety, and treated with an SSRI.

The doctor said it would take a few weeks to really feel anything from the medication, but after the first dose I started to... feel again. I felt warm and fuzzy inside, thusly, I felt relaxed. My feelings of being self conscious disappeared, my worries around time consumption vanished, and I was able to start focusing on what made me happy and not just feeling like a burden to others.

My only regret is that it took up until my 30s to decide to get help, I sit here and think about how much different my time at university would have been had I seeked out help, had I recognized that I could improve my life with the help of others and modern medicine, my life would probably be so much different today. I would have taken more risks, had a more fruitful career at this point, had more romantic encounters, and had developed much more quickly.

To anybody reading this, if you have anxiety, if you have depression, I know how hard it is to accept it, I know how difficult it is to want to go out and find help, but please; do yourself a favor and find someone to talk to.

I love it!), find a doctor to just evaluate you, find a therapist to explain what is going on in your mind day to day, and don't give up when it gets hard to deal with.

259,CausticTies,1617107276,1,"So this post may or may not be comprehensible but I'm freaking the fuck out right now. Basically, I go to uni in the UK, but with COVID and everything, I've been studying at home in another country. So as you know, the clocks changed recently (around the 13th) which I WAS NOT AWARE OF... so there I was, about 2 hours away from the deadline, typing away thinking all was good... when I suddenly felt the urge to double check the UK time on google. 

Yep, that's when I freaked out. The deadline was no longer 2 hours away, it was ONE. And I had only just started the bibliography (the actual content was mostly typed out). So when I realized this, I tried as fast as I could to get everything formatted properly and what not, and somehow I managed to submit it BUT ONE MINUTE LATE. So I knew I was screwed there and then because late submissions are capped at 40% over here...which in other words, means I just fucked myself over and the three years of hard work I put into this degree. Not only that, I have a postgraduate offer that hinges on me getting an overall first (70%+). So I've fucked over my future too.

Anyway, so as I'm freaking out, I double check the submission I made and...well shit... in the midst of all the panic I SUBMITTED THE WRONG DOCUMENT. Specifically, I submitted a final draft that did not include the word count stated at the front (instead i just used yellow asterixes as a placeholder). This is a double fucking whammy because resubmissions were disabled for that assignment. So that was when I started sending rapid emails to the department trying to explain my situation and I gave them the correct document, basically begging them to understand my situation. It's now close to two hours and they still haven't replied. I know I am fucked because usually they respond pretty quickly, and I'm sure I must be popular over there because I constantly ask for extensions due to my anxiety. So yeah, this deadline I missed was actually an extended deadline. 

What's more, I never actually bothered to check the wordcount before submission (excluding tables etc... you know the drill) as I was going to do it last, but SOMEHOW, I was something like 800 words under. Even though I could swear I wrote more than that. So yep, today's list of failures include: submitting late, submitting wrong doc, and writing too little without even knowing it.

Don't know why I'm posting this here, but I guess I just wanted some reassuring words as I feel like I'm having some sort of breakdown. I feel so stupid and irresponsible, and I know my parents are gonna kill me. But worst of all, is the feeling of dread inside me (as most of you are all too familiar with), except this time, this feeling is certainly not irrational.

277,Elizaaaz,1617096990,1,"I‚Äôve thrown up in the shower twice before in the past few months. At least the first time it was because I was in there for too long and got dehydrated. The second? Probably a mixture of that and the anxiety. This was pure anxiety.

I take showers for too long sometimes. I was just in with hot water for an hour and a half because I lost track of time, then I started to feel a tad dehydrated and nauseous. I totally worked myself up. ‚ÄúOh god, what if you puke in the shower again?!‚Äù Every time I thought it, I got more nauseous, which made the though worse. Vicious cycle. 

Eventually I had the water off and I was crouched on the floor of the shower trying to will it away (I knew that the anxiety was making it worse, but I had no idea how much) it didn‚Äôt work and I threw up. And again. And again. The last two times, I called my mom to help me (literally called her phone cause I couldn‚Äôt yell for her cause I was throwing up. I‚Äôm 17 btw) and this time, I wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to. I figured I‚Äôd be okay. Every time I thought the thought of ‚Äúokay, we‚Äôll get through this and we won‚Äôt have to call mom to come get us from the shower again at 4AM‚Äù I threw up again. I think I threw up like fifteen times honestly. 

I grabbed my phone. I clicked call. She picked up. *Immediately the nausea was gone.*

I had to tell her that I threw up in the shower again, she came in, I explained the situation including anxiety, and... she worried over what the steam might be doing to the walls, asked if I could rinse the shower myself, then went back to bed. She just walked away. She‚Äôs gone. *I had so much anxiety that I threw up several times, and she just walked away.* I know it‚Äôs 4AM, I get it, but seriously? I‚Äôm your daughter. Shouldn‚Äôt you show even a modicum of interest? Care just a sliver about the fact that I just had so much anxiety over waking you up or having to be without you that I THREW UP IN THE SHOWER?! Really?! I love my mom, but she really doesn‚Äôt understand the anxiety stuff. 

I rate my days. I have a 1-5 star paper (labeled ‚ÄúHow was your experience today?‚Äù Or something cheesy like that) taped to the wall by my desk where, at the end of each day, I mark how good it was. I highly recommend this btw, it‚Äôs helpful to be able to see that I‚Äôve had more 3s or more 4s recently and that I have far more 5s than 1s. I have like ten 5s, fifty 4s, sixty 3s, twenty or twenty five 2s and literally two 1s. I‚Äôm adding a third 1. Today was a 1. 

I‚Äôm so not gonna sleep tonight, am I? I‚Äôm still shaking. Why am I still shaking?! FUCK ANXIETY. I HATE THIS. WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY HAVE DONE TO DESERVE THIS. NOTHING. NOBODY DESERVES THIS SHIT. IT GETS BETTER AND THEN IT JUST GETS WORSE ALL OVER AGAIN. NOTHING WORKS. IM A MESS.

Haha, sorry, that was a lot. Long story short, now I know what causes that nausea to be so bad. Anxiety! And next time I‚Äôm worried about throwing up, I can come up with another solution because now I know the real problem. (Me. I‚Äôm the problem.) Thanks for fucking reading.

Here we go.

I‚Äôve been struggling to get on my feet ever since I graduated high school. I went off to college in 2015 and lasted a grand total of one semester and lost an $80k scholarship which I still beat myself up about to this day. A lot of shit happened fast forward to 2018 where my mental health is just garbage and I end up spending 70 days on 3 different mental institutions (the 3rd of which I credit saving my life) ever since tben ive been trying to get on my feet and be able adult. I recently moved out to the outer banks of NC with my dad and started looking for jobs and finally got one on the field that I love (mental health) which I had been working in off and on since leaving college. The money (as in per hour) was great however my company was having trouble finding clients in the middle of a pandemic so I went back to looking for jobs, found a retail job. Good hours, work was pretty decent, had cool coworkers but it was just a seasonal job until after Christmas. Oh and also right after I started I got Covid so missed 2 weeks after working there for like a week and a half. After that I was down to 0 clients and no job again. Eventually my company found me a client and right before I started with him my grandmother in Alabama died so I had to go to her funeral (against my whole families better judgement but we were kind of bullied in to it and my dad is a pastor and had been writing out his mothers funeral since her health started declining a few years ago and his brother and sisters wanted nobody but him to do the funeral) so after that I have to quarantine again for 2 weeks. While in Alabama I was still firing off applications and got hired by an elder care agency that wanted me to start as soon as I got back. I was happy about this cause they assured me they had lots of clients and I figured elder care is somewhat similar to what I have been doing with the kids with disabilities I work with so I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. When I got back I did all my online training and stuff and after 2 weeks I got started with 2 clients right out the gate. Both clients were only authorized 3 hours a day and one did 5 days a week and one did 3 and it was about an hour commute one way...so still wasn‚Äôt perfect and I still needed more hours and stuff but I figured if I stuck with it and did well they would give me more clients. About two weeks in the 5 day a week client goes to the hospital for saying a lot of alarming things and I haven‚Äôt really been updated on him since. So at that point I‚Äôm working just 9 hours a week. Then I get a big break and am told they found me a client who needs 24/7 care and the shifts will sometimes be 12 hours and sometimes be 24. So I work my first 12 hour shift with him and things are great and the lady the next day calls out so I work with him again then. That leads to this week which was supposed to be my biggest break and biggest week since high school. My schedule was supposed to be Monday from 6:45am to noon on Tuesday then back at 8pm Tuesday to 8am Wednesday then Wednesday Thursday Friday I work with my other client 1-4 and Thursday I also work the 12 hour 8 to 8 shift. Well as soon as I got there Monday morning it was not good. Hardcore hallucinations and wanted everybody out of his house including his wife and I. Client ends up calling the cops who come and we explain the situation to the cops and they get him to agree to go to the hospital to which I think I will be going with them and staying through the whole process, then the wife tells me she doesn‚Äôt want me getting paid $20 an hour (which I don‚Äôt even come close to making) to sit around at the hospital doing nothing...that really upset me. They have seen my beat up car pull up to their multi million dollar sound side home. They  know a little of my story from what I shared in my interview with them so they know I need these shifts. Long story short this week was supposed to be my big break working 60+ hours and instead I was there for 2 hours and that was it. So I‚Äôve gone from working 60 plus hours this week to about 11... I‚Äôm tired of being a bum and mooching of my parents who are also struggling. I‚Äôm trying so hard to get on my feet and be an independent adult but it‚Äôs so fucking hard. I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take. I try and try and try and bust my ass to be as good as I possibly can for these clients (one actually loves me and his daughter tried to give me some gift cards but I couldn‚Äôt accept them as per company policy) it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying so hard and I just keep getting dicked by the universe. I feel bad for being angry towards my clients wife but I am. I‚Äôm upset that I feel this way cause I‚Äôm not usually an angry person but the fact that I bust my ass and do all I can to help and then when given an opportunity to help me a little bit by letting me just stay with them through this whole process she tells me to just go home cause she doesn‚Äôt want me getting paid to sit at the hospital doing nothing...I kind of understand that but also like...the money I would make for that shift this lady wipes her ass with...it‚Äôs so frustrating. I try to be a good person and help people even at my own expense sometimes abd I just keep getting fucked at every turn. I don‚Äôt know what else to do and I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôm 24 with no skills, no assets, nothing. I want to be independent and live on my own (which will be hard enough given the fact that I have severe adhd and am on the spectrum) but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever in my life be able to afford to. I had to just get all of this out and it‚Äôs probably just a jumbled mess of words but...yeah....if anybody read all the way through this there are so many more minor details here and there and if you would like to know more when I have actually thought about it instead of just typing out whatever pops in my brain then I would be more than glad to talk about it.

284,ShahZaZa,1617092848,1,"Hi all,

I'm 26 y/o male and there is something that I should get off my chest. When I was in my teens, I was always a very ambitious person, who was prepared to work very hard to get what he wants. I was on a good track by successfully graduating from college and I was ready to take the next step at University.  However, I decided to quit my plans because my ex-girlfriend from that time said several times that our relationship wouldn't work anymore if we were both too busy studying. I also ran out of money back then, so it was harder and harder to meet up with her. I was afraid that I would lose her so I made the stupid decision to get a job so I would have more time for her and save up to eventually live with her together. I actually found a pretty okay job, that paid well and aligned with my interests.  Sadly my ex-girlfriend broke up with me a year after my decision. I know it was a poor life decision, but in my own defense, I was madly in love with her and I had my first long-term relationship with her. 

After the break-up, I seriously considered quitting my job and go back to university, but I decided to remain in my current position because I have a well-paying job for my age and during times of a pandemic it's very ungrateful to quit a job like this. Still, I felt like I was stuck and I felt like a failure because I wasn't in the position that I wanted to be, I was desperate for change and I wanted to move forward. My anxiety got worse and worse during COVID and I started to doubt literally 'everything' about myself to a point I almost got a mental breakdown. I thought it was because I wasn't moving forward in my life while my friends did, so I decided it was time to move out of my parent's house to rent an apartment and live on my own. Back then, I was convinced it was the right decision and that I would feel better about myself if I was self-sufficient and not dependent on my parents anymore. Sadly, things didn't get any better... 

I've always been somewhat of an introvert so the thought of being alone a lot of times didn't scare me, but  I was wrong. My self-destructive thoughts doubled by being alone and my anxiety got much worse because I don't have anybody to talk to anymore. I thought I would feel freer but that also isn't the case, because COVID measures worsened just after I rented the apartment and haven't improved since, so I didn't get the opportunity yet to invite friends or family. My workplace launched a 100% work-at-home policy, which means I don't get to see my colleagues and I'm constantly stuck in a place that doesn't feel like home at all. And there is of course also the financial freedom that's diminished, I understand that this is normal if you have to pay the rent on your own, but it's the third month now that I had to get money from my savings account.

The deep regret of quitting my studies to find a job has arisen again and I'm constantly mad at myself for choosing this life. It's been only 6 months since I moved in and being constantly alone and my self-destructive thoughts are getting me to a breaking point. Moving on my own hasn't brought me any happiness at all, and tbh I wish I was brave enough to just leave the apartment and move back in with my parents to continue my studies, but on the harder hand, I'm afraid for my friends and family's reaction, who will all rightfully say that I'm ungrateful.",Anxiety,Want to leave my appartement after 6 months,2021-03-30 19:27:28

I am not sure if this is something that is often talked about in this community however I need opinions on a benzo prescription.

Bit of back story, I've been dealing with anxiety and frequent panic attacks for a large portion of my life (5-6 years) and I've been taking Prozac to try and deal with my depression aswell as my anxiety, good news is that it helps my depression, bad news it doesn't help my anxiety. I frequently meditate and have a solid breathing routine that is practiced nearly every day. I'm in therapy to deal with it and my mental health. I've even gone to the lengths of getting healing crystals and hippie oil (doTerra or something).

I've recently got my hands on hemp seed oil hopefully that works. (The doctor won't give me any benzo prescription because I am under 18)

I'm about to move on with a good friend of 5 years. The apartment is rent controlled.
Were both studying but she has two part time jobs. I'm still looking for a summerjob and I have a lot of experience in costumer service and know different languages which is always a plus. I've searched EVERYWHERE and even got two upcoming interviews.

I've made some calculations and we should be just fine as long as I find work (still got time to do that), plus we can still receive some government support as students.

My parents were furious about this but after going through everything during this last weekend, stressing and packing, I feel pretty confident.

Plus in my country Finland we're on a good way with vaccinating the population, so this summer the situation might change drastically.

How do you deal with taking chances, and how do you trust yourself even if it falls apart?

288,Nestling379,1617091738,1,"It's a long story, but I've always had low self-esteem. I can't draw, I'm not athletic, I'm not easy to talk to and outgoing, I have become more judgmental over the past few years, and I'm not in any kind of extracurriculars. I never have been, tbh. Not debate club or volleyball or violin or anything. I'm not very creative. In English class, the other students always wrote so much better than me on the spot and I don't even know where they got that ability from especially when they don't have much practice writing or reading. I'm not especially smart at math or science. I always feel anxious during labs and my motivation to do my schoolwork has been steadily declining over the years. 

Needless to say, I feel like I have a poor personality. As if there isn't really anything inside me to get to know... As if I don't bring anything to the table other than being ""nice"", but everyone is nice. This is a painful realization because I never really intended to be this way. When you're a shy and quiet person like me, there is an even bigger urge to compensate by secretly being a really cool person. So, if I'm not able to do anything to differentiate myself, then I must have low worth, you know? It makes me quite sad. 

There used to be a version of myself who I liked years ago, the person I was around my best friend. But now, I've become stagnant. I don't feel like a living person even around her anymore. I don't have any real opinions on anything. I try to be a person as much as I can, but I feel like it isn't enough. Because anybody can follow a recipe, read a book, or learn how to knit.

This did have a profound impact on me, where saving up and not splurging has been my primary mode of operation.

Unfortunately a lot of this has carried over to my adult life and marriage. I am particularly addicted to deals (spend hours on Slickdeals and other websites, hunting for coupons) and get a dopamine high when I end up buying something at a deep discount.

* Buying clothes (even below 20$) or shoes? Gotta wait until a sale goes up!
* Looking to upgrade some much needed tech like a keyboard? Search and compare all websites for hours and days to see where the best deal comes up.
* Buying food? Gotta see if that Subway accepts a coupon for a 8$ sub.

I am pretty certain that every purchase &gt; 10$ has come off coupons or discounts.

This is my second time making this post, I apologize, but  I really want to hear peoples takes on these guys, I have a really bad feeling all 3 of these guys are cons.

I have a very hard time believing that guys like Shaan Kassam, Trey Jones, and Jordan Hardgrave are actually legit when it comes to helping people overcome anxiety disorder. Shaan guarantees 100% recovery in his programs yet you hardly ever see or hear a success story unless it's from his paid Facebook group. He also charges out the ass to even do his program, over $3,000 I believe and it's only for people that are 100% in on fully recovering. Aren't we all?

I don't know much about Jordan, but I hear that he also only interested in money. If you ask him for his credentials he will say ""most people that ask that don't sign up"", basically tell you to fuck off since you aren't giving him money and says the only credentials you need to see are the positive reviews on his website. I read this from another reddit post from a while back and it really wouldn't surprise me if this were true. Also those ""reviews"" could be written by any motherfucker on the planet, could be someone who was paid off to write some shit or burner accounts made to make positive posts.

Next is Trey Jones and while I think he's the ""best"" out of the 3, I will say that some of his stuff is bullshit and he repeats shit for the sake of his Youtube channel. You'll see videos of him covering topics that he already covered before, it's like he's struggling for content so he needs to repeat and remake videos he's already done for the sake of continuing to get views. I also purchased his bootcamp program that was a complete waste of money, and I should have known better but I was desperate at the time of purchasing it. It literally goes over things that he puts out for free on his Youtube channel, no lie. I'm not kidding, there's actually one section in the program that's about ""letting out your battle cry"" to combat anxiety. You've gotta be kidding me, this is that garbage he puts out for an $80. He also does not update this program even though he said he would add content to it, it's been months....

This is just my take on these guys and I'd love to hear what other people have heard or experienced from these guys or even other anxiety ""gurus"" out there that claim they will cure you of all your shit for the small fee of a few house payments.

324,DotNegative5853,1617075358,1,"To keep a long story short, I had my car towed to a new mechanic. I had someone I trust refer me after their good experience. I explained when making the appointment that I had an oil leak sometime last year, but with the pandemic, finances were too tight for me to be able to fix it when I first noticed it. I was just struggling to put food on the table. 

The other week things came to a head when the car broke down on the side of the road when my boyfriend was on his way home from work. He was able to make it to a local car parts store where they told him the oil leak grew and it was spraying oil all over the left side of the car, breaking the alternator. This was definitely going to be a much costlier repair than if I had fixed it in the first place. 

Anyway, after specifying twice that I was worried about the cost I received a phone call two days after the car arrived at the shop telling me it was done. My boyfriend had stopped in for something completely unrelated on his car and had been told the same thing with a different price. They told him $800ish and quoted me with a final price of over $1000. 

When they called me they misgendered my boyfriend, rudely, and told me it was ready to pick up. They never got my authorization or my approval for the work they decided to do. 

As per the topic of this group, I have horrible anxiety. My boyfriend has anxiety as well but his is more manageable. He wants to go into the shop and give them cash in a lower price than what they told him, call them out on the misgendering and tell them that they serviced our car without confirming we could afford the price. When I have my car towed somewhere I have no idea what it will cost. I don't always need an itemized breakdown but I would appreciate the final cost, especially when times have been so tight and I am just trying to make ends meet. 

I don't know how to handle this situation. I am extremely anxious confronting someone in any perceived position of authority and the thought of having to deal with him makes me want to throw up. I have no idea how to approach what we should say. I don't think what he did was legal because now my car is sitting in a parking lot with repairs I can't really afford. We both lost our jobs in the last year and I have had a ton of unexpected expenses come up through all of this. I could have had it towed back and waited until I had enough saved up to fix it, but now it's stuck there and they are probably growing angrier by the day that it's not picked up. I have had so many bad things happen to me this year alone that I am just at the end of my rope. My car breaking down was pretty much the final straw. I am safe and will manage, but I can hardly take the anxiety (and trust me, I am medicated).

i find it so hard to just leave my house sometimes i think because i just hate interacting with other people or feeling judged i think. it‚Äôs weird because in a social setting i‚Äôm actually a very friendly person and want to talk to new people but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve just changed lately or if I just get in moods where i just really don‚Äôt want to talk or if i just only wanna talk to my friends and not to random strangers. i think this could also be a confidence issue? or like being insecure so getting anxiety when people see me? but then again i‚Äôm not sure because i‚Äôm just really not that insecure like i am but i‚Äôm not embarrassed of myself to go in public i think i just hate feeling people looking at me? i really don‚Äôt know i can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs causing me to feel like this.

well whatever is causing this feeling of not wanting to leave my house or not wanting to be in public is limiting my life so much. i barely leave my house unless i have to or have a plan with friends. but i really really don‚Äôt wanna be this type of person! i hate it. i feel lazy but i know i‚Äôm not lazy and i know it‚Äôs just me being scared that‚Äôs stopping me from living a real life but i just don‚Äôt know how to change it. I plan the things I have to do in a day around the fact that I don‚Äôt wanna see people like I‚Äôll go on a run at night instead of when I actually want to and most of the time since I make myself wait until night time I don‚Äôt feel like going anymore so I‚Äôm just getting so unactive and gross.

i also smoke a lot of weed I don‚Äôt know if this affects anything but thought i‚Äôd say it incase it does. It definitely doesn‚Äôt make me feel less anxious to go out.

Sorry for saying so many random different reasons I‚Äôm just so sick of this feeling so thought I‚Äôd just say everything. 

My car recently broke down so I also lost my job so that could also contribute to me being at home all day.

329,PuppiesAreRad,1617074021,1,"TL;DR: I was miserable in my job which overflowed to my life for years. My mental health was declining &amp; I just got a new job offer and finally feel the best I‚Äôve felt in YEARS. 

For those who work a shitty job, know you will get out. You are deserving of happiness and nobody can rob you of that. I was at my current job for years It‚Äôs been a roller coaster. My depression and anxiety kicked in about 3 years ago and the last year, it‚Äôs been the worst it‚Äôs been. I‚Äôve been gaslighted by my boss every day, treated like crap from people in the company and worked like 60+ hours for week. I was throwing up before I had to go to work, from the fear of what the day will bring. I felt I wasn‚Äôt smart enough, qualified enough or too young (I‚Äôm 30 BTW and this has been said about me by multiple corporate middle-aged men) to succeed at another job. Not everything was horrible with this job, but the past year has been horrific. 

It was like universe know I needed to get out. After months of rejection emails from jobs I applied to, this new job happened within a week of applying to a interview to land the job. 

When I told my boss, it did not go well. They let me know that a new job will not take away my unhappiness in life (they were also my close friend so knew a lot about me too). But I can tell you, in the 3 days of knowing I got this new job, my mental health has improved. I was social this entire weekend, and was no longer sleeping/hiding in my apt. And I‚Äôve just been so fucking happy. Oh, and I also got rid of that friend (boss) of mine. She wasn‚Äôt a true friend.

334,Shorts_Man,1617072591,1,"Maybe this only makes sense to me. But anxiety and depression don't typically involve feelings that you can put your finger on. For me, it's not grief, it's not anger or sadness, it's not even stress about day to day struggles, even though those things certaintly don't help.

Chronic panic disorder is a completely different beast. If you're sad, grieving, stressed, etc...at least you can identify what is bothering you and you can work on what it is that is making you feel anxious. But GAD and panic disorder are like trying to put out a fire with a blindfold on. I can't even identify what is making me miserable so there's no way to address it. Whereas if I'm stressed about normal things I can handle it because I can actually identify the problem. I'm still trying to put out that fire, but at least I'm not going into it completely blind.

I think the scariest thing about anxiety disorders is that there is nothing you can really put your finger on to even begin to address what the fuck the issue is. I'm 32, been dealing with this shit since the 3rd fucking grade. The idea of a normal life is so fucking foreign to me.

350,sofi2107,1617068267,1,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share a few easy methods of anxiety relief through self-soothing that I hope you all find helpful! They're all very quick, simple, and common methods of in-the-moment anxiety regulation. Let me know if you've tried any of these, or if there are others you've found helpful! 

Self soothing is any kind of behavior that allows you to regulate your emotions in a positive way. These techniques are particularly helpful for quick, easy, in-the-moment anxiety regulation. Here are five easy methods of self-soothing: 

 **1. Describe your surroundings using all 5 senses**

Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can touch, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

**2. Muscle Relaxation**

Tense and relax each muscle group from head to toe, one at a time. 

**3. Pace your breathing** 

Inhale for a set count, then exhale for a set count longer than your inhale. (You can also add a set count between your inhale and exhale to hold the breath.) 

**4. Categorizes**

Pick any category (fruits, songs, movies, etc.) and mentally list as many things in that category as you can. 

**5. Grounding Object/Kit**

Carry an object or a kit of several objects that you can use to help ground yourself. A grounding object can be anything that you can carry with you and keep within easy reach, such as a piece of jewelry.  You can put anything in a grounding kit that brings you comfort, such as a lotion with a calming scent or a photo of a good memory. Use these objects when you feel stressed as a way to distract yourself from the anxiety. 

Attached below is a link to short infographic with these methods:

Nothing extreme so I dont think it's epilepsia.

I usually get this sensation maybe once a week or a bit more often. it can happen anywhere so I can't really avoid anything that triggers it, trust me if I could i would.

But when i'm just chilling at home in bed and get this feeling it usually passes in a couple minutes, often I just accept death and it goes away, probably not the best strategy but idk. Anyway my question is........... is this common? or has anyone else experienced something like this?

Well, I've only seen her twice but last time I actually gained weight again bc I had been on my period &amp; had had cravings (if you know the feel, you know).

I've been doing relatively ok, but my mental health issues have been worsening over the course of the virus situation &amp; lockdown..
 To the point where I now suspect my depression is back (hi, btw... it's been a while) &amp; I just had an 'emotional craving' &amp; ate it all and then immediately felt guilty....

I've noticed thoughts like 'why not make yourself puke it back up?' Or 'I'll starve myself tomorrow' etc pop up in my head and that scares me.

360,Gryffindor1994,1617065309,1,"I am currently in therapy and my reassurance seeking is the biggest thing right now that's holding me back. My therapist calls it a ""safety behaviour"". So, we created a hierarchy of reassurance seeking. My goal is to ask reassurance once every 2 weeks for 5 minutes. But right now, I am starting with twice a day (once for 5 minutes and then another time for 15 minutes). Then, I will decrease the amount from there. It's basically the same concept as an exposure hierarchy (if you're familiar with that). 

The problem is, is I have a difficult time sticking to it. I only started it 5 days ago so it's still early days. 

I have severe GAD and health anxiety. Currently, it's my health anxiety that's been bugging me. Right now, my obsession is actually about my boyfriend's health. We recently discovered that there is a hereditary autoimmune disease in his family. This disease is hereditary 90% of the time. His older sister (26 years old) was diagnosed in her late teens and his younger sister (22 years old) was just diagnosed. That being said, this disease would have been present from birth. The fact that his younger sister has it confirms that it's hereditary in his family. This disease is caused by a single gene mutation and is dominant. So if 1 parent has the mutation, then there's a 50% chance each kid will have it. In the grand scheme of things, this disease is quite minor (at least in his family). His sisters get sick more often than most people, and his older sister had a couple of other symptoms but that's it. This disease is very easily managed and both sisters live very happy, fulfilled lives. The condition is diagnosed completely through a simple blood test. His younger sister was ""accidentally"" diagnosed because she got a blood test for a completely unrelated thing, but her numbers were low so she was suspected of having this disease. His mom also has low numbers (so she is likely the one with the mutated gene). 

My boyfriend (24 years old) has no symptoms of this condition. He actually gets sick less than the average person. He's a very healthy guy. He got a series of 8 blood test several years ago because he was on a medication that required them. Most of his blood tests were great. His baseline test (before he started the medicine) was fantastic. His numbers dropped when he started the medication, but that is listed as a potential side effect. However, almost all of them still remained within normal range (except for 2 which were SLIGHTLY under the range). Apparently his sisters have never had a normal blood test. So, the evidence points towards my boyfriend not having this condition. And he is 100% confident that he doesn't have it. 

In this case, I am actually not worried about my boyfriend. This condition is not like Huntingtons, which pops up later in life. It is technically present from birth. And yet, he has never shown any concerning symptoms. He never gets sick, almost all of his blood tests have been great, and when he does get sick it lasts for like 3 days. My worry is whether or not he would still want to have kids with me if there's a possibility that he has this gene (and is just asymptomatic). The severity of this condition varies. Everyone in his family has a very mild version. But there's a possibility for a more severe version, which would just mean the kid gets sick more. There is treatment for severe cases that is extremely effective. He says this doesn't matter and he definitely still wants biological kids with me, even if he happens to have this mutation (and even if there's a possibility our kids could get the severe version). He says his sisters live amazing lives (they both literally travelled the world a couple years ago) and this disease is very manageable, even in severe cases. He says his answer won't change. 

I just have a hard time believing this answer. So I continue to ask for reassurances. I have a very hard time sticking to my twice a day (5 minutes + 15 minutes). And, when I do stick to this time, I end up crying in the evenings because it's so hard and I just REALLY want to ask him. It's almost like I'm indirectly asking for reassurance when I do this. Today, I haven't cried so hard (improvement) but I did spend 20 minutes asking for reassurance instead of 15 minutes. I am SO determined to beat this health anxiety and I really want to work on this reassurance seeking hierarchy. How do I just cut myself off at my time even if I want to talk a lot more? What sort of methods should I use to just stop myself once the timer goes off (even when I want to say more)?

364,Individual-Bet8608,1617063934,1,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm just curious to see if anyone has had something similar happen to them as I can‚Äôt really find much info online. 

In October 2020 I underwent gallbladder removal surgery. It was my first time ever being in hospital so it definitely was scary. I am generally an anxious person ( was never diagnosed but I know I started to have health anxiety and was always an over thinker, never had physical symptoms though). Around the same time I also was told I have an ovarian cyst and that it could potentially need surgery so that was on my mind too. Anyway on the second night after my surgery I kept waking up gasping for breath. For the next week I was having shortness of breath and I thought it was due to the anaesthetic so I thought it was normal( looking back it would come and go and always come when I got a little bit stressed). I definitely was quite stressed after surgery trying to not get blood clots etc. Just health anxiety stuff but in the past I would have the same worries but not with the breathlessness feeling. Anyway it finally went after a week as I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it, thinking it was normal after surgery. Then a week later I thought I could feel my cyst and convinced myself I needed more surgery and I started to develop it again. This time I knew it wasn‚Äôt the surgery as it had gone once. My surgeon told me to go to hospital and it didn‚Äôt seem normal and I went to my doctor who referred me to hospital thinking it could be a blood clot on my lung ( which freaked me out more). After a lot of tests it came back that it was anxiety which I didn‚Äôt believe because I have had worries before (worse worries) without physical symptoms so I was confused. I became so hyper aware of my shallow breathing and wanting it to go that it just wouldn‚Äôt go and I started to become upset and get severely anxious over it. I decided to start lexapro which in hindsight was a bad idea ( if I had just done CBT and breathing Excercises I wouldn‚Äôt have to endure what I did on lex). Anyway to try not make this any longer, was on lexapro for 6 weeks and had an adverse reaction to it where it actually made me worse off,depressed etc. My therapist and doctor have agreed that basically between the surgery and the adverse affect and withdrawal effects of the lex my nervous system is completely sensitised and needs to go back to a state of calm which thankfully it‚Äôs improving slowly. 

I know the shortness of breath was developed from developing a sensitised nervous system from surgery as my therapist put it as surgery is a trauma which can heighten the alarm system. I guess my question is has anyone else experienced something similar? I‚Äôm just thinking down the line I hope please god if I ever have to have another surgery that this ordeal won‚Äôt happen again or at least il have tools to deal with it this time.

368,iliketothink10,1617061747,1,"Hello, my history with panic attacks started last year, in September, after my father had a heart attack. Four days after that, I had my first panick attack which made me go to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack too. After having an EKG and blood tests done, they told me I‚Äôm fine and that next time I might need to go to a psychiatrist. For two or three weeks after that I felt bad overall, like it was some sort of a ‚Äúpanic attack hangover,‚Äù. Then I had one or two more panic attacks, but overall I wasn‚Äôt feeling that bad, I was confident my heart was fine, as the tests concluded. 

I managed to overcome that stressful period, and I had 3 weeks where I felt pretty good. Then the nightmare started. At the end of October, after two stressful days I had a panic attack. It lasted a lot so I went to sleep thinking the next day I‚Äôll feel good. No. I woke up, I was cold, felt that ‚Äúhangover‚Äù and my chest still hurted. I made an appointment with a psychologist and I started drinking daily till we could meet(bad idea, I know). 

Fast forward three weeks, the chest pain(tightness, heaviness, funky feeling) is still there, still dizzy and sometimes nauseous, still feeling cold. I was very scared, I was really believing that it must be the heart, that this was not normal. I made an appointment with my GP. She was not interested in me seeing a cardiologist, and said ‚Äúif it was the heart, something would have happened by now‚Äù, and then made me do some blood tests, and a chest X ray to see if it‚Äôs caused by the lungs. They all came back fine, apart from high serum iron, but she said it‚Äôs no big deal and that I should see a psychiatrist. I was relieved, but the chest feeling was still there.

Things were ok for one week(mentally, chest pain still there) but then it all went downhill. I started having daily, long panic attacks, I was living a nightmare. The last days before seing the psychiatrist were just torture, I couldn‚Äôt even stay in the bad, I was nauseos, scared and what not. I was playing in my mind the same imaginary dialogue with the psychiatrist:‚Äùno, this doesn‚Äôt sound like anxiety, you should hurry up and see a cardiologist‚Äù. 

My fears were not confirmed though, and I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg and diagnosed with panic disorder, and she also didn‚Äôt believe I need to see a cardiologist, but said ‚Äúif you think that it will help you, then go, but I tell you, your heart is perfectly fine‚Äù. 


I felt good, mentally, I was really hopeful, I felt so good that I even thought I don‚Äôt need the meds I wanted so bad just one day prior. But I still took them. They worked in a way, after one month the panic attacks started to become more infrequent, I didn‚Äôt panic as much when I read about people having heart attacks, I wasn‚Äôt feeling cold anymore, I wasn‚Äôt nauseous as much, but the chest sensation was and is STILL THERE.

Two days after seeing the psychiatrist in December, a very professional cardiologist saw me, and treated me like a potential cardiac. After checking my pulse and seeing my bloods tests, chest X-ray, the ekg from the ER, and doing another EKG, he told me I‚Äôm fine and I don‚Äôt need any more tests. I asked him, ‚Äúif I had a heart problem, even a minor one, it would‚Äôve shown on the ekg or on the blood tests right?‚Äù, and he firmly confirmed.

Yet here I am, after upping my Lexapro dose to 20mg, still having days when I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôm having heart problems, still fearing exercising, still having chest sensations. I‚Äôm really hopeless.


Tldr: After stressful events in my life, I‚Äôm experiencing 24/7 chest pain. Is there anyone that can relate? My pain is mostly in the middle, it‚Äôs not debilitating, sometimes it feels like a pressure, or heaviness, I have shortness of breath and 90% of time I‚Äôm not able to take a full breath or complete a yawn. It‚Äôs not necessarily getting worse with effort, and it sure doesn‚Äôt get better with resting. Also it‚Äôs not always the same, it changes in intensity and also sometimes I can feel it in my whole chest, most of the time it‚Äôs not even pain. It‚Äôs just a...sensation? But no matter what, my chest can‚Äôt feel normal. There must be something wrong with it at any moment, it‚Äôs unbearable. Also, it doesn‚Äôt feel like it is muscular, and it also doesn‚Äôt feel like costo.

Then that subsided and the existential thoughts started. Is this real? Is the world fake? Am I making this all up? Death and so on.

In march in the first lockdown i started needing to use the toilet after every meal or coffee i drank. It didn‚Äôt bother me at first but then it started to happen more frequently which lead me to stopping eating foods that seemed to cause diarrhoea such as dairy foods and junk food. i started eating way less (usually i love eating so this was unusual) and lost 28lbs. i realised i was eating unhealthily so i started eating better. 

lockdown eased and i went back to school but what i realised is that i started having diarrhoea every morning. this still happens to me everyday before school. 

i ended up going to the doctor and they tested me for IBS but my test was negative. So they believe it is generalised anxiety but didn‚Äôt diagnose me. This was in September time last year. i haven‚Äôt been back since. 

Whenever i leave the house to go out with friends or go on a bus i have diarrhoea before. 

One time i was out with my friends and at the beach and it was a far walk from the nearest toilet. I had a sudden need for the toilet and started panicking. Me and my friends walked as fast as we could to the supermarket about 20 minutes walk away. (they are so supportive and understanding ü•∞) as soon as i got there, i had a panic attack. Well i think it was, it was my first time. 

Now whenever i leave the house i have that thought in my head. ‚Äúwill there be a toilet near me? will i make it? am i going to embarrass myself?‚Äù

I still suffer with the bathroom issue and it is really affecting me. i don‚Äôt want to leave the house anymore, i‚Äôm too anxious. i‚Äôm not sure but my parents think i have a slight toilet phobia?

So far in the course, I've been doing well solo, not having many issues understanding the material but now I'm feeling cold all over, shaky, and having some issues breathing.

The main reason I got into this program is I've always been good with computers and really need a job that's in demand. I tried going for a few certifications (A+ and Sec+) but those have not helped with the job search at all. If I drop this program now, I'd have to pay back some of the ISA loan I took out (would be 5k which I have enough to pay right now). 

I already quit a program before with a Teaching Fellows where it got to the points where I couldn't eat nor sleep. Luckily I didn't have to pay anything when I left that program.

I even quit a bank job I had pre-Covid when my anxiety kicked in full gear and went to the ER to be placed under observation mainly cause I couldn't handle having people come in and out.

I do take medication for it, Celexa at 40mg and Buspirone at 30mg (10mg x 3 per day) and that was a recent increase but I swear whenever I'm in a group where everyone is constantly observing me has me feeling so doubtful of everything to the points of physical harm.",Anxiety,Anxiety from Group Assignment,2021-03-30 08:43:50

402,MustBeMouseBoy,1617053860,1,"As a little context I live with three roommates and my girlfriend, five people all together including me. I have been diagnosed with PTSD BPD and AvPD and they're all connected and play off one another in very unfun and unsexy ways. I get triggered easily by touch, loud noises and social situations, especially if I can't see an out or it wasn't something I initiated and prepared for.

My case officer a couple months ago gave me some information about my childhood abuser and his response to my statement of affect that was very stress inducing. I don't think I'm allowed to go into what was said since the case is ongoing, but it added to the nightmares that I've been getting and they haven't gone away.

I woke up after one nightmare and was really badly affected. My anxiety for the past few months has been getting to the point where its permanently in my stomach and throat making me want to throw up. I've also had a tension headache for about three days. I had a bath and felt a little better, played some games and took my medication. My headache was coming and going.

I wasn't really engaging with my girlfriend and she was coming and going from my room. After a good few hours I realised one of our friends had come over, and telling my GF was enough to get her to go join them. I told her I wanted to stay inside. The way I deal with my anxiety is by withdrawal, in part due to my AvPD. She seemed to be okay with that.

After about twenty minutes of them talking in the garden and me playing my games I noticed they were throwing stones through my open window. (I live on the second floor) They wanted my attention but I didn't want to give it so I ignored them. They were calling me on the phone and calling my name while throwing stones so it was definitely hard to do and very overwhelming. When a really big handful came through and almost hit me I floated them down a note asking them to stop. To their credit they did, but instead one of my roommates then barged into my room and started throwing stones from my window. I geuss that's the retaliation they wanted from me. He lives on the same side of the house I do and could have used his own window but no.

Thankfully he left really quickly when he ran out of stones and realised I was just going to keep playing on the computer and ignoring him. When he left I locked my door.

I was playing my game again, my headache much worse and the feeling of wanting to throw up not going anywhere. My girlfriend tried to come in (again without knocking which she knows I don't like) and asked to be let in when she realised it was locked but I said no. A short conversation convinced her I was okay and to leave me alone for a bit but she came up once or twice after still asking to be let in.

A few hours pass and I open my door, signalling that she could come in if she wanted. I wasn't really ready but felt the pressure to. I was kind of engaging again but then everyone started coming into my room one by one. I was ignoring them very pointedly and hoping they would leave but they just took that to mean they should just talk over me to my girlfriend. They treat my room like a common area sometimes and I hate it. It's my room where I go to feel safe and no matter if I tell them I need it to myself in a couple weeks they 'forget' and do it all again. 

They to their best to be nice but they're also really loud people and it was now my safe space they were invading. I'm sensitive at the best of times but it was getting to be way too much. The last straw was when one brought a stool into my room and opened it as loudly as possible, creating a huge bang noise that triggered a flashback. I didn't snap or cry or yell, which is a massive improvement for me. But when I was 'back to reality' I told them I had been avoiding them on purpose and wanted to be alone. They filed out after that. 

None of them had even noticed they'd triggered me, but I can be quite subtle so I'm not surprised. 

My girlfriend stayed when they left and bought me dinner but every little noise she makes is triggering me. I want to ask her to leave but it feels awful and rude after she's spent money on me. And I can't even eat what she bought because nothing can get past the knot in my stomach. 

Today hasn't been that bad on paper now that I write it out but I can't escape the anxiety no matter what I do and my environment is always going to trigger me. People sneezing, coughing or slamming doors across the house will make me panic. And all of those things happen at least three times a day each in this house. I can't move out, nobody listens for more than a day when I tell them what is triggering or that I really need space to myself. How can I avoid and manage my triggers when they're all around me all the time?

I'm not in the frame of mind for exposure to work, it's just making it worse. And I can't help my instinctive reactions.

Racing heart from morning till night, static vision, inability to think of anything else or be distracted.

It got to the point where I was starting to feel like I existed in a different reality to everyone else.

405,babypsychoredditer,1617052264,1,"Hello,

I am not sure if I am posting in the right sub, but I really need support right now. For the last few months, I have not been thinking about anything else‚Ä¶

I work in a field where we have mandatory Covid nose-testing/vaccination. Last year, the tests were like once in 5 weks, then maybe once in 2 weeks, now I have to take one every single week. The tests are painful and extremely uncomfortable, and then there‚Äôs also my lifelong fear of doctors and all the medical procedures. I am anxious for a few days before the Covid test and then tense and jittery for a day or two later. It‚Äôs hard to think about anything else then, though work and distractions help.

I‚Äôd like to change the job to the one where tests are not mandatory, but if I want to stay in my profession, there is nowhere to go because all the workplaces have the same testing requirements from the government. When I get vaccinated, I can stop testing for some time, but that time is very short. My boss bullied and threatened me in front of my colleagues for not wanting the vaccine‚Ä¶ I am scared to be treated like that and worse in my job. I decided to get vaccinated because I just need a break from the tests and the threats... I have already got my first shot a week ago, and my arm is still not fully recovered, I still feel some residual pain, and the second shot is supposed to be very sickening. Of course, there‚Äôs also having to go to the doctor‚Äôs and getting shots - just more and more anxiety‚Ä¶

I cry after every single test and shot, not from physical discomfort but from the thought that I am stuck in this, that I am forced to do this to myself, that nobody cares about my suffering. I understand it‚Äôs really bad for other people too, the ones who are afraid of the virus or have had consequences or losses due to Covid, but at least everyone supports them, pities them, validates them. Everyone is talking about how terrible is Covid, how we must all vaccinate/test/mask/distance/whatever, and there is nobody that gives a damn about me and how I feel, nobody understands me or supports me. I am probably a bad person, but I don‚Äôt even feel empathy for the dead, sick or their families, because I feel like I‚Äôve had to sacrifice my whole life and my sanity FOR SOMEBODY ELSE‚ÄôS SAKE. None of these precautions are even worthwile for me - I am young and have no other risk factors. Everyone just expects me to torture myself and get absolutely nothing for that (no, there aren‚Äôt any perks at all for the tested/vaccinated in my country). I feel so angry and so scared, and just so violated and abused - this is my body, after all, and it feels terrible to not have a choice about what to do with it. I‚Äôve been thinking I want to die every single day. I am not going to kill myself, I don‚Äôt even want to, but I really want this period to be over. I just can‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ 

If I could find anyone else that has had any similar feelings, I would be the most happy I‚Äôve been during last 4 months. If you don‚Äôt get me or are angry with what I wrote, I understand, but please be supportive - there are many other topics and subs that you can share your frustration on, and I really don‚Äôt have anywhere else to turn to.

406,coffeetaIk,1617052099,1,"Hi, I‚Äôm writing to determine if anyone else feels a similar way. 

Back story, w/out meds: I was against meds for a very long time, as I found a sense of success when I was able to overcome a challenge on my own. I started meds due to the fact that I had been coping with some intense anxiety for over 24 years, and I got to a point where I... just... needed... help. My therapy sessions were fantastic and by focusing on PTSD, I was able to better understand where my anxiety peaked and why I would express it in certain ways e.g. vomiting. I was very reactive and quite emotionally invested in things. I‚Äôd have very negative thoughts when the anxiety came around, and would shake and sweat in bed. I also found it was hard on the relationship I had with my partner (although he wouldn‚Äôt admit it, he‚Äôs very supportive). All in all, I FELT TOO MUCH, and it was causing my anxious episodes to be extremely exhausting and draining. Episode after episode after episode, I just wanted to say that I had tried meds. 

Current story, on meds: I‚Äôve changed, in many ways. I feel like I‚Äôve grown and been able to focus more on myself. I understand myself better. My relationship with my partner is really good. I feel like I stress less and react less intensely. I‚Äôm not so much emotionally invested in things, and I am not phased about events happening that don‚Äôt involve me. I‚Äôve had a few episodes, and they were intense (my body felt like absolute shit) but my therapist did say that there was a possibility for them to still happen. I don‚Äôt think as much tbh. I‚Äôm just.... chill. So chill, in fact, that I feel like I‚Äôve lost enjoyment in things. I don‚Äôt laugh as much, I don‚Äôt find importance in much. Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm lacking motivation because doing things isn‚Äôt as exciting as they used to be. I kind of just don‚Äôt care. My sexual desires aren‚Äôt as high. My mind feels a little blank. My room seems to always be unorganised because I know ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to it‚Äù (which is very unlike me).

For reference, I‚Äôve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I rarely have anxiety attacks though. I haven‚Äôt had one since May of last year, and before that I hadn‚Äôt for two years. I recently got covid and have just been cleared to leave home so I haven‚Äôt driven in about a month and a half (I‚Äôve been really sick with it and wanted to be extra safe.) 

Today my boyfriend returned to work, after being on covid leave. He was supposed to be there for one thing, a password change, then coming home. I fell back asleep and expected him home when I woke up. Instead I woke up to him calling me, needing his inhaler. They wanted him to work his shift there, instead of at home, but did not tell him so he wasn‚Äôt prepared. I get dressed and rush out of the house to take his inhaler to him. 

The drive is where it all goes down. I start to shake as I‚Äôm driving, my hands, arms, and feet are shaking profusely. I‚Äôm full on panicking and I can recognize this but it‚Äôs an emergency and he needs me so I quickly get there and tell him I need to just sit there for a minute because I cannot drive while shaking this bad. He asks if I can follow him, it‚Äôs just a straight line and a right turn to get home. I reluctantly agree and we take off. I know this may not have been the best choice but I didn‚Äôt know what to do at this point and couldn‚Äôt think straight. So I get to a stoplight and there‚Äôs a bus stopped on the other side, with the cars in front of me blocking the intersection waiting to pass the bus and move into the next lane. I see this and lose it, boyfriend took the other lane already and he‚Äôs out of sight. I turned right into a business neighborhood and park.

I texted him that I pulled over and needed to just sit for a minute and would be home soon. Twenty minutes later I go to a nearby restaurant for water and end up in a residential neighborhood not too far away. I‚Äôm still shaking really bad and know it‚Äôs not safe for me to drive home. It‚Äôs only a ten minute drive from where I am but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt make it. He calls and I explain that it‚Äôs my anxiety and it won‚Äôt go down. I end up having an anxiety attack sitting there. No matter what I did, it wouldn‚Äôt calm my anxiety. 

He ended up talking to me the whole way home, an hour later, and I‚Äôm now home safe in bed. My anxiety is still really bad though. I tried lavender oil. I‚Äôve tried breathing and posture techniques. I‚Äôve felt the urge to cry and vomit since my anxiety attack started though, and it hasn‚Äôt gone away. I‚Äôm unsure why it got so bad, but I assume the fact I haven‚Äôt driven for so long. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have anxiety so he doesn‚Äôt quite understand how intense what I‚Äôm feeling is right now. Just need some support from people who understand what I‚Äôm going through and realize I‚Äôm trying my hardest. I feel like he got annoyed because I couldn‚Äôt drive home and talking to me was hurting his chest.

The fear doesn't come from a fear of having an accident necessarily. It's more like, I get these irrational thoughts that I will become trapped. Like when I see a long road ahead of me or if there's a lot of hills or open space around, or if I can't tell where the road is going, I'll start to have a panic attack and feel trapped and I'll get this sinking feeling in my stomach etc. Kind of similar to how I can't ride rollercoasters because of that fear of being stuck and the uncertainty of what will happen. I'm fine if I'm really familiar with a route, but even if i'm using my ""safe route"" and then I have to go a new way for whatever reason, I'll get that sense of panic. 

It's especially frustrating because I'm really introverted and would love to be able to rely on myself to drive to new places, and I hate having to rely on uber or other people. I also just moved to a new area and want to meet new people and date but I don't want to ask if they can pick me up.

Summer last year, one of my really good buddies got married and I went to the wedding and I had a really miserable time. I tried really hard to avoid conversations because I didn't want people to be asking about my shitty life.  No one was wearing masks and I am very on the side of mask wearing. I was also getting shit for wearing a mask at the wedding. I wanted to leave the whole time. I also retreated to the bathroom for like 20 minutes trying to feel some amount of peace.  I didn't have breathing problems or heart palpitations or anything like that though.

The weeks afterwards, how I acted and didn't even talk to some people that I really should have made me feel terrible.

Now another friend is getting married. Just thinking about the turmoil from the last one, I really do not want to attend.  This is more of a childhood friend and we have very much have become distanced and haven't spoken in many years, but his family is good friends with mine so it makes sense to give me an invite. I am not going to know anyone there and think I would feel about 10 times as uncomfortable as the last wedding.

I am staring at the invitation now and everything in me is saying not to do this, but I feel a social obligation to go.

I am not sure if this would be considered anxiety or just wanting to avoid the uncomfortableness.

451,adhdandstuff,1617041884,1,"Hello.
This is a rant because it makes me angry. 
I had a panic attack in my band class. I‚Äôm in high school, by the way. 
So, I had a panic attack, with my heart racing, troubles breathing, crying, shaking, a lot. The day I had a panic attack:

I walked into my band class, which consists of 10 people (due to virus) and we‚Äôre all playing guitar (due to virus, no air instruments). So, this is normal for me. I have a every other day school schedule, the school is divided into cohorts to keep the halls less crowded (virus, again). And band only takes place every other, every other day. Does that make sense? Anyways, so I‚Äôve been feeling shaky since last period. And the thing that ‚Äúsets me off,‚Äù I guess, is seeing my friend leave the band room with the teacher. 

So, the teacher is taking them (my friend) out of the band room and I‚Äôm like freaking out. Like, now I‚Äôm here alone with the other people? And the other freaking people are mean and homophobic and gross and they scare me so much. They literally make fun of me, like it‚Äôs obvious, my friends confirmed it. üôÇ

So, yes! I start shaking. Like a lot, too much to play guitar. My hands are literally shaking like I‚Äôm on drugs. So my teacher gets back, and he‚Äôs one of those fakes. He‚Äôs the type to be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm there for you!‚Äù But then, when you‚Äôre having hmm.... I don‚Äôt know A PANIC ATTACK, he doesn‚Äôt try to help. Like, yeah, please don‚Äôt try to help, but let me leave this room because I don‚Äôt feel like having a panic attack in front of 10 other teenagers. 

So I raise my hand, which is now in the air shaking so much that it looks like it‚Äôs on purpose. He‚Äôs like ‚Äúyes?‚Äù and I wave him over. And I wave and go ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling very anxious,‚Äù and that like clump or whatever in my throat starts to form, and my throat is really dry. And he‚Äôs trying to get me to stay. And I‚Äôm telling him that I need to leave, like anywhere but here. So I ask him to go to my friend, like 3 times. And he‚Äôs like ‚Äúno they‚Äôre at the guidance counsellor,‚Äù and I KNOW THEY AREN‚ÄôT BECAUSE I‚ÄôVE BEEN MESSAGING THEM ABOUT HOW I‚ÄôM ABOUT TO DIE HERE. 

He finally lets me leave, and I start crying, sobbing, and all that. I go to where my friend is NOT AT THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR, and I find them in a room working with 8 other kids. So, I do a big swerve and go to the bathroom. Then, the bathroom doesn‚Äôt work to calm me down. So I march into the room and fall to the floor beside the chair they‚Äôre sitting on. And then they take me to the bathroom and I‚Äôm like just kind of there, irrationally freaking out, still having a heart attack and trying to stay calm. 

Finally, my dad picks me up. He was planning to anyways. I didn‚Äôt tell him I had a panic attack until later on because I‚Äôd hate to burden him with that. And that‚Äôs that, once I got home I started trying to calm down, but it took me about 2 days to fully recuperate and ‚Äúheal‚Äù from that.

This past semester I've had to email my profs a few times to let them know that I'm behind and that I'm dealing with mental health issues. The first time I was good at being proactive about it, letting my professor know from the outset that I was dealing with mental health issues and that it might result in me lagging behind. She was super understanding. I was behind for a couple of weeks, but I managed to catch up and do well in the class.

This week I was already a week behind in a class that just started 2 weeks ago, and I finally emailed my new prof last night when I realized I wouldn't be finishing an assignment on time. She also seemed understanding about it (she said okay thanks I'll take note of that) but I still feel shitty about myself.

I feel paranoid like maybe it's not my mental health, maybe it's just me being lazy and shitty and having bad habits like procrastination and I don't even deserve to be in a graduate program. I've been doing really well and getting 98% in all my classes until this semester, but these past few months I've just been feeling like I'm falling apart.

I know I'm probably being too hard on myself but it's so hard not to judge myself and put myself down and compare myself to others. The problem is it's a vicious cycle where I just get more and more avoidant of my schoolwork and then judge myself more.

I had never felt anything like it before; I thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack. I went to the doctor the next day, as I still had the numbness all over and **lightheadedness**. She did an *ECG* (normal), *pulse/ox* (normal), and *blood work* (normal). She believed it was just anxiety/emotional and prescribed me 5 mg/day of Lexapro. I have had GAD for a long time, but I have NEVER experienced such physical symptoms.

The numbness gradually went away within a week, except for my shins on both sides. However, the lightheadedness continued and I developed **dizziness** and **nausea**. We did a *brain CT* (normal). After a few weeks, the doctor increased the Lexapro to 10 mg/day. I still had lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, and shin numbness. The doctor thought I had vertigo and prescribed antiverts. They did not help.

About 2 weeks ago, I developed a **dry cough**, some **shortness of breath**, and **tongue numbness**. I took a *rapid COVID test* and was negative. My dizziness has gotten better. The dry cough and tongue numbness have stayed the same (intermittent) and my shortness of breath has gotten worse. We did a *24 hour Holter monitor* to check my heart (normal), as I sometimes get **heart palpitations**. We did a brain MRI (normal). She still believes it is anxiety/emotional and prescribed Xanax as a rescue.

514,HeatherZaffre,1617020693,1,"Right, so it's not that I think asking for help is anything shameful or anything like that and I would really like to feel better as my anxiety affects me so much every day.

I just really really don't know how to bring up the conversation with my GP (or whoever it is you have to ask). I imagined doing it so many times in my head but no matter what I think of saying it just sounds stupid. I just can't see the conversation going in any way that will actually lead to me getting the help I need. I genuinely don't even know what to actually say at this point. 

And even if I get past that, there are so many follow- up questions that make me nervous. Like them asking ""Why now?"" or thinking that I'm just attention seeking as it would seem out of the blue. It also doesn't really help that my GP is not a very compassionate or nice person so just thinking about facing them is stressful on its own. I am really worried that I will say something wrong and miss out on my only chance to change this situation. I can't express myself too well especially when talking about myself or my feelings, but I do come off as high functioning nonetheless. And additionally, mental health is not something that is really dealt with in my community in general. Whenever I was younger and would bring up some issue of the sort my parents would just tell me to ""deal with it and sort it out in your head"". Again I'm really worried that me being high functioning will make it seem like I'm fine even though internally I am struggling, I just don't know how to explain all that to someone else who will likely dismiss it as attention seeking.

And beside all that, I'm the type of person who generally struggles with approaching other people and asking them anything. If only I had some sort of an opening, some sort of an opportunity where I am being asked this, perhaps I could make it work. But I know that that's not how life works.

Just typing all of this out sounds so whiny and childish and I know I need to get past it. I am nearing my 30s for fucks sake, but there doesn't seem to be any way out as I'm seeing it.

519,jxehh,1617019506,1,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting on reddit. I figured that I should share my experiences in dealing with some of autonomic responses we can have as a result of anxiety. I've never had a panic attack where I've hyperventilated - although the dizzy, profusely sweating, lightheaded / loss of vision (pre-vasovagal syncope) response I have is perhaps similar; at least in the vicious cycle I'll speak a bit about.

I started struggling with this about 2 years ago now. I think the first thing to really accept is that, for reasons which you don't control - you are set up physiologically to experience these events more often than others; and that's absolutely alright. I know it's annoying, and takes up so much bandwidth in your mind at times that it feels like it's all you think about. The first experience I had of this was in high school when we had a trip to listen to a very real talk about car safety and the repercussions of dangerous driving. We were in a big hall, it was hot, and i had this horrible nauseous, sweaty, lightheaded feeling for a few minutes. Here's the thing - come the end of the day, I'd completely forgot about it. I didn't think about it for years - but importantly I still had the same physiology that was prone to it. I still do as i write this! But I wasn't identified with the stream of thoughts which you experience as a result of this, and hence it didn't happen for years. It was a weird one off feeling, that was all.

Why is this important? Well, I went into a healthcare field after I left school, I'm now in my final year. We have placements in different hospitals, and it happened again one time in a staff huddle in a medical unit. I barely made it to the bathroom before I lost my vision. And then it happened a few months later, sitting in the barbers chair. The thought of that hospital episode popped up, and then I thought what if it happened here.. I started feeling hot, and by that time the end result is a foregone conclusion. I was dripping with sweat, keeled over with a hair dryer trying to cool down infront of a full barber store. Good times.

**The antidote:**

Here's how I'm now able to live with this. Here are some axioms which I think you **have** to follow, and I promise you it will eventually improve:

Premise 1: Do not let this stop you from doing anything, ever. Even if it feels horrible, and you want to curl up in a ball, and avoid x,y and z.

Premise 2: There is nothing inherently wrong with these episodes - they are only negative in the fact you are chronically identified with what you are thinking about them. You have to learn about the mind, and what thoughts are, and importantly how they are not you. This leads on to..

Premise 3: This was a **game changer** for me - you have to learn mindfulness meditation. I'll speak about this later.

Premise 4: The aim isn't to stop this from happening, that would mean that you build it up as some monster in your head which you won't look at. You accept it probably will happen again, and then **you keep doing things that makes you feel uncomfortable.** It goes well? Good - do it again. It doesn't go as planned? Good - get back up and put yourself right back in that situation. If you don't adapt this mentality, at least for me, I know it would get worse. For example: I fainted in ITU the other day (first day on the job). Now if that had happened a year ago, I would really struggle getting over it. The very next day, I felt awful, I didn't sleep well, but I went right back in there. It hasn't happened in there since, but **even if it did**, I would be right back in there as soon as I could. It's not ""well I've been meditating and I've been doing uncomfortable things and trying my best so whats the point if it keeps happening"" - that means you are still trying to avoid them. You keep on going regardless. This is essentially exposure therapy in psychotherapy, and it has a wealth of overwhelming evidence to support it; it requires courage though.

In short: Continuous, relentless exposure x learning mindfulness.

Speaking for myself here; I really felt I was stood at the fork in the road between living normally and becoming agoraphobic (fearing every situation). It felt like everywhere I went there was this cloud above my head, just ready to take me on a rollercoaster which was induced by thought, and which I had absolutely no control over. You really do feel helpless. And why would you go anywhere when the second you do it feels like you're about to be pushed head first off a cliff? I just couldn't figure out why this voice in my head would say over and over 'syncope, syncope' or 'you're going to faint' or something like that - like **why** does your head do that?

The first thing I did to hard wire what I'll call 'default action' is forcing myself into a cold shower every morning for about 3 months. I didn't want to do it. I stood outside **thinking** and **suffering in thought** about how horrible it was going to feel. And I kept on stepping into it every single morning. Didn't feel like it? Too bad, it was happening. I'm not saying cold showers do x, y or z. I'm saying you come to learn how to take action regardless of how you feel. Perhaps it's worth a shot.

Next, download Sam Harris' app called 'Waking Up'. Complete the 28 day introductory course. The app is actually 90 pounds or something a year, but you can email them or go to the website and request a years free trial if the money is a problem. I'm not sure if I can post links, but just type in 'Waking Up Sam Harris' on google. Sam always says he doesn't want money to be a reason someone can't access the content - all requests are granted. There are two sections called **practice** and **theory.** Go through both. Learn about the illusion of the self, our lack of free will, learn about the minds and thoughts. I can't explain how liberating it has been for me not to be so consumed by whatever pops out of my head. Sam also has some great stuff on youtube regarding meditation if you want to check that out first; of course I'm not affiliated in any way.

The physical responses to anxiety are a series of vicious cycles. **Panic attack happens - its embarrassing and feels awful - you are consumed by negative thoughts and feelings about said event - you start to avoid places because of them - these thoughts and feelings bring on more episodes - you avoid more places.** **Repeat ad nauseam.** Excuse the pun lol.

You have to break this cycle. The purposeful action which I speak about breaks it as you do not stop going anywhere. You don't shrink your domain of habitable order. You force yourself into these situations, and you know that rain or shine you will be going back again. The mindfulness means that you are no longer chronically identified with thought. You have got to be able to observe thoughts and feelings as just appearances in consciousness and nothing more. It's not 'you' in your head. It's just thoughts.

This isn't easy, it requires real determination and mental fortitude. But its well worth the effort.

532,SourMushroom,1617011275,1,"Growing up I was in a group of 5 best friends from kindergarten to college and years after. The five of us had our ups and downs over the years but we always remained together, we referred to ourselves as ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù. 

I moved to the opposite side of the country a few years ago and while I‚Äôve tried to keep the relationships with the boys alive and well, they have faded a bit but I was under the impression we were more like brothers and nothing could change our bonds.

Since my move across the country, Ive been working remotely from home and haven‚Äôt made any new friends or girlfriends (covid hasn‚Äôt helped). I used to love to go out but now Ive gained 40 pounds and became depressed for the first time in my life. I have been so reclusive for so long that the thought of going out to an event and mingling with people gives me terrible anxiety.

Last year one of the boys told me he was getting married and invited me to the wedding back in my home town, when I was speaking with the other guys about it they told me that all the boys are going to be groomsman. Based on that knowledge for about six months I assumed I was groomsman. I had contacted the groom several times over this period and talked about the wedding but I never thought to confirm my assumption that I was a groomsman and he never told me I wasn‚Äôt. 

I told the boys I was excited for the wedding and to see them all again, but I secretly harboured an immense of anxiety about attending the event. I know his fianc√© well from high school and the wedding is going to be like a mini high school reunion, which is something that is not appealing to me in my current state. However I was willing to suck it up and be there for my friend on his big day. 

I got the call the other day, that I am not a groomsman but every other member of our tight knit group is. He was nice about it, told me I was still his one of his best friends and that offered to sit me at the table with the boys at the wedding. I told him it was fine and not to worry about it although I was pretty crushed inside. 

Since the call, I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I really don‚Äôt want go to the wedding but I also don‚Äôt want it to seem like I‚Äôm just being petty about not being in wedding party with the rest of the boys.

I am thinking about coming clean about my current state and telling the groom I won‚Äôt be attending. 

I have written down some points that I want get out to him over the phone

\-

‚ÄúI completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from as we haven‚Äôt been that close for a few years and you can‚Äôt pick everyone to be a groomsman. 

I feel super guilty about it especially with how accommodating you been for me (offering to sit me with the guys in the wedding party), but I‚Äôm not going to make it to the wedding. 

Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm pissed at you, you‚Äôve done nothing wrong to me, I am definitely the asshole in this situation. I should be pumped to go watch one of my best friends get married but I‚Äôve become very reclusive over the last few years which has caused me some pretty lame anxiety issues.

Prior to your call I was feeling really uncomfortable about attending all the events and now that I know my absence isn‚Äôt going to screw up anything up, Im just going to be a little bitch and pull a houdini. 

really hope you can forgive me and we can still be friends. 

anyways, I love ya man and I‚Äôm really happy you &amp; \_\_\_\_ ended up together.‚Äù

First off, I must say thanks for all the very helpful replies, that blew up a bit more than any post I have made in the past. I hope to be able to respond some more in that thread.

The replies/diskussion there, together with a good nights sleep (lots of exercise yesterday, went for making nutricious meals, eating vitamins etc) set the stage for actually making some progress this morning! Cleaned the kitchen, did quite a bit of laundry, sorted (and even threw away some) clothes.

BUT here are some obervations (and I hope this is not all over the place) that are not limited to decluttering/cleaning, I often experience this no matter what:

Despite sleeping 8 hours, for once uninterrupted (I usually wake up a couple of times), eating a good breakfast, and starting the activity of decluttering - I lose energy after about 30-60 minutes and just feel like I need to rest.

This is of course a problem as I had planned to do (remote) work starting about 9.

What I experience: dry eyes, a bit of a sore feeling in my throat, some brain fog (despite having coffee).

The weird thing is that had I had people around, I doubt I would have felt quite this way. I have a (C-safe) sports activity planned this afternoon and I know I won't feel tired then, on the contrary energized.

So there are thoughts popping into my head - do I work with the wrong thing (SW dev, a rather solitary, confined, activity). But at the same time, with this low energy how could I ever hope to make any change? I doubt I could even focus on sitting in a classroom for a couple of hours feeling like this.

What I'm experiencingright now  is another beast all together and I've been having them a lot recently.

It came out of nowhere, most of my anxiety attacks come after being anxious for a while, but this time I completely fine and laughing, when suddenly it hits.

It starts with feeling like my legs are getting shorter or I'm sinking into the ground. Then I feel like I'm floating but yet sinking into the ground. My limbs become numb and feel like I'm about to pass out.
It feels like is something is wrong or something is going to happen and can't control any of it. 
Then comes the shakes, full blown shivering with teeth chattering and the jaw locking, all which o have no control over.  
Nausea.
Feeling like I'm going to faint and die alone.

My fingers lock up and spasm.
Everything then feels fake or dreamlike. 
At times it feels like I would lose bladder control.
I'm shivering and can't stand up for long, feeling really weak.

Of course had a hard time breathing, and my palms sweaty af. I have  all of this but I am not anxious in my mind. I'm only freaking out because I don't what this is.

567,aozoraninaru,1616997756,1,"Hey all.

32, OCD+GAD+Depression, unofficially childhood and religious trauma as well.

My OCD is the worst of the bunch, combining with the religious trauma to make every waking moment of life more difficult than it needs to be. ERP has failed twice to treat the OCD and no mental health professional I've spoken to seems to get the whole religious trauma thing.

I'm currently employed, I don't work enough hours to be considered part-time, so I managed to get help from my social worker to take 3 weeks off when I realized how bad things were getting. I only work two days a week, 5 hours each day. I thought taking the time to myself would help me get out of this rut I've been in. It did not.

The OCD affects the driving and it affects the work itself, so I'm dreading going back. I go back Tuesday, the new therapist I started working with has two weeks off, so normally I'd see him on Mondays. I'm kinda sorta on my own.

I'm gonna call my social worker tomorrow as kind of a last-minute check-in to see what else I can do to try and make things a bit easier. I dunno.

The disorder got much worse over the years, honestly. Between 2018 and 2019, three family members passed away, and we had to move out of my childhood home. I moved with my mom two hours south, in a smaller apartment with less privacy, slightly too far from all the familiar, and before I could successfully grieve the losses, covid hit. By the time the pandemic started, I was already going downhill real fast.

The driving is nothing short of embarrassing. Years ago, I used to go driving for fun. Now I refuse to drive unless I need to go to work or need to help out family.

Mom knew I needed to get used to driving again for work but she kinda sprung a ""you're driving today"" on me this morning, which wasn't a good way to go about it, so now I'm *more* anxious.

The OCD affects literally everything I do. Even during my break, while attempting to relax, the OCD affected the reading, the gaming, the time I spent online with friends, and so on. I took a break from work but had no break from the disorder.

While literally everyone recommends mindfulness, I can't bring myself to do it and I haven't the slightest idea why. I know a big part of it is due to the leftover religious fears from my past (yoga and meditation is ""demonic"" etc.), and even now as an Atheist I just don't want to spend time doing anything 'spiritual' anyway. But the benefits of mindfulness, pure mindfulness at its core, is apparently backed by science. So...I should really get on it.

I'm trying different vitamins, too. I'm not deficient in anything, but the primary doc said I had nothing to lose if I wanted to give B complex a shot. It's been a couple of weeks with no noticeable differences.

I'm nervous that I'm going to get on the phone tomorrow with my social worker and that we might discuss just...leaving the job.

This would hurt me severely because this is the longest I've worked since college. And I mean, I worked a solid year, although last summer I was furloughed without pay because of the whole pandemic thing. But still, I was *employed* for a solid year.

I'd be scared to leave the job because it does kinda make me feel a little more productive than I normally do. And it's nice to have my own money. It's nice to feel like mom can worry about money a tiny bit less because I have an income. And it's nice to not think that my dad, who, bless his heart, doesn't understand the whole disorder thing, won't get on my case for being unemployed.

On the other hand, if I left the job, good. Honestly. Good. Because I'm suffering whether or not I work, I'm suffering at work and at home, and if I wasn't working, maybe I could devote my entire schedule to trying to get better.

I've been on a generic of paxil for a couple of years now, and if I wasn't working anymore, I'd be more inclined to try out a different medication. But I dread that too, since I've been down that road multiple times. So far, nothing worked anywhere near as well as the paxil, which doesn't say much because the paxil itself clearly doesn't work very well either.

So...I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

Meanwhile, I have two more dumbass problems that have been getting in my way during those times I try to relax.

The first is what's apparently known as ""oneitis."" Basically, I got stupidly fixated on someone I literally have zero shot with, and I imagine a surprising amount of my time each day (if added up) is spent being depressed about that, which definitely isn't helping the whole ""relax and try to get better"" thing I've been going for.

The second somewhat less stupid (but still very stupid) thing is Monster Hunter.

I would love nothing more than to pick up Monster Hunter: Rise and start practicing so I could hunt with people I know who are also playing the game. I'm a lifelong kaiju nerd and love Japanese media, plus I love adorable shit, so Monster Hunter hits a lot of those buttons for me. The cat companions and the new dog/wolf companions, love'em.

But you're a *hunter* in these games. It's not like the superhero/Godzilla stuff I grew up with, where it's an evil monster who needs to get their shit kicked in. In Monster Hunter, a lot of these things are basically just wild animals.

To kill a monster in these games, once they're low on health, they'll literally start trying to limp away and escape, so you need to continue keeping up with them to finish capturing or killing the monster.

Not only is this nothing like what I'm experienced with (I'm used to monsters who are trying to kill your ass til *you* kill *them*), but I'm too much of a goddamn sensitive wuss of a baby to kill the monsters.

I feel guilt. I feel guilt, as if these are real creatures (and they're not). And people tell me, ""oh, that just means you have a good heart, that just means you're sensitive and empathetic etc.""

But *tons* of people play these games. I refuse to believe the tons of people who play these games aren't also sensitive and empathetic people with good hearts.

Maybe they're stronger-hearted people who feel less guilt because they realize it's a goddamn fake video game.

I used to consider my sensitivity and my emotional-ness as a strength, and lately I'm starting to think it's an actual weakness. Sure it makes me feel like I'm less likely to be a soulless asshole to people, but what else do I have to show for it?

So I've wondered if maybe I should play the damn game anyway and try to confront and work through these negative emotions. And I wondered if maybe doing that would just aggravate my already currently-suffering mental state.

Meanwhile people are playing and getting better at it and I'm gonna feel left in the dust real soon.

Told myself to just drop this and forget about it since it's not a good time for it, whether or not I play. Yet, well, you can see how well that's going.

If not for my over-emotional reaction to hunting down these digital, nonexistent monsters, I'd be playing and having a good time like everybody else.

The funny part is, I know others who feel the way I do, who just...don't play it.

Wonder what it's like for life to be so simple.

Wonder what it's like to drive to and from work without multiple incidents where I think I might've hit someone or something with the car.

Wonder what it's like to work a day without thinking I've messed up patients' old records and might lead to them dying in treatment (which I've been told is a very irrational fear for my specific position). 

Wonder what it's like to be an Atheist and *not* still be terrified of god, demonic shit, etc. every second of every day.

Wonder what it's like to realize I have no shot with a girl and to just forget about her.

I'm just so goddamn broken.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what to do next.

I think the job is the scariest thing in this moment. If I quit the job, I'm going to be full of shame, full of fear (specifically of my angry dad back home), out of an income, and will have lost a job shortly after making it to the full year mark.

If I leave the job, however, I'll have less things aggravating the disorder per week, and I'll have more time to devote to fighting this thing, so that maybe I can *somehow* get this shit managed sometime soon and I can actually work a job with more hours someday.

And I go back on Tuesday. So whatever the decision ends up being, quitting the day before I come back is a real shitty move.

I hate this.

I really, truly hate my life.",Anxiety,I'm just having an aggravating couple of days. big vent.,2021-03-29 17:02:36

570,Marla_is_real,1616996975,1,"I am Marla. F (33) married to a guy who ( I met on chat) has been super controlling and never showed any care or love. His love is all materialistic, get me something expensive for whatever life event it is. I fell in love when I was 17, it was all so rosy, talking for long on the phone, hours and hours then we finally met one day. Those days video calling was not very common so I just knew his voice. We both found each other different from the mental images we had of each other, but there was so much bonding that we started formally dating. That's when it started the signs of toxic relationship - I chose to ignore cuz I was madly in love, he'd go out with other girls, not call me for the day for some of the other reason. I

&amp;#x200B;

I have a tendency to self-harm, and my world revolved around him - so I never fought back, never confronted, and that started the whole anxiety/panic thing where I would just shiver for hours not knowing where or who he was with. He never said I love you even once since I was 17, he'd just say me too. Never Whenever I wanted to talk to him - he is such a master manipulator he would make me feel I was wrong, and I tried to fix myself - sometimes that I was too fat to be introduced to his friends, or I'm not pretty enough to be seen roaming around with. He didn't want anyone to know we were dating. 

I wondered what was this relationship we had 0 physical contact, still, he was my ""boyfriend"" who'd send me roses. I started self-harming myself with sharp objects, alprazolam an alcohol overdose, numbing a part of my body so the blood flow stops and it turns blue.  

&amp;#x200B;

My family was against marrying this guy - they said we are not compatible - but who was I listening to? not them voices in my head that told me he's the guy for me. I tried to convince my parents - also continued to increase my alcohol and medicine abuse. I used to miss office for 4-5 days and not remember. I saught a psychiatrist she told me to make a decision if I wanted to come out of this cycle, and I did. I married him. No one from my family was there, I was losing more than what I was gaining. But I don't know what was over me. The first few years were ok, and then again the cycle started of me not being pretty, smart, or be shown to the world. It felt like he married a maid to take care of his family. I did that too, and then soon again the cycle started with meds, cuz alcohol was difficult. I put all my energy in work and worked so hard, that I gained ranks much quicker than others (only benefit of being with him)

Our sex life was nonexistent, don't know if he wasn't interested, or if he was getting somewhere else. I stopped caring about feeling loved, feeling valued, feeling I meant something more than a body that he turns over when he was done. 

In the last 4 years, we have done nothing physical and I was just busy with work, I did the same started working twice as hard as I had accepted this as my fate. I had a lot of guys hit on me romantically but I wasn't interested.

Now in 2020 when I was not looking for love, I met this guy in a workshop, he left an impression on me, and that 15-year-old girl came out again blushing and talking to this guy that in 2-3 months we decided to call us a relationship. I have never loved someone this much, and it's too much for me. I love him unconditionally but I suffer from not communicating, I'd do things and not tell him, I can imagine how stressful it is to be in a relationship with a married woman who does not communicate.

I think it's something I picked up in my current relationship, no talking. Also, I'm a pleaser (that's my work persona) I m always trying to make people happy. This is someway added to me being a pathological liar for stupid things that didn't matter, also cuz it made things easy.

I want to change my life, I want to take control, I will take a divorce and live like a free bird a few age. Feels like I've lost half my life to someone who never deserved me. I don't hate him, I wish him luck - but I'm moving on even if I have support or not.

585,dillydallydino,1616991359,1,"TLDR; therapist recommended considering medication, but it‚Äôs something that terrifies me to my core. I‚Äôm curious how you found it helped/hindered your ability to heal and manage anxiety and depression. 

So for some background, I (21F) have struggled with anxiety in some capacity for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve always been the highly sensitive/anxious type, and my anxiety has always cycled through and attached itself onto different ‚Äúthemes‚Äù: harm to my family, separation anxiety, paranormal, school, social, and most recently, my lovely three year relationship. 

Dealing with anxiety (and depression) within my relationship has been both a blessing and a curse: it is so SO deeply frightening to know you love someone, and WANT to be happy with them, but don‚Äôt feel connected (depression) or are constantly in ‚Äúdanger mode‚Äù and looking for issues where they simply don‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm extraordinarily lucky to have the partner I do, and he is extraordinarily loving and patient with me. And on top of that my best friend. I just really struggle with feeling secure and settled and deeply connected despite objectively knowing I am safe and loved. The hardest part is reminding myself it‚Äôs anxiety and NOT the relationship when, sometimes, it‚Äôs 90% of my thoughts or days. 

The blessing of it is that for the first time in my life, I am accountable for someone outside of just myself. All my life I was able to deal with my anxiety and mostly keep it to myself, without it really affecting those around me. Now that it‚Äôs affecting my relationship, and therefore the person I‚Äôm closest to and love the most in this world, it‚Äôs really prompting me to start making changes in my life so that I don‚Äôt lose this beautiful, wonderful thing I have. It‚Äôs a struggle to stay motivated and spend time working on myself when I‚Äôm also depressed (albeit fairly mildly i think, it‚Äôs hard to tell how bad it is until you‚Äôre feeling better) and busy with school so much of the time. 

I started seeing a therapist regularly, which had been good though I still struggle to see the pathway/steps that I should be taking to actually make progress. Recently, she suggested I strongly consider medication. I have been told this before, by other therapists and family, but I have always had a vendetta against it. I think I‚Äôve heard a lot about how it dulls your emotions, kills your sex drive, makes you care less, gain weight, etc. and I am scared (terrified!) of the side effects outweighing any benefit, or even going as far as ruining my life/relationships/RELATIONSHIP by making me less empathetic, less motivated to work on it/myself, less affectionate, less sexual. Which as I‚Äôm typing it out, seems like a classic anxiety brain thought. But still. :(

Clearly I am not a very secure person, in myself or in most other areas of my life. And honestly, I‚Äôm already experiencing most of the side effects I‚Äôm scared about as symptoms of my anxiety/depression. All this to say, that I would love to hear about your personal experience taking medication to help manage your anxiety/depression, particularly if you were in a relationship when you started and particularly if you had a positive experience (i‚Äôm good at finding all the negative stories myself lol). 

Sorry this was so long, lots on the brain as per. Hope you‚Äôre having a good night and finding some peace and love.

587,Bpswan,1616990437,1,"Hey everyone.  I‚Äôm a 43 y/o male and unfortunately I‚Äôve had to deal with anxiety/panic for over half of my life.  These episodes were off and on but generally, there has been a atmosphere of anxiety that has controlled or directed my life for a long time.  Tons of therapy and SSRI‚Äôs and books and tearful panicked walks at 3am.  Lots of feeling like a failure.  Loss of relationships, jobs, and lots and lots  of dignity.  Decades of fear and temporary relief from Xanax or Klonopin psychiatrists and self help apps and podcasts.  Admissions of being scared to friends and loved ones and subsequent emasculation.
For the thousands of anxiety attacks or anxious states that have been endured...seems like the latest one is just as uncomfortable and terrifying.
Half the time it‚Äôs manageable.  Half the time I‚Äôm running away and hiding.  It‚Äôs not fun to own a business or have to perform physically when you are feeling like you‚Äôre dying or that you might pass out. 
Most recently my latest episode started the day before Thanksgiving.  So it‚Äôs been going on for awhile now.  I‚Äôve ended up with zero energy and chronic fatigue.  I feel short of breath often.  I‚Äôm dizzy.  I literally can‚Äôt work.  I went to the doctor and had complete blood work.  Going to the doctor is an amazing feat for me.  That place is scary...So, everything looks normal except this time they checked my hormones and wow.  My testosterone is extremely low.  Who knows for how long but I kind of thought I was excited to maybe have found a missing link.  So I tried it after the recommendation of an endocrinologist.  I tried it for a month.  My anxiety went through the roof.  Panic attacks daily.  I stopped it.  Symptoms got relief by stopping.  It‚Äôs been a week now.  I finally slept for the last two nights. 
Felt good this morning.  This evening I‚Äôm short of breath and panicked.   Klonopin doesn‚Äôt seem to help.  I‚Äôm bummed out.

589,Aff_Mark_V,1616989950,1,"This was a funny incident of 2020 which I want to share. The reason I'm doing it now is because it occurred around this time of last year.

*Now, let me say something to give you context - I'm a University student who started studying again after a few years into my job. So this is how the story goes -*

Some folks at the University EDP department made a mistake while calculating my attendance for a previous semester.¬†

**An attendance of 85% was mandatory to be eligible for taking the final semester exams.**

Back then, I didn't know exactly how much attendance I had. Plus, we don't get access to electronic records which the officials have.

All we can ever know is the calculation from the attendance book which our professor has. This is the same book the EDP department digitizes. However, those digital records can't be changed once entered.

So on **February 14, 2020** I got summoned by the Head of the Department, along with few of my classmates. Actually the whole class got vacant because we were the very few people who showed up on a Valentine's Day.¬†

**That's when I got shocked.** Why ? Because my attendance in the electronic records were 60%. The HoD threatened to debar me from writing exams.

I tried a lot to convince him that I was regular in attending the classes. **But all my pleas fell on deaf ears.**

I checked the calendar. I had only 2 more months of classes before exams and **knew I can't do anything to get it above 85%.** 

**I was really anxious. Also, worried about my future. I thought the whole world was conspiring against me.**

So I wrote an apology to escape from that room. After that, I visited all my professors one by one, each day. Some days, they were not available and some of them were reluctant to share those details.

*It took me 2 weeks to get the actual picture. I was relieved.* ***I had an attendance of 91%.***

So, I made a daily visit to the EDP department¬†for a week to get their records to see where they have made errors and ask them to get it corrected.

They did not reveal much but, from what I understood I could conclude that it was their error. There were some other students who did not even have their names on the attendance list.

I also had company - as few more classmates were in the same situation I was.

By **March 10, 2020** I had got a clear picture and **began requesting my HoD and course co - ordinators to remove my name from the blacklist**.

So I could write my exams without hurdles. **However my pleas were not considered.**

**I got depressed and anxious**.

***The only relief was that there were 5 - 6 classmates facing my same pligh*****t.**

I was worried about my future and facing my family.

I kept quiet for a few days and tried to distract myself.¬†

**I was totally lost and confused.**

*That night, I went to my room and watched my favourite movie - The Shawshank Redemption.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, here comes a twist.**

**It was around this time the COVID 19 began spreading all over the world.** 

**Some countries were struggling to contain it and announced lockdowns.**

*So, on March 14th 2020 the Government of India ordered all educational institutions to close down.*

*Initially it was for 2 weeks and then it got extended to months.*

**Suddenly, my problems became irrelevant. It was a really liberating feeling.**

Once the lockdown was declared, everyone would lose 2 months of classes and attendance.

So it became impossible for them to debar students.

The next thing that occurred was that the governing bodies cancelled exams for that semester.

We were to be graded according to our performance in the previous semesters.

*Maybe I got lucky, here. Even if the pandemic never occurred, the worst case scenario would have been a backlog for me. And I could always write it and compensate for that loss.*

**Today I feel I was stupid to worry so much for a small matter.**

*Also, do share if you have any such stories.*

591,raspberryjam99,1616988332,1,"I've (F21) been seeing a therapist for about six months now, and we've come to the conclusion that I'm living with GAD. More recently (last session) she also told me that I exhibit symptoms of OCPD, which unfortunately makes a world of sense for a lot of things in my life. When she gave me the GAD diagnosis, she asked if I wanted to try medication. I know medications are extremely helpful and do amazing things for people, but for some reason, I really hesitated. My anxiety is not debilitating - it's gotten worse in the past year with a good amount of catastrophizing/social anxiety/general doom, but I don't have a lot of panic attacks. In the past few months, the physical symptoms have gotten worse (particularly muscle tension and chest tightness), but I'm still really hesitant to validating myself as a person who really actually does have anxiety, and I'm not just ""faking it,"" etc etc. (Part of me thinks it might track with the OCPD thing in that I wouldn't have control over how my body will react, then it will throw off my schedule, then I'll get behind in work, etc etc).  


So long story short, how did you know you needed medication? Were you anxious at all before taking it?

Today was day 3 of 30mg and I am so done

The first couple of days I felt really... weird. I kept wanting to yawn, yet not feeling very tired. I felt ‚Äúout of it‚Äù while doing homework or watching tv. Got the shivers and goosebumps. Took a shower and in the middle of it I could feel a panic attack coming. Did my deep breathing, and then I was fine. Went to a family function with the usual day people I see, and felt like I was going to freak the fuck out. Way more than my usual anxiety before medication. I was convinced it was my body getting used to it. 

Today, out of nowhere, I became flushed all over my body, rapid heart rate, loss of coordination, excessive sweating but still chilled? Nausea. Had a loose stool out of nowhere (I made it to the bathroom, don‚Äôt worry lol) After dealing with that for a half hour, and a few hours pass, I‚Äôm kind of okay now. 

Anyway, anyone think I‚Äôll have bad symptoms if I don‚Äôt take the meds tomorrow? It‚Äôs only been three days. I will call my doctor ASAP in the morning to talk to her about it but I was hoping to get some opinions.

Wanted to post this to see if there was anyone in my position who has experienced this and could help.

I‚Äôm 23 and All throughout my childhood I was a fat kid with huge body insecurity issues made worse by comments from my family and the fact that all my friends were athletic types and very skinny. I only became comfortable with my body when I was 21 and had been weightlifting for 3 years consistently. My body had transformed from a flabby chubby boy to being rock solid.

The problem is that a lot of my self worth and confidence was now tied up on the assumption that I‚Äôd always have access to a gym. During Covid, The UK has handled the whole situation like fucking garbage and between March 2020 - April 2021 the gyms have been open for a total of 3 months. 

This has created havoc for my body which pretty much relies on weightlifting to stay fit. Home workouts and cardio bore the death out of me and I‚Äôve stopped trying to build a habit there. I also stopped eating clean and just turn to dopamine type junk food.

The problem is that now I get these weird feelings of anxiety around 6/7pm every night and it‚Äôs worse on Sundays. This is around the same time that I would go to the gym. My heart races really fast, I feel really sad and feel less masculine because I know my body is soft and I‚Äôm in terrible shape.

TW: a trigger warning for anyone who has suffered or has a loved one who suffered from Covid. 



I have been an ICU nurse for 4-5 years. I loved it, the adrenaline, the constant learning, taking care of people and watching them thrive as they get better, or comforting them when they don‚Äôt. I thought I found my calling. I was really good at my job. Covid finally hit my hospital in February and my life has fallen apart since. Covid isn‚Äôt like anything I or my coworkers have ever seen. It kills so fast, you feel helpless while watching someone struggle, you try everything possible and nothing helps. A lot of chronic illnesses at least make it so people are less aware and more out of it when they are really sick. Covid doesn‚Äôt, they are awake and aware. The few who survive were so riddled with issues, it was so hard watching these healthy people cope with their new disability. The amount of human suffering I‚Äôve absorbed has broken me. I quit my job, I‚Äôve had too many traumatic nights.

I can‚Äôt look at people I love or care about without getting these horrible images in my head. Whenever someone starts to bring it up or talk about Covid, my chest gets tight and I can‚Äôt focus. I‚Äôve had anxiety in the past, but I had overcome it and was using it as my weapon to make me a good nurse, always double checking things and it made me a safe nurse. Now it‚Äôs destroying me. I have nightmares about work, I think about cases. I remember names and faces and it‚Äôs just all hard. I can‚Äôt enjoy being around my friends or family because my mind is like ‚Äúwhat if they end up like the patient x?‚Äù And I get horrible images in my head. It‚Äôs like every case I‚Äôve seen is haunting me. Even traumatic things from before Covid haunts me now- my first peds code which I thought I had handled so well is now keeping me awake at night. 

If anyone has tips for this- or any healthcare workers can relate, I would appreciate it. I‚Äôll probably end up deleting this- but I needed to get it out and put it somewhere.",Anxiety,COVID nurse struggling with anxiety,2021-03-29 11:06:10
636,acac47,1616976339,1,"Hi everyone!

I graduated last year from university and I started a job in my field shortly after. However, that job required me to be in person for the job, so I was working in person for a majority of the pandemic. The job required me to work long hours and so when I got home it was already fairly late and all I wanted to do was watch some netflix and pass out. The job wasn‚Äôt for me in the end and I have since switched to a different job that I so far am loving. However, this job is 100% WFH at the moment. I have been at it a month and I feel like it is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I used to be very anxious as a teenager and had all the time in the world to think and worry and be neurotic in my room alone. I moved away for university and it made a HUGE impact on my mental health for the better. I became a very productive and high functioning person, I was in an honours program with a full course load, working a part time retail job, doing research hours in the lab I was helping out in, found time to hang out with my friends/party/relax - all while maintaining straight As. It was always go go go but I loved the busy lifestyle and it kept me very sane and honestly happy. I am neurotic and anxious by nature, but being so busy all the time allowed me to stay out of my own head and not stress small things into oblivion. It wasn‚Äôt like I never got anxious, but it was much more manageable. Now I have moved back home into the same bedroom I was in growing up, working from home (in my room) and now I am alone all the time. Work has also been super slow, usually only about 3-4 (sometimes even less) hours of actual work to do but I‚Äôm expected to be available 9-5 Monday to Friday since I‚Äôm on a full time salary so I am just on standby in my room for most of the day. This has given me so much free time to just think and overthink and just get super in my head about things, just like in high school. It has made me start to feel very anxious and on edge? almost. I live in Canada where the COVID situation is not quite under control so there are still restrictions against any kind of indoor gathering, and it has been cold and ugly outside recently so outdoor hanging out with friends hasn‚Äôt been super feasible either. I have been trying to go on walks or read in the evening to clear my mind, and it has helped a little bit.

I have been in therapy, i changed therapist as one wasn't working, i shared my issues with my partner and worked together at it... i feel like i have no other chance to actually create change than taking a real break from work and finally accepting to have a chemical imbalance and take meds.

The fact that i am unable to meet with my thesis supervisor in person (due to coronavirus) makes the situation even worse, since i have terrible email anxiety and have to hype myself up for DAYS before logging into my gmail account and looking at my supervisor's feedback. And even when i really need help, i avoid sending emails to her unless absolutely necessary because i don't want to bother anyone.

661,Sufficient_Laugh1764,1616968325,1,"(TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM)

I am normally a hard worker. I love my job, I love my supervisors, and they seem to feel the same. I've had a couple of days where I was late to work, probably 2 or 3 in the last 4 months. Not ideal, but not horrible, I suppose.  Well, our morning cook(Let's call her Sarah) has been out for 2 weeks following their *test*. I am usually a closer, so I leave anywhere between 9:30 &amp; 10:30 pm. 11 if its a particularly difficult day. My boss, ""Jillian"" asked me to take over Sarah's shift since she only had a couple more days of being gone,, so I said yes. It was 3 days, which was fine. But I'm a night owl, and I do not do mornings. I pretty much can't. I do have insomnia hence why I chose the late shift. Coffee makes it worse. 
A couple weeks ago I went to work sleep deprived and pushed thru as long as I could but I felt myself dissociating and everything was really hard to do. I looked and felt drunk. (No. I don't drink ICYWW) Patrons were becoming irate despite me going as fast and safely as I could when operating the slicers. Knowing I couldn't last much longer and I didn't want anybody getting more angry with me, I phoned Jillian and she asked our assistant, ""Andy"" came to help out and he said I could go home. Thank the gods. 
Fast forward to yesterday. Jillian had scheduled me for that morning at 8 am. Call-out policy states you must call at least 2 hours before your scheduled shift. Our store opens at 6 AM. Friday night my insomnia had ramped up again, along with excruciating cramps. I took some Aleve and tried to sleep but it was not working. I laid there writhing in pain for hours. I finally passed out around 5 in the morning. Well. I slept thru my 6 am alarm, and woke up at 8:15 to Andy calling me but I missed it by a second.  Called him back and he said call the store so i did a few times and nobody answered for a while until Jillian picked up.  She was very monotonous when speaking, which isn't a good sign. She is usually very cheerful. She pretty much transferred me straight to HR, where the rep, ""Hannah"" scolded me for not showing up, not calling on time etc and demanded to know why that happened. I told her I have insomnia and missed my alarm. (I'm a trans man, most people at work don't know, and I didn't want to tell her about my cramps because I was embarrassed so thats my fault). 
""Hannah"" said insomnia isn't  a valid reason to not show up or give proper notice,  and very snarkily remarked ""Oh Sufficient_Laugh, im sorry you're a tired."" Her tone changed,, although still mostly stiff sounding as she told.me to get some rest and make sure to come in on time or give proper notice. We hung up.. I was too exhausted to care at that moment but the way she dismissed my condition and seemed to mock me for it really angered me. 

So now im sick to my stomach with anxiety and although Jillian said she isn't angry with me, I can't help but fear the talking-to im going to get from the other managers. Before this they all said I had great potential in moving up and becoming  manager, and now I'm scared that thats all out the window. 
I most definitely understand how much I screwed them over, but it wasn't intentional at all, I just feel so bad. 

TL;DR - my insomnia caused me to miss my alarm, called out of work past the time I was supposed to be there, everyone is angry at me, I feel like the worlds biggest poop.",Anxiety,I messed up so bad and now I'm so anxious I can't think about anything else.,2021-03-29 08:52:05

Hey. So just a little background - I've had anxiety &amp; depression since I was 15. I've basically had a terrible time since I was very young which has made me fuck up a lot in every aspect of my life. My whole life since I can remember has just been about this disease. 

Anyway, recently, I was going to be laid off but wasn't and it was extremely traumatizing (how I was treated) and I've started developing a compulsion about some divine punishment. Whenever something bad happens, I tell myself it's because I took an unrelated action and this was punishment. Unrelated action could be minor stuff like I lied to someone or I was keeping stuff from people or just sleeping too much. Idk. But I keep framing this as 'it happened to me because of so and so reason' and I have started anticipating doomsday scenarios as is common with anxiety but also started wondering what totally unrelated action I might have taken to CAUSE this doomsday scenario.  

Idk I've started obsessing over this stuff a lot and I need help. I can't speak to a therapist yet because they're basically not giving me a session and idk who or where else to post this.

Unfortunately, my spiraling led me to what felt like rock bottom when I found the c*** I had purchased was laced with m*** and I had a substance induced panic attack. Several visits to the ER later thinking I was about to die, I was told I was fine, pumped with Anxiety meds and sent on my way home. I cut out anything that wasn‚Äôt water but my anxiety continues to linger. For the first few weeks after I felt as thought death was walking right behind me. The anxiety was so bad I felt my heart would stop beating any second. I scheduled an appointment with my primary and he prescribed Zoloft and Buspirone but the side effects were too much for me. I took the Buspirone for a few days and that made me feel worse. I feel so ridiculous and stupid that I pretty much gave myself an anxiety disorder.

It's just that the news is a huge trigger for me because there's always something bad or stressful to hear. I'm not against being informed. Just for my mentality, it's healthier for me to avoid the news as much as I can.

So after my 12‚Äôth grade ends, I‚Äôll have to participate in a couple of tests to enter a decent university. This actually isn‚Äôt a problem for me, though. The thing I was going for was going way higher. I was first in my class in middle school, and generally got called a genius. This increased the expectations of me and my family. Then i started to high school and my grades dropped from about 99.8 to 85s. Luckily though, my family didn‚Äôt make a bug deal of that, but I did. My entire class ended up cheating in exams after a while, but i was stubborn not to do that, so my grades were way below average. 

So the point system of the university exams works like this: the maximum points you can get is 560. 100 points are given to everyone, 400 is from the tests and the remaining 60 is from your average high school grades, multiplied by 3/5. So this gave me about 8 points of disadvantage from the beginning. I was worried about this a lot, which prevented me from sleeping sometimes. Then I joined a discord server and made great friends, which helped a lot.

Basically the two exams I mentioned are way different from each other. First one had easier topics but had an infamously little amount of time given. Second one harder topics but with more time and less questions. And the first one was way more important in my eye, since I had to solve 120 questions in 135 minutes. I kid you not, you have to literally speedrun the test. Even being able to see and think about every question was every single sane high scholars dream. 

Once a week, I‚Äôm having a practice exam and I slowly kept getting faster and faster, improved my strategy, increased my reading speed yet I kept leaving a few unsolved questions before the time ends. But for this week, it went way different. I somehow managed to solve all but two of the questions and still had about 7 minutes remaining. I was absolutely shocked and shaking. After 2 minutes of periodic inhale-exhaling, I got to work and solved one of the remaining questions and fixed a mistake in another. This was huge. This gave me more than enough hope about my future as someone not working full time for minimum wage. I still haven‚Äôt checked how many questions i actually managed to guess correctly, but honestly, I am pretty confident that it would be my best ever.

I remember shopping with my mom years ago, clinging to her cart as I begged her to let me pick up a PS2 game from the electronics department.

I remember goofing off with my friends in high school and wandering the aisles late at night for something to do in our boring hometown.

Now, when I walk into Target, I remember what it was like to be in a better mental state and to be around people that I don‚Äôt see much anymore. I wish that feeling of security never left me. I‚Äôm comforted by the unchanging consistency.

717,GabieTheMighty,1616956803,2,"Lately I have been getting this feel in my stomach and my anxiety won't calm down, this happens mostly when I take a second to think about my life at the moment. 

To summarize it, I am 25, I graduated from University last year in January (2020). Back home I was working at a mobile game dev company that let me go due to Covid and down-sizing. After 5 months of not finding a job my dad suggested I move in with him (back to Canada) and maybe I'll find better opportunities. 

I arrived in Canada in October and started my job hunt, at first I wanted a job in my field (3D Art or Game Development) but after 40 job+ applications and no one replying I started looking for anything to do. In December I landed a job at a warehouse which they let us go after 3 weeks due to unneeded amount of employees (it was a temp job) all the while applying to other jobs. 

Since the beginning of 2021 I have applied to somewhere around 200+ positions, 4 rejection emails and the rest didn't even reply, thankfully I got interviewed by one company and after doing 2 interviews I have been waiting for their final reply for the last 2 weeks even though they said it'll only take 1 week to reply (doesn't exactly help my anxiety at this point). Even warehouse jobs turned me down cause I pulled my back a few weeks ago and they don't want to risk it.

I even applied to internship (non-paid) jobs just so that I can have some Canadian company experience on my resume, which they replied with only students from a Canadian educational institute  can apply for them. 

I have no idea what I am doing with my life at this point and my dad and family keep asking me how the job hunting is going, I feel useless and unmotivated even my personal projects were put on hold for a the last month cause I can't even get my mind to want to do anything. 

I'm in a country where my only friend is 100km away and with quarantine, my only social interactions with people other than my dad are through phone or the lucky day of the week when I go buy groceries.

I often worry that there might be a fire at night while I'm sleeping and I'll wake up to find my entire house in flames. Much more frequent are thoughts of home intrusions or being murdered in my sleep. If I think about this too much, I'll start imagining that there's somebody in my bedroom, and I'll imagine hearing footsteps and breathing. I can almost picture someone standing over my bed, ready to stab me any second. 

These thoughts used to be only about my own death, but more and more often, I've been imagining these things happening to my family members or friends. Just thinking about my loved ones dying gives me severe anxiety. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but these thoughts often give me full blown panic attacks. Often I'll end up sobbing and hyperventilating for almost an hour straight, unable to calm myself down. After these panic attacks I can't sleep for several hours.

I can't see a therapist at the moment since i live with my unsupportive family. Right now, sleeping is hell.

I am wondering whether anyone had an experience living in a country or culture where disorders like anxiety and OCD are downplayed, not taken seriously or just not part of the wider conversation about health. Obviously this happens all the time in places like the US, UK and Canada, but here there's this fundamental perception that you ""just need to think positively"" and ""just need to relax."" I am going on medication and don't feel like this is something people here understand or support. 

Psychotherapy really isn't common here (although I go online) and I constantly feel like people just see me as making a big deal out of things or unfriendly. Like I am being selfish by having so many triggers and just need to get over it. Obviously I am not the only one struggling with anxiety here (we're all human, after all) but talking about mental health within the framework of specific disorders just isn't as common. I feel like this invalidates my experience, but also realize that I am the one who decided to live in another country and need to accept this. 

I guess I'm just looking for some support from others who have experienced this, and perhaps interesting research on the cultural perceptions of anxiety (if that's even a thing?).

This is first time posting here, so I hope I'm in the right place.

I am a people manager, managing a team of 6 creatives at a tech company that has been thriving during the pandemic due to people being at home and using our products regularly for entertainment purposes. 

These issue is that the working conditions over the past year in my department have been really tough on me and my team. This is largely due to the increasingly heavy workload, but also a slew of process changes being driven by our leadership. 

I know my team is hurting and I'm doing everything in my power to try to make their lives easier. A couple of people on my team are not performing to expectations largely due to their own mental health, motivation issues, and in general, having a negative attitude to the changes being made (these changes are non-negotiable).

742,EmpowerUp,1616948737,1,"I‚Äôm here today to share a story of how a SWAT team crashing through my apartment door was the best thing to ever happen to me, despite it setting off my anxiety, depression and PTSD to record levels.

Why?  Because I believe that someone out there needs to hear it.

I was twenty-five and just put myself back into college after dropping out years earlier.

One evening while studying, I can still hear what sounds like a herd of stampeding elephants outside my apartment door.

Suddenly, there‚Äôs a loud smashing sound, and my apartment door comes crashing open.

Looking up from my textbook to see red lasers blinding into my eyes while a symphony of voices filled my ears, screaming, ‚Äúget down on the f‚Äôn ground.‚Äù

Confusion running through my mind as I‚Äôm viciously thrown to the floor with a knee jammed into my spine to hold me down.

As I lay on the cold floor, paralyzed in shock with a knee jammed into my spine, I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but this would be one of the best things to have ever happened to me.

You might be wondering how this could have possibly been a good thing?

This journey started at five years old when my struggles with anxiety, depression and PTSD began.

For me, my journey started at such a young age that I never knew anything but struggling and merely surviving life.

I was the stereotypical kid who was left behind.
I struggled through physical, emotional and mental abuse.
I wasn‚Äôt given the help and support I needed when it was needed most.
No one saw a future for me.
They saw no hope.

I did the bare minimum to survive grade and high school and toiled for years due to my mental health.

Many years later, however, I would go on to not only graduate from college but would achieve the unthinkable and be the only person in my family to graduate from university with my Bachelor‚Äôs degree.

The results just got better from there as I began to develop a level of inner peace I never dreamed was possible.

None of that would have happened, though, if it wasn‚Äôt for that SWAT team.

As I lay there for what felt like an eternity, the swat team realized that they hit the wrong apartment.

They were after my neighbour one door down‚Ä¶.

Oops? :(

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night and failed the exams the following day.
They left me with the parting gifts of extreme anxiety, depression and yet another PTSD moment to add to my collection.

Initially, the shock of the incident was just more proof that all I was meant to do in life was to struggle and suffer.

Because no matter how many times I tried to regain control of my life, there was always something that would derail my progress and send me crashing back down.

Maybe you can relate to that?

Once the shock began to wear off, there remained a spark of realization that had never been there before.

I had been merely surviving life, always waiting for change to come.
And all I would get is more of the same.
More garbage that always happened to me.
And just like Dory, I just kept swimming.

After waiting for decades for change to come, this spark helped me realize that it wasn‚Äôt coming.

 It woke me up.

It helped me realize I was done waiting for change to come.
I was sick and tired of always having things happen TO me.

I made a decision in that moment and every moment since to push back and fight to start having things happen FOR me.

I started to fight for change to come to me, whether it wanted to or not.

To do that, I had to transform my reality.

The problem was, I didn‚Äôt know how I would do it.

It‚Äôs not like I hadn‚Äôt tried before with the old methods.

No matter how many online videos I watched or how many podcasts I listened to,
they never give a game plan with the action steps to implement them.

No matter how many books I read,
they only give ideas but come nowhere close to providing the whole picture.

No matter how many do-it-yourself courses I took and workbooks I went through,
they stop far short of bringing permanent change.

Maybe you‚Äôve tried some or all of these things and had the same results I did?

I had to start becoming relentless and unwavering at piecing together what worked for me and, more importantly, what didn‚Äôt

As I crafted things together, I started to see results.
I was able to repeat the successes, which led to bigger and better results.

After I found out I would be a father, I really started to crack the code of my struggles.

It made me push harder because I knew that the vicious cycle of toxicity and poison would have to end, and only I could do it.

It had to be me to make sure that she wouldn‚Äôt have to live with what I went through.

The work I put in and the results I got were good, and it was what I needed to tackle the bigger and bigger chains within that held me back.

But the time came that I had to go deep within and release every big thing that I had swept under the rug my entire life. And I was ready.

Nothing will ever be perfect in life.
There will always be challenges.

But I‚Äôm in control of my anxiety and depression and living a life I never believed was possible.

I have the resilience to know that I can tackle whatever is thrown at me and be unstoppable.

I feel enough.

I feel happy and grateful.

I lived virtually my entire life believing I was broken, lost and no chance at experiencing anything else but more of the same. Because in those times, I had no reason to believe that change was ever possible.
 
 I share my story today as a hope to help that one person out there who needs a catalyst to spark the belief that there is more beyond the fog of life. 
 
 I hope my story can, in some way, be the loving and compassionate catalyst for you instead of having your own traumatic SWAT team event.

Much love to you all.

We are doing really well with the business/ financially but its a very intense life that I find myself in. My wifes mother is staying all the time now as well. Basically everyday Im surrounded by women and a needy child and I feel overwhelmed. My wife let me go away yesterday to the beach to be alone for a few days and I feel a weight off my shoulders. Im sure they are happy Im gone as well....

I feel so happy and normal now to be away from home life. But last night (after we closed our business) and most nights I feel so stressed at home and get angry very easily. Even this morning I felt wound up so much. This has been going on for yrs now and I dont know what to do. We live in the building where our business is and have to listen to the busy traffic.¬†

I feel like I should be on meds or something everyday. Ive never done this but Im really worried about my mind now (health). Im waking up at 3am all the time and dont sleep well. Im sleeping in a separate room.¬†

Ive tried seeing a psychologist but he made excuses at the end of our initial consultation about how he's going away or whatever. Maybe I was in the too hard basket for him.¬†

If this goes on and on I know that stress can kill.¬†

I sometimes take ativan at nightime when I remember and sleep really well with that. I dont know if I should take that everyday for a trial period. But concerned about addition. I dont normally like taking pills to be honest.¬†

749,cezzzie,1616946115,1,"This is basically just a vent but it would also be nice to know if others have felt/are feeling anything similar to anything I feel.

(I‚Äôm feeling really bad right now, mentally and physically, so this will probably be poorly-worded and poorly set out, sorry. I‚Äôll try and keep it short but there‚Äôs so much to say. There‚Äôs a TD;LR at the end.)

Short background/info:

I‚Äôm 17(F). I feel so incapable. I feel weak compared to everyone else. I am and always have been extremely dependent on others. This is probably something to do with the fact that my parents were very overprotective.

I have been to a therapist. The therapy didn‚Äôt help me so I‚Äôm on a ‚Äúwaiting list‚Äù right now to go see a different therapist but it‚Äôs taking a long time.

I have been to a psychiatrist. I‚Äôm on an antidepressant currently (Fluoxetine) it doesn‚Äôt seem to help though so I‚Äôm going to go back to the psychiatrist whenever I can. 

My parents know about my anxiety and depression. They‚Äôre very supportive, they don‚Äôt fully understand but they try. I‚Äôm very grateful that I have them but I just constantly feel like a burden because they‚Äôre always worried about me. I try to seem happy but it‚Äôs so difficult. 

Here‚Äôs my 5 main...issues?: 

1. The future. When I think of the future, I feel extremely anxious to the point that I feel nauseated. I believe that I won‚Äôt be able to cope. I have no idea how everyone else does it. It genuinely makes me feel suicidal. I am just never looking forward to tomorrow.

2. Outdoors/socialising. I haven‚Äôt left the house in over 3 months (mainly due to my anxiety but also because of covid) and when I do leave the house, I HAVE to have someone I trust with me but even then I‚Äôm still very anxious and cannot make eye contact never mind have a conversation. I‚Äôm also terrified that something bad is going to happen (even though I know it‚Äôs unlikely.)

3. School/Education. From the ages of 13-16 I didn‚Äôt attend school (UK) at all, or even do any school work due to anxiety, depression and not having any help at all from the school. I have no qualifications and feel stupid. I tried college for 1 day last year but I had a panic attack, went home and never went back. So now I feel like I have already ruined my future anyway. I also feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cope doing ANY job. I can barely do anything for myself.

4. Health anxiety. Oh boy, I didn‚Äôt even have this at all until covid came around but now I‚Äôm so anxious about my health and my parents health, not just the thought of getting covid but even the thought of getting something like the flu makes me anxious. I cared about health previously but now I think about it so much and get very anxious. The thought of having a health problem which would cause me to have to stay overnight in a hospital terrifies me. I never went to sleepovers because I have to sleep in my own bed. Even when my parents would move my bed to a different place in my room I would have to move it back because I can‚Äôt seem to cope with any changes, I don‚Äôt know why. Also my cat sleeps next to me every single night and I couldn‚Äôt sleep without that.

5. Food/Water? I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to add this one but I barely eat anything and barely drink anything but I am a healthy weight. I guess this kind of goes with the health anxiety but I‚Äôm worried to eat anything because I‚Äôm scared it will make me sick. I rarely feel thirsty but I‚Äôm trying to drink more water lately. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôm anxious about everything and it‚Äôs making me lose the will to live I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. The only reason I‚Äôm alive is my parents and my pets. I don‚Äôt want them to be sad. That‚Äôs my only reason. (Wow that made me cry. For the last few weeks I‚Äôve felt so...numb?

This surprisingly doesn't go for everyone I know online. I want to message a certain friend but it has been almost 3 days and I'm still unable to. I'm scared of making them tired of me, scared of overwhelming them, burdening them by accidentally messaging them too much. I am also very afraid of them ignoring me. I've known them only since november and they're pretty nice to talk to but I feel like I'm going to ruin all of that. Whenever I don't get a response after a while of waiting I delete the message because I feel like I said something bad or I might've been annoying.

781,skyfallboy,1616928814,1,"Hello folks today I wanna address the main reason why the majority of people experience Anxiety on a daily basis or from time to time .. what you have to know in first place is your nerves system / unconscious mind can't talk to you in English or in a clear language so that's why when you're being exposed to a trauma of an emotional pressure because of a problem or an accident, the body starts to generate Anxiety and other physical/Emotional symptoms just a way to get rid of the shock and the Emotional conflict that you faced when you had that event happened to you .. so instead of focusing on medicating your anxiety or other symptoms you should get to the cause which is gonna be stored Inside your body, I suggest that you guys start processing your berried Emotions and energy coz that's the only effective way to discharge the pressure of Emotions that keeps torturing you by experiencing a range of different symptoms such as : 

- lack of focus
- panic attacks
- insomnia
- feeling tired all the time
- failure in Relationships because you can't maintain a stable Emotional connection
- getting lost in your aggressive thoughts 

So on and so forth as I said before the symptoms are wide different but most of the time the cause is the same which is trauma. 

Hope you guys got some value from this post, if you wanna know more be free to ask :)",Anxiety,Anxiety is only a way of communication from your unconscious mind,2021-03-28 21:53:34

I had my first panic attack 5 years ago when I was overseas with family. Since then, I‚Äôve had these attacks around once/twice a year. However, in the past two years, it has been happening a lot more frequently, around once every few months. Between the attacks I also often felt extremely panic-ky in some moments, but I‚Äôm usually able to calm myself down with some coping mechanisms I‚Äôve discovered for myself over the years.

The increase in frequency of these attacks and the psychological burden of constantly fearing another attack encouraged me to seek professional help. I‚Äôve been in therapy for around 6 months now. My therapist believes I have anxiety, but I find it difficult to believe.

I‚Äôve never been afraid of meeting people / speaking in public, and my panic attacks always seem very random with no obvious trigger. Everytime I see people talk about anxiety, it‚Äôs always about hating social settings, feeling unconfident or anxious in front of strangers etc. I feel like I can‚Äôt to relate to all these symptoms, which makes me feel confused.

I realize that I do a very toxic thing where any time I notice any progress I get incredibly hopeful that I will finally be able to beat my anxiety and then I feel terrible when I have a very anxious day a few days later. **How can I accurately manage my expectations?** This has led me to feeling a lot of guilt especially since I am more aware than ever before about the extent of my anxiety and how it influences how/what I think about, but it's that knowing what I am doing wrong doesn't make me stop latching on to anxious thoughts, which has recently led to a lot of overthinking (and overthinking about overthinking) and guilt.

A lot of my anxiety is not just that x person doesn't like me, it is a fear that is made complicated enough that disproving it becomes impossible. It's like I have this fundamental feeling that while I know people like me, they only like me to the extent that they behave in the nice way that they do, but in reality they do not fully like me, and it is a matter of time until I do something to decrease the amount that they like me, or the rest of the way to go is impossible to achieve and I am just unlikable enough that they won‚Äôt want to like me any more.

I just feel so guilty about being anxious even though I'm super aware of what I'm doing, and then when I am vulnerable and open up to friends I feel like I am burdening them (especially because it feels like they think anxiety is all I talk about). **How do I talk about my issues with friends so that its not me just talking and get them to  ask me questions and check in with me occasionally so it feels like they want to help?**",Anxiety,Overthinking and Guilt,2021-03-28 19:56:04

800,imbadatwukong,1616917315,1,"hello, im in quite a tough spot right now. Ive been depressed and anxious for a very long time, but have always kept it all to myself and delt with it on my own. About two years ago, i started dating a girl, who would become one of the most important people in my life. She helped me through many things, including a sexual trauma i had from when i was young. When we started dating, she was also at a horrible part of her life, so i helped her through it, took care of her when shit went south, and tried my best to teach her to love herself. I was able to, but she became extremely dependent on me, and seeing that, and knowing how unstable I am, i decided to end things there, for her sake. However, i went out of it completely shattered, i had lost the one person i had that assisted me in day to day livign, and the possibly worst part: i had kinda became sexually dependent on her. We spent about 4 months without talking to each other, but quickly went back to talking, as we still cared for each others well being. 

She said shes in a phase where shes only attracted to women, and doesnt see it going away soon. I am completely lost here, because im fine not being her boyfriend, and not being able to have sex, but the idea of her doing anything sexual makes me go insane. Im second guessing everything i ever did to her in the sexual part. I always made sure she knew she deserved limits, she was always supposed to ask me to stop if she didnt feel like it. I dont know if she will keep those memories, or remember it fondly. And my anxiety just completely fucks my brain up whenever i ser a girl, and i just start thinking ‚Äúis that who shes going to be banging? what will she do to my friend? will they be okay? will she respect her? will she be fine?‚Äù and when i lay down to sleep, i cant stop picturing her masturbating herself, and some other weird shit that make me want to shoot myself in the head. 

I know part of it is myself not accepting she wont come back, and its ok, i do need time to take it in, but im going crazy, i cant stop having anxiety attacks thinking of lesbian sex, and i dont even fucking know why? i just wanted to know she‚Äôll be okay, that she did enjoy it all, she did love me. I dont know if i can confront a reality where all of it was fake to her, just a facade. Where she didnt enjoy my kisses, the sex, the pasta or the fucking cake id bake to her.


im sorry, this was kinda of a vent, but i cant stop thinking. ive never been able to stop thinking, never ever. I just want to take care of her now.

Now that the vaccine is available, I can already tell that people feel a lot more relaxed about hanging out and I already anticipate that saying no will be more of a conversation again.

I have some difficulty connecting with my close family and I also have isolated myself from social interactions in some way that is still confusing and also difficult somehow. I've tried reaching out to people on reddit on those ""r/MakeFriendsHere"" kind of subreddit, and it just have strengthen my resistance of digital social interaction...

Anyway... Besides the tiredness I was feeling, I'm writing this 3 hours past the time I went to bed, after trying meditation and other stuff, but this insomnia just kicked in hard today and now I just accepted that it might take a while for me to be able to sleep today.

I just wish I had someone to talk to, someone that feels my pain and has a heart so kind that I'm able to feel even trough this cold screen. But either way, I'm still comfortable with just sharing my discomfort here, no hopes (since I feel like I've lost them all, I guess).

822,AphexyTwin,1616905991,1,"18 male. Prescribed: Vyvanse, Adderall, Gabapentin, Trazodone. I have also been on various SSRI from childhood.

I have been dealing with bad Anxiety and Depression since I was 12. I also have ADHD and was diagnosed at 16. I smoked marijuana daily from ages 14-16 in order to self-medicate for ADHD and Anxiety. I also used nicotine vapes (puff bars, juul). I no longer smoke or vape for reasons I will explain below.

Right before my 17th birthday, I developed an extremely uncomfortable Globus Pharyngeus after a suspected upper respiratory infection. I attributed the globus sensation to marijuana tar from my lungs getting stuck in my throat because I was also coughing up brown phlegm. As you can imagine, this caused me extreme anxiety and I went to my doctor. I was referred to an ENT and a GI doctor and diagnosed with GERD/LPR. My doctors suspect that the stomach acid and pepsin from my acid reflux reaches up into my throat and causes the globus. 

Over a year has passed since I stopped smoking marijuana and my symptoms are still present. I have learned how to properly take care of myself (diet, exercise, therapy/meds) but I still have massive anxiety over my throat. My main fear isn‚Äôt that it means I have a serious illness, but I am afraid the feeling will never go away.

Every doctor has told me the same thing: I need to get my anxiety under control because it is probably preventing my body from healing. I am clearing my throat and swallowing all day. I used to try and cough up the mucus that I felt in my throat, but I now actively avoid this because I know it is counterproductive. As hard as I try, I cannot go without clearing my throat. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just anxiety, but it feels like I might choke or suffocate if I don‚Äôt do either. It‚Äôs almost like how people with Tourettes describe tics.

It feels like I have exhausted all other options besides asking for a strong anxiety medication to help. I have read multiple accounts of people with similar symptoms experiencing relief with Valium. I am so desperate right now. My thought process is that if I am able to alleviate some of the physical anxiety symptoms I have (clearing throat, coughing, feeling like mucus is stuck) then my throat may be able to heal itself properly. 

I am nervous that my doctor will think I am drug seeking. I know that Valium has high abuse potential and people my age should not take it. I am desperate for help because I do not have a life anymore, I break down almost every day over this. My mother has even voiced that she supports this, but I know it isn‚Äôt up to her.

My brother tricked me into laying down on his floor and penetrated my vagina with his finger, causing a lot of pain. When I recalled this memory for the first time in years, I started having a panic attack and did not allow myself to think about the rest. I tried my hardest to distract myself. 

When I got older, I started looking for proof that I got molested, because I deal with a lot of self-doubt and denial. One minute I believed myself, the other minute I told myself I‚Äôm lying to myself and am crazy. Mainly because my parents told me what he did was not that bad and normal sibling experimenting. But also, the memory feels very distressing so it feels easier to tell myself I made it up. 

I recently went on a search for my medical records to see if sexual abuse was ever suspected by my pediatrician. Because when I got a UTI, with a lot of bleeding, that landed me in the hospital, I was mandated to do therapy by my pediatrician right afterwards. 

However, my medical records showed no suspicions of sexual abuse. The only thing that I saw was that around age nine, I was in the doctors almost every week complaining of frequent headaches, nausea, and stomach aches, and unexplained pains in my wrists and legs that would cause a limp. After doing a lot of medical tests, I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety at ten years old. They chalked all the symptoms up to being psychosomatic.

I tapered and finally stopped taking zyprexa between christmas/new years because I had grown sick some of the side effects. Anyway, I would like to ask if anyone might recognize this kind of situation regarding GAD or otherwise severe anxiety, perhaps periods where there has been a rapid increase of anxiety in particular.

I've never felt mentally ill to such a crippling degree as has been the case during 2021 so far, and until a week or two ago I had super intense, if usually short-lived, panic attacks every night, at least once but mostly twice if not more. Whenever I have attacks they usually happen seemingly at the very moment I'm losing consciousness falling asleep. Recently, I have consistently ended up more or less jumping out of bed convinced someone was walking into my apartment with murderous intent. The conviction itself would last a couple seconds maybe, but all in all, every night was pretty horrible partly because I always expected this to happen while trying to fall asleep.

So, fairly recently the panic attacks seem to have mostly stopped. But the last few days, every night I will wake up a couple of times during the night, confused that I might somehow be recording myself and there's people able to hear what I say through my phone or pc (tiny apartment, these two things are always close to me) if I speak out loud. I'll do so to test if it's true, and I often feel like it should be which leaves me even more confused as to what's going on when there is no response. This confusion can last while I get out of bed, go to the bathroom and get back to bed before I realize how ridiculous it is. That this kind of thing happens so consistently lately is a new state of affairs for me.

I rode the SSRI gravy train for 13 years and enjoyed almost complete symptom remission from OCD/Panic.

Bipolar had other plans. Moods kept getting more and more unstable no matter what mood stabilizer we tried. Eventually it devolved into hellish rapid cycling. Paxil is the culprit, and we're tapering.

I can handle the bs withdrawal symptoms. They're not fun, but they're manageable. But lord, the anxiety. We tapered too fast on the first try and the resulting anxiety/panic set in a few days into the taper. It was ridiculous.

Every missed call, every date cancellation, every disappointment turns into feelings of ‚Äúoh this time they‚Äôre going to leave me‚Äù. This feeling only goes away once I hear from them and we make plans to see each other or I‚Äôm in their company and know everything is fine.

859,RyntheRabbit,1616894682,1,"Hello fellow anxiety havers! This post will be kinda long (tl:dr at bottom) but full story will have a better understanding.

I wanted to first start off by saying that I've been taking propranolol for the past 3 years usually 5 days at a time ( stayed in on the weekends so no need to take). When i first started taking it i was prescribed 60mg ER and to take it at night. I noticed maybe slight dizziness for the first month or so but nothing i really couldn't overcome. Over the years i weaned offed 60mg to 20mg and take it usually 1hr -2 before i go out. I felt great, i got through senior year and college with it. I still had anxious thoughts but with my physical symptoms gone, i felt like they were less rampant. However because the pandemic i really stopped taking it besides maybe once a week or sometimes not at all.

Heres where the issue comes in, i tried taking 20mg again and after the second day i was having weird heart palpitations (the type that feel like you're falling in a dream) i was genuinely scared for my heart, and each time it knocked me breathless (i think this is happening because I've become very physically lazy and my heart rate wasn't crazy to begin with so my overall bmp was very low compared to when i began taking it)and then dizziness. I cut back to 10mg and still was dizzy but the heart palpitations went away. If i took 10mg i was dizzy, if i didnt take it i was dizzy until 12-24hrs passed. 

I took this issue to my doctor after stopping it, (which the dr is a trigger) when he measured my heart rate it was 120bmp and agreed that i might have to be on some form of heart medicine, which i informed him my heart only gets like that when im anxious, and it was left at that. Then he prescribed me a form of paxil, and oh my god it was horrible. First off he gave me 20mg(which i have learned from here, is a big no no, esp bc im a small woman) I felt nausea, dizzy, headaches, eye soreness, and couldn't hold a single thought. I was so drugged up i couldnt eat or sleep and coming off that dose felt awful. Not to mention i havent had a physical panic attack in years, which was hard to control. I havent felt my heart race like that in a long time and that caused more panic. Im on my second day off it and still feeling dizzy and having a weak stomach. My doctor now called in Lexapro 10mg but I'm honestly not sure if SSRI medicine is for me? Not to mention one of my triggers is being sick so you can imagine how much of a wreck i was on paxil. I now contemplate if dizziness would be better to push through than deal with SSRI side effects.

Should I take the Lexapro or should i give my propranolol another chance, perhaps taking it at night to reduce the side effects? Has anyone felt this way about propranolol and how did you get back on it?

TL;DR stopped taking propranolol over quarantine, tried taking it again and made me feel dizzy, was prescribed Paxil variant and had the worst side effects, now given new script of lexapro and hesitant to take it at all. should i try propranolol again and how do i manage propranolol side effects if i do?",Anxiety,"Paxil was awful, hesitant to try Lexapro, Should I try my old reliable again (propranolol) even though I'm having side effects?",2021-03-28 12:24:42

Like many people, I experience crippling anticipatory anxiety before presentations, interviews, high pressure meetings.

Although unmedicated organ extraction is a more inviting prospect than giving a speech, ive come to reluctantly accept that exposing myself to the fear is the only way out. 

However, that is easier said than done... This afternoon, whilst ruminating over a dreaded upcoming panel interview, I realised I'd really benefit from having an online platform to practice on. 

I imagine something like omegle minus unsolicited genitals.  Available on demand. Users could select the number of people to speak to and the activity (e.g. presentations, practicing round-the-room introductions. Could be adapted depending on comfort level.)

864,Vanilla-Long,1616891875,1,"So I'm 18 now and have a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome that I received when I was around 6/7 that has always caused me severe anxiety issues. I moved out to uni about 6 months ago which has so far been great for me and my parent's relationship. Previously it had been very strained as throughout my whole childhood I have argued a lot with my parents and caused a lot of arguments between them. Socially I would say I am basically neurotypical and haven't really had issues in that area since before I was a teenager. My main issues have always been with emotional regulation and demand avoidance, basically when I get upset I can have uncontrollable meltdowns consisting of crying, shouting, hitting objects and saying things I don't mean. It is insanely hard for me to calm down from these meltdowns and at its worst it can take hours. I take full responsibility for all my actions, meltdown or not because at the end of the day they are still my actions to own. The worst of it is the link to demand avoidance where I find myself filled with uncontrollable anger and stress when I am asked to do even the simplest of tasks sometimes. This has, inevitably, caused a lot of tension and arguments between me and my parents. In addition, my severe anxiety has had a huge impact on my parent's lives as I have been unable to cope with and do certain things and was even unable to go to school for almost a year when I was around 8. My parents have done the best they can but all of this drama and negativity has put a huge strain on their relationship and has resulted in many irreversibly hurtful comments aimed at me, it never helped that I have a younger neurotypical brother who is very laid back and different to me. Throughout my whole childhood, it was relayed to me either subconsciously or through comments made to me in anger that I have caused huge problems for them both individually and relationship-wise and I can see the impact I have had on my mother especially as she is much more emotional than my father. I tried to seek help all through my childhood ranging from CBT to family therapies that basically just turned into us all sat talking to a therapist about how much I was damaging my parent's lives. I have was on antidepressants from 12 until 14 which only resulted in side effects and suicidal mood swings. 

I am left with insane guilt that takes over every aspect of my life, I just can't let go of the fact that I have caused such harm and distress to the lives of people that I love so much. When I was a teen this came out in nightly self-harm which again when discovered by my parents only hurt them even more. I have said so many things to them in my meltdowns that I would do anything to take back. I don't think I will ever be able to forgive myself no matter how much I try to be as great and thoughtful of a daughter as I can be I just fear it's too late. I am left with constant anxiety, depersonalization and panic attacks which I self-medicate with both dark web bought diazepam and the small amount I get prescribed each month. 

Last night I had a vivid dream about me having a meltdown and my mother snapping and driving us both into a lake to our deaths and it has just hit me how much this is tearing me up. Is this something anyone else has experienced? I just want to know what I can do to try and reclaim my life back from this overwhelming guilt.",Anxiety,Anyone else have insane guilt about their childhood and how their difficulties affected their parents?,2021-03-28 11:37:55

899,fuckingfucku,1616875705,1,"Hi!  I‚Äôm curious if there are others out there who solely have used a beta blocker for their anxiety?  If so how does it help (or not) you?

A little background about me: 

39/F,  Anxiety (GAD, Health, Death), Depression, PTSD (Trauma from long-term childhood abuse), and OCD.

My anxiety has been an ongoing battle and the worst of things I‚Äôve been dealing with.  To keep things short as possible, my anxiety causes anxiety, because why not?  One of my many symptoms, involves a high heart rate which doesn‚Äôt always come down now, even with breathing exercises/relaxation.  

I have done all the usual things, including seeing a great cardiologist.  My family has a history of heart issues and such so that has not helped matters mentally.  Thanks to having a vastly different diet and lifestyle to my family I have lower blood pressure (it is considered normal low) which recently started spiking due to anxiety.  I have received an otherwise clear bill of health in every way but that hasn‚Äôt changed the fact my heart rate will be incredibly high at times, which I‚Äôve learned recently is sometimes my only anxiety symptom.  As in why is my heart racing?  Oh!  I‚Äôm anxious!  This can sometimes last for a solid week or more.

All this to say that I‚Äôve had many such episodes lately, all exhausting and more easily triggered thanks to the pandemic.  Recently my cardiologist and my doctor have recommended thinking of a low/micro dose of a beta blocker as I‚Äôm essentially ALWAYS in fight/flight mode as I‚Äôve dealt with some intense stress/anxiety for so long.  The concern has been that because I do have lower blood pressure, and beta blockers are known to help with that, we don‚Äôt want it to get too low since that‚Äôs obviously not good either.  So I‚Äôm curious from anyone taking one and bonus points if you too are a lower/normal on the BP scale:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How has the beta blocker helped you with your anxiety?  Please feel free to share your background if you‚Äôre comfortable with that.
2. Have you used a beta blocker as a temporary medication vs. super long term so you could work through things? This can be anything from using it for anxiety attacks to taking it for a few years and then weaning off as things are doing better.
3. What side-effects if any have you experienced from taking a beta blocker?
4. Has this impacted your ability to exercise?
5. Anything else you‚Äôd like to share?

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm very sensitive to medications and due to how I grew up I am very adverse to taking things unless absolutely necessary, so I‚Äôm trying to make a decision on how to best tackle this possibility and one thing that helps me is learning from others experiences.  At that end, thank you for reading and any potential responses!  I really appreciate it.",Anxiety,Beta Blockers for Anxiety,2021-03-28 07:08:25

If the adrenaline response is too great for too long, your heart might not be able to keep up, causing tissue damage or, worse, a heart that stops beating altogether. In fact, any strong emotional reaction can trigger fatal amounts of a chemical, such as adrenaline, in the body. It happens very rarely, but it can happen to anyone.

915,YourBoiJimmay,1616872777,1,"Hello, so my life I feel has gotten terrible and I have no idea when I'll start feeling better. During my senior year of high school, I was feeling great. Did whatever I wanted, had fun, lots of friends to keep me busy, and anxiety wasn't controlling my life. Then I went to college and, I hated it there. I made literally no friends and was just alone for two semesters. And I suffer from OCD/intrusive thoughts so being alone with your thoughts like that and no excitement on campus takes a toll on you. These awful thoughts would just come into my head and it made me feel like a terrible person, even though I didn't mean anything I was thinking. I was starting to feel weird mid-way through the 2nd semester (Feburary 2021) like I was getting headaches and afraid of going on highways (they're overwhelming to me). Then quarantine/2020 craziness happened a month later and it destroyed me, and I feel like I've only been getting worse since. I have not driven on the highway in almost a year, and I'm generally really nervous just driving around my town. Somedays, I'm too anxious to leave my house at all (I can't even walk a mile, and I used to be able to run miles for cross country in high school). Sometimes I get too anxious, become lightheaded, and crawl back into bed.

I've just been feeling down and literally, everything drains me.  I'm not sure why I'm like this but I'm not seeing a therapist and here are some things worth noting. I get terrible sleep, and often just have trouble going to sleep early. Been trying to fix it the past few months but, it's still been inconstant. My house/family is often loud. I transferred colleges (to a better school but one with a bigger workload), and I'm often stressed about homework and sometimes have no motivation to do it. A majority of my close friends are away at college, or I haven't done anything exciting with them in a while due to the virus. I also caught the virus in January (if that's worth noting). I also drink a lot of caffeine if that contributes to my anxiety problem. I also (sorry to be gross but) suffer a masturbation addiction and I wonder if that's making me feel emotionally numb. I only started masturbating during college, and I was a lot happier when I didn't do it at all in high school. But I got a gf at the end of high school (who I'm still with) and started masturbating during my lonely semesters at college. Then I became sexually active with her which is great but, I think masturbating multiple times a day is a problem but I'm having trouble stopping.

Sorry, a lot's on my mind with that last paragraph. It's worth I love my gf but, this is def impacting our relationship. She's understanding but it's tough when I can't go out and do anything. Point is, I'm starting to get worried. I wanted to come on here because I need to ask if anyone else has gone through this? Will I get better? My therapist just told me to get better sleep right now, manage my time, and do neurofeedback training. I've been doing this (somewhat inconstantly) for the past two months maybe but, not feeling better.

My friend has been dealing with it since age 16, She is 19 right now. 

It‚Äôs where she has  these uncomfortable impulses from various things, such as trauma triggers or things that reminds her of them or her situation, offensive words and phrases, and when her comfort thoughts and memories come in the wrong place/time, or when her trauma thoughts and memories come at the wrong place/time. 

And when this impulse occurs, she does a variety of things to suppress them, such as pinching herself, scratching herself, closing her ears, screaming out loud words, phrases, and made up stuff, and such. It was worse before she got on an antipsychotic, but she still deals with it. The antipsychotic reduced the intrusive thoughts, but the other things still occur. When I‚Äôm around in public, she finds something that doesn‚Äôt stand out to do. She will basically look away from everything for a sec or two, and hit herself on the thigh, do the grunts and yelling at a lower voice, close her ears or squeezes her eyes for a split second more than normal, and such.

I am also a research assistant and I work around 20 hours a week. I used to love my boss and my job but lately I cannot get my act together or meet deadlines and my boss is growing increasingly frustrated with me. I missed a meeting for work unintentionally and my boss was very upset. It feels like I keep messing up no matter what I do and I can hardly focus. I cried for two hours this morning.

I have woken up at 6 AM every single day for two weeks trying to catch up and I just sit and stare at my computer, unable to even bring myself to do something as simple as open my emails. I dread and fear it so much.

My boss called me on Monday and asked why I hadn't finished a very simple task I was supposed to finish forever ago. I didn't even know what to say. I promised I would get it done and then I got a call from my mom telling me my aunt has late stage breast cancer and will die in the next few months. I barely know this aunt as she has lived on the other side of the world for the majority of my life, but I had even more added stress as her doctors think she has the BRCA 1 gene. If she has it, then I might have it too. We are waiting on her genetic testing and depending on the results I will have to be tested as well.

It all just feels like too much for me. I can't stop crying, my chest and throat feel so tight, and when I'm not crying I'm hyperventilating. I told my boss I was struggling with my mental health and she was sympathetic at first and let me take off two days but now she is getting very annoyed with me.

We lost two coworkers and haven't been able to replace them, and my other coworker is out because she just got married. I feel so much pressure and like I'm a failure.

These tips are for people who are coping with everyday fears. If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition, see our page on generalised anxiety disorder.

1. Take time out
It's impossible to think clearly when you're flooded with fear or anxiety. The first thing to do is take time out so you can physically calm down.

Distract yourself from the worry for 15 minutes by walking around the block, making a cup of tea or having a bath.

2. Breathe through panic
If you start to get a faster heartbeat or sweating palms, the best thing is not to fight it.

Stay where you are and simply feel the panic without trying to distract yourself. Place the palm of your hand on your stomach and breathe slowly and deeply.

The goal is to help the mind get used to coping with panic, which takes the fear of fear away.

Try this breathing technique for stress

3. Face your fears
Avoiding fears only makes them scarier. Whatever your fear, if you face it, it should start to fade. If you panic one day getting into a lift, for example, it's best to get back into a lift the next day.

4. Imagine the worst
Try imagining the worst thing that can happen ‚Äì perhaps it's panicking and having a heart attack. Then try to think yourself into having a heart attack. It's just not possible. The fear will run away the more you chase it.

5. Look at the evidence
It sometimes helps to challenge fearful thoughts. For example, if you're scared of getting trapped in a lift and suffocating, ask yourself if you have ever heard of this happening to someone. Ask yourself what you would say to a friend who had a similar fear.

6. Don't try to be perfect
Life is full of stresses, yet many of us feel that our lives must be perfect. Bad days and setbacks will always happen, and it's important to remember that life is messy.

7. Visualise a happy place
Take a moment to close your eyes and imagine a place of safety and calm. It could be a picture of you walking on a beautiful beach, or snuggled up in bed with the cat next to you, or a happy memory from childhood. Let the positive feelings soothe you until you feel more relaxed.

8. Talk about it
Sharing fears takes away a lot of their scariness. If you can't talk to a partner, friend or family member, call a helpline such as Breathing Space on 0800 83 85 87 or Samaritans on 116 123.

You could also try a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach over the telephone, with a service such as NHS Living Life. If you would like to find out more about this appointment-based service, you can visit the Living Life website or phone 0800 328 9655 (Mon to Fri, 1pm to 9pm).‚Äã

If your fears aren't going away, you can ask your GP for help. GPs can refer people for counselling, psychotherapy or help through an online mental health service, such as Living Life to the Full.

9. Go back to basics
Lots of people turn to alcohol or drugs to self-treat anxiety, but this will only make matters worse. Simple, everyday things like a good night's sleep, a wholesome meal and a walk are often the best cures for anxiety.

10. Reward yourself
Finally, give yourself a treat. When you've made that call you've been dreading, for example, reinforce your success by treating yourself to a massage, a country walk, a meal out, a book, a DVD, or whatever little gift makes you happy.",Anxiety,How to cope with fears,2021-03-18 01:34:41

Panic attacks are sudden, intense surges of fear, panic, or anxiety. They are overwhelming, and they have physical as well as emotional symptoms.

Many people with panic attacks may have difficulty breathing, sweat profusely, tremble, and feel their hearts pounding.

Some people will also experience chest pain and a feeling of detachment from reality or themselves during a panic attack, so they may think they‚Äôre having a heart attack. Others have reported feeling like they are having a stroke.

Panic attacks can be scary and may hit you quickly. Here are 11 strategies you can use to try to stop a panic attack when you‚Äôre having one or when you feel one coming on:

1. Use deep breathing
While hyperventilating is a symptom of panic attacks that can increase fear, deep breathing can reduce symptoms of panic during an attack.

If you‚Äôre able to control your breathing, you‚Äôre less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms ‚Äî and the panic attack itself ‚Äî worse.

Focus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four:


2. Recognize that you‚Äôre having a panic attack
By recognizing that you‚Äôre having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you‚Äôre OK.

Take away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms.

3. Close your eyes
Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you‚Äôre in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.

To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.


4. Practice mindfulness
Mindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what‚Äôs around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it‚Äôs approaching or actually happening.

Focus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.

5. Find a focus object
Some people find it helpful to find a single object to focus all of their attention on during a panic attack. Pick one object in clear sight and consciously note everything about it possible.

For example, you may notice how the hand on the clock jerks when it ticks, and that it‚Äôs slightly lopsided. Describe the patterns, color, shapes, and size of the object to yourself. Focus all of your energy on this object, and your panic symptoms may subside.


6. Use muscle relaxation techniques
Much like deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques can help stop your panic attack in its tracks by controlling your body‚Äôs response as much as possible.

Consciously relax one muscle at a time, starting with something simple like the fingers in your hand, and move your way up through your body.

Muscle relaxation techniques will be most effective when you‚Äôve practiced them beforehand.

7. Picture your happy place
What‚Äôs the most relaxing place in the world that you can think of? A sunny beach with gently rolling waves? A cabin in the mountains?

Picture yourself there, and try to focus on the details as much as possible. Imagine digging your toes into the warm sand, or smelling the sharp scent of pine trees.

This place should be quiet, calm, and relaxing ‚Äî no streets of New York or Hong Kong, no matter how much you love the cities in real life.


8. Engage in light exercise
Endorphins keep the blood pumping in exactly the right away. It can help flood our body with endorphins, which can improve our mood. Because you‚Äôre stressed, choose light exercise that‚Äôs gentle on the body, like walking or swimming.

The exception to this is if you‚Äôre hyperventilating or struggling to breathe. Do what you can to catch your breath first.

9. Keep lavender on hand
Lavender is known for being soothing and stress-relieving. It can help your body relax. If you know you‚Äôre prone to panic attacks, keep some lavender essential oil on hand and put some on your forearms when you experience a panic attack. Breathe in the scent.

You can also try drinking lavender or chamomile tea. Both are relaxing and soothing.

Lavender should not be combined with benzodiazepines. This combination can cause intense drowsiness.

10. Repeat a mantra internally
Repeating a mantra internally can be relaxing and reassuring, and it can give you something to grasp onto during a panic attack.

Whether it‚Äôs simply ‚ÄúThis too shall pass,‚Äù or a mantra that speaks to you personally, repeat it on loop in your head until you feel the panic attack start to subside.

11. Take benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines may help treat panic attacks if you take one as soon as you feel an attack coming on.

While other approaches to the treatment of panic may be preferential, the field of psychiatry has acknowledged that there is a handful of people who will neither respond fully (or at all in some cases) to the other approaches listed in above, and as such, will be dependent on pharmacological approaches to therapy.

These approaches often will include benzodiazepines, some of which carry FDA approval for the treatment of this condition, such as alprazolam (Xanax).

Because benzodiazepines are a prescription medication, you‚Äôll likely need a panic disorder diagnosis in order to have the medication on hand.

This medication can be highly addictive, and the body can adjust to it over time. It should only be used sparingly and in cases of extreme need.",Anxiety,Coping with panic attacks,2021-03-18 01:23:07

962,LazyCock,1615985754,1,"M/46. One of the worst parts about my anxiety is that I retreat further and further into myself and withdraw from everyone. This really sucks, because the more I need the interaction, the further I pull myself away. Negative interactions make it worse, then I second-guess myself and pull away more.

This really magnified itself in the summer of 2019. My marriage came to a screeching halt, my mother succumbed to cancer, and I just fell to pieces. You don‚Äôt really understand what you have in place until the foundations buckle under your feet. I ended up in a new place, only seeing my daughter every other week. I tried hard to make it work, made visible progress, but I was shattered internally.  

Then the pandemic hit a few short months later.

Since the pandemic started, I ended up creating the smallest box possible to put myself in. Not having the solid work ritual of driving to, working, then driving home made my work suffer. Working from home had become the ultimate curse. Basic work items filled me with fear, and it shouldn‚Äôt be that way at all. It should be routine stepping stones, but it was akin to mountain after mountain.

Now I feel pressure all over. Pressure with work, family, friends, relationships, everything. I retreat further and further into the box. If it wasn‚Äôt for the relationship with my girlfriend, I think I might have ended up in a much worse spot with no way out.

There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that I need help and assistance. My problem is the antidepressants I‚Äôve tried seem to cause more disconnect and withdrawal. And with each different therapist I try, I feel like a fool. A lot of talking about the same things, new treatments based on the same concept. Running in place. Probably the worst thing about this is when I do try, I generate mistrust because the treatments fail. My body reacts strangely to most medicines in that I feel extreme fatigue with almost everything.

This is mental illness. And it‚Äôs just exhausting. I fear there is no real fix. And the way my brain overreacts and drains me of energy... I‚Äôm going to die a bit sooner than I was expecting. There will be a point where I just give up. I don‚Äôt want it to be like that.

Like... Literally every damn day. How can I live in peace when every day something shitty happens and I fear doing anything at all more and more?? I know this is exaggerated and probably not-such-a-big-deal for most people... but every time something ""bad"" happens, my day is ruined and I just want to go to sleep or off myself. I go through a roller-coaster of emotions every day and every time something stresses me, I can't help but fantasize about shooting myself. Even tho I manage my depression okay-ish at this point... I just can't find any positivity nor stability in my life. At least not for long. And if I find it, it's gone by the next shitty thing that happens, because that always throws me off the wagon again. It's just an exhausting, never ending circle. I get anxious about everything! Making calls, going grocery shopping, driving, talking... sometimes I'm anxious about something that has already happened, even tho I know it makes no sense. Like, I just sit in my room and suddenly feel anxious about a job interview I had weeks ago?? Why?? 

There are a thousand examples how it ruins my day every time. Over and over again. I just can't stop this anxiety. It weights me down so much when I fck up again and again and fuels my anxious thoughts. I'm so embarrassed by all of my stupid mistakes that I make all the time. It makes me feel even more worthless and I worry all the time about everything already. There isn't a single day that I'm not completely stressed out about... Well my life. Most days I'm so stressed, I have a burning headache by the time I go to bed. Sometimes it stays for days non-stop. Which stresses me out even more... 

I know there is no reason to be stressed constantly and I already talked to my therapist about it... But none of the relaxation techniques seem to be working so I always end up coping in... bad ways. Which stresses AGAIN because it makes me feel like a failure. Is all of this a symptom of my depression?? Or is it just my personality? I wasn't always like this, it kinda ""developed"" in the last  3 years or so and got gradually worse during the last few months. By now I'm a complete fck up, I mess up appointments, I do so many things wrong (even simple things, that I've done 1000 times before), forget important stuff, mess up appointments and feel overwhelmed by everything that is going on - while beeing anxious and embarrassed about myself 24/7. I just want to chill one day and not... be. Not be stressed about my life, my future, everything. Not be anxious about going for a walk or calling a friend.

So, I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I suddenly got a fear that I would turn into a pedophile somehow (despite being disgusted by the thought of children like that, immediately turned off whenever I got a thought of them like that my entire life up until now.),, i have ocd and once I feared I was a cannibal, another time I feared I was gay, (all of which I ended up not being) but now it turned into fear of turning into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I am one now, because just ew. But I‚Äôm terrified of turning into one

So I was having anxiety over it today and I had a compulsion. Once I read a story of a guy who looked at shota which is like anime drawings of boys who are young teens or pre teens i think and said he wished he never got into that stuff because maybe he wouldn‚Äôt be a pedo then. And I got so scared that if I saw shota I would be attracted and turn into a pedophile. So I had a compulsion to look at a picture of a shota (this seems counterintuitive and it is, but that‚Äôs what my compulsions are like. When I had religious ocd that god would do something bad to me I had compulsions to search up people who had bad experiences with God because my whacked brain thought somehow that would soothe my ocd which it only made it worse. I felt like I HAD to search up these experiences and read them because if I didn‚Äôt idk I just had to and I hated it)

Looking at it immediately it just grossed me out. It wasn‚Äôt porn or anything, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stomach looking at that. It was of a boy maybe 12? I‚Äôm 15, so that‚Äôs a 3 year difference but still it was an anime drawing so they could‚Äôve been younger or older I don‚Äôt know. I had a fear that I would find attraction to it, and though i guess a 3 year age difference wouldn‚Äôt be the worst, my fear is that I‚Äôll be attracted to it and then when I age, the age I‚Äôm attracted to wont age if that makes sense. Because I read stories of pedophiles where that happened to them.

they were wearing clothes but the picture was sort of in like that ‚Äúinnocent but sexual implications‚Äù manner, that in itself made me uncomfy but my ocd kept telling me I could be attracted and so I was really focusing on my groin area to see if I felt anything/felt attracted because I was utterly terrified that I would get turned on by it and turn into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I felt turned on, more uneasy and anxious. But this is the worst part, but I felt like I had to do it to make sure I wasn‚Äôt attracted and I could stop worrying about it. I want to kill myself because of it and I just want to throw up and I can‚Äôt believe I even tried it but I attempted to touch myself to see if it felt pleasurable or uncomfortable, and I felt uncomfortable. After like 3 seconds I had to stop because I just couldn‚Äôt stomach it and Felt so grossed out that they looked young and it was a child and just gross. 

But it‚Äôs the fact that I even looked that up, the fact that I even did that I haven‚Äôt been able to eat all morning because my appetite is gone and I feel like the worst person ever and that I am a pedophile. I‚Äôm scared I want to kill myself and I probably will because I‚Äôm to scared to live and see if I turn out to be a pedophile. I‚Äôm so so sorry for even doing that and it was so wrong and I feel like puking. I hate my compulsions because I feel like I have to do them to make sure I‚Äôm not what I‚Äôm scared of being.

However when I got the job my mental health WAS going back to a good place. Especially since I had nothing else to do (I dropped college until this pandemic gets a little bit more under control). I was making friends with my coworkers, loved my managers, loved the customers and location. 

But that was a short lived feeling. I‚Äôm still not in school so that sort of ‚Äúuseless‚Äù feeling still simmers in my stomach everyday. I still haven‚Äôt talked to some family that I know and love in a very long time. My social life still sucks. 

But my anxiety came back and now I feel like I have to force myself to be a person. Which is ironic because a few months back I was complaining how I wanted to be a person. 

People come up to me and say hi and expect me to be all bubbly and happy. When I‚Äôm in the break room people start talking to me like I‚Äôm going to be this funny and flamboyant gay person. I‚Äôm not that person I was anymore when I got hired the first time three months ago. Im just this fake that‚Äôs always depressed. Meds and therapy make me feel less overwhelmed but I still don‚Äôt feel the same. 

Positives; I make a lot of money, have broken a record at how long I can hold a job, social interaction. 

Cons: feel burnout, back issues, anxiety has become worse. 

Overall I think the cons and positives balance each other out but pretending to be a person is still such a bitch. 

I hate having focus problems when I‚Äôm having anxiety I hate not knowing what to say or feeling a mental block. When that anxiety is gone everything comes so naturally to me. I‚Äôm mad.",Anxiety,Tired of going to work because I have to pretend to be a person,2021-03-17 22:40:17

I have very bad anxiety/health anxiety. This last year has been filled with counting of days after possible exposures (which for me means I went and took out the trash so I count 14 days from that).

She knows my anxieties.

979,sharkpickles,1615978859,1,"about 7 months ago, my wife started taking Wellbutrin 150 once per day for her own panic/anxiety problem, which was mostly caused by sexual trauma in her childhood. she was having near-constant anxiety and avoidance problems. she was basically a nervous wreck almost all the time.

after 2-3 weeks of feeling insane during the adjustment, she leveled out and started experiencing drastic life changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

it was truly unbelievable. she went from being scared, closed-off, anxious, defensive, and avoidant to being strong, confident, self-assured, and a lot more openly loving and empathic. 

the change was crazy. or rather...*not crazy.*

she wasn't even in therapy at the time (she'd been doing CBT for 2 years prior to taking Wellbutrin, but she'd stopped several months prior, because it didn't seem to help her).

craziest of all? she used to be avoidant, defensive, and dismissive of sex. she avoided it at all costs, except on very rare occasions. according to her, she ""had sexual anxiety 90-95% of the time, all the time"". she could barely talk about it, let alone do it.

she had a strong sexual phobia.

now she says ""i don't have sexual anxiety 90-95% of the time"", and it shows. it's like some switch got flipped. 

it's like she never had a sexual phobia at all. she used to get panic attacks before, during, or after sex pretty often. now it never, ever happens.

in fact, she enjoys and craves sex like never before. we've been together 20 years now, and i've never seen her like this.

it's like the past 19 years never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

she's like a whole different person. she's calm, confident, and just has a ""quieter"" mind. she never has sleeping problems anymore, she doesn't get nervous about work, and she openly and confidently discusses her views and ideas without any hemming or hawing.

she's so affectionate, caring, and giving. she handles stressful situations with a ""fuck it"" attitude. ""fuck it, why worry? it'll succeed or fail, but things will be ok either way.""

she's also become very accepting of personal insignificance. ""i'm nothing and nobody, and i don't give a damn. i'm happy to just be me. i don't have to prove anything to anyone. i care about doing my job and having fun with the people i love, and if anyone disapproves, then fuck them.""

&amp;#x200B;

it's like she experienced some kind of ego death. she no longer worries about mortality or the future. she no longer gives any care about existential concepts like life and death. she no longer cares at all about ""her place in the world"". 

and after 11 years, she's no longer in mourning about her mother's suicide. of course she's sad about it and misses her, but she doesn't stress or ruminate about it. now she's ""happy for the time we had together"".

it's like something shut off the part of her brain that cares about ""big ideas"" and ""big problems"". mostly, her life seems centered on little things, like work issues and where to get brunch, wanting to sleep late and trying to get the laundry done before Saturday night.

it's like she's ""living for now"" instead of living in the past, or living in some scary, uncertain future.

&amp;#x200B;

when i try discussing things that make me nervous, scared, or worried, especially if they're ""big deals"" like death, illness, or ""our place in the world"", she just grins and says ""it's not worth worrying about. we have a lot to do in life, so what's the use in clogging up our brains with crap?""

i envy this attitude. 

&amp;#x200B;

don't get me wrong--she's always happy to listen to me and offer sympathy and empathy, but it's almost like she doesn't remember being constantly anxious and worried. almost like it happened to someone else, instead of her. 

i'm jealous as hell, and i'm so happy she's no longer troubled. 

&amp;#x200B;

she seems capable and content to live in the moment instead of anxiously trying to imagine all possible outcomes. she has a ""well, let's just wait and see"" attitude. she doesn't ruminate. she doesn't ideate. she doesn't have crazy worries about tomorrow. she doesn't toss and turn in bed. 

in 5 minutes she's out and snoring, and she doesn't get night terrors anymore. she sleeps like a log.

&amp;#x200B;

she hasn't had a panic attack since the 4th week of taking Wellbutrin--so about 6, 7 months now. she says she gets occasional ""anxiety flutters"", but that they're very easy to blow off and brush away. she says she ""just thinks about something else"" or distracts herself for a minute, and it passes without becoming an attack.

she's much less stressed and angry. she no longer has burning career ambition, which she celebrates, because ""all that matters is feeling good and enjoying life"". she doesn't care whether she gets promoted in the near future, because she's ""happy right where i am. if i get promoted, cool--if not, i'll still be ok in this role.""

&amp;#x200B;

i want to be like her. god *damn*, how i want to be like her.

is this reaction typical of people taking Wellbutrin? 

&amp;#x200B;

i've been picking her brain trying to learn her methods, and she says this is what she does/feels in contrast to her previous self:

&amp;#x200B;

\- we're all gonna die. i don't care. i just care about doing my job, having fun, and relaxing. 

\- i started fighting my anxiety. i started yelling at it, taunting it, and challenging it. i fought back against the bully. i dared it to hurt me. i called it a pussy and a coward and a piece of shit, and i hoped and prayed for it to end my life. but it didn't, because it can't. when i did that often enough, my brain seemed to learn that anxiety was a useless, pointless waste of energy...and most of my anxiety problems stopped in a few months and haven't come back.

\- everyone on earth needs some type of fidget spinner. i watch TV and play phone games to distract myself, and i don't care if that bothers people. it's a tool that helps me, so i'm going to do it. i'm also weaning off FB, playing mindless phone games instead of caring what random social media idiots think.

\- i always fall asleep with the TV on because it blocks my ""brain chatter"". i'm going to do this the rest of my life, and i don't feel bad about it. it's soothing and i like the way it feels.

\- i plan on taking Wellbutrin the rest of my life because it helps me feel better. i'd rather feel better with a pill than struggle without one, and that doesn't bother me at all. fuck anyone who has a problem with that.

\- most of people's problems and anxieties come from selfishness and ego. drop the ego, stop thinking you're more important than you really are, kick your anxiety in the balls every time it starts happening, and you'll feel better. the world isn't waiting breathlessly for your ""amazing contributions"". you aren't depriving anyone of your unique, special self. when we die, 99.999% of people won't give the slightest shit. you're just depriving YOU of an amazing life by worrying that you're ""wasting your life"". most people waste their lives, and they're happy anyway. better off wasting your life than living with constant stress and anxiety that you aren't ""good enough"".

\- why stress? have fun, play video games, sleep late, waste time with your friends, go out to dinner, eat cheesecake, lie around in your pajamas, and do whatever else feels good to you. we'll all be dead soon, so who cares? the only possible difference between you and some health guru is 10 extra years of life--maybe--and i'd rather die at 75 than live to 85 as a vegetable in a nursing home. you'll both end up dead sooner or later, so do what feels good to you. life's too short to worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

is this the expected/intended outcome of Wellbutrin?

my doctor says Wellbutrin isn't good for treating panic, anxiety, or phobias. yet my dear wife seems to have experienced an almost religious or spiritual change these days. 

it's like something ""clicked"" in her brain, and she isn't even in therapy.

i want this for myself. i need this for myself, and i'm very hesitant to try SSRIs because of all the unwanted side effects.

her first 2 weeks were a wild ride--ups and downs, agitation, grimacing, poor sleep, vivid dreams, muscle tension, increased anxiety.

then around the middle of the 3rd or 4th week, it stopped pretty suddenly. she got up, she made a pile of eggs and bacon and a pot of coffee. 

i said ""how are you feeling today?"" and she said ""i pretty much feel fine."" and that was that. 

no further side effects. it's like everything just stopped, except for the positive feelings.

981,sharkpickles,1615978221,1,"hi, i'm a 40/M, and recently i've reached a crossroads.

this post is lengthy, but please bear with me. i need *your* advice. 

please feel free to skip over the background and skim down to ""question"" if you like.

&amp;#x200B;

***Background:***

my anxiety is so severe that i can hardly leave the house anymore. some days it's a huge struggle to swallow food. even showering can be a big struggle lately.

my anxiety is rooted in emetophobia--the constant fear that something will make me sick. it can be any number of things, from standing too long, to taking a too-hot shower, to riding in a car, to a panic attack caused by a huge number of things (though i've never gotten sick from a panic attack, i'm afraid it'll happen ""someday"").

i don't eat very much, which gives me hunger pain--often triggering anxiety. then i'll eat something, and boom, the rumblings and stirrings will trigger anxiety because i think ""i waited too long, now eating is going to make me sick"". 

i've become agoraphobic, but even staying inside all day doesn't relieve my problems.

i'm also taxing the hell out of my wife. she's literally the only factor that helps me stay level and stable. 

nighttime is the worst. she's home working during the day, so that helps...and over the past few weeks, she's been staying up until 2-3 AM with me, sometimes watching calming TV shows, other times just chatting.

the weird thing is, a lot of the time i'm pretty lucid during anxiety attacks. i'll tell myself--or say aloud--""this can't hurt me. i've experienced this thousands of times, and i was always ok afterwards. just let it go."" sometimes i'm actually more annoyed than scared.

i've also been having bad nightmares and waking up sweating and scared.

i seriously need a tooth extraction, and it's causing me pain. but i'm too terrified to leave the house for an appointment, let alone get into the office--or the chair. 

something needs to change. life can't continue like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***question:***

my wife has had amazing wins with Wellbutrin (i'm going to write another post in this subreddit about that, right after this one), helping her deal with her own obsessiveness, panic, anxiety, and avoidance.

it had an incredible, almost unbelievable effect on her. after 7 months on Wellbutrin, she's like a new person. it's absolutely unreal. 

&amp;#x200B;

other people sing the praises of BuSpar, but i'm not really convinced.

my doctor isn't so sure about giving me Wellbutrin, saying it can cause anxiety and it ""isn't intended to treat panic, anxiety disorders, or phobias"". 

yet my wife is doing SO much better on Wellbutrin 150 once per day. she's become a pretty chill, confident person who doesn't really worry about the future anymore. she sleeps like a log and doesn't struggle with self-esteem, guilt, or worries that she's ""losing her mind"". no more intrusive thoughts. she still distracts herself from unwanted thoughts, but it's no longer a struggle.

she was having panic attacks 1-2 times a week before the meds, even when she was in CBT. after adjusting to the meds, and now 7 months later, she hasn't had ONE panic attack. 

not one.

&amp;#x200B;

the thing is, long ago i took Prozac, and i felt like complete hell. no libido, i was brain foggy and physically weak, and i couldn't concentrate. after 4 months i ended up losing my job because of it. i literally felt like i was losing my mind. i didn't know who or where i was anymore.  

i don't think my body agrees with SSRIs  =/   

that's why i'm curious about BuSpar and Wellbutrin. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm also very scared of side effects. anything that causes nausea or dizziness is terrifying to me, and it seems like these two don't really feature those side effects prominently.

my doctor discussed a beta-blocker like atenolol, but my resting heart rate is 80ish (normal), and he's concerned my blood pressure will get too low. 

plus, taking BBs long-term can cause physical problems like dizziness, heat intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, and exercise intolerance (you can throw up if you exert yourself a little too hard, even by moving furniture), so i'm not convinced that beta-blockers will work for me. i doubt they'd help my phobia and intrusive thoughts anyway.

i take the occasional Xanax, but obvi, that isn't a daily/long-term solution. getting addicted to Xanax? going through withdrawal? yeah, no. 

&amp;#x200B;

please share any thoughts or ideas you have. i'm getting into a desperate situation here.

Wanted to share something that works for me in the hope the it might encourage or help someone similar. 

The root of my anxiety is very much contained in my family. Their lives, choices etc. etc and sometimes my guilt for succeeding and leaving them behind/not spending as much time. Though, for context, we‚Äôre not a close family, and it‚Äôs not something I long for. 

A lot of my anxiety can be classed as worry, I suppose. There are valid-ish reasons for feeling this way. Often meaning there‚Äôs no real way to solve it. I can‚Äôt control their lives just to satiate my anxieties. 

I cope by ignoring it. I don‚Äôt check up; actively don‚Äôt look at when they were last online, don‚Äôt text, don‚Äôt call and palm off invitations to hang out. This isn‚Äôt ideal but the idea of confronting them with my concerns make me feel worse, and a little bit stupid...

Recently I accepted that this was going to be a part of my life whether I ignore it or not, so I took what I thought was a HUGE leap and spoke to them all about my distancing and feelings etc. 

It didn‚Äôt cure my anxiety, but it immediately became more manageable. Today I felt the impulse to ignore contacting them again when it the anxiety began to spike, so I sent a message to my mother and explained that to her.  It helped. I feel more normal than I have done in months. 

This is a long way to say something small which is - try interacting with the cause of your anxiety (if you‚Äôre aware of it). 

It‚Äôs likely obvious to all you folks but it feels like a win to me as I had never looked for help and advice prior to this (only joined this sub a week or two ago). 

So thanks to all of you for sharing concerns, worries and tips with each other because it inspired me to take a step in the right direction.

I‚Äôm a uni student and over the past 4 months I‚Äôve had time to reflect on how bad I was living. I hadn‚Äôt eaten fruit or vegetables in that time, I was eating a meal a day (usually McDonald‚Äôs or another takeaway) I was drinking no water, no vitamins, and I was constantly staying awake for uni.

Well, who knew that would take a toll? On Friday I had a terrible anxiety build up which made me feel very surreal. Because I was always a worrier I have constantly been thinking about it and scared I would be in that state of mind forever. I had to come home the next day and since then (until yesterday) I had CONSTANT anxiety because I felt so weird. 

Well, thankfully, I now know it‚Äôs not GAD or any anxiety disorder because I calmed down, deal with how I usually deal with anxiety, accepted it and my anxiety went away. It‚Äôs been spiking a tiny bit but I feel it‚Äôs under control, and I haven‚Äôt had constant anxiety since yesterday.

My husband recently went to the doctor for the first time in a while and was told he has high blood pressure and to change his habits (less drinking, start exercising, nothing crazy). He went full panic mode and dove headfirst into an intense diet. Started exercising every day from nothing. After a week of straight spinach and salads and stuff, he had a bad stomach day. This triggered a bunch of health anxiety. Checking every twinge, testing blood pressure multiple times a day, even checking heart rate. He has never felt this kind of anxiety before - like I am sure many of you have, where it eats at you all day and you don't feel in control of your thoughts and you cannot stop it. 

With the combo of reading him helpful posts from the health anxiety subreddit, constantly being there for him to talk to and be reassuring, and being able to relate as I have felt the crushing anxiety over all sorts of things (including health) for half of my life...I feel like I've been helping. He had a good day today keeping his health anxiety at bay. 

But tonight he could not fall asleep due to anxiety, and came down out of his mind anxious. He said he has no idea why he is anxious - he's anxious about being anxious. Anxious about the anxiety he might feel. I tried my best to help and hug him and talk him down. 

This is so unlike him (and I'm sure that's part of the reason he feels anxious - it's like, I've never been anxious like this before so there must be something wrong with me). We both feel a bit of anxiety because we don't have health insurance until May. That means no doctors, no therapy, no reassurance about health issues, no ability to get medication etc. I just found out I'm pregnant yesterday and I am dealing with my own anxiety related to that especially after the last pregnancy ended in miscarriage (and I won't be able to see my doctor until almost the second trimester thanks to the insurance), and I feel exhausted trying to fix this and cope with this.

My sister paces a lot. I love her to death, but it makes me want to curl up in a ball and die. I can recite every millisecond of her movement, interludes by her clicking her heel with the ground, before launching herself off the wall and doing it again. Sometimes this happens in a loop for half an hour or more. She‚Äôll run during random interludes too, extremely quickly and without direction before stopping and going back to her slow pace.

It‚Äôs so grating to me that I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep because of it. I‚Äôll be cooking or reading or literally anything else and she‚Äôll start, and I can see it in the corner of my eye and hear her heels click and all that I can think is that someone is approaching me. You know that feeling you get when you hear footsteps approaching your doorway and you have to wait two or three seconds for it to arrive? It‚Äôs like that, but on loop. I can always see her moving sporadically, doing the same clicking with her heels while wearing the loudest loudest Converse that have ever graced this Earth, and I can‚Äôt do it anymore.

I haven‚Äôt brought it up because I know it‚Äôs something she can‚Äôt prevent. It‚Äôs a tick for her, and it‚Äôs not my place to tell her she cannot do it. Further, it‚Äôs probably less trouble for me to stop getting so stressed by it than for her to learn to do something else.

This is a bit of a long one, but here goes.  I've (f26) had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but over the last five years it's gotten worse. About 6 months ago, it became absolutely brutal and I was struggling. I had a new, stressful job and was getting to the end of my rope. 

About 2 months ago, I started therapy and medication. I've only had a couple sessions with a therapist which has helped a little, but I also started an ssri, celexa. At first I wasn't sure it was working, but after about 6 weeks I started noticing changes. I haven't finished a full meal in years but now I only occasionally have leftovers. I now have 3 meals a day instead of 2 very small meals. My libido has also gone waaay up. I've had better s*x over the last 2 weeks than over the last five years. Even better, my anxiety has decreased a lot. I still have anxious episodes, but much less frequent and less severe than before. I can relax on my days off now, much less worrying about yesterday or tomorrow. It's fantastic, but it makes me sad that I missed out on so much for years because I wasn't sure I wanted to do medication or that it would help. I missed out on meals, fantastic s*x, and relaxing days off because I was stubborn.

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn‚Äôt interest or challenge him enough.




I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong



He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.



He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.



He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He‚Äôll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I‚Äôm the meanest person he‚Äôs ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he‚Äôs said about me he says ‚Äúeverything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult‚Äù



I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,‚Äù I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.‚Äù When I lost my temper he‚Äôs sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar?

My doctor prescribed 20mg if Viibryd, but after reading up on it I'm pretty terrified to take it. Brain fog, decreased short term memory, brain zaps, loss of libido, nausea, sleep paralysis. I already have extremely vivid and sometimes lucid dreams so I assume there is a strong chance I may get sleep paralysis from it. I can deal with those in the short term while I adjust, *but* I'm specifically nervous about PSSD and any other long-term effects (especially because PSSD can happen even if you stop taking it after only a few doses. In fact it blows my mind that no doctor has ever mentioned that to me...)

I tried Zoloft earlier this year and reacted horribly to it. I had intense brain fog, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, the whole nine yards. I couldn't even tell if it made my anxiety any better or worse because I was so frustrated with how shitty I felt during the day. 

I'm strongly leaning away from trying Viibryd because of the side effects. If I do take it, I would cut the 20mg pill in half and try only 10mg. But even so...I don't think I want to risk tampering with my brain. I'm a teacher/researcher and I really depend on my cognitive abilities for my income and livelihood. I also have ADHD, which I've just finally gotten somewhat under control with medication (Concerta 18mg).  

I'm 27 and I've had extreme anxiety since childhood. Clonazepam helps when I need it...but I'm not willing to take a Benzo every day, I don't think my doc would even give me a prescription for that frequency even if I wanted it. It's just frustrating because ***I feel like I'm probably doomed to live at a baseline of ""somewhat panicked"" for the rest of my life.*** SSRI's have so many cons and I'm sensitive to medication.

I've been going through a rough anxious patch the past few weeks, and while sitting here dreading the coming evening I was thinking about what I wish someone would tell me to make me feel a bit better, (since I'm not listening to myself). So this is my somewhat selfish attempt to make myself listen and believe this, I hope they might be of some comfort to someone else:

* You are safe. 
* You are stronger than you think, the fact that you've made it this far is proof of that strength, others might have crumbled, but you've held on. 
* These feelings and thoughts will eventually pass, just as they have before.  
* You are not defined by your anxiety, so do not devalue yourself.
* There is still hope and happiness in the world.
* Though others might think our worries are silly or unwarranted, they are real to us so don't compare yourself to others.
* Though anxiety feels overwhelming when you're in the middle of it, it won't always be in the driver's seat of your life, even if you have to fake it until you make it.

I hope some of these might have helped you, please add anything that has or would bring you comfort.  Sending digital hugs to all who need them.",Anxiety,If anyone else needs to hear this...,2021-03-17 12:57:35

The other is a small school that's 45 mins away with 7k students (3k more than my high school). That campus already feels like home, but I feel like maybe I should go out of my comfort zone?

The thing is, is that going out of my comfort zone doesn't always work. For example, i joined this debate club Freshman year. Yeah, I bettered my publc speaking, and everything was going fine. But then literally out of the blue (literally so random) my junior year I started getting panic attacks when public speaking. I couldn't stand, I got heart palpitations, couldn't drink coffee anymore. The more I got out of my comfort zone, the worse that it got.

Then on the other hand, one time I went on this school trip that was a week away from home. For the first time in years I made new friends, went to my first ever (and only) party. Got reallllll out of my comfort zone and it was great. Had 0 anxiety for the first time in forever.

So I'm conflicted on whether getting out of your comfort zone actually works. Do I cower in the comfort of living close to home? Do I combat my anxiety (that makes me physically nauseous; seriously thinking about this is making me sick) by going to a big school?

The thing is - the daydreaming can help me be incredibly creative - but most of the time its just anxiety and depression and its not controlled daydreaming. If a normal person could work 8 hours - I would probably spend 6 hours in a daydream - especially if the task is something boring and not related to me in any way.

I found Xanax 0.25mg to help me tremendously! It felt like my brain was working properly when on it. My question is, is there an SSRI or something similar that I can use for long term?

I understand that Xanax has a GABAA effect or something like that. But, I've also read different stories about how it either lowers or increases dopamine and serotonin. Which one is actually true?

I've tried plenty of stuff from Meditation - all kinds of meditation to plenty of different ways to try and control my brain. But, that doesn't really work as it should. I just feel like if I was on Xanax sooner I could've been the topper in every class. 

I used to think I needed something like coffee, etc - but they were just increasing my daydreaming - while xanax helps me stay present - I just want to figure out how and why this happens - Which chemicals are in play here, and is it possible to recreate at least somewhat similar thing with an SSRI or something like that?

I am currently using it for physical symptoms of anxiety, but the relief is fascinating.

1141,super_salt,1615926116,1,"Hi all, I must admit that I had no idea how debilitating anxiety and panic attacks can be. I never suffered from severe anxiety and/or had a panic attacks until my mid-30s. The last six months have been a grind of learning to deal with and live with anxiety. I get somatic symptoms over just about anything and now even the most rudimentary things, things I could do before without a second thought, now get me near a crippling anxiety state. 

Once I realized what was happening to me I did a few virtual therapy sessions and started educating myself. A lot of the information, coping mechanisms and wellness practices really really do help. However, I feel like I am running into the ocean, swimming a few lengths in and then getting tossed back out on to the anxiety beach because I am not swimming fast enough. 

For example, exercise and meditation seem to be the best at finding my underlying pressure points and alleviating somatic symptoms (numbness and tingles in limbs). Together with practicing mindfulness, going on walks during sunrise and sunset, eating healthier food, avoiding alcohol, and getting as much sleep at night as I can have really got me the closest to feeling back to normal.  However, if I miss a day or have a rest day schedule, or the weather doesn't allow me to go on a walk or even if the weekend trips up my daily routing than the anxiety comes flowing in and I end up in a downward spiral for a few days or weeks until I can gather myself and start all over again. 

I guess what I am wondering is it always like this? I am always going to have to deal with this and everyday, six or seven times stop what I am doing to do a coping mechanism?

For today's one on one interview, for example, I expected a deep analysis of the jobs I did, where I did them, in detail questions about them to expose me if I were lying or why I never had an actual contract, all features of the worst case scenario. Instead the recruiter asked about my jobs, my university degrees, literally two questions about the job I'm hopefully going to do and all was wrapped up in less than ten minutes.

I have two different types of anxiety. The first is all in my mind and brain and head. It's triggered by memories and thoughts and bad situations etc. It is when I really can't calm down and I feel really upset and heart broken and hopeless.

Then I realized that I have these days where my BODY is anxious. I don't have bad thoughts, I am not afraid and I am not upset. But my body shakes and I can't focus on anything and I feel so restless and light headed and shaky. My body feels hallow, like I'm 10X lighter and I am not really anchored to it at all. Like a puppet. I feel so hyper but not energetic per se. 

I also CANNOT stop talking. Now, I always tend to talk a lot out of nervousness, but in these situations it is my body that is nervous, not me.

Occasionally this will lead to real anxiety and trigger all those bad thoughts and then I have a panic attack. 

Anyone else? Sorry if this is worded poorly but I really can't focus...because my body is anxious. I am concerned this has less to do with my anxiety and more to do with my bi polar disorder.

Recently, I started abording a hard topic for me: My attacks are commonly around a few topics, and one of them is the ""crush"" with one of my best friends. Doing the history short, I knew her three years ago always feeling a kind of ""romance"" to her, but I just tried to ignore it and continue with the friendship. I don't know if the panic attacks are something passenger by my age (18 y/o), but it feels bad. All this may seem actually dumb and a loss of time, but I swear it feels horrible. 

After talking about this with my therapist, he recommends me to tell her about my emotionality towards her, but I'm dubious about that's as a good idea.

I‚Äôm thinking about doing tennis or karate. That way if I miss a lesson I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd effect the entire class. I‚Äôd just miss extra tennis practice and a few karate moves. I could maybe make up for the lost practice time somehow. Just my assumptions don‚Äôt quote me on this.

I want to believe that anxiety is something I can overcome on my own, but it‚Äôs really been kicking me when it comes time to make a change. Even going to the grocery store requires a pep talk as I get older. 

My support system is probably going to be moving away from the area in the next year or two and I don‚Äôt want to become the guy that stays in his house, except to work. I‚Äôve always been skeptical of medication because of what happened to my mother when she quit cold turkey. 

I‚Äôve been fighting hard to keep being active despite this, but I think it‚Äôs going to turn into a losing battle in the next year or two. I want to make meaningful changes in my life, medication could help, but I don‚Äôt know what to really expect from it. I don‚Äôt want it to change my personality I just want to be less anxious.

1180,mildredss78,1615913922,1,"a little backstory, after 7 years of living with anxiety and 3 with depression, I finally decided to open up to my family members about my struggles on November. On December I had my first consultation with a therapist who prescribed me 20 mg of Lexapro and it took more or less 3 or weeks to start making effect.  

On January i started to feel much better tbh, I felt like I could do get the things I once feared, my appetite got better and my life in general improved a lot. January and February were both the best months in the last 5 years. But then a week or so ago I saw something that kind of triggered my anxiety and I had a rough couple of days struggling with anxiety. Ever since that day I haven‚Äôt felt good. Although I don‚Äôt feel as anxious as last week I feel very bad like my will to live has exited my body. I feel on edge, as if nothings ever gonna get better and tbh I‚Äôve cried all day today, I feel hopeless, sometimes I feel like nothings real and just today has been hectic, I feel very depressed like I want to die right now but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôm afraid of getting suicidal once again. Is this normal? Has it ever happened to anyone before? Should I contact my therapist and tell her to schedule a meeting? are the meds not doing effect anymore...? Please offer me advice",Anxiety,did anyone else experience this after 3 months of medication?,2021-03-17 03:58:42
1181,insanitiezzz,1615913867,1,"() Alright, so I never ever talk about my anxiety with anybody except for the occasional conversation with my mom (she gets it, she's had mental illness issues throughout her entire life) because I feel like my friends wouldn't understand or think I'm searching for pity. Soooo, I apologize if this is long because I'm basically pouring my heart into this and FINALLY saying whatever is on my mind.

So for context, I never experienced anxiety or depression much besides me overthinking or occasionally worrying about stupid things like my Mom not coming home on time. However, I reached my current sophomore year of high school. Hell. I think the pandemic definitely contributed a lot of darkness to my mental health as well. I used to be extremely social, known as the ""Gay Best Friend"" who would always make everybody laugh and have tons of friends. I still do have friends, but a small circle and now I find it *extremely* difficult to make new friends without the blatant awkwardness involved.. And I can't specifically remember when I started having immense anxiety but it began I believe a little after I started smoking weed regularly (using dab pens almost 5 times a week, only a few hits though and I would get high). I started to be very paranoid when I was high, my heart would beat out of my chest and I would have almost like ""voices in my head"" which obviously led to me thinking I had Schizophrenia or another serious mental illness. It feels as if I *can't* stop thinking or stressing over things. However, I soon realized that it was just my thoughts and they would be CONSTANT thoughts and I doubt this has anything to do with anxiety and I'm just rambling at this point and I sound stupid. This is exactly what I mean-- I can't talk about my anxiety and have the ability to ""put it all in words."" I feel as if I'm the only person that understands and I sort of.. confide in myself? 

Anyways, I constantly stress over things that other people tell me do not matter. It seems so simple to live a care-free, relaxing life but I can't. I have a consistent fear of growing up as well, whether it's the future or college plans, etc. I consider myself to be mature for my age, having researched colleges since I was 13. I think that my intelligence and knowledge of.. the world.. also is a factor in my anxiety. I have a fear of having a low-income when I'm older like my family.. I have a fear of not having a single-dorm in college because of my snoring.. and the list goes on and on and on until I get a stress headache and have to force myself to breathe and stop. I feel like I am burning my brain out with all of these worries, and I'm only 15, almost 16, years old. I can't keep going on like this, but my Mom, who is a single parent after I stopped contact with my alcoholic dad, doesn't want me to start medication because I am so young. I agree, though. I've researched some medicine and I don't want to be zombie-like or gain weight, as body dysmorphia and feeling that I am ugly is already a key part of my **lavish** mental health. I have fears of me dying young, of death in general, and everything that I do I correlate it to my fears. I'm gay, so I constantly stress over being judged so before I meet anyone new, I go through the usual heart racing and palms sweating situation. I do not let my friends invite guys I don't know to hang out with us-- men, in general, are a no-no to me, I feel as if everybody is homophobic until I get to meet them and know them. This mindset is horrible and I wish I could change it.

Additionally, I stress *for* other people. My mom's job doesn't give her a pension so she told me she's going to have to work until the day she dies. Don't even get me started on death. Once my mom dies I feel as if there's going to be no purpose in life. I have my brothers and a lot of aunts and uncles too, but I've been such a mommy's boy my whole life considering the ""daddy issues"" I've had since I was 5 years old. She also drinks a whole bottle of wine per day constantly, which scares me. Yeah, she's about 50 but she always says how her body hurts and I get scared for her health. She's been smoking for many years as well, and that leads me to ANOTHER fear of mine, the fact that I vape. I've been vaping since I was fourteen, which is SO young. I don't stress about it until I put it in retrospect and realize the number of pods that I've used (which are probably 3-4 a week, one pod being equivalent to a pack of cigarettes) and I'm only 15. I'm destroying my body with the vaping, the hitting probable laced carts off of dab pens, and the stress of everything messing with my brain.

My mom offered for me to see a therapist, but I just don't want to be a burden on her. Sometimes, sessions can be up to $100 each and I just can't do that, especially not with her spending problems. We order food every night because my mom has no energy to cook, considering her depression. I usually clean up the house, do the dishes, etc. and this adds so much stress to me because it's just more and more things that *I* have to get done. And it just leads me to think that.. when I go to college.. who's going to help out with my mom? She wants to move across the country practically but I want to stay here for college-- which is once again, another stress of mine. 

I've also struggled with derealization and depersonalization issues and the whole conversation of an ""afterlife"" gets my heart pumping, and not in a good way. (TW) Suicidal thoughts as well have come across, but I know I would never for the sake of my mom.. and my fear of death/afterlife. I just cannot see myself living past 18, ""adulting"" is extremely scary to me with taxes, being alone, having no love life because I'm gay with insecurities, etc. My whole life is a blur and it's scaring me. I'm 15 - I should be out having fun and enjoying my last few teenage years. Instead, I'm bottled up in my room half of the time constantly worrying.

I'm so sorry for rambling and rambling, and I doubt anyone will read everything I just let off of my chest, but I will say that writing this was a hugeeee relief. Venting definitely helps guys, that's for sure! Anyways, thank you so much. I hope you all have an amazing day &lt;333",Anxiety,I'm too young and I can already feel anxiety taking over my life,2021-03-17 03:57:47
1182,UrghAgh,1615913794,1,"Hey everyone,

So I (25M) had it stuck in my head for a few days that maybe I had ALS. Symptoms being tired legs, arms, and feet. 

However, not tired enough to where I couldn‚Äôt exercise, and play in multiple soccer games. I guess what got me is the lingering tiredness, which never really happened before. 

With that being said, the past day I have had these thoughts pop back in my head with tired hands that feel weak‚Äî which is weird because they ‚Äúfeel‚Äù weak but I really think my grip strength is there and all is normal‚Äî I‚Äôd say this, there is pain that has coincided with this, mainly in my knuckles &amp; brief periods of numbness. 

I guess what is making me feel okay, is none of this is specific to an individual limb, I‚Äôve had cramps but it‚Äôs been the same cramp I‚Äôve experienced my entire life, 0 muscle twitches, and I‚Äôm feeling sensations like pain &amp; numbness‚Äî which I believe point away from ALS.

I have health anxiety. I've been to the dr and noticed that I get consistently high readings for BP around 130/80 - 140/90 but the problem is I get very very nervous before each reading.

Unfortunately the problem doesn't go away when I go home. I have my own machine now, but I still tend to get high readings because I freak out as soon as I try. My heartrate goes up to 93 or so as I'm taking it. I can't get myself to calm down because of this self-fulfilling prophecy: I expect a high reading and thus I get one.

Tonight I took several readings and tried to wait until I felt my hearbeat slow. I did manage to get one around 125/83 but my heart started hiking up again towards the end.

I hate that I am hyper-sensitive to everything now. My childhood deeply affects me to this day... I use to be a confident little girl until I hit middle school and things changed, I had body dysmorphia, and being bullied really took its toll on me even to this day, I was called ugly, too skinny and was called a monkey, frog, etc. This was a hard time for me because my only sister who was really close to me went to a boarding school away from home, days would get lonely and at times I would cry alone in my bed having no one to talk to to. My parents are foreigners and went to school in their country so they could not relate to the American system of school which was even harder for me. People treated me like an outcast, all I wanted was to have someone like me and not judge me. My parents were extremely abusive during this time and there was one time where my mom came back from work and started beating me for no reason. My dad would fight me too. High school was no better I had a falling out with this girl who made my school life a living hell all because I wanting to leave our toxic friendship. In college, I was not able to go to a 4 year due to grades and I went to a community college which really caused my depression because I made no friends went from school to home every day crying. I made sure I got my grades up and finally was able to transfer to a 4 year, my grades started to decline because I didn't like a major (I like it now) and covid came and shut everything down and now I feel more vulnerable than now.

Last time I had a surgery, nearly four years ago, I was left traumatised. I developed OCD within a few months post op and its taken the last few years to recover mentally with the help of therapy, medication and my support system.

Even though I have pretty much recovered from my OCD, I still become anxious and shaky when thinking about hospitals.

Ok I am , for a little backround, for the past few days I‚Äôve had this fear of becoming a pedophile. I think I might have OCD because over the past few months I‚Äôve had fears and intrusive thoughts of becoming many things like gay, a killer, etc. because of intrusive thoughts, despite never having the desire for the same sex and NEVER wanting to kill. The intrusive thoughts have lessened but the fears are still happening. And I have these compulsions I feel like I have to do to soothe it like searching up stories of pedos and making sure my story is different than theres, or looking up a photo of a kid and making sure I don‚Äôt get any reaction out of it which thankfully I don‚Äôt, but my fear only gets worse and it‚Äôs so frustrating. I ended up not being gay or a killer, but at the time it felt so real and scary.

So i think I‚Äôm not a pedophile right now, I wasn‚Äôt before. The thought of children in that way makes me sick, but it have a huge fear of becoming a pedophile, or secretly already being one. 

So today I just remembered this like, ok this is embarassing to say but whatever, a ‚Äúkink‚Äù I guess of sorts or something. It was ALWAYS about adults or older teenagers like 16-18, never kids or anyone younger than me ew. But it was basically like idk how to explain it but where the person like Didnt know about sex/pleasure down there and stuff and the other person like showed them but I never thought of it in a way with a child because that‚Äôs just abuse and children can‚Äôt consent to that stuff anyway. It was always with an adult, like sort of like that Wonder Woman (it might‚Äôve been someone else) movie where her kind didn‚Äôt need sex to reproduce so as an adult she didn‚Äôt understand that I think, or like an adult who just was never interested in that stuff until then idk. And the ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù person ALWAYS consented and wanted to do it, it was just where like they were new to sexual things. And I didn‚Äôt see a problem with that then, but now that I‚Äôve got POCD I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm secretly a pedophile OR I‚Äôm going to turn into a pedophile because of it. There is a big difference that sort of helps calm me down remembering. Whenever I imagined those scenarios, it was always with a CONESNTING adult, but with children they can‚Äôt consent and I would NEVER get excited by something that isn‚Äôt consenting so that helped calm me down. But still, I‚Äôm terrified and I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm so so scared, I can‚Äôt handle the fear of possibly turning into a pedophile because of this, is female castration possible? I mean I would like to have a sex life with a future ADULT partner, but if I become a danger to society I can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm scared this makes me a pedophile because in a way that‚Äôs how children are and ew I just I‚Äôm scared and don‚Äôt know what to do. Like I am very uncomfortable by the thought of children like that and only ever thought of them in a maternal way (I really want to have kids when I‚Äôm older), or in a way where they were annoying little sticky humans.

I () am supposed to be going to a house party this saturday with my boyfriend (). I'm feeling nervous and sad about the prospect of going, but I historically have always loved parties and want to be able to have a great night and enjoy myself, as well as be upbeat and fun for his sake because the night means a lot to him.

I'm an extroverted person who loves to be around people, but when I was younger I struggled a lot with social skills, was bullied, and didn't have many friends. Since then, I have obviously come into my own and become a very social person. I've had several concussions in the last few years, and my most recent concussions (my 5th and 6th concussions, which happened in early january and a little under 3 weeks ago) have frustratingly brought back old social anxiety and depression. I have also somewhat lost connections with lots of my friends because of the amount of time and energy the recovery process takes up‚Äî I don't have much time or energy for socializing and have been quite isolated. I feel like I have trouble starting and holding conversations now, along with difficulty focusing and coming up with responses, and being lively in a group conversation. 

The party is technically for the birthday of a girl in my bf's grade at his high school, and almost everyone who will be at the party will be from his highschool. He is one of the nicest, most likeable and social kids at his school, so he knows everyone and is friends (or friendly at the very least) with almost everyone. I've been to a few parties like this with him before, so I am friendly with some of the people who will be there. 

However, the reason this party means a lot to my bf is because it's happening later in the night of the day of his first football game (which his team will almost definitely win). This year is his senior football season, and he is the captain so he's really pumped for it. This party is also the biggest one that has happened in a long time, and he's been talking about Project X for the last few days. He loves me a lot and brings me to every party he goes to, and he has mentioned that he really wants me to have a good night and let loose on Saturday. I want to too, and I want him to have the best night with a happy gf by his side.

How can I loosen up and enjoy myself at this party without getting overwhelmed, sad, antisocial or needing to go home?

tl;dr- saturday is the night of the big party after my bf's first senior year football game and i'm struggling with post-concussion social anxiety, overwhelm, and mood swings that are making me not want to go. i've always loved parties and this one is super important to my bf- advice on how to enjoy myself, socialize better, and loosen up?",Anxiety,Advice on how to overcome post-concussion social anxiety at a party that's important to my bf (and that I genuinely want to enjoy myself at)?,2021-03-17 02:32:29

it's really, really out of character for them to use my things or touch my stuff.

i keep trying to come up with logical reasons for how so much of my medication has gone missing but i literally can't... someone in my house is opening my bottles and taking pills out without my permission or knowledge, and i'm pretty sure it's not my cat.

these are Percocet pills. extremely addictive, but fortunately, I have never gotten addicted to them.

However, every few months, my chronic pain has a flare-up, and the percocet is the only thing between me and an injection of dilaudid in the emergency room. I only take half of the one-per-4-hour pills, and the pain management lasts 2 days from that alone.

I have taken, probably, a total of 5 of these in my life. I try to avoid taking them as much as possible and only when I really, really need them.

Today I noticed my bottles had been moved, so I counted, and between each.. there's 19 missing from one and 10 missing from the other for a total of 29.

I know it's maybe kind of silly to want validation from internet randos, but here we are. I am going through so much right now, and I just need permission to not be okay. I am working through a health issue that is related to and very triggering to my anxiety and PTSD. I am perpetually in hyperarousal state, and my body and mind just feel really yucky. It feels like my body and mind are betraying me and want me to be miserable. I am also in a really intense crunch time at work, with more demands on my time than I can accommodate. I love my job, and it's the best job I have ever had in terms of work/life balance, but I just don't want to be here because of all the pressure and the perpetual urge to cry and sleep forever. Also it's a high-risk job re: Covid, so there'sthat fun bit as well. I am also doing a pretty deep dive into dealing with my PTSD (diagnosed last year, traumatized 12-14 years ago), and that is a full time job in and of itself in terms of emotional labor and the drain it has on me as a human being. I am surviving it all, but I am so tired, I am not doing my best work, and I just need someone to tell me that I am, indeed, going through a lot and have too much on my plate and need to take care of myself.

To be overjoyed at success and destroyed at failure is to become a **victim of circumstances.**

I used to work so hard to achieve my goals, I would work 6-7 days a week on my startup to get the result as fast as possible.

What did I get in the result?

In a few months, everything starts to crumble. The work becomes a struggle, not an enjoyment. The energy is low and you can't run your business with the same motivation as you started. I lose interest and think that achieving my goals is not possible.

Surprisingly, when we let go of attachment to goals and outcomes, the achievement is often the result.

**Goals in life are simply guidance** that illuminates our path, keeping us on track of inner emotional and spiritual expansion.

*Is it more important to achieve than to find meaning in the experience of achieving?*

Notice how quickly we improve and develop when we focus on the experience itself and the process, the direction in which we are going, rather than on how quickly or ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù we arrive.

Such focus **reduces anxiety and tension** over attaining a particular result, and the by-product is a true achievement.

1218,sirmisterchris,1615904871,1,"Hi All,

This is something that I have been suffering with for many years, and I am trying to find a way of making it more tolerable. I have severe anxiety over food making me sick, even though I can't ever recall having food poisoning before.

Part of the issue is that I have IBS, and am sensitive to foods like garlic and mushrooms, as well as food which is generally very oily or greasy. I get severe anxiety when it comes to going out to restaurants, or having food in other people's homes, as I worry that they might use some of those ingredients in their cooking methods. I'm aware that at least some of the time, my body's reactions will sometimes be related to IBS issues, but I know deep down that in many cases I get severe stomach pain and have to excuse myself because of this anxiety; not the actual food. I always take Pepto Bismol or nausea medication when I go out to eat, which is essentially me accepting defeat before I even leave the house.

Eating at home is another problem. Just today, I made lunch with a pack of ham which had been opened yesterday, and I worry that it will have gone off in that time. I still ate it, as I am trying to power through this, but in the back of my head I worry that I'll be sick in a few hours, even though there's no realistic chance of it happening. I also freak out about food being undercooked, even though everyone at home is competent at cooking.

I spoke with my doctor last year about this, and was prescribed sertraline. That had extremely mixed results. I did notice that my worrying had reduced, and I did eat more, however I gained a lot of weight as a side effect (roughly 20 pounds in total.) The weight gain hit my confidence and morale, so I went off sertraline after only a few months and have lost all of that weight since.

I would just like to know if anyone has figured out any coping mechanisms, and I really am open to hearing any and every suggestion - natural remedies, medical remedies, therapy, breathing exercises, anything at all!! Thank you.",Anxiety,Food Issues,2021-03-17 01:27:51

1228,mu_ness,1615902447,1,"My girlfriend (mid 20s) and I (also mid 20s) have been together for around 4 years. I knew from the start that she suffered from anxiety and that she took medication for it. This was fine, I knew what was involved with having anxiety, how people react and it wasn't something I really factored into our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

At the start, everything was great. That classic honeymoon period. When that honeymoon period came to an end, everything was still great. We both loved each other and life was pretty good.

Things started to go off rails at around the 2 1/2 year mark when she started being less and less interested in having sex. She was also unwell for a fairly long period, which I think compounded the 'not-having-sex' feeling. We went from having sex around 2 or 3 times a week to about once a week, then to once every few weeks and before you knew it we hadn't had sex in more than a few months. 

This wasn't amazingly fine, but I recognised that she was going through some issues in relation to sex so I was happy to brush over this and we could pick the sex back up when she felt more into it. 

We still kissed/madeout and cuddle very often, so this was a fine sort-of replacement. But then she started not wanting to kiss me. And now, doesn't even want me to hug or cuddle her. Not on the sofa, not in bed, and now not even before we leave for work or anything. 

I've tried speaking to her about this, bring it up on different occasions to see if she feels she can talk about it. I know it is anxiety related, she has said as such. She says she feels overwhelmed when we cuddle, which I understand to a point. But I don't know where we are going to go from here. 

I am at such a loss and feel like our relationship has just sort of crumbled into nothing? It really tears me up inside that I am constantly being held at arms length by the person that I love and, at least at one point, loved me. 

I know the obvious answer must be that she wants to break up with me. It seems pretty clear from what I've said that this is probably what is coming. I only post this here because she has anxiety and blames her anxiety for her feelings. Perhaps this is something someone here has had experience with and can give me some advice on, well, anything. I would like to standby her and help her in anyway I can, but I of course know that I can't 'fix' her. I don't know if I should wait it out, wait for her to regain her confidence? That's what I would like to do but it just seems that our relationship has gotten worse and worse, and feels like she won't engage with me on how to make it better and bring some fun back into our relationship. I've suggested doing little date things together again but she also rejected this based on anxiety. Maybe that makes me seem selfish, but I don't know what else I should be doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose, the writing is maybe on the wall. I only don't see why she hasn't said something more direct to the effect on wanting to breakup. Perhaps because we live together? Do I just have to wait until the lease is up for her to finally end it? Because I don't want our relationship to end but it tears me up watching her put up more and more barriers between us.

I am a doer . I have to do something about everything . It is both a blessing and a curse. As long as I am dealing with a situation where actions are both warranted and productive , we are in business . However, situations where not much can be done can leave me feeling out of sorts and downright edgy. As much as this is a personal struggle, I often run in to this trouble in my relationships where a friend or family members simply just needs a listening ear but I have more to offer . I have to do something or we have to do something about this . If not do something than I have to at least offer a solution . But how can I offer a solution when a friend or loved has thrown a good 30 to 40 things are currently not working in their favor . 
Trust me , I can tirelessly attempt to offer a mediocre solution for each one them. That conversation will be quite the drag . Also, when we are overwhelmed and stuck, too many solutions are worst than no solution at all. So I came up with a system not just for my friends and family but one that I can use myself in such times . 
Write down all those 30, 40 , or however many things that are wrong right now. Don‚Äôt leave anything out . From problems as big as I don‚Äôt like my partner to problems as small as I don‚Äôt drink enough water. Put them in a bucket . And pick one at random . 
Now read the problem you picked and ask these questions 
- Do I currently have emotional capacity to take this on? 
- Do I currently have the financial capacity to take this on?
- Do I currently have the physical capacity to take this on? 

If you answer yes to all these questions, them go ahead . Take this on !

I can't focus on studying because I constantly interrupt myself with a fear that I have some discease that I need to check (i.e. I constantly check myself for testicular cancer even though I've been checked for it at the doctor - he says I'm healthy, I also have no reason to think that I would have this but I still keep thinking: ""What if on the next check I feel an irregularity? I better check once more""). The same mentality goes with the heart thing - even though I've been checked, I wonder if maybe my heart has gone bad since the last check up.

1268,RepresentativeNo3605,1615884522,1,"Hi guys. I‚Äôve always had anxiety, but it‚Äôs been the kind of anxiety that I‚Äôve always managed with and it‚Äôs really not been too bad at all (especially now, in hindsight). 

My anxiety has always come from being a worrier, an over thinker; I always got anxiety from genuinely believing I was going insane or getting some form of illness. I was always fine after 30 minutes or so and always felt normal.

On Friday I was exhausted at around 5 pm, a lot of sleepless nights, submitting uni work late; my girlfriend said something like ‚Äòwake up‚Äô on her game and I just felt this wave of anxiety and panic rush through me, it was building and building until I felt so out of it, kind of like greening out on weed if you‚Äôve ever experienced that, I felt trapped and frightened. I rang my dad and just kept telling him how weird I felt and how scared I was. 

I thought it was my exhaustion, I went to bed so hopeful I would wake up and be fine. I remember waking up and instantly had such bad anxiety because I didn‚Äôt feel normal, when I calmed down and slept again I woke up feeling fine. Phew, except I kept debating it inside my head what had happened, it was like an internal battle all day and my anxiety was constant and I was always full of fear. When my girlfriend left, I broke down crying, I rang my dad and he came and collected me.

Since then, it‚Äôs just been CONSTANT anxiety, like it‚Äôs the most distressing feeling ever. I feel so... disconnected, like I feel here, but I just don‚Äôt feel like myself, I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll be like this forever. I‚Äôve not eaten in 3 days, I just don‚Äôt know what the hells going on, I‚Äôve always been an over thinker and an insanely bad worrier but why do I feel like this? 

I spoke to a psychiatrist over the phone last night and it immediately calmed my nerves. For the first time in days my anxiety had gone, I felt normal in that department, but I just don‚Äôt know why mentally I feel so weird, and I feel like while I feel like this my anxiety will always linger because I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll never be back to normal.

i'm trying to not let it happen, but i feel my body slowly shuting down and getting more and more ""symptoms"" of an anxiety attack that i really want to avoid.

Even when I manage to fall asleep, I have restless dreams and recurrent thoughts about my insecurities.

First of all, I was born and raised in a very Christian family in a conservative community where anything seems to be ok unless is going to church and I don‚Äôt blame anything but I had to mention it. 

My mom had cancer when I was 15-16 (now I‚Äôm 21) and I really felt that this would be the worst year of my life when my mom said goodbye to me because doctors told her that it wouldn‚Äôt be very possible for her to recover and I really felt sad, stressed about it but I never showed it to anyone until I just promised myself if she survives I wouldn‚Äôt waste a minute and I would try to enjoy my mom then when death decides to appear around I wouldn‚Äôt regret anything at all because I gave everything for her, I let her love deeply:) and that‚Äôs what I did. I changed in how I was, I low key forced myself to grow up, be more mature, independent so my mom wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about me but just smile and I would spend the rest of my days with her, we got together incredibly like there was no tomorrow until I turned 18-19 

We moved to a bigger city in Canada, the party city I would say and I started having ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or people I could see regularly, we would go to restaurants and movies until I met the classical toxic friendship with a crazy past LOL and I got to tried clubs and I loved dancing hahaha when I was younger I promised myself I would have a popular ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù kind of shit and I would post it on social media so voil√† you have me showing of my perfect life in this new Canadian city with amazing friends and I started partying so eventually I got to try drinks but I knew my mom don‚Äôt like it at all. And because I knew she didn‚Äôt like it I will just try a little bit to get less shy and warm so I will dance even more but things I will just get one or two glasses I will get back home and after all the sweat and dance and food I will no longer have any affect on me and when my mom confront me about me getting very late you know back home I told her I went just dancing and then eating because I realize It was nice to meet people. In this city there was a particular bar. we went to a language bar where you can practice languages and I am trilingual so it was like a paradise for me and after a certain time it will become a dancing bar with a creative dancing floor amazing drinks and so on so on so it started like that I will not drink a lot and if I will I will drink low alcohol kind of drinks because of my mom I always wanted to respect her but I started realizing I loved it and one of my friends got me a job in a craft Wine and beer store there was literally two minutes from the bar which was in downtown in a really party area where all universities are located a lot of students a lot of young people a lot of tourist a lot of bars and I worked there for almost a year and I got massive discounts and alcohol because we were in courage to try new products so we will be able to sell them quickly... but it got to the point I had a habit that I will drink some thing every single day something new something I haven‚Äôt tried I was discovering the drink I liked back then and I had Lotta beer to the point I got extremely fat in a matter of a month because I will drinking a lot during my shift and after my shift and the next day and the next day and the next day and I have 12 hour shifts sometimes so it used to get bad... 


My mom never caught me... I went to solo trip for 3 months ‚ÄúEurotrip‚Äù (not backpacking tho) where I would drink a bottle of local wine every single day ?minimum) I took profesional wine connoisseur courses in France and I got into wine so quickly and my mom approved it since I got to a professional level but I always felt guilty about it... because I was hiding stuff from my mom 

I came back from Europe in 2020 for the covid pandemic and I didn‚Äôt have a job or something to do but wait for university to start or get a job meanwhile... my mom caught me twice (on different dates) drunk or drinking at home or getting back home (because I forgot my keys) 

Darkest months of my life, I guess my life was not like the one I created in Europe where I felt free, where no one knew me and I just lived my life as I wanted to live it! (I am someone very mature, extremely responsible with money and health matters) and I‚Äôm mom knows so but I always watch a tv with my mom or I would go to her bed and watch or eat something after dinner like we would go everywhere together and when she would mention alcohol or us drinking I would get a panick attack 


2020-2021 I stopped drinking like down to 1% of what I used to do, no longer even sociable because I get hangover well it is definitely Hangxiety (please google it) 

And I feel so guilty and this massive anxiety that can‚Äôt let me concentrate... I feel like I am hiding so many stuff to my mom, I hate it .... And I can‚Äôt see photos of me drinking because I wouldn‚Äôt even sleep since I would get so much anxiety...

Setting some context here:

I work for a digital marketing agency, probably in one of the top 5. It doesn't matter that I work as part of a large company because I get treated like shit. I joined this organisation on January 2020 and I have regretted it from the first week itself. I work with a manager who I am sure is a psycho/sociopath. He is the type of guy who sings praises for you when he is very much in need of getting something done but at the first sign of trouble he will ensure that his subordinates fall under the bus instead of him. He makes tonns of mistakes and he never gets penalized because he plays the office politics well and at the same time he micromanages the shit out of me. if the subordinate is a lady she immediately becomes his favourite and doesn't get shouted at for huge errors, but if you are a guy, this jerk will take us down for the simplest things. Enough about him as I might need a whole new post for the torture that guy puts me through.


Anyway, to the matter at hand, last week I had given an interview for another digital marketing company, the job seemed to be fit for me and I thought I did a great job , I wanted to just get the offer letter as fast as possible no matter what the salary was, just so I can tell my manager to f*ck off. However much to my shock, I didn't get that job. I was a bit sad but I was okay, after some time I checked on another interview I had done and there also it was the same result. I was sad but I put on a brave face, that's when a crisis came in my work, a report I sent to the client turned out to be wrong, this report will apparently be used for their internal purposes. My manager was the worst yesterday. I was as stoic and uncaring as I could be for as long as I can, I didn't want this to impact my already terrible day. However today I have a call regarding the ""Grave error"" committed by me with him and his senior manager and I am sad and scared if I might just quit out of frustration. I am a newly married man, I have responsibilities and all but I just don't know what to feel but anxious and dejected. It's been long since I relaxed and just had nothing to worry about. But everyone from my parents to (I suspect) even my wife needs me to hold on to this job until I find another one. I suffer from overthinking and anxiety all my life, and due to that life has been more difficult for me. But I don't know if anyone understands the chaos in my mind. I have been imprisoned in everyone's expectation of me to be a high earning member. I don't know what to do.

I know that he struggles to deal with my anxiety. He is such a sweetheart and he tries, but he is at a loss whenever I have intrusive or obsessive thoughts, intense worrying, panic attacks... these days I feel him becoming more and more distant.

An ex told me I was ""too demanding"" when I asked him for more support, emotional and other. nothing crazy, just stuff like doing his fair share of house chores because doing everything or living in a mess made me anxious. Im starting to think my current bf thinks the same thing but won't tell me. Today he's left all my messages on read. 

I am so deeply in love. If he leaves me, I don't know how I'll carry on. We share a home and a cat, but he is the owner of both so I will lose everything. 

It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I worry so much about a him leaving me that he'll end up leaving me.  I feel like no one will ever be able to share their life with me because of my anxiety. If he really does leave me, I think this is IT for me... I can't fall in love again, and be left again because of my anxiety or related needs. This is my 4th serious relationship.

Of course, the State I live in has this wild rule that with certain anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medications, you have to physically see the doctor for an appointment every 4 months (the months in between you have to go into the office to physically pickup a refill slip) and of course, my luck, this is that 4th month where I have to physically meet with the doctor to discuss my medication and obtain a refill; apparently there‚Äôs no way for my doctor to override that rule.

because of several weeks of bad weather I ran out of Lexapro.  I have a fairly small dose but I've been on for about 2 years. I've been thinking about trying to go off of it for a while now and when I ran out it seemed like a good time to see what happened.

So far the experience hasn't been too terrible. I expected to feel somewhat differently but because it was a low dose I didn't expect the change to be as abrupt or his noticeable as it has been.

I've had a fair bit of nervous energy. Like I'm vibrating under my skin. also a lot of the tingling sensation all over my body that I had before I went on it. Have definitely been easier to startle.

it hasn't been significantly interfering with my life like it had before but I can definitely tell the difference.

So I guess my real question/point of posting is when you went off Lexapro is this how you felt? Did your symptoms return quickly? Also, if you remained off of it how did you cope with some of those physical symptoms that I described?

I'll try an keep this short. I'm a 27 year old male. Ended up taking SSRI's after accutane left me with horrible suicidal thoughts, anxiety, an depression.  Tried a lot of different ones out there currently taking Lexapro 20mg/daily.

The problem is all of these meds have either made my anxiety worse or caused me to throw up.
Lexapro seemed to be working great for a bit but now it's messing with my stomach. Haven't thrown up from it yet but currently feel really nauseous after taking it.

I'm worried about what's going to happen when I'm an old man, as I'm only 27. How is my body going to deal with this stuff when I'm not young an able to handle as much? 

I have Klonopin for panic attacks aswell but only take it as needed because of past addiction problems. 

Anyone else feel the same or able to offer some insight? Tips? Etc? 

Anything helps tbh. I used to take Zoloft an to stop myself from puking I'd eat as much as I could when I took it. Didn't work out very well lol.

I have had anxiety my whole life. The biggest things that make me anxious has changed a lot throughout my life from being afraid of losing to my mom, to being scared of my teachers, making friends, looking stupid in front of classmates... you get the idea. Right now I have a lot of anxiety about finding work/a career one day, and more broadly finding a place in the world that I can fit into and feel like I belong somewhere that suits me. I am an undergraduate in university right now so I know a lot of people in this kind of position too. 
I think I use my anxiety as a way to punish myself for not having done enough and getting myself into the position I am in. I blame myself for my difficulty with finding a job because I haven‚Äôt worked enough previously and stuff like that. I am also kinda introverted and so interviews are a big hurdle for me too. I know I can‚Äôt really control my anxiety, but I think I somehow use it as a way to motivate/punish myself for how I feel, and because of that I feel like I can‚Äôt allow myself to feel happy or relaxed. If I am having a good day my mind will say ‚Äúyou have no right to feel like way because what about X, Y, and Z.‚Äù I feel like I am not allowed to have problems and also be happy because I blame myself for those problems so I shouldn‚Äôt get to be happy. I do think I am a pretty happy person but I go through bad episodes of anxiety that is hard on me.

I'm driving down the interstate and fear every car by me might change lands and ram into me, or I'll have a blowout and get in a wreck myself. I'll check the tires before driving and it's never happened but it's just the only thought I have when driving.

I freak out and get jealous over someone I'm not even dating, I put the assumptions in my head that they must be talking to him or him because this probably coincidence happened and in my mind it looked funny.

I really don't know what's wrong with me sometimes but my mood can change in a instant if my mind assumes the worse which it seems to always do. Maybe I'm bipolar.

For example, reading subs about being foreveralone and datingover30 or 40 and lo and behold i end up in those age categories and single. Theres nothing wrong with being 30+ and single but I am refering to being in your 20s and already mentally preparing yourself to be single in the future and that actually manifesting vs someone who was actually out living life and dating and is now 30+ and single.

I feel like I would have been better off if I was just those people who goes with the flow and lives life seeing where it takes you, I may have been more successful. not neccesarily looking for advice but rather sharing my experience, don't be like me! especially if you are in your teens or 20s, try to stay positive and assume you are going to win vs psyching yourself out by researching possible failures.",Anxiety,researching into failure,2021-03-16 06:27:46

1434,homeless_deer,1615834533,1,"Quick backstory. Beginning of this year I found a therpaist that specializes in GAD and ERP therapy (I also have severe OCD). 

We got to the topic of, following COVID rules, going out to meet friends as an exposure. I told her I didn't have a ton of friends to hang out with, either because a) they moved across the country  b) they're a bad influence / do shit I don't wanna get involved with or c) I lost connections to em after highschool. 

So I told her that I don't have a tonna close friends right now. And she went on saying how I ""must not have a ton of friends"" and how I might ""feel very lonely"". Her tone didn't sound all too sympathetic either. 

My therapist runs on tough love, as in emotions later, just do the damn exposure, man up and conquer your OCD. Which, I'll admit, gets me out and about. But that one line she said really hit somethin in me.
The thing is, I didn't feel lonely until after she pointed out to me. I liked being independent. I'm sure she said that to stir up some motivation to go out and meet people, but honestly it just makes me feel worse about myself. Like, ""oh geez I really am a lonley person, geez I really don't have a lotta friends, wow I'm a loser."" I pretty much minded my own business throughout highschool and floated a ton around friend groups. Sure I talked to people but I never gained a tonna close friends, I didn't really want to in a way.

I guess my anxiety started way back when I was a kid (around 7-8) after the divorce of my parents. Before, I used to be quite a fearless and happy young lad, but I became more fearful and anxious over.. basically everything. After a few years of panic attacks due to bullying (when I was 10-11), my anxiety started to dumb down, I only had a few health anxiety related fears here and there, but nothing serious... until the pandemic started. Being stuck at home for all year didn't do nothing good for my mental health, and I started having more fears, especially health anxiety, I was afraid that I had 2-3 types of cancer, and today I worry that I got a brain eating amoeba and also that food got stuck in my lungs, so basically constant panic attacks and surfing on the internet. Stress due to online school also plays a huge part in my recent anxiety, with way more tests and in general harder work than real life school. The pandemic has basically made me even more anxious due to me not seeing anyone my age for months and living in constant fear of virus and many, many other things.

1445,larki18,1615831720,1,"I have GAD, panic disorder, trichotillomania and phobias. For the last sixteen years I've had nightmares all night, every night. *Constantly.* I wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first few good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I found nothing to help.

Until now! Medications such as Prazosin and Topamirate are commonly prescribed to reduce uncontrollable nightmares. About a month ago I added Topamirate personally to my SSRI, I take 25 mg 2x/day. It started working on day three. It has reduced my nightmares *shockingly* well, by perhaps 80%...I probably dream like a regular person now!! I have long periods of dreamless sleep, I have normal, not completely disturbing dreams! I could cry. *Amazing.* This was an awful problem that plagued me for *sixteen* years and persisted through cognitive behavioral therapy, through my massively helpful SSRI which eradicated my anxiety, through *everything..*it seemed bulletproof. I'm so happy.

In general for sleep issues, these things may help if you haven't given them a shot already:

- Avoid alcohol and caffeine
- Melatonin is paradoxically most effective in *small* doses under 1 mg
- Make sure you're going to sleep and waking up on a consistent schedule, whether or not you have to go to work or have plans that day
- You may find yoga or exercise a few hours before bed helpful, or meditation just before bed
- Have a consistent bedtime routine
- Avoid bright light and screens before bed
- Try not to eat 2-3 hours before bed - when you're still digesting food in your sleep it can increase nightmares and sleep disturbances
- Try listening to audiobooks or podcasts on a 30-60 minute timer to prevent ruminating, racing thoughts and overthinking from keeping you awake
- Try a sleep medication such as hydroxyzine - I have insomnia and with hydroxyzine I've gone from waking 7-8 times a night to only 3-4",Anxiety,"Bye, endless nightmares!!! God bless Topiramate!",2021-03-16 05:08:40

1458,puddingatfouram,1615829893,1,"Ok so I have suffered from a myriad of mental illnesses most of my life that culminate into different symptoms, one of the biggies being extreme anxiety. All my life I have been trying to curtail it in order to live a relatively ""normal"" less dramatic life. I was proud of myself for landing a job for almost 6 years now in food service where I have been a manager for more than a year.  Three things have landed me in the position I'm in now, which I'll get to. They are; COVID, the increase in responsibility and stress at work, and a recent medication change. 

Where I am now is...obnoxious and debilitating. I had a major panic attack (first one in almost 3 years) and left work for the first time ever. The next time I tried to work I had yet another panic attack. The idea of coming back into work made me nauseated so I was sent home and have been in limbo ever since. It's been less than a week of me not working, I am contacting my therapist/psychiatrist/friends/family because I'm not thinking quite rationally and they all said I should go to an outpatient psychiatric program. I want to, but I contacted the hospital today and said it would be about another 3 weeks to be admitted into the program and then it would be at least a 4 week program. So I have a decision to make. I want to work, however when I have anxiety like this I become unpredictable and I am realistically afraid that if I go to work I will either have another meltdown or I will lash out at a customer/co-worker (my anxiety manifests itself into intense anger). But if I don't go to work for 2 months I have to not only tell my boss (which I am absolutely petrified of doing) but risk a) getting fired (also terrifying) and/or b) having them be mad at me/judgmental and c) what if I'm faking all of it?! What if I'm just doing this for attention and/or I'm just lazy and don't want to work anymore. Ok, that's the anxiety talking, I know I am not doing that, but that voice is very loud right now and I am frozen. 

Because of my illnesses, I have always worked my ass off to hold down a steady job and not complain about it. The illness is front and center now and not only am I embarrassed, but I care for my co-workers and bosses (they have been very good to me in the past and one of them said that my health is more important than the job but technically they have to say that, right?). 

Basically...I want validation and/or if I'm making a huge mistake for someone to tell me so. If I take the two months off will my co-workers and bosses hate me/fire me/think I'm lazy and is it justified? Or am I being weak and should I just go to work and hope I don't do something harmful/embarrassing that also hurts me in the process.

1459,DupCup,1615829834,1,"this is probably a very common topic and as a teenager its probably very very common to worry about. with everyone else i am a little scared but with this one friend its more than usual. ill call them bunny.

ive kind of had a bad past with bunny. its not too terrible, but we both had a mutual friend and hung out a lot. without me knowing they both secretly didn't like me. i kind of picked up on it, but i tried to sum it up to anxiety. then it came out through secret groupchats that our mutual friend had planned to leave me and they both discussed how unenjoyable it was to talk to me and how i was a lost cause. 

which is understandable since middle school me was very toxic. i was always going through something emotionally and had a bad home situation. i didnt have anyone to turn to. i also have a bad habit of accidentally revealing too much about how sad i was to random strangers and put my friends at that time through emotional torture.

i'm also really clingy and dont know shit about social cues or how to act normally in a social situation. so my two friends often got frustrated with me. plus me and our mutual friend always clashed since she was very bullheaded and she always made me anxious and i cried alot after conversations due to accidentally making her angry. so it was for the best.

currently me and bunny are still friends and theyve apologized too much for it. there was also an incident where i found a chat log in a group chat they invited me to with their other friends about them telling their friends that im annoying but 'fun to talk to'. they apologized for that. 

i cant talk to bunny without feeling like theyre lying to me. anytime ive been invited to hang out with their other friends i ended up crying and having a meltdown about feeling like they despise me and constantly checking that they havent said anything bad about me. during conversations im so scared that bunny is slipping from me and only talking to me out of pity. ive asked so many times, and they always apologized for the past and tell me they dont hate me. 

i want to talk to them more and call them more, but i hate feeling on the verge of tears and this impending doom whenever they talk to me for more than three minutes. im scared that our phone calls are just a nuisance and they think im boring. im scared that they want so badly to tell me that they hate me and dont want to talk to me anymore.

i know it doesnt sound that extreme, but inside theres so much emotional torture and labor, this paranoia and alot of tears that i cant really describe that well. maybe im just over exaggerating.",Anxiety,anxious about my friend hating me secretly,2021-03-16 04:37:14

I have been in an on-and-off holding pattern with my current job's work assignments, and I am really uncertain about my future in this current role. There was a time over the summer where I was prepared to wake up and be told I was being let go every day.

My partner has been out of town for almost two months and after spending almost an entire year together due to a quarantine-specific arrangement, this has been a really intense shift that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be as difficult.

I‚Äôm subleasing and my roommate has been on rent strike for almost a year over building conditions (including mold throughout the entire apartment including my bedroom/office space). These conditions have been going on for a long time. I can‚Äôt feasibly see how I‚Äôm going to spend this summer working from home in the heat and in a space that‚Äôs crumbling around me. I already feel like I spend so much time in my room and think I‚Äôd probably even need to take my meals in my room just to have air conditioning come July and August. Another unexpected physical symptom: pain at the nape of my neck.

So I‚Äôm looking for a solo living space. I‚Äôve seen close to ten places, and it‚Äôs feeling like another full time job to get out of a toxic situation and into a place where I actually can meet my needs and feel safe, all the while knowing that this search is being formed out of a place of trauma and paranoia. One I really liked and was actually in my price range fell through (somebody who makes six figures came in and took the place).

While walking over the weekend with this all on my mind (and headphones on), I got over to a city park entrance where there were just too many people, too many dogs sizing each other up (and I always assume things are going to turn south when I watch this happen), too much noise, and too many people with petition clipboards. I felt unsafe, like the clipboards were going to be used to inflict pain, and I cut people off and nearly jumped over a partition to avoid people I thought that were looking to stop me. I started twisting my hands like they had tambourines in them as a response. Does anybody else find they‚Äôre doing that as a coping mechanism?

So, I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I suddenly got a fear that I would turn into a pedophile somehow (despite being disgusted by the thought of children like that, immediately turned off whenever I got a thought of them like that my entire life up until now.),, i have ocd and once I feared I was a cannibal, another time I feared I was gay, (all of which I ended up not being) but now it turned into fear of turning into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I am one now, because just ew. But I‚Äôm terrified of turning into one

So I was having anxiety over it today and I had a compulsion. Once I read a story of a guy who looked at shota which is like anime drawings of boys who are young teens or pre teens i think and said he wished he never got into that stuff because maybe he wouldn‚Äôt be a pedo then. And I got so scared that if I saw shota I would be attracted and turn into a pedophile. So I had a compulsion to look at a picture of a shota (this seems counterintuitive and it is, but that‚Äôs what my compulsions are like. When I had religious ocd that god would do something bad to me I had compulsions to search up people who had bad experiences with God because my whacked brain thought somehow that would soothe my ocd which it only made it worse. I felt like I HAD to search up these experiences and read them because if I didn‚Äôt idk I just had to and I hated it)

Looking at it immediately it just grossed me out. It wasn‚Äôt porn or anything, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stomach looking at that. It was of a boy maybe 12? I‚Äôm 15, so that‚Äôs a 3 year difference but still it was an anime drawing so they could‚Äôve been younger or older I don‚Äôt know. I had a fear that I would find attraction to it, and though i guess a 3 year age difference wouldn‚Äôt be the worst, my fear is that I‚Äôll be attracted to it and then when I age, the age I‚Äôm attracted to wont age if that makes sense. Because I read stories of pedophiles where that happened to them.

they were wearing clothes but the picture was sort of in like that ‚Äúinnocent but sexual implications‚Äù manner, that in itself made me uncomfy but my ocd kept telling me I could be attracted and so I was really focusing on my groin area to see if I felt anything/felt attracted because I was utterly terrified that I would get turned on by it and turn into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I felt turned on, more uneasy and anxious. But this is the worst part, but I felt like I had to do it to make sure I wasn‚Äôt attracted and I could stop worrying about it. I want to kill myself because of it and I just want to throw up and I can‚Äôt believe I even tried it but I attempted to touch myself to see if it felt pleasurable or uncomfortable, and I felt uncomfortable. After like 3 seconds I had to stop because I just couldn‚Äôt stomach it and Felt so grossed out that they looked young and it was a child and just gross. 

But it‚Äôs the fact that I even looked that up, the fact that I even did that I haven‚Äôt been able to eat all morning because my appetite is gone and I feel like the worst person ever and that I am a pedophile. I‚Äôm scared I want to kill myself and I probably will because I‚Äôm to scared to live and see if I turn out to be a pedophile. I‚Äôm so so sorry for even doing that and it was so wrong and I feel like puking. I hate my compulsions because I feel like I have to do them to make sure I‚Äôm not what I‚Äôm scared of being. I don‚Äôt know what to do I had to get this off my chest somewhere I‚Äôm really sorry. I‚Äôm really horrible I‚Äôm sorry

I know the comments will either be to see a therapist or maybe to die because of what i did which I wouldn‚Äôt blame them for saying that, but I can‚Äôt tell my therapist this I can‚Äôt tell anyone this. I know I‚Äôm not attracted to kids, but I feel overwhelming guilt and hatred to myself that I did that. Now I keep seeing that image in my head and I want to puke.

Things like not sharing my true wants and feelings, being an intense people pleaser, avoiding making any decisions for myself, avoiding all uncomfortable emotional situations, not seeking help etc.  This clarity is resulting in even more anxiety over practically missing out on my 20s and I feel like I‚Äôm in a spiral. 

On top of that, I‚Äôm also in a critical point in my life where I have to decide to reluctantly move back home to my family and just live ‚Äútheir life‚Äù, or to stay in the city I‚Äôm in with no real support group other than a few decent friends who I have fun with and live alone. I love this city and I want so bad to find someone here to share the experience with, but I am lonely. If I move back home, I only have this awesome experience for myself and nobody at home could possibly know how much and why I love this life so much. The act of moving and going back to that life is also causing a great deal of anxiety. 

Even though I feel like I‚Äôve come a long way in recognizing everything that was affecting me emotionally, I now feel the burden of regret an inability to handle my new anxieties. Can anyone relate?

1489,mandhow,1615823453,1,"I'm currently taking an SNRI that is helping me but causing some sexual side effects.  My psychiatrist and I will be working together to lower it a bit in the next couple of months to see if that helps.

I really want to give myself the best chance of success by supplementing my SNRI with another method of fighting anxiety.  Obviously doing as many as possible is better, but time/energy only allows for so much.  What does everyone think is the single best additional remedy I should explore from the list below ?  I should also mention that CBT isn't on this list because I am already about to start seeing my (awesome) therapist again.

1. **Exercise** \- Right now I'm pretty sedentary.  I have health anxiety and rapid heart rate is a trigger for me, but I have successfully worked through to become a regular jogger (in the past).
2. **Meditation** \- I've tried this in the past with varying levels of success.
3. **Elimination/reduction of alcohol intake** \- I have 4-5 units of alcohol, 1-2 times a week.  One of my earliest triggers was in my early 20s (when I drank a LOT more) and I would get panic attacks when I was hungover.  I don't get that as much any more but I do notice my I'm moody and irritable the day after drinking.  I don't smoke weed anymore or do other drugs (10+ years since my anxiety put a stop to all of that).
4. **Reduction of screen time** \- I spend a lot of time glued to my phone/laptop.  I have gotten off of Facebook/Instagram completely but still browse a lot (and constantly check my work email).
5. **Reduction of workplace stress** \- My job is quite stressful and the only thing I could really do about it would be to switch industries (which would reduce my income quite a bit but it would not be impossible).
6. **More time outside** \- You could say that this is tied to #1 above but in this case I'm talking less about working out and more time outdoors.  I usually do indoor activities and have to push myself to get outside.
7. **Yoga** \- Again you could say this is related to #1 above but I've heard a lot of people specifically focus in on yoga as being helpful for anxiety and depression.
8. **Anything I missed?**

I was at my psychiatrist last week and we got to talking about using logical, rational thoughts to overrule the anxious ones. One of my bigger anxiety triggers is driving. He asked me ""What's the worst that could happen?"" And I responded, ""I could die."" Do I understand that the likelihood of that is very, very small? Yes, I understand the basics of statistics. Does it seem to matter when my /literal death/ is a not completely unreasonable outcome for the situation? Not at all. 

I used to be afraid of weird things as a child (monsters in the dark, aliens attacking Earth, gravity suddenly failing), but I was able to use logic to get over them.

None of these things are illogical and happen to people every freaking day. 

I tried to explain that this is the thought process I go through with some situations, but his only response was to ask, ""But is that /really/ going to happen?"" I wanted to scream at him and say, ""How do you know it isn't?""

1517,FreshStart2020-21,1615813833,1,"Hi All:

First time posting here. I am a 40 something male who was diagnosed with generalized anxiety about 10 years ago after a full blown anxiety/panic attack. In hindsight, definitely showed signs of anxiety before that incident. I have been prescribed meds to help with my anxiety, which helps but definitely does not alleviate it completely. 

Back in October my anxiety was getting worse - like bad (COVID lockdown has not helped in this department) so in order to help I decided to stop drinking. I definitely self medicated with alcohol to help alleviate the anxiety that would build up during the day. The next day was obviously worse. Nasty cycle. After successfully weaning myself off alcohol, I eventually gave up nicotine as well. Unfortunately, after a few months of not smoking, my anxiety got so bad one day that I went and picked up a pack of cigarettes. Still smoking a handful of cigarettes a day despite knowing this just makes things worse.

I have been working out a few days a week, the most I can with my work schedule. I am now thinking it is time to give up caffeine (and nicotine). I don‚Äôt think I am a huge coffee drinker. I get a large coffee in the morning and maybe a medium coffee in the early afternoon. It‚Äôs part habit and part the need for a pick me up. Except along with the pick me up, I feel like complete garbage, mentally and physically. 

I am wondering how folks here get their anxiety under control. I take meds, I haven‚Äôt had alcohol in almost 5 months, I had given up nicotine for almost 3 months, and I am working out. I am exhausted and just want to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and not with this constant weight from anxiety. I think giving up caffeine will help as I have always been sensitive to it, and I feel awful every time I have it.

Open to any suggestions.

Thank you all. Have a great start to the week.

I basically go to different hospitals, medical institutions, etc. across the country to make sure that all of the procedures are being followed, data matching, and checking patient safety.  I was expected to travel 8-10 times a month and stay there for a couple of days. Once the pandemic closed things down in March 2020 almost everything was online. Now that things are getting ""better"" my company is expecting us to pick up our old metrics for traveling. 

I was always on the fence about my job and the career path I chose, but after the pandemic hit I've been having increased anxiety. Even with my meds and coping techniques I am still questioning if this is what I want to do for the rest of my life, and that just fuels my panic more. I have two visits planned this week and I feel sick to my stomach. Insomnia has definitely kicked in and just random bouts of feeling like i'm about to have a heart attack.

i've tried talking to a few friends and family about this but I've been getting a lot of comments like ""Well it's a good job think of your future"", ""Nurses are doing way more than you are"", and ""Suck it up"".

today i had an interview, halfway while i was introducing myself, my interviewer cut me off and said ‚Äúi‚Äôm sure your school taught u better than this‚Äù, which left me pretty shook. both the fact that he was so rude about it (he proceeded to make snarky comments throughout my interview) and that, perhaps, i am not good at interviews and hence i haven‚Äôt gotten any internships.

1535,healthaboveall1,1615807713,1,"Hello everyone.   


I am on the edge at the moment and it feels like I am about to experience a stroke or TIA. I am like 90% sure I won't, but breathing and relaxing doesn't help..   


Not looking for diagnose as even my GP and psychologist I've seen are clueless like I am. Just want to see if I am not some kind of alien and I have something in common with you lot.  


I'm 32 male, never had serious issues with mental health or any health to be honest, I've lead healthiest lifestyle I could afford. It didn't matter much and I was unlucky enough to have a silent and atypical stroke on 25th of October last year and I was doing great. I've manage to regain my balance, I could walk, run, swallow and my hiccups stopped and I was back at work after a month. So from January this year when I've started having these episodes where it seems I was loosing it.. There was always a trigger and it was usually a nausea or weird headache. I am not even sure what PTSD is, but I was reliving my stroke twice a week and usually at night. It exhausted me both mentally and physically and I lost nearly 1.5st/10kg. 

I was in ER 8 times (!!!) this year alone and it was always nothing. MRI/CTA scans showed that I'm fully healed and my brain had no changes.  

Now, last week I've ended up in ER again. But this time I was in other country than of my residence. I was leading the meeting when I started to get very nauseous and dizzy out of the blue. I am ok with people, I do not have stage fright and meeting was very casual. I just turned pale and dizzy. It was such a strong episode and most of it is blocked by my memory so I can't even describe it properly.   


I tensed up, both of my hands froze and finger turned white from all the pressure. I couldn't move them, nausea and dizziness came in waves. I was getting even worse symptoms than when I was having my stroke. And I was loosing it the ambulance vehicle. I was shaking, my mouth was dry and I got massive headaches and pins &amp; needles on my stroke side.  I had tight throat, almost like globus, but it felt like a paralysed flap in my throat, tonsil or something. I also got massive GERD. I was 100% sure I was having a stroke or haemorrhage. But I wasn't.  
My symptoms subsided after 6 hours and I felt really sleepy, yet I couldn't sleep. My phone died and I had no connection with anyone. I was like hundreds of miles away from home and they had no medical records of me there, they even questioned the stroke. But I didn't care at this point..   


Now for the last two days - my stomach is being a nice guy, I have almost no nausea and dizziness, but yet my hands are getting numb, usually on one side. I get pins and needless, some weird feeling in my tummy and shortness of breath. And some random pains here and there.   
There are no triggers. What is that what I am having, it makes no sense biologically, lol.

So I‚Äôll keep it short. I recently went through an incredibly painful and emotionally taxing breakup that‚Äôs resulting in me breaking the chains of a lot of things that once eternally scared me. I frequently feel depressed and anxious to go to bed, because my significant other used to always be there.

Pity party aside, my real issue is that, as our breakup began to become clear (something either she or I was going to initiate as we‚Äôd been a month into a break), I started taking the generic SSRI for Lexapro. I‚Äôd been on fluoxetine before, and had great results with it, and figured while I made a ton of painful life changes, I could use it to help ease me into a VERY different looking life than I‚Äôve ever had. Well, six weeks into the treatment, and around a month after our breakup, I start having suicidal ideation. Freaks me the hell out, call my doctor right away, and begin halving my pills as he suggested, and one week later, I‚Äôm totally off them.

Well my doctor kinda sucks, and didn‚Äôt tell me there‚Äôs withdrawal symptoms that can feel and behave an awful lot like being on the medication still.

As a result, as of the past five or so days, I‚Äôve grown increasingly nauseous, and have random chills. Worse than that, I basically have jolts of depression and crying, so I‚Äôll be fast asleep (something that‚Äôs kinda tough thanks to the newly developing insomnia) and my ex will basically invade my world like in dark souls, and absolutely destroy my mental state, and i land squarely in crying, feeling depressed, aimless, and scared.

I haven‚Äôt been on Lexapro that long, but I‚Äôm reading it can take three months for the withdrawals to fade. At this point, I‚Äôm looking to switch to Fluoxetine to treat my depression and anxiety, and have an appointment with my doctor again soon to address these concerns.

But until then, anyone have any background with this SSRI and have any advice on how to keep my cool? Beneath it all, I‚Äôm feeling better after the insane emotional turmoil that was the lead up to my breakup, but I am just BEAT to hell and back with the come up of Lexapro and the weening off of it, all while adapting to an awful lot of change.

They determined it was anxiety causing me to feel this way.

This weekend recent events in the world and in my life triggered something in me and this weekend I went through it bad.

On Saturday I woke up like normal, and I was going through social media and generally scrolling on my phone and something just triggered me. My heart rate shot up, I felt this huge sinking feeling, I was constantly on edge, and I was just fearful of things that I really shouldn't have been.   
I was to a point paralysed by it, I slept nearly all day because it was the only time I was really at peace/not worried about random stuff.  
Since, I have deleted most social media, Twitter/Facebook/Instagram, all which I can't really control the content (I feel like I have some control on Reddit with the subreddits that I follow only contain topics that I enjoy). 

I called my friend up and I talked about it which really helped, in the moment, but I have still had small spikes here and there over the rest of the weekend!

For most people who have anxiety, usually they are somewhat anti-social, which for me makes it very awkward when talking to people. It‚Äôs sometimes even awkward talking to relatives. I basically hate everyone at my school because to me they seem like annoying, rude people. This may be why I only have 2 friends, but I‚Äôm fine with that. Let me just tell you what I feel like when I talk to people. When I talk to someone, I usually don‚Äôt know how to reply, and then it gets really awkward. I also feel like if I say something humorous or if I say my opinion, they might not find my humor funny, or might find my opinion weird or offensive. I really only think this because when I was younger, whenever I said something with confidence, people always judged me, which really hurt my feelings. When someone talks about something I have never heard of and they expect me to reply with something, I just start to panic when I don‚Äôt know what to say. I move my hands in repeated motions, sometimes bite my tongue purposely, and move my legs closer together. I just feel like nobody seems to like me or really care about me (well except my relatives, but not including them), and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. It makes me uncomfortable to talk to a group of people for some reason, and to people I barely know.

Mostly I‚Äôve improved in lots of areas, having less panic attacks and am able to transition well from task to task during the day. But my reflection went deep, back to elementary school 16 years ago. 

I was so afraid to voice myself, and it was because of what I know as anxiety today. But back then I didn‚Äôt know I had anxiety, in fact I‚Äôd never heard of it at that stage in life.

I received a report card for the semester, it had the first negative comment I‚Äôd ever received. I was ‚Äòeasily distracted by peers.‚Äô This got my anxious brain ticking, trying to understand where this comment had stemmed from. The only thing I could pinpoint was that as a kid I was very forgetful, I‚Äôd often ask my friend who sat next to me to borrow their eraser or sharpener. These are things I forgot to pack all the time. So I made a point to start remembering these things.

One day during the next semester (same teacher) we were taking an exam in class. The led on the bottom of my pencil snapped off. I had only brought 1 pencil into the exam. I FORGOT my sharpener. I was sitting there so anxious I wanted to cry. I couldn‚Äôt even put my hand up to ask my teacher if I could get my sharpener from my bag, I was too afraid for some reason. I was so anxious and wanted to be a good student, I just didn‚Äôt understand how to do it. 

After a few minutes of panic, I decided to write my entire exam with that tiny piece of led that snapped off of my pencil. I don‚Äôt even know how I did it, but I did. 

These sorts of scenarios of being so anxious I couldn‚Äôt speak up occurred for quite a few years. Luckily as an adult I‚Äôve learnt to voice myself in important situations, but I am still afraid to do small things like ask for extra sauce from the server at a restaurant for example.

I'm currently having some mone  issues -nothing terribly serious, but money's tight- so I can't go to therapy. I don't want to talk about this with my friends because I don't want to be a burden (even though I know they'll never think of me like that and they'd like me to talk to them instead of building up anxiety like I'm doing) and I also don't want them to look at me with different eyes. I don't want to disappoint them.

The isolation is really getting in my head, even though I live with a friend (F) and I've seen some other friends, but always with distancig. I miss contact. I mean, my friend always hugs me but I really miss my bf. We haven't seen each other in a long time (he's living in another city) and when he was about to come visit... lockdown.

I'm behind at work. I'm still doing the bare minimum I must but I'm behind in so many things and they keep coming, not only in work but also in a personal proyect.

And then there's this other guy. Don't get my wrong, I'm not cheating my bf, we have an understanding. We both know that in distance there are things that we can't provide each other and it's ok if something happens with other people. I love him, and I don't see myself being in a relationship with anybody else. But I really miss having contact. I'm not talking just about sex, I'm talking things like watching a movie while hugging and stuff like that. Ik, lame. But I've always been like that. Can't help it.

So, back to the guy. He's nice. Kinda bi, but I'm not sure. I mean we've talked about guys we like (famous people) but he also told me about his past gfs and the girl that he's currently sort of in love with but she left him. idk if anything will happen with him. I don't even know if I want something to happen with him more than some snugglig.

Having all this stuff happening and having to try and keep a somewhat happy face is consuming me. Today I had to focus all my mental energy just to get up and eat something -at 4pm- and when my friend told me out of the blue she loved me and she was happy we're living together I almost burst out in tears. I can¬¥t go on like that. I need to at least talk about this or else I might explode.

2. Weed. I smoke every once in a while, I don't wanna get too addicted to it.
3. Any activity that requires focus. Recently I've been getting into embroidery and it really makes me concentrate so my mind doenst get a chance to stress. Reading also helps if I really like the book.
6. B complex. Not sure if this one helps too much but I read it does so I try to take that supplement once a day.
7. Meditation. This only works if I am relatively calm. If I'm very anxious this won't work for me.

But when my cat died I suddenly started seeing everyone close to me (particularly pets) as just time bombs of emotional agony. It's not like regular fears because unlike most things, everyone I love WILL die.

Early last week my other cat had a health scare which had me very rattled, then the next day my  mother (who is a breast cancer survivor of twenty years) learned that during a recent mammogram they had found precancerous cells and as a precaution they will be performing a precautionary mastectomy.

While my mother is strangely upbeat about, given she's waited two decades waiting for it to come back, that she'll have this done and dusted. I myself am an absolute wreck.

Context needed: For those outside of the UK or the scope of our news, (possible TW, couldn‚Äôt add two flairs) a woman was recently kidnapped and murdered by a police officer while walking home at night in the same city I live in. On top of this, someone was just murdered by stabbing on the street outside of my place of work. I‚Äôve already had a lot of anxiety about getting home after work, because I am a bartender who can finish as late as 3am and I rely on public transport to get home, Ubers if the trains aren‚Äôt running and I can afford it, or a 30 minute walk in the worst scenario. I deal with many male aggressive types at my pub, and at times have been approached by them again on my walk to the station, or by other random men in the street. As pubs haven‚Äôt been open for a while, I‚Äôm absolutely sure that people are going to be drinking a lot more than usual and their behaviour will be worse as a result. The streets are lit, but not well. The roads are not overly populated, but at the times when my shifts finish, there are still often people hanging around in doorways and alleys- drunk or otherwise. 

I am due back to work on April 12th, and this all in combination has been spinning around my brain and has sent me into a complete and utter anxiety overdrive. I just burst into tears at the thought of going out alone full stop right now, let alone at night.
Long and short of it, I want to ask my boss if I could be put on earlier shifts. However, I‚Äôm getting anxious in a separate way about what to say and how it‚Äôs going to be perceived.

I just started developing an extreme fear of my life ending, but not the way you'd think. I'm not scared of being hurt or car crashes or dying right now, I'm scared of dying in the future. 

Let me explain; My biggest fear is death. But not in the way you think that will make you laugh, because I'm only 22 and have so much time left so my fear seems silly to lots of people, my old therapist included.

But my fear of death is more like; when you are getting ready for bed and you look outside and you realise you were doing the exact same thing yesterday at the same time, and it's been 24 hours. Its been a full day since you last went to sleep, and yet you're doing it again. And you remember it so vividly in your minds eye because it seems like it was a minute ago, although you consciously comprehend it was 24 hours ago, it's so vivid because it was so recent. And if 24 hours feels this short, feels like a minute to you, you'll feel the same in another 24 hours. You'll lose a day in a minute. And if that keeps happening, day after day, and you can't stop it no matter what, soon it will have been years. And it will feel like a minute. It will feel like a day. 

It feels like my consciousness just experienced yesterday night. And now my consciousness is in this moment. So soon, although I don't know it yet, my consciousness will be in my 70s. My 80s. Soon I will die and there's nothing I can do to stop that. My consciousness will be near death in a minute. I am young, I know it's silly, but soon I will die. 

That's how I feel. My last therapist laughed at me being that he was an older man, and recommended me to try to find a religion. 

I feel like I've given up on trying to find someone who can help me feel better about this. It brings me so much anxiety when I have one of these ""realisation moments"" that I have panic attacks.

Because I always tried my best to keep to myself, no one at school really knew who I was. (I only had about 2 friends at the time.)

Does anyone else feel extremely awkward around your own parents/family? 

Backstory: I‚Äôm 20, turning 21 this year. I‚Äôm going into nursing school this year and completing my second degree. When I was younger, I came out as gay to my grandma and grandpa (my parents.) They didn‚Äôt accept it at all, and I mean at all. I was 12 when I came out to them but they never accepted me so instead they had me go to church with them for 4 years in hopes to ‚Äúchange‚Äù my ways. I still live with them sadly, but it‚Äôs the only place I can go because of housing costs and school. 

My grandpa was extremely domestically violent, and he used to punch holes in the wall. He would scream at my grandmother and take a gun to pretend he was killing himself. One time my grandmother found porn on his laptop (to older people it‚Äôs nearly a capital violation of marriage) and he took the laptop and smashed it onto the ground with the keys going everywhere. I‚Äôve witnessed many days of violence in this house and it‚Äôs days I‚Äôll never forget. 

On top of the violence, being gay in a southern Baptist family can be a bad mix, especially for a child. I was always told I wasn‚Äôt normal and I needed to change, which led me to being very depressed. I don‚Äôt eat with them, nor do I have family gatherings with them. On Christmas Day I‚Äôd rather spend time to myself in my room than sitting in the living room on the couch. When the entire family gets together, I‚Äôm always the black sheep. Everyone treats me as if I‚Äôm somewhat different? 

Mind you I had plenty of friends in highschool. I would love going outside and laughing with them, and playing volleyball or going to visit friends in other rooms was super fun. I wasn‚Äôt quiet and everyone knew me for being fun and laughable. When I got to college I kinda closed off and became very independent. I stayed in my room mostly, and when I wasn‚Äôt in my room I was going to other people‚Äôs houses or visiting friends. After I finished my associates, I took a small break from school and now we are here. 

When I talk to my grandmother it feels so weird and I get so uncomfortable about everything. I can‚Äôt have a normal conversation without getting that sweaty palm feeling. I stumble on my words and get very anxious even with the most simple conversation. I‚Äôve always told myself I can‚Äôt wait for the day I finish my nursing degree, because when I do I‚Äôm moving as far away as I can. I understand I have the ability to move out at any point if I just get a job, but it‚Äôs very difficult to have a full time job and nursing school. Is it possible? Yes. However I‚Äôd rather take it easy and just suffer through the next year and a half. 

The anxiety I feel when I talk to my parents grows worse everyday. I always feel so different to them. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm afraid they will be against every single thing I say. I‚Äôm always having to put my guard up to avoid confrontation. It‚Äôs recently gotten so bad that even having eye contact is kinda difficult.",Anxiety,Awkward around parents?,2021-03-15 13:33:34

For the past week or two I‚Äôve been anxious about/afraid to go to bed and I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt have insomnia and generally don‚Äôt have an issue falling asleep, I haven‚Äôt been having bad dreams, I don‚Äôt know. Once I lay down to go to sleep it‚Äôs okay, but I‚Äôm just finding myself REALLY not wanting to decide ‚Äúokay, it‚Äôs time for bed now, I‚Äôm going to lay down and go to sleep‚Äù. The only thing I can think of is about two weeks ago I came off one of the worst depressive episodes of my life, and things are better now but some things in my life just aren‚Äôt great (I live with my dad and his girlfriend can‚Äôt stand me, so whenever I find out she‚Äôs coming over it can ruin my whole day with anxiety and bad feelings, that‚Äôs the biggest example), so the only thing I can think of is maybe I just don‚Äôt want to end the current day because at that time I‚Äôm okay and tomorrow I might not be.

1622,Bibblesballs,1615775046,1,"So I have OCD and in the past it‚Äôs convinced my I was a cannibal, that I was bi and was going to turn completely gay, etc. looking back on it I was none of those things, but each time it feels just as real and scary. Anyways, lately I‚Äôve developed some sort of POCD, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a pedophile right now because the thought of children sexually disgusts me and just makes me uncomfortable. (Although intrusive thoughts and anxiety has been trying to convince me I already am one, doing my best to remind myself its my disorder tricking me) But I have a fear of BECOMING a pedophile. 

At first i wasn‚Äôt too scared because I researched that pedophiles were born not made, and your sexuality cant just switch and change. Yes you may realise you are bi or gay at a later time, but you didn‚Äôt switch sexualities. So I figured, if all this time I‚Äôve been disgusted at children being viewed at in that way, then I don‚Äôt have to worry about suddenly turning into one.

That was until I read this reddit comment of a pedophile who said at first he liked both kids and adults, but then as he aged his attraction towards adults diminished and now it‚Äôs mostly to children. This scared me all over again because my fear is that my attraction towards adults will go away and I‚Äôll become a pedophile! (I also have HOCD and fear my attraction towards boys will go away and switch to girls. This worry is what triggered my POCD because I thought ‚Äúwhat if the same could happen with kids?‚Äù And I got a whole new worry.)

I‚Äôm so so scared of becoming a pedo, losing attraction to adults, what if I was a pedo all this time? I‚Äôm so scared and don‚Äôt know what to do and my anxious thoughts won‚Äôt stop. I lost my appetite and had a panic attack over this. This sounds horrible but I tried to force myself to imagine a sexual thought of a child to see test, and every time I couldn‚Äôt do it I just kept cringing  because i just couldn‚Äôt. But here‚Äôs the thing, idk if I keep cringing and getting uncomfortable because it makes me uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt like it, or if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm actually at risk of being attracted to them and having a sexual thought will make me attracted? My brain keeps telling me that I‚Äôm secretly a pedo, that I‚Äôm in denial, or that I‚Äôm not a pedo now but I‚Äôm going to become one and i don‚Äôt know what to do, I want to kill my self before becoming one.",Anxiety,Terrified of becoming a pedophile,2021-03-15 13:24:06
1623,sydsmarie,1615774503,1,"I have been extremely busy lately and all the stress doesn‚Äôt mix well with my anxiety. I have been getting a lot more panic attacks lately and it‚Äôs not exactly fun. 

To start, I‚Äôm a junior in high school. College is just around the corner and I‚Äôm gearing up for adulthood. I take 6 in person classes through my HS and I‚Äôm taking 2 additional college credit courses. I‚Äôm apart of art club, key club, hopefully NHS (still waiting on the letter cause my mail is backed up) student council, prom committee, band (learning a new instrument), soccer, and I‚Äôm a team captain/manager for our powderpuff team. I take it upon myself to do additional projects such as designing shirts for our powderpuff game next month and I‚Äôm already researching scholarships. I‚Äôm apart of AP art and I need to work on my portfolio as well, and I work about 12+ hours a week. I‚Äôm participating in a reading festival as well. On top of all of this, I try to exercise regularly and eat healthy. I‚Äôm even struggling in my math class so now I have to tutor and sessions are an hour long. 

Yes I brought all of this upon myself. To me success is defined as busy, so I need to keep up with a heavy flow. But I have no motivation and my emotions are so whack. I cut sleep to do things I enjoy. I usually read webcomics in my free time since finishing a chapter is a small accomplishment to me, but then I wake up too tired to make myself proper meals and I either starve until dinner or eat cafeteria food. Then I usually have shifts immediately after school and on weekends so i have a limited time frame to get any work done. Shifts end at 10 and since I‚Äôm awake for 16 hours straight, I barely study or do the bare minimum on my work. On my free days my parents want me to make dinner as well. Lots of responsibilities get cut or pushed back and they just continuously pile up. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am starting to panic regularly and I can‚Äôt calm down. I don‚Äôt know what I should cut and how to manage time.

Who do you watch/listen/read on a regular basis and why?

If you have multiple.. share your top 5!

**Heres mine!**

1. Joe Rogan. I love the WIDE range of people he has on his podcast, whether its a physicist or a comedian.
2. H3H3. I love both their podcast and youtube. They just have a vibe that I can relate to and love their podcast guests and the shit they talk about.
3. Paul Rudd. Love all the movies and tv shows hes in. He just has such a likable and lovable personality that I would like to incorporate into myself. More laid back, witty and kind.
4. Yes Theory. Another youtube channel I love. They do SO MUCH crazy social experiments and really push the idea of discomfort and it really helps motivate and drive me to better myself and have more life experiences and be spontaneous
5. Elon Musk. I love how he is so brutally socially awkward but despite his lack of social skills he is still a massively successful person and is STILL likable to so many people. Goes to show that there is no ""one size fits all"" personality to be successful or likable by others.

1631,tossawayandburn,1615773047,1,"This might be a long post, and I‚Äôm sorry. Just got to get this off my chest. 

I graduated university last year and was really worried about not being able to find employment. The pandemic was ramping up and talk of a new recession was putting a lot of unneeded fear in my heart. So I did what I always did when my anxiety flares up and I get scared - I made decisions out of fear and desperation. I applied to any job that I thought would hire me, and gave absolutely no thought to if I would enjoy or be able to handle the work. About 2 or so months of this goes by and I get recommended by a family member to apply for a position as a Covid-19 contact tracer. I live in NY so the need for tracers was extremely high during those early months of covid when the state was drowning in cases. I applied but I didn‚Äôt expect to get a call back since it‚Äôs a state job and in a field completely unrelated to my degree. Anyways I get the job, surprisingly, and go through my training and finally start working. The pay is great and 90 percent of everything I‚Äôve been earning has been going into my savings, but my mental health has plummeted SIGNIFICANTLY over the last 9+ months. Now, my anxiety has always been a constant part of my life. It‚Äôs like a background noise that persists throughout the day. It‚Äôs a part of everything I do - interacting with family, friends, making decisions, not making decisions, etc. 
This job is 100 % a call center job. I‚Äôm given a certain set of assignments (people to call) and I‚Äôm tasked with reaching out to them and letting them know that were exposed to someone with covid or that they themselves are positive and should isolate at home. The calls take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, and most people are really irritated with the interactions. I work full time and some weekends on and off. I wake up and feel an immense sense of dread that makes me sick to my stomach and unable to eat anything, because all I can think about is the wave of people I have to be on the phone with and how difficult they‚Äôre going to be. I don‚Äôt like talking to people if I don‚Äôt have to, and phone conversations, even outside of work have always been dreadful to me. But now I‚Äôm doing it professionally and expected to meet certain performance metrics all while managing the emotions of very frustrated and sometimes downright aggressive people. Not all of the calls are like this, but enough to fill me with gut-twisting anxiety before I dial a number. When I get off work, I‚Äôm so mentally and emotionally drained and I‚Äôm a nervous wreck. That sense of dread creeps in from 6PM until I go to bed and I get so terrified at the thought of waking back up to do it all over again. I don‚Äôt eat properly anymore, I‚Äôve fallen into long periods of really dark depression (suffered from it before but now it‚Äôs back and really bad), I can‚Äôt stop thinking about work, and even when I get a two day weekend (rare) I start dreading going back on the first day of my day off. I‚Äôve been thinking so hard about my life and what I want and it‚Äôs been a constant source of worry and stress and even more so because of this job. I get off and all I can think about is one day leaving and just not doing anything for a few weeks. Just to decompress. I have a dream of what I want to do with my life, and I work on it when I‚Äôm not too tired or anxious, but for the past several months, my work anxiety has drained me of any motivation to learn the skills I need to pursue my dreams. I‚Äôm just so tired and scared all the time and I feel like I‚Äôm on alert every day. I‚Äôm trying to start therapy again but, my work schedule is so weird that it‚Äôs difficult to schedule an appointment. I signed up for a career counselor and I have a meeting with them this week (I asked for a few days off), just to see if I can get guidance on finding jobs that don‚Äôt require the same responsibilities as this one. We‚Äôll see how that goes.

Anyways, work is tomorrow and I‚Äôve spent my whole day worried about it and all the people I need to call. I desperately want to quit, but I‚Äôm so lost. I don‚Äôt know what to do once I‚Äôm out of here. I just want the anxiety to stop. I haven‚Äôt been happy since I started this position. And I know I should be. I have a job during a pandemic and it‚Äôs for the public good, but I‚Äôm so fucking miserable all the time because of it. I just know that it‚Äôs the reason why my anxiety and depression have come back in full force, but I don‚Äôt have the strength or courage to do anything except ‚Äútough it out‚Äù. My friends tell me my mental health comes first, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to get out. I‚Äôm anxious about leaving the job that‚Äôs making me anxious. It‚Äôs awful.

1633,Outrageous-Reveal-21,1615771872,1,"I‚Äôve been getting to know this guy for a little while. We know each other through family friends. He initiated the conversation (via text) and we have been texting back and forth everyday. We have been having great conservations. He‚Äôs asked me if it‚Äôs an issue that he‚Äôs been in previous relationships and what my ideal family situation looks like. Then yesterday I received a text from him asking us both to identify areas of conflict because it‚Äôs better to know early on (even though there will always be stuff that will come up later, you can‚Äôt plan for this). So we talked about a few topics like communication, love language, what do we value in a relationship, where we would live, children, and then finances. 

My dad dislikes that this guy‚Äôs family is ‚Äúextremely frugal‚Äù (could be another term for cheap). 

My family is not filthy rich. My dad has had to work very hard for the lifestyle we have now. I am in no way materialistic but we have always lived comfortably. So I mentioned to this guy that my family and I always go out once a week to eat. It‚Äôs just something we have always done. And also that I would spend my own money (that I earn) once in a while on a nice treat (like jewelry, a pretty outfit/handbag, etc). I also explained that I shouldn‚Äôt have to give any explanations to my partner about how I spend my money. 

He replies with a short and direct comment saying: 

Yes, no one should need to justify themselves. But if one partner is saving for the college fund while the other is going to restaurants every week, there is an imbalance.

I felt a bit taken aback and upset after reading that. Am I overreacting? Again, this is something I‚Äôve always done. I didn‚Äôt think this would be a big deal. I didn‚Äôt reply to him. He is always talking about saving and investing because his family struggled growing up (and I understand that is the case for many people). But living a miserly lifestyle is not something I could deal with. And again, going out to dinner once a week wouldn‚Äôt stop me from helping with our kids‚Äô college funds. He made me upset with that comment.

I replied with a text that basically said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve started to like the person I‚Äôm getting to know.‚Äù

Then I went on to say briefly that I felt a bit upset by his text and how just because I grew up comfortable, it doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm an impulsive spender or thoughtless with money. My family instilled respect for money in me.

I pointed out the fact that saving and investing is very smart but why does it have to be an either-or situation? Why couldn‚Äôt we both contribute to the college fund and set aside money to enjoy ourselves. And I also mentioned a few examples: that we don‚Äôt have to go to the fanciest/most expensive places. We could even go every 2 weeks. Or what if I wanted to spend some money on decorative items for our home or buy a lovely dress and doll myself up for him? 

I also stated at some point that we should have a talk about ‚Äúmine, yours, and, our‚Äù money. 

This was on Friday and a little while later he replies saying: ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, I appreciate your honesty. I will reply to you when I have a chance this weekend.‚Äù

It‚Äôs 9 pm now on Sunday and I‚Äôve heard nothing. He‚Äôs always been so good about replying to me and keeping the conversation going. The truth is, I feel sad and upset that he‚Äôs gone silent. Pretty hurt too because things were going really well. 

A really close friend of mine said that because his family really struggle financially when he was growing up, something in my words may have triggered some kind of trauma (that was financially related) and he just shut down.

Last week I noticed my tingling in left arm, noticed my heart beating, etc. Went down the Google rabbit hole panicking for 3/4 hours until I called the paramedics, being painfully self aware of all the cliches while doing it. They came, put the on nodes on me, took my blood pressure, heart rate, etc. and told me I was having a panic attack. Also had some laughs because I'm 21. Since then, I've been able to tell myself that during the day, but at night I really seem to have developed some kind of new health anxiety thing. I just want to hear from some other people that struggle with this so I can calm down, as it's happening again right now.

My heart rate is going between 60/70 up to 100 sometimes 110 or 120 but I THINK that's when I just start to really panic. It really does move up and down a lot but obviously I can't look at what it's doing when I'm not thinking about it.

Anybody else have heart rates that spike up and down or struggle with health anxiety that could help me out here?

I have a guilty mind and have always been very self-blaming, which I have improved a lot in regards to friendships. Being left on read, awkwardness between friends or accidentally hurting people are my main triggers and result in obsessive thoughts as to whether they hate me, or if I've hurt them or if they're secretly mad at me, and my bad behaviour was to text and call profusely to figure out what's wrong. Tonight I lapsed into that after months of working on those behaviours. The context was that my two best friends have been flirting and kissed in my living room after I went to bed last night. I've been as unbiased as possible with them both, trying not to play Cupid but Friend A has a lot of issues which I felt I should warn Friend B about, despite it being very personal to them. However Friend B is fresh out of an abusive relationship and the issue was regarding how Friend A views/treats women. He is very regretful of his past and has a lot of guilt surrounding it, but because he's not out the woods yet in his recovery, I felt Friend B deserved the right to know. I feel completely terrible about telling her and I have been messaging them throughout the night trying to figure out if Friend A knows that I told Friend B.

1669,Quick-Athlete3754,1615765406,1,"Hi, this post is going to be a bit difficult to explain but I will try my best. Thank you if you are planning to read the entire thing and are going to try to understand! :)

Just to gather a bit of context, I'm going to talk about my ""story"", I guess.

It started in around January 2020. I was put in a school spelling bee. I'd been in one a year before that was pretty okay, but this time around things were so much worse. I had to sit in the very front row and was the second person to stand up to spell every round, which meant I always had a fair amount of attention directed towards me- which I did not appreciate at all. 

And then there's my mom. The relationship I have with her is confusing, especially for me. I hardly know how I feel about her, or how she feels about me. But she was coming to this event, and I was ready to break down in the front row for fear of her not being there in time (she was late but made it right as the spelling bee began). Looking back, I think I would have made a scene and ran away if she hadn't shown up, which would have made me realize my desperate need for validation, an unrealized symptom of my anxiety.

And so, maybe 30 minutes later, I managed to spell the final word and got 1st place. It was quiet for a moment, then people started to cheer. I suddenly felt immensely stressed and overwhelmed, standing there. The 2nd place girl was glaring at me so viciously I thought I would melt. The students began to stand back up, the crowds began to swarm in every direction, and I suddenly was terrified. I could hardly hold a calm smile for pictures.

For maybe 3 months after that traumatizing event I worried all the time. Looking at the stage where I had stood gave me shivers, and I worried that someday I would be forced back onto the front of the floor and be stared at by a couple hundred people once again. I was jumpy, never able to sit still, and scrutinized by my classmates. It calmed down mid-March, when we went into lockdown and virtual school due to the Coronavirus. I was grateful; I thought this would give me a chance to recover until this passed a few months later. But I was wrong.

Things escalated quickly. I was incredibly bored and uncaring towards myself. I began this habit where I never ate breakfast, and, because of the pandemic, my parents never made us lunch either, so all I had every day was a couple snacks and dinner. I didn't shower much either, or stay clean. I stayed inside all day, staring at my laptop screen, living in my own mistakes. This went on until October, which I am ashamed for, because in total that was 6-7 months in all of doing absolutely nothing. What a waste of life.

By late October I was determined to get my life back together, so I rose out of bed and began to get productive. But as I rose out of bed, so did my anxiety, like it'd been hibernating with me until I was ready to continue the process of stress. It almost makes the lockdown months sound like paradise.

As I started to get more involved with the world around me again, I noticed just how much I'd missed out on. When my birthday came around in December, I almost expected that I'd have a party again, like I did every year. But this year my friends had floated away from me, meeting new people and spending less and less time with me. My parents pointed out it could just be because of coronavirus, and that everyone was spending time alone. But I knew my friends were not alone. They just weren't with me. And not only that, my entire birthday day in general had just been weird.

And so, for the first time ever on my birthday, I cried. I went to my room, shut the door, turned on the fan, and sat in my closet, trying to be as quiet as possible. When I was finished, I left my closet and stood in the center of my room. I looked back at my closet. Why had I just sobbed so much? I have this issue where whenever I'm extremely mad, sad, or stressed, I forget a lot of what happens in those situations. So I was immediately confused by why I had been so upset a few moments ago.

My day had been pretty great, or at least my family would have said it had been. I'd had cake, presents, a movie night, and lots of attention. But everything was just so off. Of course, I was grateful for everything and was extra careful to be polite and happy-seeming the entire day as to not come off as spoiled or rude. Then I realized the issue.

I was too zoomed-in, as I like to call it. What I mean by zoomed-in is this:

Imagine that your room is shaped like a square, surrounded by darkness, like in your house in Stardew Valley or in any classic pixelated game (look it up in case you're unsure by what I mean). Imagine that you zoom in to you in your room, sitting in a corner, trying to paint over one little smudge of white paint on your grey wall. You can't find the right shade of grey, and you're starting to get extremely stressed and upset. You start to cry and start overthinking, wondering what people will do if they see the smudge on your wall (This is actually what I have done before, ngl).

Then you freeze. Your focus is zoomed in on that one little smudge in the corner of your room, something you wouldn't even notice if you stepped back and zoomed back out. You stand up and look at the smudge, then realize that the box under your bed is tall enough to block the smudge without looking weird. All you had to do was step back and look at the bigger picture, the way you would when painting a big mural.

I remind myself a lot about zooming in, but sometimes it still gets the better of me. Looking back on my birthday, I realize I was trying so hard to be genuinely happy and act like everything was normal, when, really, it wasn't. There was a pandemic going on and I had zero friends. I was unable to get back on track with the world. I'd slipped on the jungle gym and fell straight onto a bar, getting the air knocked out of me; and I was still sitting on the mulch, trying to get my breath back.

I was too anxious, and it'd ruined the one day I was supposed to be carefree.

In fact, when I mentioned the whole ""forgetting"" issue, my breakdowns, worries, and stresses all happened within this year yet I did not type about many of them because I can hardly believe and trust myself to.

From then until January 3rd that was how it was for me. A year later and I still wasn't doing any better. 2020 was BS. But I think just about everyone would agree with me on that.

So, January 3rd. I watched motivational videos, heaved myself out of bed, and started all over again.

Little did I know it was about to get terrible.

It started with the little things. It began with pushing aside doubtful feelings, then making self-depricating jokes, then having to use the restroom way more than usual. 

Then it began to rise. I started searching online for the slightest worry. I got a literal rabbit in hopes that he would cure my mental health. I would sit in front of my phone for an hour, procrastinating whether or not to send a simple text to a person I hadn't reached out to in a long time. I began shaking and stuttering when trying to talk to people I didn't know well, and I began having trust issues with my own family. I became more sensitive than I ever was.

All of this had built up over the past year. This was when I was acquainted with anxiety.

I found that I reasonated with a LOT of the symptoms, mentally and physically. I slowly learned more about anxiety through videos, articles, and more. While this was happening, though, one of my close friends (one I hadn't talked to in a while) lost all of her hair within a few days due to a terrible anxiety problem (Alopecia areata, I believe). She's currently taking a long break from school due to mental health.

My brother as well, only two years older than me, is talking to a therapist. He's struggled with school, friends, and life in general, and he's gotten a lot better. 

Then I realized something. This girl was doing the right thing, and so was my brother. They were taking care of themselves the right way. And I wanted to do that too. But my anxiety is much different than theirs, which leads me to the dilemma that I need some advice on.

=======

In summary of MY anxiety, it's been a lot of physical symptoms. (Cold hands and feet, itches/rashes, extra gassy and in need to use the restroom constantly, loud stomach, achy muscles...) But there's also the mental toll that it has had on me. Even little situations- such as the time I had to talk to my band teacher about my class project one-on-one where I sobbed for fifteen minutes, had to practice controlling my shaking shoulders and hands, and nearly puked all before it even happened- made me go out of control. I always thought it was a normal situation, and part of me still thinks so; but the other half of me knows this isn't healthy and that even if I don't have a professionally diagnosed anxiety disorder, that I still need to take care of myself.

Another thing that came with my anxiety was lack of self-love. Always worrying about the way I looked, constantly comparing myself to other people, and craving validation that couldn't be fulfilled was another issue that was bubbling to the surface recently. All in all, I really want to talk to someone about my issues, but there are two things that concern me.

First of all, I'm scared that I'm overreacting. I'm afraid people won't believe me because if they ask about my worst anxiety situations, I won't be able to tell them all because the details are fuzzier due to me having difficulty remembering stressful situations. I'm also just an overdramatic and hyper-sensitive person, so what if it's all in my head?

I'm also apprehensive because my situation isn't even HALF as drastic as others' are. I mean, my friend LOST HER HAIR. So is my situation really even valid enough that I need to seek help? I've seen posts where people have anxiety attacks and stuff, and I'm nowhere near that level. So what if, again, what if it's all in my head?

1671,OddHat3115,1615765184,1,"Anyone anxious as hell regarding loosening restrictions to allow ppl to socialise more? I literally froze, my heart was racing, my stomach dropped when I heard of potential loosening restrictions. This is for many reasons which I'm hopeful others can relate to  A) I kinda liked the not allowed to socialise with anyone outside your HH as the pressure was off to HAVE to hang out with ppl. B) Now, there is no excuse for not going to an outdoor gathering of up to 10 ppl..which skyrockets my anxiety. C) I do know limited ppl here but I like it that way but still get jealous, anxiety seeking groups of ppl, ppl with partners and they are plodding along like normal.(I'm the most laidback person ever on the outside and have no trouble getting along with ppl but with my health right now, I don't reallycare about that) D) the months are due to get warmer which means more ppl out than ever due to these new looser restrictions. I am very much an overcast, slightly rainy, night, sunset type person as I melt, get headaches, nausea, depressed when in the sun/heat. I'm also one of those ppl that looks absurd in shorts and baseball cap so I always wear usual clothes ( within reason in the sun lol)

I buck the trend by preferring colder, wintry, overcast, drizzly days..it's more cosy, I am a little more relaxed but still a mess lol. There is also less expectation to ""Have"" to be out with ppl. I'm a sit in in a cafe, watch the world go by with coffee and communicating with ppl over chat type guy..usually alone but I don't mind another person or 2 sometimes. 

Sorry for rant, but it is actually pretty crippling seeing ppl around happy when you don't want to hang out with ppl but when you dont, you suffer this crippling anxiety, depression, jealousy..and yes a lot has to do with feeling unworthy of the opposite sex.

I know how weird that sounds. Winning millions of dollars should sound appealing, not terrifying. But it is to me. I can't help but think of how much that would change our lives in a bad way. You'd never really have the feeling of accomplishment anymore. You'd have to keep your lifestyle a secret, because you'd always be afraid of people taking advantage of you. Money corrupts people, and I'm scared that would happen to me. That I'd start seeing other people as lesser. Also, as a young person, I feel like having tons of money would stunt my development so much. Anxiety has already done that to me. Knowing I would never actually have to try anything because I was rich would just worsen it. 

And I know that the chances of winning the lottery are so miniscule that it shouldn't even be on my radar. But does knowing that really stop anyone with anxiety from worrying?

Hi, so growing up my parents were fighting and arguing a lot. My sister was also not helpful at all and she has a very bad temper. At some point, the only thing they would talk about is her (teenage crisis+absent father).

My dad is a very calm person and every time my mom would be the one screaming and breaking things. I honestly understand her. It‚Äôs upsetting when someone wants to talk to you and you‚Äôre just on your phone not listening. She‚Äôs always tried discussing things with him but he never cared. 

Also my sister has always been suicidal which was exhausting for me. I don‚Äôt mean to be insensitive but I was like 11 I think and the last time she tried I was maybe 13? ( I remember I was the reason she wanted to do it one time because I didn‚Äôt make her food when she was feeling bad and then my mom blamed me for it). 
Every time she made an attempt I would have to take care of her and talk to her and reason her. And as I said she has a very bad temper and it really scares me sometimes. One time she told my mom to shut up or she will ‚Äúbreak this plate on her head‚Äù. My mom wouldn‚Äôt shut up and I would be very scared that my sister would hurt her. She did/does push my mom. 

She also used to hit me and slap me and choke me. She told me numerous times to kill myself and die and that she wishes I was never born. I honestly never thought about suicide and I never will since the only thing I want is for my life to be better. I, of course, do wish I didn‚Äôt exist in moments like that. 

I‚Äôm still in high school and so far my life has been very agitated and not in a good way. I always try to stop everyone from fighting since it does get physical sometimes. My dad left 2 years ago but he was never really present. And when he was they would ALWAYS fight. He doesn‚Äôt care about our education and tones of other things but it‚Äôs not the appropriate subreddit so yeah. 

To get to the point, I hate noises and sounds. Like when my mom is mad she would move things and it scares me and makes me very anxious. She would never hurt me of course but it makes my heart beat so fast and I feel uncomfortable. 

I like it when it‚Äôs calm and when my sister and mom fight, it exhausts me. I‚Äôve been doing this my whole life and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. It already ruined my childhood and it‚Äôs now ruining my life as a teenager. 

I hate it so much when people get mad and start talking and complaining and putting things too harshly  on a table for example. I just wanna live in peace and it‚Äôs a little hard to do it right now. 

It‚Äôs very tiring. Also when they fight I always think about what our neighbors think. It‚Äôs awkward for me to go out and face them all. Everything is making anxious now and I obviously don‚Äôt like it.

1700,WatcherOnTheWeb,1615756069,1,"Hi all

So the title pretty much says it all. I don't live in the US so this might seem a bit crazy, but some people here fail quite a few tests. I'm on the extreme end of the spectrum though... 

I thought I'd share some thoughts which constantly run through my mind in the days leading to the test and in the test itself. There are also meta-issues - sort of me getting anxious about a source of anxiety. 


I find myself thinking - ""I have failed so many tests, why the hell should this one be any different?"".  The obvious answer is experience. And then I have two ways to go about it: either I accept that logic, or I reject it. If I accept it, I get pressured because I think to myself ""highschoolers who are 4-6 years younger than you passed, and you have so much more experience than they. Failing now would be really pathetic"". If I reject it, then I get into this futile mood, which piles on the dread of another terrible experience.

I also think about how much money I've spent, and I'm not sure if I should downplay it as ""just cash"" so I'm less stressed or look at the money as ""literally months of my salary"" so I approach the test with gravitas.

I gave these examples so you get what I mean regarding ""meta anxieties"",  they occur similarly in a few other issues but I won't elaborate on them so as not make this post even longer. But I do want to vent, so in short:

- I'm so embarrassed to be so bad at something that almost everyone succeeds in at a much younger age. 

- I somehow connect my lack of having a license to ... everything bad in my life? And then passing my test is the key to all happiness which makes the test even more scary. This is obviously ridiculous, but what can I do? My screwed up psyche just works that way.


And of course, there's the meta issue of meta issues. All the above sources of panic and anxiety, and their meta instances, transform into the mother of all shit. Which is the thought which is always racing through my mind - ""how should I handle all these scary stuff so that I maximize my odds of passing? Am I doing it wrong?"". This convoluted inner dialogue is constant, and I'm pretty sure it makes it even harder to focus on just driving. And then I fail again.

I'm pretty hopeless right now, tbh. I have spent thousands of dollars on this and if I don't get it done within the next month, I'll probably be unable to do so for the next 5 years or so (long story). So yeah, I'm despondent.

Lately this changed, when I have to meet my boyfriend‚Äôs friends or go to the grocery store or at my friends place I feel like I‚Äôm dying and that I find myself locked away from everyone again, I am becoming very frustrated because even though there is a pandemic and mostly I‚Äôm home in my comfort zone, there are times where it would be nice to socialize when I get the chance and be there for the people who are there for me too, but I can‚Äôt, because the moment I go out and get in a room with them I start having panic attacks and can‚Äôt move, think, talk or anything.  I feel this is causing me depression slowly, there are many other things going on in my life that are hard to manage and would be nice to get away from these problems, but I can‚Äôt since I get very sick if I leave... 
I‚Äôm stuck in this vicious cycle of wanting to get out but can‚Äôt.

I've been doing a lot of thinking and I'm having major anxiety with the whole thought of it all. I've had many ups and downs throughout middle school that have caused a large variety of worries. For example, I had an infatuation incident with a boy over a year ago and I lost/dropped a whole friend group. I managed to keep my best friend of 11 years and have a few acquaintances within school that I enjoy spending my time with. Quarantine and corona has really helped with relieving some of this social stress, but I've also gained some social anxiety for meeting new people. Meanwhile, I've gotten no closure whatsoever from the boy and I've been struggling with picking up my life and moving on.

I've recently come to the realization that not only your classes in high school matter, but so do extracurriculars. I haven't had a sport since elementary school, which I dropped after playing it for a year and I highly regret it. Lots of thoughts about not being athletic enough or having the full capability of being able to pick up something have been on my mind. For me, I don't feel like I do things anymore for the pure enjoyment of it, but more for the ability to be able to say you're productive and have a life. There's been a few ideas of what I could do, but it's never felt enough. Plus, constantly comparing my life to other people's lives isn't the most beneficial way of dealing with all of this.

1723,beaniebaby193,1615749504,1,"I will try to lay out this mess of a 'relationship' as succinctly as possible! Last year I (25f) met this guy (37m) and we embarked on a 3 month long intense and passionate relationship, which involved regular relationship things like lunches, movies, sleepovers, and various outings, but mostly revolved around sex. About a month in I started getting hit with some pretty heavy insults/criticisms, which I will outline below. Note that at first he was great to me and treated me well, and then suddenly started out with these things:

1. One morning after sleeping over, he was making coffee and I hugged him from behind. He immediately snapped at me and told me I was 'so needy and emotional' and compared me to his dog. I totally understand that people may not like to be touched first thing in the morning, but I feel like a regular form of communication would have been warranted. 
2. Towards the end, he compared me to Gatorade flavors that he changes according to his mood. 
3. One time when we were going hiking, he suddenly told me that my 'anxiety' was pissing him off and that I have horrible vibes and he had to take me home and leave. I didn't particularly feel anxious, I just still got nervous sometimes around him because I liked him so much. He then texted me days later saying he was sorry, that he was tired and cranky. 
4. The last time we saw each other I was poking fun at him for not having coasters (mind you he 'jokes' with me ALL THE TIME, almost always insulting me), and he snapped and asked me how many times he needs to 'bash my head in' for me to understand that I can't do that to him. He then sped in his car at 4am to take me home. Yes, I know how ridiculous this sounds.

After this last incident I was completely taken aback and destroyed. I never texted him, he never texted me. Fast forward five months later, I get a text from him saying he's sorry, and that he's dealing with anxiety that sometimes manifests itself negatively in a relationship. He is currently swearing up and down that he will be good to me and that he just went through a really hard time, and that maybe I can help him. 

Can anyone relate to what HE is going through? I absolutely adored this man and I literally have chest pains knowing that he's hurting like this. At the same time, he destroyed my self esteem and mood for months and I was devastated when he didn't reach out to me earlier. I don't know if giving him a second chance will set me up for abuse, or if I should have more empathy for his anxiety. He had a really rough childhood and is now a very successful doctor. I think he has a very fragile ego and does not know how to generally deal with negative emotions.",Anxiety,Anxiety manifesting itself negatively in a relationship?,2021-03-15 06:18:24

Every Sunday, and most weeknights, I just have this horrible gut feeling about starting the next day at work.

For context, I like my job for the most part. My coworkers are nice, and I work with some really smart, funny people. I feel like I'm always learning and am challenged. The downsides are: 1) one person I work with, who is sort of my supervisor, is kind of tough to deal with (headstrong, kind of argumentative, and can be belittling without realizing it). 2) I feel like I'm regressing and not performing as well as I used to, and that's really taken a toll on my confidence and subsequent ability to get work done and do it well. I already struggle with imposter syndrome and in the last few months it's just gotten really bad. 

Every Sunday, and every night, I just have this horrible feeling about tomorrow. Worrying if I'm going to mess up, worrying about what my coworkers think of me...and then I just start to spiral into thoughts like ""I'm going to get fired, I don't know when but it's going to happen"", ""everyone thinks you're such an amateur"", ""no one likes you, you don't have anything to contribute"", ""you're just a joke to your whole team."" It's a combination of feeling very specific, horrible things about the immediate future AND a heavy, gut feeling that something bad will happen in the more distant future.

I cut everybody off, got a new phone number and e-mail address so that nobody could contact me with abuse and hate, but now I feel intimidated and worry about what this person is saying about me, that I am not being represented fairly (I could tell everyone I know about what a horrible person they are with plenty of good examples but I don't want to do that because I think it is immature and just hateful)

I‚Äôm posting because I‚Äôm in dire need of some reassurance and could use some support. I have severe health anxiety and up until last Thursday (other than the occasional anxiety attack), I was managing okay with no meds etc... On Thursday at 3am I woke up with a little bit of arm numbness. Most people would‚Äôve attributed it to sleeping incorrectly but I looked up the symptoms of stroke, which set off the ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of weekend events. I immediately panicked, thinking I was taking a stroke and my heart started pounding out of my chest, my legs were shaking so badly it looked like I was having a seizure, and then I got so nauseous I made myself throw up. All of this lasted around 45 minutes-hour before I finally fell back to sleep. I woke up Friday morning feeling off due to the previous nights events and started hyper fixating on the ark numbness which had not totally subsided. I then became worried about MS all day and could not eat, or concentrate on anything. Around 4pm I took a bath and looked down at my toes, convincing myself they looked purple due to lack of oxygen, because you know..at this point why not? And took another anxiety attack right there in the tub. I laid down and could not stop shaking and making myself throw up. From that point on, all night on Friday, I was up EVERY TWO HOURS forcing myself to gag from the extreme anxiety. At one point, I had myself convinced it was COVID and panicked even more. My doctor called me in a script for Kolonipin to help immediately, I took it and the edge came right off but I‚Äôm trying to avoid taking them unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. He‚Äôs recommending therapy and I have to wait for the call. 

Anyway, since then, I have felt physically off with periods of ‚Äúokayness,‚Äù followed by periods of extreme edginess and fatigue, which has me convinced I have cancer, although I was physically perfect until last weekend.

I could write for hours but ill try and make this as straight to the point as possible.

I have always struggled with a weird sexual appetite likely from being exposed to pornography at an early age coupled with borderline personality disorder I have.

anyway so I was married and met up with a prostitute. I know how crazy this is but it was almost like I was compelled or at least thats how it felt. I tried to take my life after and ended up confined to the hospital

obviously my wife divorced me but that wasn't all. I was removed from my religious organization which is my life. I lost all my friends being unable to speak with them. I know this is my fault but the anxiety has been unbearable. I have Noone to reach out to.

i got shingles from all my anxiety. I'm trying to change my life and be allowed back into the religion but I messed up again by getting involved with a prostitute. I can't think clearly I have no hope. I feel the only way out of this mess I caused Is taking my life.

I know it's normal for people to act a bit differently opposed to family and friends, but both feel like only a small part of me. I've always been a shy girl, and as I got older my anxiety worsened. I was homeschooled for two years because of my recurrent panic attacks and the bullying, and I developed agoraphobia when I didn't leave the house properly for two years (thanks to covid and having to stay back inside, a bit of it's coming back again). Now I'm in college, because I became desperate to interact with people again, but I don't think I express myself well at all. I never have, but it's only now bothering me.

I made quite a few friends (which was a real struggle for me at my previous schools) and I like them - but for me, I don't feel like our friendships are truly genuine. I'm a reserved person anyway, I don't open up about secrets and personal stuff until much later, but even the normal part of me that I shouldn't be hiding is not coming out. My humor or my imagination for example, on the outside I look like a boring, dull, too-serious type of person. But on the internet, my inside, I find it much easier to talk and express myself there. I just want to know how to express myself in real life. I feel like no one knows me. I relate to a lot of people, but only in secret because I'm too damn awkward to speak out and have a relatable conversation. It feels like people have me covered just by the first impression.

I know it's partly my fault, I don't say anything, of course people are gonna think I'm just a loner or something. If you were one of my online friends and we met in real life, you would never guess it's me. I appear more funny and happy online (apart from this here rant), whereas I look so boring and miserable irl. I feel so f\*cking lonely, and I don't know how to help it. My parents keep stalling in taking me to the doctor for anxiety, they have done for years. I won't go to the doctor alone, and I just want to be myself. I understand the shy trait is a part of me anyway, but it's eating up \*all\* of me. I thought interacting with people will make the loneliness go away, but I feel even more isolated now. 

There were the occasional people who stood out to me. They have this certain look on their face when we see each other, the look where I think they know who I am, and they like it. Those type of people give me a temporary surge of confidence, but somehow, in the end, I nearly always blow it. I don't know what I do, or maybe I wasn't doing \*enough\* of something, but we drift apart eventually and almost never become proper friends. I think that's what kills me the most, when I thought I found someone who understood me, but they leave.

I find it incredibly difficult to simply discuss my interests with someone from the fear of being judged. I never talk about my troubles in case I get the opposite of support, shattering my trust. No one knows I'm actually quite stubborn, that I can be funny, that I also have struggles at home, that I'm secretly very emotional. I feel like a blank canvas when I'm around people. I want them to know the real me, because when I'm not the third wheel, I'm just the friend who nods along.

While I have always had a bit of social anxiety, I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder. For about three weeks now, I've been having a bit of a medical situation that has caused weakness and numbness in my left arm and leg for three weeks now. Tests are coming back negative so my doctors are thinking that it is anxiety. 

In the beginning, it correlated with fatigue after physical activity until I started waking up with foot drop, funny bone sensations, and numbness - then I couldn't pick up so much as a mug with my left arm (after some steroids I can now pick up a \~book\~ with extended concentration).

I went to the ER twice for this they did a couple of MRIs and a head CT, all came back clean (no indications of a stroke). My neurologist originally did not want to run a spinal and head MRI because he thought I was just experiencing anxiety. Waiting for head and spine MRI results, but it's been two weeks so I am going with ""no news is good news."" 

Has anxiety physically manifested for anyone else like this? I am not looking for a diagnosis, but I would appreciate some advice if this in any way resembles what someone else may have experienced. While I am sure that anxiety could cause these symptoms, it seems weird to me that would persist for so long even after some anxiety medication I received in the ER. Also, it gets worse with physical activity rather than stress.

Throughout my entire life, up to being 15 years old, I had no form of anxiety whatsoever. Life was breezy. 
I simply, calmly went to sleep on a Sunday night in 2009 dreaming of sawing wood noises coming from the back garden. I remember looking out of my window to see what was going on but saw nothing.

When I woke up my life had changed forever. Suddenly I was on edge, I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything (literally) 
My mind was fighting with me and for 6 solid months, I had to try everything to stop it from fixating and obsessing on every, minor thing which it was constantly searching for answers for. 

Eventually I took control, but ever since then I‚Äôve had a low level, ‚Äòrumbling‚Äô anxiety that latches onto the occasional issue with i then have to quickly ease before calming down.

I‚Äôm a 22 (F) and have been with my boyfriend (23) for over 3 years now. We met when we were in college. We were friends first but always had a flirtationship and then fell in love. He‚Äôs literally the best boyfriend and my best friend. I suffer from a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and add. The last year has been really rough for me and he‚Äôs always been by my side through it all. We‚Äôve always been serious in our relationship and talked about getting engaged in the near future and spending the rest of our lives together. We recently moved in together after college and I‚Äôve been having some conflicted thoughts in the relationship.

The thing is I love him so much but we also differ in many ways. He‚Äôs very religious, I‚Äôm not. He loves staying in, I love going out. He‚Äôs a huge planner, I‚Äôm totally spontaneous. I‚Äôm never sure of myself and what I want because I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my mental issues or just doubts in a relationship but I always questions everything...Cities I always wanted to live in, i move  there and am not happy...jobs I initially loved...tire me out after a while. I feel the same way about this relationship, I love him and can‚Äôt imagine my life without him. But  the what if‚Äôs eat me up, what if there‚Äôs someone out there I‚Äôm more compatible with, what if we‚Äôre too young to think of getting engaged in the next year, what if  our differences pose problems down the line. I really don‚Äôt want to end this relationship, I feel like it would destroy me emotionally but I‚Äôm never happy with anything in my life sometimes.

The other thing is the sex. I‚Äôve only ever had sex with my partner but I‚Äôve had other sexual experiences with a few people in the past. I enjoy kissing or making out but when it comes to other sexual acts or sex, I‚Äôve never enjoyed it. I‚Äôve told my partner this and he‚Äôs very understanding and willing to find a solution and work on it together but sometimes I wonder if there‚Äôs someone out there who I may actually enjoy sex with or if I‚Äôm just a non-sexual person.

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice or to see if there are others who felt conflicted like this in their relationships in the past. Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è",Anxiety,Have you guys ever felt this way in your relationships?,2021-03-15 01:50:51

The problem is that I have never - not even from day one - felt comfortable or heard by him. Each conversation leaves me feeling less understood and more frustrated than before. I want to reach out for a second opinion, hopefully from someone who actually gives me the time of day, but that‚Äôs when the self-doubt creeps in. 
I begin to worry that the problem is me. That somehow I‚Äôm the reason this isn‚Äôt working out. That my expectations are too high or unrealistic, and even if I went for a second opinion, the problems would persist.
And then I‚Äôm paralyzed.
Even when I remind myself that communication is something I excel at, that it‚Äôs my psychiatrist‚Äôs job to understand me (not my job to make myself simpler for him to understand), and that I have every right to seek another‚Äôs assistance if my current practitioner is not providing the support I need, the spiral of fears and invasive thoughts persists. 
The ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄùI should‚Äôs‚Äù have even made me question whether my problems are real, or just a form of attention seeking.

I began to believe it was because I was ugly or something was wrong with my brain because nobody accepted me.
Over the years my anxiety built up, I was chewing my nails, picking my hair, crying secretly all the time and I developed social anxiety. I desired acceptance so much and I still do. 
There was point where I began to improve academically and I began to feel confident, even if nobody would accept me I found success for myself. I wanted to do something great.

In the meantime I'm staying with my parents because we weren't in our city when the accident happened. We don't have a fantastic relationship right now, and it's stressful to be here alone without the emotional support of my fianc√©.

I only smoked once and didn‚Äôt like it up until junior year when weed actually became fun and enjoyable (sometimes). I smoked pretty heavily (once or twice a day) for some months and would go without for a while if I smoked too much and panicked. Fast forward to last summer, i had just lost my friend to a fentanyl overdose (we were close in high school but grew apart when I entered college) and finals week was just about to start and to top it off we were in the midst of the pandemic.

I‚Äôm self destructive.

I- 

Don‚Äôt know what it is but I love to hurt the feelings of both the people I love and myself. I look at how great my current relationship is. How supportive my SO is despite never having had anxiety or depression or ocd before. 

But yet.

I still think obsessively about my ex. I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm still in love with her. Every. Single. Day. Since I ghosted her. I think about her. A self-inflicted torture that I have no one but myself to blame for. She was amazing. She was sweet, understanding, fucking STUNNING looks, a heart of GOLD.

But my immatureness told me there were plenty of fish in the sea. And there are. My current SO fits the same description and in some ways even better. Yet the burning feeling remains ‚Äî I‚Äôm missing my better half.

I‚Äôve tried Alcohol, self-medicating with Weed, prescribed SSRIs, prescribed SNRIs, and prescribed Benzos (in that order, but not at the same time obviously) and it all fails. Have you ever seen eternal sunshine of the spotless mind? Joel and Clementine. That was my ex and I. Watching that movie for the first time months after we had broken up while in bed with a hook up, my heart shattered. I held back rivers of tears that were ready to rush out like blood rushing out of a deep, open wound. After that, I listened to our favorite songs, watched our favorite movies, trying to understand that death isn‚Äôt the opposite of Life but that the opposite of death is birth. And that this old flame that was reaching the end of its wick, may be born into something completely new ‚Äî I still don‚Äôt get it. Am I a hopeless romantic? Or a human who‚Äôs constantly making mistakes? 

Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make me feel fake when I smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back hanging with my late night fools
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

I took the cookie, and now I‚Äôm doing the time. Sentenced to an eternity without my better half, whom is now in the arms of a man I greatly dislike due to completely other reasons (I was once friends with him). Even if things were to end between them, she would probably never trust me again or things would never be the same either. 

It‚Äôs a fucked up world we live in. And the worst part, I fucked it up.

I guess I need support and advice on the following:

Should I text the ex and at least clear my consciousness with an apology? Or should I just let her be and let the anguish and hurt I put her through be the end of it as she now seems happy?

Do I end things with my current SO because I‚Äôm still in love with a ghost from my past, but also having eyes for others? Why does the human in me make it so hard to fall for someone and not have eyes for anyone else?

Am I a bad person or just a human who‚Äôs made mistakes?

I know life is beautiful and a gift, but it‚Äôs been so hard to enjoy ever since my loss. It‚Äôs like I lost my identity in a way. But how do I recover it? How do I feel whole again so I can love selflessly in a relationship again? I‚Äôve been better at loving others such as strangers selflessly, but what about people I‚Äôm close to, my SO, etc?

Maybe I‚Äôm just lost and confused. Young and immature. Maybe these trials and tribulations have been going on to change my soul into a better form or higher frequency. Maybe God‚Äôs got me after all. Maybe everything works out the way it is destined to. Maybe some are destined for love and some are not. Maybe I don‚Äôt know all the answers.

But, one of the characters is afraid to drive on the highway (which many of us suffer from driving anxiety). At one point, he is forced to drive, and his older brother is telling him to merge onto the busy highway. 

The younger brother exclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready!‚Äù, to which the older brother notes: ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never be ready. Merge!!‚Äù

1. Who am I ? Male : Indian : 25 : Mechanical Engineer : Introvert :  Working full time at a natural resource company : looking forward to loose weight &amp; start prep for future education. 

2. History:  
Age 11 : Got bullied first time : got beaten up and tossed around by seniors who broke my lunch box - stole my lunch. This continued for 2 months. Almost alternate day. Presently has no impact on me. 

Age 18 : Parents came to know about my school crush and in the name of parenting they grounded me for an year with no tv no music no mobile no movies no hang outs no nothing. Impact : Least cool/publicly seen person of school : severed all friendships : currently I have none from that group now : often get dreams of school as going to school was my entertainment as well. 

First two years of college: was worst. Failed a subject twice - Eng Math because the professor was racist against by caste &amp; family name. Impact : the worst nightmare I have had : termination from college : an extra year : reduced self esteem : exclusion from batch activities : being butt of jokes and not being taken seriously by anyone : till date I am traumatized by it - have certain aversion and under confidence when it comes to math now. I get dreams of fucking up that exam till date over and again. 

Next two year : Come back time. Met school counsellor after suicide attempt over second termination. She turned my life around.  I passed even tougher subjects and advanced subjects. In three subjects I was in top 10 of my class of 95. 
Ultimate got my job also. All in all a good finish to a bad chapter. 

Now, in working life, I find myself in the same selfish cut troat race again. The race leads to another race. Of higher education in a college where same stuff happens. Being in india, the completion is known to be cut throat af. 

My direct issues : 

1. Silent : fear of everything. Fear of boss asking me something I don't know. Fear of what happens tommorow. Fear of other people backstabbing me. Fear of anything. Always there. In head. 

2. Constant Comparison/Jealousy : Though this helped me get back on track in college : but now I see this fucking never ends. All life is comparison. I compare myself to always to everyone. I am constantly troubled seeing other people excel. I am troubled seeing other people enjoy life / chill. I am troubled seeing other people study with clarity and commitmentbecause I already took one extra year so I am elder to most of my peers. 

3. Anxiety &amp; Underconfidence : even in fields I know I am better - I won't speak up/ I find idiots who know less than me walk around thumping chests and bragging about knowledge. 

4. Constantly feeling behind in life : that I don't chill / live. That I wasted more time in life than others. That at my age certain things must be done...etc.

Im 30, I avoid my family but at the same time I dont hate them. Theres a lot in my past they have done which hurt me but I was able to forgive. I just dont enjoy the feeling of anxiety when Im around them.

For example I get it around my older brother the worst. He used to beat the soul out of me as a kid for no reason other than to make my life miserable. Tortured me. Whipped me with wires, made me do pushups while he would stand on my back, tie me up and kick soccer balls at me so hard and said if i flinch ill get beat up, once made me strip naked and locked me out the house.

We were cool with each other when we got older but the feeling of anxiety is wired into my brain. Whenever im around him i get so much anxiety, i fidget around a lot, my mind races.

I HATE that thatd a part of me because of what other people did to me.

Its also made me have no personality because of this deep engrained fear i had since i was a little kid of expressing myself because of how much i was afraid of any type of confrontation that my safety mechanism was to just be very quiet, very reserved, blend in the background so no ones sees me or so people just dont interact with me because i had such a big fear of people.

On Monday (March 15, 2021) I will be going in to get surgery on my knee to replace a ligament. I'm fine with the surgery. My mom has a medical background and I did some training as a CNA, so I'm not squeamish when it comes to invasive medical procedures.

It's the anesthesia. I am so. effing. scared.

Maybe scared isn't the word - I'm extremely anxious and nervous. I've never been put under anesthesia before and the thought of going under and possibly never waking up is really heavy on my mind. I know statistically that i'm more likely to get in a car crash on the way to the hospital or get crushed beneath a vending machine than to die whilst under. But it's not impossible, and nobody thinks that they'll be that rare statistic until it happens. 

Plus, I've had a pretty messed up history with drug use. I'm (thankfully) a few years clean now, but the thought of a chemically-induced altered state is bringing up a lot of old anxieties, triggers, and flashbacks. I just don't want to be in that scary place again, you know.

I've talked to my therapist, doctors, and nurses. And I will also make my concerns known on the day of the surgery. But for now I'm just a nervous wreck. I'm getting more anxious and upset by the hour to the point where I'm shaking and just close to tears. I keep envisioning the moments right before I go under, and wondering if it'll be my last. Or wondering if coming out groggy will trigger memories of being stuck in 'bad highs.'

Then, because of my horrible first couple of driving experiences, I wasn't prepared for my behind-the-wheel lessons.

This caused me to have extreme panic attacks whenever my lessons days were. 

This was the start of 2020, when my mental health deteriorated. My parents finally realized that I needed serious help and started going easier on me regarding driving, school, and work. Over the year I learned to forgive and accept myself for who I am, and what I struggle with.

1871,Eddakeg,1615692400,1,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôd like to start off by simply sharing my experience with anxiety, the taboo of mental health in a highly conservative upbringing, and the complete 180 I‚Äôve made in the last year or so. 

At its‚Äô worst, anxiety has taken me through the entire gambit of symptoms, severe hypochondria, overthinking, rapid thoughts, insomnia, ruining family vacations, and cancelling travel due to fear of flying just to name a few ways my diagnosed general anxiety disorder has affected my livelihood. My anxiety took a deep dive for the worst a little over a year ago when it began to debilitate me every second of my life, causing severe impacts on my ability to work and perform every day functions. Not that I became suicidal, but there was a perceived sense of relief in the idea of not having to deal with my condition again. 

I‚Äôm here to help anyone in anyway I can get on their feet through this journey. For a little over year now, through finally getting on meds and having weekly sessions with a therapist, I feel like I‚Äôve regained my footing. By no means are the anxious tendencies gone, but with the help of meds and therapy I‚Äôm able to find that much needed sense of reason that we all lack when we are in a downward spiral of negative thoughts, fear, and anxiety. I grew up in a conservative home, where mental disorders or diseases were to be prayed away or referred to as something we should ‚Äújust snap out of.‚Äù In reflecting, I‚Äôve been anxious person since as far back as I can remember- having irrational fears since as far back as day care. 

I‚Äôm now a functioning, white collar professional and in just the span of a year or so, I‚Äôve been able to regain control and approach myself with more self love. Feel free to reach out to me for any advice, believe me when I say that I‚Äôve been through it all! All the symptoms, all of the thought patterns, the trips to the ER because I was sure I was dying, depersonalization and disassociation, depressive states about my anxiety, ANXIETY about my ANXIETY.

1873,cascobum27,1615692294,1,"My boyfriend is so honest, to the point that sometimes I'm just like ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è shut uppp i did not need to know that. But I DO also appreciate that he is honest ...my anxious neurotic brain needs to know all the details of things most of the time. But when he tells me I lose my mind sometimes.

This usually relates to things about sex, ex's and feelings. If I ask him a question about if he used to do xyz with an ex he will answer with too much detail and it sends my anxiety through the roof and I can't get the image out of my head. 
The other day I asked if he ever felt the urge to be with other women while he's been with me. He said ""maybe the occasional urge but never when I'm with you"" . I know what he means..he literally means that a couple times over the years he has mentally undressed someone but would never act on it. He later clarified all that.

But problem now us my brain latches on to the 'urge'. Like who was it,  why them, am I better looking? And it sends me spiralling. 

More recently we've had some big conversations about love and how we feel. And he admitted he feels unsure sometimes. The word 'unsure' was seared into my brain and I have not been able to forget it. And he can't understand why I get so hung up on silly words, as if he didn't say anything so bad. What he meant was 'when we have fights all the time it makes me wonder if this is what its supposed to be like but it's just a fleeting thought, I'm not going anywhere and I do love you'

Another example last night at dinner we talked about when he was younger him and his mates went to a massage parlour. He told me about it and I was curious asking lots of questions coz I was genuinely curious about how it all works and felt fine about it. But the second he said she climbed on top of him and basically nearly had sex with him (as in rubbing herself against his dick) and he fingered her. I nearly threw up and started yelling at him and called him disgusting.  I had to leave the table and go have a cry in the toilets. I came back and he's like ""it was over 10 years ago and you asked me"". 

Arghh its a blessing and a curse. Sometimes I wish he was just one of those ""yes dear, no dear"" guys but at same time hate the idea of someone I love hiding things from me and my curious nature always has to know the ins and outs of everything. But he has no filter.

1877,swaliepapa,1615691284,1,"My whole life, I've seen people complain about anxiety, one way or another. Mainly through social media, but also back In highschool. the way people portrayed themselves around this disorder made it seem like a joke in my eyes. It's like, they made it seem like every little problem that they had, they just blamed it on ""their anxiety"". how: ""omg this is giving me anxiety"", ""my anxiety is sky-rocketing because of this little insignificant thing, I cannot cope with it."" it all just seemed like a fat blatant excuse to not cope and deal with one's problems. Not really trying to offend anyone of course, but back then, It's not that I looked down on such people, but more like, it seemed simple to overcome. Just don't be anxious. I am sorry if I sound insensitive, it truly isn't or wasn't my intention. the whole idea of anxiety seemed stupid to me. boy was I wrong. 

I smoke a lot of pot usually. I am in college, and because of my studies, I have to quit pot in order to be able to achieve higher marks, which is fine. But this week, I don't know what happened to me. I was cornered in between a conjunction of problems that made me literally snap. between family problems, meeting deadlines that I wasn't prepared for, being behind on some classes, and quitting weed and nicotine, made me experience out of nowhere a huge anxiety attack when i got back from the gym 4 days ago (took pre workout as well, haven't been drinking caffeine in months), showcased more like a DP/DR episode (derealization). it was terrifying. thank god the feelings have subsided, but I still feel off. to be honest, I am still scared that I will go insane. 

when I sit down to do my work, or I am just minding my own business, is like this wave of anxiety just hits me randomly. it's hard to explain. No matter how much I tell myself that I still have time to catch up. I still have time to fix my mistakes. there's still f\*cking time to do me justice. it does nothing. it's like it's ingrained subconsciously in my mind, like I cannot trick myself out of it till I show results to myself. it's insane!

I am honestly annoyed and pissed the f\*ck off that I am going through this. I actually meditate daily and consider myself decently good at it, work out on a daily basis as well. I should be immune to this sort of disorder right?? WRONG! 

This just gives to show how fragile the human mind is. how, when put in real stress full situations (i Know what I listed is insignificant as to what many people go through, my many blessings go out to the many sufferers) your mind can just literally fold when it doesn't have a crutch to lean on. 

Lesson learned, my hat goes off. Karma is a b\*tch, f\*cks u over sooner or later, But fair. I just hope I can feel normal again. I literally feel pressure in my head, I feel scared, alone, and so emotional these days. I feel like crying as I am typing this. and although I know that everything will be okay in the end, it just aggravates me when I look around and still feel so desensitized with reality at times. it's gotten a lot better though (been like 3 days), but I am just stuck in a place where I don't know what's normal anymore. whether it's all in my head, or whether I f\*cked up something. I guess i just need some people to tell whats up. Ive been on the DP/DR community on reddit, but that sh\*ts so depressing to read, and i am getting no help honestly over there.",Anxiety,a public apology to all the ones who suffer from anxiety disorders.,2021-03-14 14:08:04

1905,GiulioR3,1615682435,2,"There was a traumatic episode in my life that never actually remembered until about three weeks ago, when my parents reminded me of it.

It was a memory of when I was 8 years old:
I was in school and at some point during a class I really needed to pee and we had to ask for the teacher's permission to go to the bathroom, so I did, and my teacher did not allow me to go so I peed my pants because I couldn't contain myself anymore.

After my parents pointing this event to me I started remembering a couple of like fotograms of it and now I am anxious about peeing my pants at university, 12 years later.

For context I should add that I remember dozens of traumatic events and I have no memory before 8 yo except for 2 very blurred traumas.

My question is: is it possible that I buried this memory to protect myself from the trauma?

And also, why remembering such a old memory brought back anxiety with it? Is it just imagining it? And if it is why don't I get anxiety by empathizing with others?",Anxiety,My memory problems and anxiety,2021-03-14 11:40:35

1907,crushedhopeful,1615681599,2,"Just recently turned 33 and over the last year or so I've become more acutely aware of how much I struggle with anxiety and I'm so sick of it. I want to get better.

**This is a long/venting post, so apologies in advance. I did try to highlight different things I'm struggling with for ease of reading.**

**Lately I've been wondering if I've ever _not_ struggled with anxiety**. I seriously wonder if I even know what ""normal"" is or what it's like to not be anxious, you know? I imagine it like this burden over me that so many other people have, but that so many more don't have. 

But I can't remember if I've ever known anything different. Maybe in high school or earlier? Not sure. I wonder if it's possible to identify a point at which I developed an issue with it. The last couple of years have been particularly tough and the last few weeks have pushed me to seek professional help. 

**Last year my younger brother committed suicide**. I _think_ I grieved properly, but sometimes I'm suspicious that there's some deeper, subconscious brokenness that is fueling my anxiety. My parents have struggled a lot with it, understandably, but the depth of their struggle causes me anxiety. I don't know how to help them and I don't know that they can hear what I'm saying.

In some ways I resent my upbringing and wonder if _that's_ the main reason I am the way that I am. I've been married almost ten years and my wife's parents put my parents into stark contrast when it comes to being involved in their children's lives and just... being parents. That's the reason I wonder if I just never learned or was never prepared for adulthood. 

**I appreciate my parents, but honestly I have no idea how to communicate with them and they seem so detached at this point**. I look back on my life and feel angry that they didn't prepare me better or teach me things that my wife's parents try to teach their children. I wish my upbringing had been more like hers. To my knowledge none of her siblings struggle with anxiety or depression. My wife definitely doesn't.

**And I also wish she hadn't married me because I feel so broken**. I think ""wow, she would be so much better off if she hadn't married me!"" And we have two children now and are expecting our third. That has been anxiety-inducing, too. Yet another event that I wonder whether or not has pushed me to this place is the brith of our first child. It was a long labor that ended in a c-section. I don't know that I'm ""traumatized"" from it, but it was a rough experience. 

**Life leading up to that child's birth was the first time that I can remember really feeling I was having anxiety attacks or as close to panic attacks as I've ever come**. I would be at work just doing something routine and suddenly my heart would be racing and I would get chills and just totally zone out with anxiety about my wife or unborn child or both possibly dying in childbirth. 

Fast forward and we've moved up and down the east coast, had another child and bought our first home. Plenty of opportunity for crushing anxiety there, right? 

**And now I'm in flux with my job situation**. For almost the past two years my job has been mind-numbingly boring. Less than a year with my current company and my boss and his VP got fired. In one day our team went from a nice, steady velocity of work to literally being told ""stop what you're doing"". 

From then on it was just piecemeal projects here and there and more days than not I've had nothing to do. I've desperately tried to find another job and had offers that were either way below what I currently make, changed from direct-hire to contact, or gotten to final round interviews and had thing halt because of COVID. 

Ironically, the last several weeks I've had a ton of work to do, gotten a new, externally hired manager and received two job offers. I've already passed on one because of fear/anxiety about negative employee reviews and it looks like I have to pass on the second because they can't even match what I'm making now. 

**Add to that a couple of tooth fillings I need to have done**. The fillings have produced **some of the worst anxiety I've ever experienced**. I don't think I've ever gotten to the point where I've nearly broken out in a sweat during an anxiety attack. The dentist has never been a fear of mine, but passing out definitely has. I've passed out giving blood, having blood drawn, getting a tattoo, etc. 

I've already had 5 fillings over the past three years, so the past few weeks I've been chronically worried about losing my teeth to the point that I feel like my overall health is in jeopardy. 

I just need help. I just need hope. Does this last forever? Will I just be crushed by life for the rest of life? :(

Thanks for reading...

I noticed recently that my situational depression (who doesn't have that nowadays?) lifted significantly in a way that continued all day after a few days taking this stuff every night: Anxious thoughts are quieter, sensory details more present and intense (not in a trippy way, just in a not depressed way), mood just overall improved and sleep WAY better. It was recommended to me by a nutritionist for anxiety, but I had no idea it had this kind of effect on serotonin until I researched it. Has anyone else tried this supplement and had success with it? Any nasty side effects I should know about (my nutritionist didn't mention any and the Internet seems generally uninformed, but I take anecdotal evidence from real people more seriously)?

1911,monotonespirits,1615680847,1,"Hey all I'm 23yo male and been having issues with sleep for a while now but they are becoming more of a problem lately. This is something I've always had to some degree, I was terrified to sleep alone as a kid and through early teenhood because of fear of people breaking in etc.

I guess it's the loss of control that I fear most. I hate the feeling anything could happen to me while sleeping. I also am scared of having nightmares, and particularly scared of sleep paralysis (though this hasn't ever happened to me).

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is at the same time I'm afraid of NOT sleeping, because of the damages that sleep deprivation can cause, and knowing that a bad nights sleep causes my anxiety to be even higher than usual.

I've had many years of therapy and have found that it has unfortunately made little difference to me. In the last month I have started using mindfulness meditation every day 1-3x a day and so far am finding it incredibly useful for the daytimes, but when it comes to bedtime my anxiety still spikes.

I hope that if nothing else, contininuing to be dedicated to meditating and mindfulness everytime will start to help the sleep issue aswell. 

**TLDR -**  I'm stuck in a situation where I'm both fearing not getting to sleep, but also scared of the process and concept of being asleep. I find being very tired and sleepy almost scary, and as a result I wake myself up again. I've recently started mindfulness meditation to help my anxiety and it is helping in the day, but not as much at bedtime. Is there anything else I can do specifically to try help, or just continue with the meditation?

And then anxiety will strike out of what seems like nowhere. I know it isn't out of nowhere, but I don't always know what has triggered it. It might be a sensation in my body that scares me and worries me. It might be something I read in the news that upsets me and I can't get it out of my mind. Then I try to talk myself out of it and tell myself it's okay, I'm okay, but that rarely works. Sooner or later (usually sooner) I'll take 1.4 mg of xanax, and that usually works in about an hour. I don't take it every day. But these days I'm taking it about twice a week. 

I do have a therapist and we Zoom once a week. Used to see her in person. And that helps a little. But sometimes a panic attack will strike later in the day when she and I have talked. A couple of weeks ago, I had a panic attack that was very bad on a day I was scheduled to talk to her. I felt so awful, so out of control, so terrified that I didn't want to talk to anyone. I just wanted to stay in the house with the shades closed. I texted her and lied and said I was fine but something came up. When I talked to her the following week, I came clean. 

When you're in that panic state NOTHING HELPS. You're in this Terror Bubble and you can't get out and no one can get to you and assure you that you're safe.

Most of my life I have struggled with at least a smal amount of anxiety. It mostly stemmed from a rough childhood and not enough support. Fast forward to 2018 and my body for what ever reason decided it was going to turn up the volume on anxiety 300%. I went from a happy go lucky individual to a too scared to drive or go anywhere puddle of mess. 

It turned out I had been strong for too long. My mental health and well being went untouched while I tended to others. I thought I could just keep pushing those feelings down further and further into my person. It was that action that landed me into an in-patient stay at my local psych ward.

It took two years of medication adjustments, therapy, personal support, physical activity, and exposure to get myself out of the hole I was in. Anxiety isn‚Äôt gone but I have the tools in which to better handle it.

I live in the US, so on top of the pandemic shitshow, this year has been the busiest and least secure years of my life. I've moved across the country for school, consequently took a leave of absence from said school, started a relationship, ended said relationship, started trying to sell art prints while looking for employment, yadda yadda. Lots of stuff.

The problem is that because a bunch of these things within the span of a few days/weeks of February, my anxiety has absolutely spiraled out of control. I'm not sleeping normally (hard to fall asleep/stay asleep/nightmares), not eating normally, throwing up from stress, manically cleaning my place and friends' places until my hands hurt... I reached a breaking point today because instead of sleeping, I cried on and off literally all night and gave myself diarrhea, so... glamorous. Stoked about that.

I have an anxiety diagnosis, but it hasn't been this bad for over 5 years. I can't remember anything about what I need to do between how much time has passed and how I'm too scared and anxious to think straight.

Similar to many posts on this thread, I feel a bit lost and burnt out. As a 23 male in my first full time role, it seems like I made it. I have a good job, pays well, doesn't have too many hours, and I work from home. I am very aware and very appreciative of these working conditions.

Yet the whole idea of a linear career progression came crashing down on me. I listened to what people told me and I went to school like everyone said and got a ""real"" job. I made all the ""smart"" decisions people told me to make. I have a life some would call cushy and I handle my money responsibly. Yet for some reason, I feel empty. My idea of what life should be all came crashing down this year. I thought that ""making it"" would feel different. Yet oddly it feels hollowing and decrepit.

I feel I spend 40+ hours of my week doing something I don't particularly enjoy, and I feel like I'm working for not anything too significant or groundbreaking. I don't even hate my job; rather, I just feel even more confused and more frustrated when I try to understand what it means to me.

Perhaps it is pandemic fatigue. I have no doubt that's a part of what's going on.

But many days it feels as if I exist in a re-run. A virtual groundhog day that feels never ending. On top of that though, I also get anxious about returning to the office, as I have to relearn and adapt to a new environment all over again. For young people, all this seems super stressful and the future seems as unpredictable and unknown more than ever before...

In truth, I have no clue what I'm doing with my life, nor do I even know what the next step to all this is. In sum, I feel lost. Very lost.

My only response to this absurdity is to try to keep a smile on face and appreciate the little things in life. This means reconnecting with family and prioritizing the things in life (no matter how small) that mean something to me. It seems to me struggling through both last year and this current year feels like the only option.

I'm not really asking for suggestions or even empathy necessarily. It just feels good to admit the re-run of a life I seem to be in, and how fucking lost I feel in the ocean that is the ""real world"". Many times I don't know if I will sink or swim in this vast void.

1954,enfpthrowaway2939,1615667512,2,"Having anxiety over heart palpitations over a month, seem to be getting weirder

Over a month ago I had a panic attack over heart palpitations that coincided with a delta 8 thc edible. In the past month I‚Äôve been experiencing PVCs, they usually aren‚Äôt too bad at home, but I can develop anxiety over them in public. In the past week, I traveled to Colorado for a ski trip, because of the altitude I was worried over how it would affect my heart. 

Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt get any worse palpitations, but I had two bad panic attacks during the trip anyways. I was out to dinner with my family and the entire time I felt extremely tense and uncomfortable. I could breathe fine and as far as I could tell my heart wasn‚Äôt beating fast, no palpitations. However, I still felt incredibly anxious and a sense of doom overwhelmed me. I had no choice but to play along as normal until eventually it went away while we were in a store.

After that day, we started driving home. On day one of the trip back I felt an ambient tension and discomfort riding in the car but it wasn‚Äôt so bad. The next day however (yesterday), we stopped at an uncle‚Äôs house and it was horrible. I kept feeling strange ambient sensations over my body, which caused me to overthink. I felt strange shivers and white hot sensations traveling across parts of my body and face. I went to use the bathroom, splashed some cold water on my face, and they subsided for a bit, then they came back with a vengeance. I was into full blown panic mode, my body felt extremely tense, my breathing was normal, heart was normal, face was normal, but inside I felt like I was going to die. I could barely open my mouth to speak because I felt so terrible. This lasted for about 30 minutes. It felt like an extremely long adrenaline rush almost. For the car ride home I felt better yet still very anxious for the aftermath. I couldn‚Äôt relax until I got home and even now typing this thinking about it I am getting flashbacks to the weird hot/cold flash feelings across my neck/shoulders/face.

1955,Socialist7,1615667283,2,"Several years ago I was physically assaulted by another man outside a bar. He left me with a black eye, split lip and a bloody nose. The physical wounds healed within weeks but the mental scars are still with me to this day. The assault has affected me greatly, so much so that I find it unbearable to watch a scene in a movie/TV show where there is a 'fist fight' or physical violence. 

Someone suggested I could take up some sort of self-defence to give me confidence and confront my trauma. I decided on boxing (orthodox). I bought some gloves and (because gyms are closed due to Covid) I began watching instructional Youtube videos about boxing drills. I don't have a bag yet but I've been shadow boxing in my living rooms practicing the combos, footwork and slips.

I have mixed feelings about it. When I'm having a good day I feel good about the new skills I have learned and feel more confident, but if I'm having a bad day the videos feel quite triggering. All this macho talk about hitting and punching makes me anxious imagining myself in a ring being subjected to a beating by some superior opponent. Some of the techniques feel barbaric and cruel (hitting someone in the liver sounds appalling to me).  

I guess a part of me wants to confront my fears head on by competing in an actual match (white collar boxing allows ordinary amateurs to do this) but I'm not sure whether this might make my anxiety worse if it all goes wrong.

I've never posted on reddit let alone have ever felt the need to speak my mind about this sort of thing, but I woke up this morning with another wave of overwhelming anxiety.

It started last night when I spun out. When I say spun out, I mean I started to abuse substances that I told myself I was not doing anymore. Prior to this I was studying for mid-terms and have just been feeling very overwhelmed. I do not have a lot of friends that I consider real close friends, so I decided to see what my brother was doing. I ended up getting lied to, ignored, and left alone once again. 

The feeling of being alone is frightening. Especially when you are there left thinking about all the actions you have done that got in the position of being alone. No one that you can text, call, see. No healthy relationships that you can fall back to. In my experience and I know others as well, that is when you resort to drugs and alcohol. To build that bond or relationship that you are desperately trying to compensate for.

Many people including myself feel this everyday. Overthinking everything that has led us to this feeling. Feeling like you are not worth anyone's time so why bother? 

I guess I'm here to remind someone and whoever who may read this that you are not alone. Before you think of resorting to any sort of coping mechanism that is that suppresses your feeling, feel that shit. Let yourself hurt. It's the only way you'll feel real in the moment. I know I can do a better job too, but we are in this all together :)

1972,WesolyPiecyk,1615663283,1,"Does anyone else also have fear of their neighbors?

I have a great fear of my neighbors since I moved to my girlfriends apartment 2 years ago. I have lived in the suburbs in single family houses since I was born. I always had friendly relations with my previous neighbors. Despite living in several different locations, I always felt like I was in my right place.

  
My mood changed drastically after moving to my girlfriend's apartment located in city center. It is first time I live in such crowded place and in apartment building. My immediate neighbors are on their high horses. They don't even bother to say anything or look at me when I simply greet them   
when we pass each other in the corridor. I feel like they always judge me. I can't feel safe or spontainous in my own house, because I feel that they judge every sound coming from my apartment.   
I can't even park my car in the parking lot, because I feel that they are watching me from behind the windows and judging me. One time, I accidentally looked out the window at my neighbor as he was getting out of his car and I think he noticed me. Since then I fear that he thinks I am creep.

I live in constant fear of them and I don't really know why. My girlfriend always tells me that I should completely don't think about them, because they certainly don't care about me. I know she's right, but I can't help to worry about them. I feel like I am living on their territory, and my house is under their control. Does any one know what can cause this feeling? Maybe I am used to friendly neighbors and this change is too harsh for me?

I have mild BPD disorder and I am seeing therapist monthly. I told him once or twice about my social anxiety, which is mostly focused on my living in crowded place and on my neighbors. He simply told me that I won't change my perception of neighbors so it is best to move out which isn't possible. I feel that there is something that could help me with this anxiety, but I don't really know what.",Anxiety,I feel like prisoner in my own home,2021-03-14 06:21:23

I just don't know what to do, I don't want to be ungrateful to those who care about me, but I think it's unfair to have to pose for the birthday.

It has always been a tiring date, but now that I have grown up it seems that my anger at birthdays has increased. I love to celebrate the birthday of the people I love, if they want to, but I hate to celebrate mine, it awakens feelings of anger and fear that I still don't know how to deal with.

Been unemployed for about 2 years now. Mainly due to mental health but alot the anxiety about getting back into the workforce.

Everything about it causes me GREAT anxiety. The first hurdle is applying for jobs...in alot of these applications you have to leave a phone number - to which I assume they use to get into touch with you. I am usually very hesitant about phone calls, and usually don't answer any that isn't from someone I know very well. I get to anxious otherwise. 

THEN there's the interview.... That, I don't know how I'm going to get past that. I haven't been to an actual interview before and had bad anxiety about anything formal/presentation/etc.... I got accomodations throughout high school (aka therapedic day school) where I didn't have to give presentations or stuff like that.  So idk how I'm going to go to an job interview.... Since to my mind equals a interview to a formal presentation....

*My first job I got help getting from one of those after-high school programs...so they kinda got in me into the job...didn't have to worry about an interview/etc*

Then there's the actual issue of keeping the job.... Every job I look at causes me anxiety because you have to interact with people, or have skills, or something that causes me to be hesitant about applying for the job. These are just entry level jobs to....

I also had issues with skipping school due to mental health and that did carry over into my first job...I didn't mean to do it, I just couldn't help it. Became a habit as well. Plus anything that causes me anxiety tends to cause me to avoid it. 

I also don't know how I'm going to deal with the derealization on the job.... I can barely sorta handle it at home (gets worse when I'm away from home). However I have ALOT of pressure from family to start working, and that makes me anxious and feeling guilty too..

1982,Expert-Salary-4712,1615661392,1,"(24M) To start, I've seen a clinical psych on several occasions and taken evaluations and have been told I have severe anxiety. I've gotten blood drawn and taken every blood test my doctors can imagine and no negative results. This all started for the first time a year ago. After some very stressful life events I started getting severe panic attacks when I would smoke weed, previously I had smoked for years with no issues. So I quit weed cold turkey and the past year I've just been having severe anxiety I believe. I constantly over think things, I toss and turn all night, I get nightmares, I have bouts of derealization, and I'm constantly obsessing/worrying that I'm becoming mentally ill. It got better over time, so I stupidly decided to try to smoke again a couple nights ago. I didn't have a panic attack but I could definitely feel an increase in anxiety right away. Now since then I've been feeling derealized again and have this horrible lingering feeling that I can't explain. It's almost like dizziness mixed with a head buzz that you'd get from nicotine. It just feels physically in my head like something is wrong. I don't know how to put this feeling into words, it's just like this ""off"" feeling that I have all the time.

1987,Rucksack212,1615660841,1,"Hi. I'm experiencing some of the heaviest anxiety of my life and I don't know where else to turn. I'm a 23 y/o M. I really started struggling with anxiety when I was 18, though I suspect I may have had issues with it earlier based on memory. Anxiety/Sleep disorders run in my family for preface. 
I was able to solve them mostly at the time, so I had to leave my job, got prescribed Hydroxyzine which still works decently well to this day. Then, around 2019, so two years after I had the initial problem, I took a second job to help cover costs at my house, only weekends though. Biggest mistake ever. I went through a few nights where I didn't sleep due to stress, and ended up quitting that new job only two weekends in. I got offered full time at Hobby Lobby, where I still am employed to date. It was fine for awhile, minor nights of bad sleep but I was never really ""worried"" about it per-sey. 
So everything was looking up right? That's what I thought too. Then, quarantine hit. I started staying up really late playing games/watching videos, would go to bed around 6/7AM and wake up at 2-3PM. This went on for a couple months, then had to go back to work. Long story short, big surprise, going to wake up early again, couldn't sleep. I got 2-3 hours for 2 consecutive days, working a 9-9 shift at work, came home after the third day expecting to crash because I was so tired. Nope. Panic attack to the fullest, I was twitching, crying, went to the hospital because I thought I was legitimately doomed, they gave me Lorazepam, ended up out like a light. 
Since, I started taking better care of myself. Give myself an hour to relax before bed. Have to be in bed by 2AM at the max, take Hydroxyzine to relax. All was good for awhile, a few bad nights of sleep which I was now starting to worry about owing to my past experiences with sleep. 
It was around this time I started becoming a Hypochondriac as well. If I felt ill with something, constantly looked by symptoms. It didn't really affect me alot at the time. Then, come September, moved out of my parent's place into an apartment with my cousin. I was worried about sleeping away from home, but did so just fine. Had a few flare-ups in November and December for a week where I didn't sleep particularly well, got prescribed Trazadone (hit or miss with me). 
Then, around this time, something within me has snapped. I got prescribed Seroquel last week because I had a small issue sleeping and brought it up to my doctor, and slept for 8 hours about 5-6 consecutive days. Then, two days ago hits. Can't sleep until 4AMish, call off work, slept from about 9AM-1PM. Nothing new, have done it a few times before. Pills seem to be ineffective again. Then, my hypochondria gets the best of me. I look up insomnia and the different types, and came across FFI and SFI, both fatal forms of insomnia. Er, maybe I shouldn't say Insomnia, but it is a very common symptom owing to a psionic gene in the brain that mutates, if I read correctly. I started freaking out. Last night, I tried to sleep at midnight, ended up tossing and turning and wanting to cry regarding the thought. My anxiety wouldn't let me sleep. My hypochondriac mind wants to believe I have this terrible disease that is very rare and only within certain bloodlines (of which mine is not one), but my mind thinks I have it anyways, or have the spontaneous version (very very rare to get, actually better chance of winning the lotto, again, from researching the topic). Didn't crash until idk when, but I did get sleep, woke up at 9 today but only probably slept 2-3 hours. 
I wanna cry. My mind won't let go of the thought that by some slim miracle chance I have it, and that I'll be dead in 6 months, unable to sleep, suffering. I'm terrified of sleeping tonight, that my meds again won't help. That I'm in a downward spiral that I can't climb out of. I need someone's help, encouraging words, ANYTHING.

1988,Exlplora_0109,1615660111,3,"It wasn't until I learnt about panic attacks that I realised I have experienced similar sensations, physically and mentally. As a little girl, I used to dread meeting new people which at the time included just guests coming home. It would give me chills to face and interact with them. I was never really introverted, in fact, I was a debater throughout my school and college. But I have always experienced this suffocating feeling if anyone has tried to breach a certain mental space in my head. 
As I grew up I realised that I am not much of a people's person. In a large gathering, I would find myself the quietest. I forget words. Don't have coherent thoughts. And sometimes do eerie things just to look cool and comfortable in social situations. Sometimes I do absolutely normal things while shitting bricks inside. 
After an abusive personal relationship, and working with a snob for a boss, I have lost all faith in myself. Raised with typical Indian middle class values, I was always taught that I had to fight my own battles so asking for help was never an option for me. So I feel stupid telling anyone about my issues because it usually involves so many explanations. And I feel stupid for not being the ""social"" person that everyone thinks I am. I feel stupid for feeling emotionally weak. 
I've not exactly been very lucky with therapies either as most professionals have just tried to extort money from me in the name of therapy. I am trying really hard to understand my own anxieties but I could really use some advise here.

1998,BurtslicPatzer,1615657896,1,"Hey everyone,

Not really sure what I'm looking for with his post but I thought maybe someone else gets this and could maybe shed some light on how they come with it.

Background... so I'm a pretty anxious person as a standard, I have general anxiety and specifically health anxiety but this is more about the general. I have a tendency to REALLY overthink situations that others wouldn't even think twice at; an example could be my boss wanting a catch up, I would jump to the most negative thing I could think of and fry my mind for days about what it could be... then it would just turn out to be a 'Hey how are you getting on' type of thing and I had nothing to worry about. So that's just an idea of where we are at.

I have a really specific one though. When there is any possibility of conflict between me and another unknown person it will really make me worried. Here's an example from today. So someone pulled out on my while I was driving, I was only doing 15mph or so approaching traffic lights and they pulled out and blocked the road sideways as they wanted to go into the lane across from me and were waiting to be let in. As I approached them they started actioning me from the window waving their hands, screwing their face up and shouting that I need to slow down etc, even thought I was doing nothing wrong and it was their fault. We then pulled up to the lights together and I didn't look at them or anything but they drove behind me for a while after, nothing aggressive or anything like that. Now that has sat with me ALL day today. Worried that they will see me in the future and confront me, remember my car, plate, see me parked up or anything etc to try and find me.

This sort of anxiety has been with me since school as I would feel sick going back to school after the holidays in case someone had stirred something up and there was conflict awaiting that I was unaware of etc.

How do people just let things like this go and not let it bother them or let it consume their day worrying about it? Right now my anxiety is really high after today and nothing even happened.

This has really thrown me off today, my GF asked me why I'm so quiet and the truth if because I have been playing that 5 seconds over and over in my head on loop, I was just too embarrassed to tell her that's the reason. FYI she FULLY knows about my anxiety and is super supportive, just didn't want to burden her with every little thing.

What's weirder is I'm actually a really confident person and will happily put myself in conflict but if I feel I can judge the outcome. If I don't know the person - like today - then I go into overdrive about it. But like at work say, if my boss was rude to me I would 100% call them out on it and tell them they do not ever speak to me like that with no second thoughts or worries and have done previously.

I had to take 3 weeks off work due to some mega stress, my doctor gave me citalopram which ended up giving me my first ever panic attack after 3 days. And it was brutal and terrifying, lying on the floor at 4am thinking it was a heart attack. November and December, the panic attacks continued to hit randomly, but most noticeable was at around 3 to 4am almost each night. 

I got a therapist, I looked at my diet (I was vegan at the time) but in December I brought back fish and eggs into my diet and wow I started to feel loads better, physically and mentally. Into January 2021, therapy going well, feeling less anxious and almost like my ""normal self"" again. Cue end of Jan, I started to notice some acid reflux symptoms, out of nowhere, daily. Went to Doctor, and they prescribed Omeprazole, and then Lansoprazole, still didnt work. Things came to a head for me last night, ended up in hospital as I had bad abdominal pains and loads of acid feelings, a little different to ""normal"". After bloods, urine, xray on chest and abdomen, ECG, I'm discharged and told to go home. 

Today I feel miserable, physically and mentally. I've got an endoscopy booked on 27 March and waiting on that. I feel terrified that I've something awful, like the big C or an ulcer or something that the docs missed.

I've been have these ""anxious"" feelings since 8th maybe even 7th Grade - I'm in 12th grade currently.- I tried to get help from school counseling last year and it was a total disaster. The school counselor made me even worse instead of helping me. She judged me, questioned my feelings and relationships like I was doing something wrong. For instance when I talked about my toxic friend and not talking to her anymore she blamed me for betraying my friend. I'm probably making grammar mistakes but I wanna complete this text without worrying about anything. Cause I really need to hear your thoughts.

Even though I haven't been diagnosed with anything at all since I couldn't go to a doctor and probably won't be able to I really can see my problems, reasons for them etc. I don't know if this is a good thing or not but despite knowing them I can't really do anything about them. It started to affect my life really badly and I'm definitely not okay.

My expression is a mess right now, sorry for that. I'm gonna start from the beginning. The reason why I got these feelings is my mom. She's been always critical towards me but not in a nice way. She always damn me. She constantly remind me what a mess/disappointment I'm. So it all started with these and these haven't stopped in any day. Once I started to believe the things she said to me, I started to fall apart and couldn't fix myself since the day I let those words in.

I have a important exam ahead but I don't do anything about it anymore. I'm tired all the time and meanwhile I guess I destroyed my relationship with my best friend. It can be the anxiety who says these words yet I can't deal with them anymore. I'm feeling so powerless and helpless. I'm not just damaging myself now, I'm damaging my friends too.

Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt get any worse palpitations, but I had two bad panic attacks during the trip anyways. I was out to dinner with my family and the entire time I felt extremely tense and uncomfortable. I could breathe fine and as far as I could tell my heart wasn‚Äôt beating fast, no palpitations. However, I still felt incredibly anxious and a sense of doom overwhelmed me. I had no choice but to play along as normal until eventually it went away while we were in a store.

After that day, we started driving home. On day one of the trip back I felt an ambient tension and discomfort riding in the car but it wasn‚Äôt so bad. The next day however (yesterday), we stopped at an uncle‚Äôs house and it was horrible. I kept feeling strange ambient sensations over my body, which caused me to overthink. I felt strange shivers and white hot sensations traveling across parts of my body and face. I went to use the bathroom, splashed some cold water on my face, and they subsided for a bit, then they came back with a vengeance. I was into full blown panic mode, my body felt extremely tense, my breathing was normal, heart was normal, face was normal, but inside I felt like I was going to die. I could barely open my mouth to speak because I felt so terrible. This lasted for about 30 minutes. It felt like an extremely long adrenaline rush almost.

Everything was fine till I was in highschool. The problems started after that. 

When I was around 16, one of my friend confessed to me and I rejected them (quite rudely, cause I panicked...this is some other anxiety problem which I'll save for another day). That person didn't take it well and told the other people in the group the complete opposite of what happened. I tried to make them realize the truth but I don't think it worked that well.

My contact with that person and the group then fizzled out and I got into college. 

2 years later...

During my time in college, I was around 18, I developed severe OCD, which caused my mental health and overall confidence to plummet as low as possible. Around this time, I got in contact with them again, but the confidence I had, the personality I had during childhood, was now replaced by the nervous me. I just couldn't talk openly with them. Felt out of place. Everything I did in front of them came out as awkward.
I wanted it to be like old days but I realized that it was impossible now.

And because of it, I couldn't control my behavior, which resulted in them having this bad image of me in their minds.

The people in the group got busy with their lives and the contacts between them fizzled out as well but I am sure that they have better friendship between each other individually than I have with them. 

I got a hold my mental health when I was 21. Regained my confidence. Matured personality-wise. 

But it still pains me when I go see them, talk with them. I can see it in their eyes that they still think that I am ""that"" person.
 
I still can't talk openly with them. My confidence still goes out the window when I interact with them.

It only happens with that group of friends. I have amazing relationship with other people, but I just can't be my full self when I am with that group of friends. I constantly think about whether they would like what I say, what I do, etc.

It hurts me cause I am not the person they think I am. I can't even talk to them about these things cause I have that gut feeling that it won't make a difference. I know so.

[For context] As far as I can remember, I've always been very selfaware of my flaws and very critical toward it.
It seems like there's always this little voice in my head telling me that every step I take is wrong and that basically I shouldn't even be alive to begin with. Somedays this kind of negatives thoughts can make me have a panick attack. I've struggled in the past with depression (hello teenage years) but overcame lt with a lot of effort and excitement for the future since I graduated highschool and went abroad for my studies. 

Living alone was terrifying at first but you get used to it and since I'm not a very social person, it was fine and even enjoyable. I've been living by myself for three years now but it was just recently with all the covid situation and closing borders between countries that I started having this perpetual worry that something bad was going to happen to my family when I wouldn't be there for them (my aunt died from a car accident not long ago). Eventually, my parents caught Covid-19 at the same time and I just couldn't do anything about it except praying for them in my studio.They recovered but I still have a feeling of shame, that I was useless.

After that and with all of my school sessions being on zoom, I've got the opportunity to return to my hometown and I think I'm gonna stay here till the next start of the academic year.
The relieving sensation that I got when I could actually see them without any of us being dead or injured ( I've took two different flight that day and was persuaded that I was gonna crash somehow) didn't last long. Now I'm always worrying everytime my younger brother get into the school bus or my mother visiting relatives in another town. I would like to be with them every moment of the day but that would be a little bit creepy.

 I don't really identify as a generally anxious person, most of my anxiety occurs in social interactions, but last night a very strange thing happenned. I was minding my business being on my phone when I got up to brush my teeths before sleeping. And I sensed something was off, well actually it literally was off : I hadn't any thoughs. Any worries at all, it seemed like my brain had taken a break from thinking. So I just sat on my bed looking at the wall, for the first time of my life probably enjoying the silence. No self depreciating comments, no ""What if""s, absolutely nothing.
This lasted for about 10 minutes (really great experience I must say) but what came after was a nightmare.
As I laid on my bed to finally sleep, I felt like vibrations in my soul. Not the in-love type but like a real storm coming. As the vibrations grow bigger and bigger, I could feel and hear my heart beating really fast like it was gonna explode. It seemed like peace evaporated my body and I was left with all the trouble.

I started getting chest pain and pain in my left arm, which worsened over the course of a few minutes. Eventually I was so out of breathe and weak I was on my knees and getting stabbing pains in my chest that made me moan. I called an ambulance, by the time they arrived I still felt wierd and shaky but it was mostly over. They did a few tests and then a heart reading which were all okay. They said my color was good and because of my age and lack of underlying health conditions it was very unlikely I had a heart attack. They told me it was anxiety and left.

I was just left wondering wtf that even was, as a similar thing happened a week ago where my chest got tight and I got out of breath except it was not as bad as this time. I've also been ill the last few days and fatigued. I lost my energy and had to lay on the floor earlier this morning.

Why, yes. Of course.
The main scenarios that play out in my head are: 

1. If I (f) was sent back in time to the Ancient Hebrew age (old times in general), how would I stay alive (since I don't know the Ancient language, the customs, etc.)? And then I try to mentally prepare myself. I try to think of every possible outcome and ""Oh maybe I can bring something with me!"" But how long WOULD my toothpaste last? And could I camp out forever or would I need to be apart of society eventually? How do I show that I'm not a witch?

It just goes on and on until I get really stressed out.

2. If I was sent back in time, how would I do everything the exact same way so that I end up where I am now? Would my knowledge of the past make me to do things different and create a butterfly effect that land me somewhere else? How do I get to dating my boyfriend and have the same trusting and healthy relationship we have now?

This one stresses me out the most because I feel like I have so much to lose.

These aren't anxiety-inducing enough to make me panic, but I do get that Heart-beating-too-fast feeling when I overthink them, and sometimes I'll spend hours on these questions before realizing that they don't matter because they can't happen.

2040,throw_away987651,1615649380,1,"Hello kind strangers! Reaching out for some help and psychological advice in hopes of finding somebody that could help. üòä Long post warning! 

It was only recently that I finally identified and pinpointed a years-old psychological problem that I have. I‚Äôll try to be as precise with the description as I can, although I cannot grasp it fully yet. 

I‚Äôm currently 20 years old. For years on end, I was out of touch with my own emotions. I didn‚Äôt really open up to anyone, I had a hard time trusting people and my own family didn‚Äôt encourage me to express my emotions, often mocking me if I laughed like a little kid or cried. This is not to say that I grew up in an abusive household, nor do I want to pull the victim card or blame somebody else for my own issues. However, I guess this was a contributing factor in me becoming rather closed off and unable to identify how I feel, or how I should react to a particular situation. During the described period, I didn‚Äôt have anyone I could share anything personal with; I only maintained weak friendships enough to have some social contacts, but nothing more than that. There was a gap of trust between me and my parents and we argued often. 

During this time, I didn‚Äôt feel like there was anything abnormal about my situation. I just considered myself a rather cold, aloof, distanced person, even though I acted friendly with everyone around me. It was also during this time that I developed a dislike for physical contact, I didn‚Äôt like letting anybody near me (physically or emotionally) or being touched. Basically, up until the age of almost 18, I wasn‚Äôt much more than a machine for good grades and academic achievements, this was my only aim and I had completely neglected my mental health and inner world. I barely had any close relationships, let alone romantic ones. I only had my first kiss at 18‚Ä¶ I think this says enough. Before that, I did develop crushes and romantic feelings for different guys, but I never acted on them; rather, I suppressed them deep down inside and didn‚Äôt allow myself to feel anything like that. 

I will go on and describe two situations which, I believe, took a toll on the person that I used to be. When I was about 11 or 12, my then-best friend turned her back on me and took the side of a girl who hated me ‚Äì all in front of the whole class and my then-friends, who turned against me and started bullying me. I know this is a childish story that doesn‚Äôt have a large impact on my personality, but I still remember the pain and how hurt I felt, and I believe nevertheless that it left behind some unhealed trauma that gave me trust issues and a fear of attachment. I considered myself really close with this girl until she blamed me that I suffocated her by being an obsessive friend and never gave her any space. I still remember her words and how deeply they hurt me back then.

Situation number 2 features said guy I had my first kiss with. The first person who seemed to respond to the feelings I had for him ‚Äì understandably, I was head over heels for him and hoped this would turn into a serious relationship, but then he ghosted me. As he vanished into thin air, I blamed myself for being too clingy and not taking hints that he was not interested. I fell even deeper into the hole of avoiding getting close to people, I couldn‚Äôt forgive myself for letting him hurt me, and distanced myself to an extreme. Afterwards, I had two brief relationships which didn‚Äôt really get anywhere, and the second one ended after the guy said to me that I was apparently ‚Äúmore invested into the relationship than he was‚Äù. 

Now to the turning point ‚Äì shortly before I turned 18, I had an almost-mental breakdown after I saved myself from an eating disorder and realized I was going to die if I didn‚Äôt get my life together. Mental health-wise, the following months were a (mostly) upward curve with the exception of the above-mentioned moments when romantic relationships entered the picture. It was also around this time that I found a friend who allowed me to be myself around her ‚Äì it took me a while to open up, but she was the first person I got truly close with. She started helping me out of my aloofness, and little by little I started embracing my emotions. The truth is, I‚Äôm a very sensitive person who feels everything deeply, and it was the one of my most liberating experiences when I allowed myself to cry openly about something for the first time instead of suppressing my emotions and bottling it all up. 

About a year ago, I had a really deep conversation with my cousin whom I always considered the older sister I never had (I‚Äôm an only child btw). Indeed, we meet rarely, but I‚Äôll never forget what she told me back then ‚Äì she said she wanted to know the real me, the emotional side of me, instead of the kid with the good grades others presented me to her as. At this point, me being almost 19, felt I had become more mature, and some insights from this conversation with her really sank in and stuck with me. 

I‚Äôve been dating the guy of my dreams for almost a year now. He‚Äôs been really sweet and understanding to me, and always willing to help and console me when I‚Äôm trying to deal with my issues. Recently he told me not to be afraid to be myself around him, referring to me avoiding clinginess to an extreme due to the past incidents in my former relationships. I feel like I‚Äôve changed and overcome most of my past trauma, but I‚Äôm still afraid to reach out to him and call him when, for example, I think he might be busy, in fears of coming across as obsessive and annoying. I like to give him his distance and personal space, but he has encouraged me to work to get over this last remaining issue and consider my own emotional needs. I like to describe myself as having a soldier-like behavior at times ‚Äì I‚Äôve trained myself to require as little attention as possible, regardless of how much I really need. 

On to the questions ‚Äì how do I heal from this? How do I get over my neglection of my own emotional needs and finally remove this last barrier which prevents me from opening up fully?

2042,Byul3006,1615648698,1,"Hello, guys!

I am in need of advice. I've been struggling with anxiety for a few months now. I am in my first year of university now and ever since I started in September I think I have developed some sort of anxiety. Probably the main reason for that is having online classes and not being able to go out much and enjoy life because of social distancing. I was fine during winter semester, or at least I thought I was until winter break started and I began noticing the symptoms more. It wasn't that intense in the begining, I would have some difficulty breathing from time to time and insomnia but I didn't pay that much attention to it until I started developing some serious nausea. When winter break started I decided to go to my general practitioner because I thought it might be some gastroenterological problem. But then after I discussed it with my mom she said it's probably a mental related issue because of university pressure and then I started noticing the signs more. Every morning I wake up and have to struggle with my nausea, it's especially bad in the mornings. I have headeaches from time to time, increased heartbeat, difficulty breathing. There was one time when I went out and had sensory overload (at least I think it was that, because it felt like every light and every noise was too much at the same time). Anyway, I've been reading a lot and thinking a lot what might be the cause for that and I think I might have developed GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), although I am no expert so I can't be sure. Things that I used to do easily before that, like giving a presentation for example, is too hard now even though it's an online class which just makes me feel pathetic because I've talked in front of a room full of a hundred people in the past without having a breakdown.

Some thoughts I've been having that cause my anxiety are:

- I want to go out with my friends but I feel apprehensive if it will go well, if we'll have things to talk about because nothing that exciting happens to me that I can talk about because of the social distancing BUT I have to go out in order for something to happen (it's a vicious circle really)

- I am worried that I have so many assignments to get done for uni all the time that if I go out I will have to do a lot of catching up BUT I am already behind on school as it is because really you probably have to study 24/7 if you want to be on track with everything which is impossible.

- I feel like I am not doing enough. Currently all I am doing (or at least trying to do) is study for uni and volunteering in this student organisation while back in high school I was studying, volunteering in a few organisations, taking up a few extracurriculars and I've never had problem, like I would be worried and stressed from time to time but it was never that intense. Now the situation I am in only makes me feel pathetic looking back.

A few days ago I woke up with a really bad nausea. I have only threw up a few time since December when it started but my nausea has only  presented itself in the form of gag reflexes which is really inconvenient. Anyway, that day it was too intense, I threw up although I didn't eat anything, then I started having difficulty breathing, my heartbeat increased and I was so restless, I felt cold one second, then hot the other, I had these racing thoughts. The whole experience was so surreal because I felt like I was existing right that moment but at the same time I was not, if I can put it that way. I think this was an anxiety attack, I've had those before as well, but not that intense. The situation was worse because I had to give a presentation that day, so I got even more anxious, like I knew it wasn't a big deal but that was not comforting in any way. At the end I took some sedative pills half an hour before the presentation and this managed to calm me down a little bit.

Every day I just wake up and feel this tension and anxiety in my body although I know there's nothing to worry about, like I am waiting for something to happen at each moment and it's frustrating. Ot course, there are bad days, but thre are good days as well. On these days I almost can't feel my nausea or any other symptoms besides the tension.

Anyway, my question is do you guys think it's a good idea to see a therapist. I've talked with a friend of mine and she gave me contacts to a therapist she's been to, but I feel anxious making an appointment because what if it's just not that serious and I am just making things up and looking for attention.

Last night I spent 2 1/2 hours in my bed, rehearsing what I was going to say to her, brainstorming what we can do in case she gets bored, and trying to remember how clean and nice everything looks in my house. And, no, it's not because I am romantically interested in her; the main issue is that I do this **every single time** me and other friends make plans. 

Two weeks ago, me and my even closer friends scheduled a hang-out the next day. For two hours, I stood in front of my mirror, trying to fix my hair, cursing at the big pimple on my chin that just wouldn't go away, and worrying and worrying about everything. I stressed about what kind of snacks I should bring, whether or not they would judge my only pair of shoes, and, of course, transportation, because I'm terrified of going anywhere alone. I do this every time there is a hang-out. It's so exhausting and it's getting to the point where I physically sprint away from this kind of social contact.

Last week I was exiting my trapeze class and a boy I knew from school looked at me. I suddenly got so afraid that he was going to say hi that I speed-washed my hands, fumbled to pick up my water bottle, and made a dash across the entire parking lot to get to my car, almost running into a non-moving one.

2050,FightingAnxiety22,1615642457,1,"24 year old male here 200 lbs and major health anxiety sufferer! No heart genetics of anything.

Hello, I was checked out at the ER 3 days ago and had to stay for 1 night due to elevated Troponin levels. Normal was under 15 and I was on 29. Over the next day and night the Troponin level went down and down and by the time I left it was at 10. 

I had been feeling throat and top on shoulder to neck pressure for a week. I was playing at a soccer practice and I did the whole practice but after I went to the ER for the pressure pain. 

They checked my cholesterol levels which was completely fine and checked my heart with an EKG for 10+ hours and it was all good. The next day they did and ultrasound of the heart and it was also completely normal so they sent me home.

What I am scared of was the Troponin levels rising but I got told it was due to me being very active at the soccer practice just before i got to the ER

I still have the pressure on my shoulders but i never feel the pressure in the throat and shoulder at the same time. Has anyone else had this feeling and do you guys think I‚Äôm fine? I‚Äôve done a stress test 1 year ago as well and it was perfect so they didn‚Äôt want me to do another one.",Anxiety,"Bad shoulder pressure and throat pressure, making anxiety worse",2021-03-14 00:34:17

2052,tWig_producer,1615642223,1,"For some context, im a 24yr old male who grew up in a very old school portaguese and catholic household. My parents came straight from the Azores to America in the 70‚Äôs. They met in the 80‚Äôs, got married and had my brother in 88, then me in 96. I honestly don‚Äôt really know alot of their upbringing. My grandparents that were alive when i was younger didn‚Äôt speak any English so its not like i could ask them how it was. 

Anyways onto my situation, my family is pretty fucked up. My mom used to tell me stories about before i was born when my dad would beat her. They‚Äôve had issues even before my brother was born. If i had to explain my childhood in one word, it‚Äôd be chaotic. My earliest memories are that of just my parents fighting and my dad hitting me. Very very early on, i was molested by my brother. I don‚Äôt remember how old i was but all i can tell you is that i know it happened. This is something I‚Äôve never brought up to my family, it doesn‚Äôt really affect me and never really has. So i just kinda like to forget it happened.

My dad is a narcissist to the very core. His word is god‚Äôs word and he can never be wrong. He‚Äôll put words in your mouth that you‚Äôve never said and deny all terrible things he said. I never really did well in school, had a hard time paying attention. I assume i had ADD but this was never confirmed by a doctor so take it with a grain of salt. I assume a normal loving parent would probably have taken their child to a doctor to confirm that, or at least try and tutor their child. My dad instead would beat me, call me a disgrace and always compare me to my brother (who did considerably well in school.) 

I had no sense of privacy at all growing up. My door always had to be open and if it was closed, I‚Äôd either get yelled at to open it or my dad would just barge in without knocking. To this day he never knocks before entering my room and I‚Äôve brought it up multiple times but my word is nothing to him and always will be. I‚Äôd get beat for pretty much anything when i was younger: spilling a beverage or food on the floor, not finishing a plate of food, getting C‚Äôs in school. I used to chew on blankets when i was younger and I‚Äôd get beat for that too. Im not gonna list every single thing but you get idea. Now i guess i can say in a way getting beat as a child toughened me up as an adult now but was it for the right reasons, i don‚Äôt know.

My dad has absolutely no respect for women. They are beneath him and his ideals are that they belong cleaning the house and in the kitchen. I‚Äôve witnessed my dad beat my mom several times as a child. Shes had cuts, bruises, black eyes, the whole works. My mom used to have a shopping addiction, my house to this day is just filled with bottles of unused nail polish and unworn shoes and heels. This was always the main issue with my parents while i grew up. My mom would shop for things because her marriage made her so miserable and buying things was the only thing that could make her happy. She thought she could always hide the fact that she was shopping but she‚Äôd get caught every single time. Either my dad would find hidden envelopes of credit cards that my mom applied for, or he would catch her leaving work early. This would always result in a HUGE fight at home and they always would bring my brother and i into it. My brother would always take my dads side cause he was also poisoned to believe that women are nothing. Me on the other hand, chose my moms side. This was only because my mom was the only loving parent, she was very good to me when i was a child. Even as a teen I considered her my best friend cause I‚Äôd talk to her about everything. 

This was life for me for most of my childhood up to until i was about 19. My parents would fight regularly every day. Most of the time it was screaming matches but many a time it got physical. I just felt constant trauma all the time. I had a very hard time fitting in with kids at school. The friends that i did have i never really hung out with because leaving the house was always an issue. Before i was a teen, My dad wouldn‚Äôt allow me at any ones house period, only family members. As i got older it just turned to constant berating whenever i tried to leave the house. ‚ÄúWhere are you going? Who you gonna be with? I better not catch you doing anything stupid.‚Äù It got to a point where i just didn‚Äôt leave the house at all to avoid all that. I couldn‚Äôt keep stable relationships in highschool and it was 100% my fault. I just didn‚Äôt know how to handle relationships back then cause all i saw at home was a marriage of chaos. 

By the time i was 20 i knew at least how to treat a girl right. But i got into a nearly 2 year long toxic relationship. This is a story for another time but the gist of it is: i moved to an apartment with this girl. I was the only one workin and i paid for everything and did everything she wanted. She was very manipulative and just used me for my money and i dealt with that because to me, ANYTHING was better then moving back home. But eventually she took off with some guy to NC and i got evicted and that whole ordeal cost me $20k. Im very happy to say that I‚Äôve grown so much since that happened and I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes. I finally found my own sense of identity at 22 and i can say i truly love who i am as a person today. And a big factor to that is my current S/O who i will be marrying next year in October. 

Anyways, after i moved back home from the apartment, shit was worse with my parents marriage and my brother had since moved out. My mom got into an ‚Äúinternet affair‚Äù because my dad just won‚Äôt change his ways. Instead of finally divorcing they just fought about it until my mom was forced to block this dude on everything and continue to stay with my dad. Shes always been like this, she just ultimately submits to him after every fight. They were SO close to divorcing once, they were seeing a lawyer and everything, but then all that just stopped. Now they just fight about the her cell phone literally every single day cause my dad is paranoid. Which understandably i would be to but at that point just fucking separate already. 

As an adult now i tell my mom all the time that the worse thing that my parents ever did was staying together while my brother and i grew up. My brother might not admit it but him and i are so mentally damaged from that environment. And my mom‚Äôs only excuse is ‚Äúwe did it for you guys‚Äù which of course is horse shit. My mom wouldn‚Äôt be able to support herself if she was single (this is what my dad would threaten her with) and my dad would be lost without a slave in the house to do everything for him. 

Now heres what set me off to write this whole thing. My mom told me yesterday that my dad said this about me; ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt survive on his own, if i were to die he‚Äôd be helpless.‚Äù I‚Äôve worked full time jobs since i was 18. Even after that whole toxic relationship i have quite a bit of money saved up. I really really just wanna move out and start my own life on my terms. More then anything i just want to be away from my dad. I hate that man with every ounce of my being and when he dies, i will not shed a single tear. But i just feel trapped. 

I know when i do leave, its gonna be a huge ordeal. To them I‚Äôll be doing it just to spite them when in reality i just wanna start my own chapter in life. But there is another thing that keeps me home. Growing up i had dreams and ambitions, i really wanted to be a musician but that was shut down hard because of my dad. ‚ÄúYou need to do a real job when your older, be a lawyer or a mailman.‚Äù I wanted to start a gaming channel on youtube when i was a teen but never got the help to start it cause it was ‚Äúa waste of time and its stupid.‚Äù As i got older of course I realized you can do ANYTHING you set your mind to. But its not like i can livestream on twitch at my current living situation cause my parents fight all the time. I also have a hard time being inspired to write music just cause im around so much negativity. 

A huge issue with moving out also is the fact i live in MA. Living expenses here are fucking ridiculous. However, i do have 2 options: My fianc√© and i can move in with her sister in Arkansas or we move to Michigan where my girl grew up. Problem with those options is everything i have is here. My job doesn‚Äôt pay much, about $360 a week, but i love it. I work in a tire garage and I don‚Äôt really have to deal with people and i save up quite a bit. My girl also makes about the same at her job and together we‚Äôre pretty set financially. I also wanna stay in MA cause i want to start a podcast with my best friend. 

My main thing is i just wanna get away from my family. Yes i could move out and still live in MA. I wouldn‚Äôt be living paycheck to paycheck but i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to support my dreams. Also i just recently looked up a first time home buyers discussion on reddit and an overwhelming amount of people say owning a house is a bad idea cause its just a money pit. As an adult I don‚Äôt really let my parents‚Äô problems get to me, i ignore it most of the time cause I‚Äôve made peace with that they‚Äôre never going to change. But the constant bickering and the fact that my dad still tries to control me is driving me insane. I never want to be home, im happier at work most of the time. My friends are my family as far as im concerned. I just feel like im stuck and I can‚Äôt escape. I really don‚Äôt know what to do, and even if i think i do, i second guess myself cause all i ever been told in life by my dad is that im nothing. I don‚Äôt want to believe this anymore, i want to spread my wings and fly but im scared. I was brought up to fear the world, not embrace it and i know this isn‚Äôt the way to think. I was raised to not take risks, but you can‚Äôt get anywhere in life if you don‚Äôt take a leap of faith. Im so afraid to cut this family from my life cause i know what kind of backlash awaits me. Dad will probably break everything i own in a fit of rage cause his whipping boy will be gone. But that shouldn‚Äôt matter cause wether i stay or leave they‚Äôre gonna bitch anyways.

2072,JBgreen,1615628234,1,"It's strange. I used to go out for three days at a time, spending money , drinking, laughing, fucking. A lot of -ings really. Pain was never a thing I thought about, sleep was never a necessity it just sort of happened when it needed to. Anxiety wasn't a reality I was really ever familiar with.   

Cocaine was my best friend, my best friends were my brothers, and my family was third tier at the BEST of times.  But it was all by design, keep those things separate, don't mix ""work"" with ""family"". Work was pleasure, 24/7 when I was young. 

Right now I feel it. 20 years later, I feel it all acutely. I spend most, if not all of my time alone. I hear or see people carelessly talk or post regarding being depressed, or on anxiety, or blame a few hours of lost sleep on insomnia. I hear about their so called pain and it angers me. I am bitter, by my own design of course, because I remember when none of that was real. 

And when I hear the talk I want to take them and MAKE them feel the pain or the anxiety, or experience real abysmal insomnia, where death is almost preferable. I think to myself, if you felt the real thing you'd have offed yourself a long time ago. I haven't because I am not fucking done. My body is betraying me. My WILL is strong. My body is falling apart. How do I even explain?

My brain is a muscle, and it hurts. That's where it all starts, obviously. Years ago I met a girl who absolutely ruined me in the most wonderful and devastating ways. Before here those things that hurt and haunt me were non-existent. She slowly changed me, made me stop the drugs, the booze, the week long benders. I gladly stopped because believe me when I say she was worth it.

Weird things happen mentally and physically when you go from hardcore drug fueled partying to absolute stop. Just like it sounds. A wall that I never saw all of a sudden took me down, an unstoppable force in me, meets an immovable object. Imagine it. A human body, the strongest minds, no one could ever be prepared for that. I wasn't.  Sadly neither was she. 

I broke. My body gave out, my mind cracked, it wasn't a peaceful experience, it was worlds colliding, what was left of me. I was strong. I held it together by the tips of my fingers, and tried to appear outwardly okay. I was not. I don't know when she sensed it, but I do know once she did that her love for me, her through thick and thin and forever love, it started to fade...it was slow and drawn out and I commend her for putting up with the pain that I put her through because I didn't know how to handle what was happening to me. 

I know that no one else would ever have put up with what I put her through. She did love me. I hurt her so much, and she couldn't take it anymore...I remember the moment it ended. 

The entire year leading up to the end, it was hell on earth. I said before no one else would have stayed and held me, helped me....and in truth no one did. my brothers were gone, one had died on me, the other scarred had run back to his own real family, and me, I stayed with her. My own real family didn't know what was happening, by design I always left them in the dark.

 Hell, actual, true hell. and  there was her, and there was me. I had never felt fear, I was always fearless, I remember having rifles to my head,, or driving through a border patrol check-point with 200lbs of cocaine just sitting in the trunk of a rental and I was never afraid. That year it came to me, the fear, i felt her slipping away and for the first time i was afraid. 

How to explain it in words that do it justice?

I don't know who said it or where it was said, I am sure if someone even reads this they can educate me, but there's a famous quote about staring into the abyss and it staring back at you. Imagine that. For an eternity that abyss for me was comfort, it steeled my resolve. Because nothing ever stared back. 

When I felt her, physically felt her slipping away, it  opened it's eyes, it looked at, into, through me...and it laughed. A laugh that crumbled the walls around me, and in that quick instant I knew, and understood fear.  Because  love, the love I never understood till her, the one she  gave me, it was slipping...and the fear shook me, and tore my body and my mind and reality itself. Through it she held me. 

One day, it was December 2008.  I want to say 18th, but at this point the year and day were not registering in my mind. I was on the floor, the pain and fear pulling me in opposing directions, I was crying. She called. it ALWAYS helped, although less and less by this time..but it was never worse when she called...always better... not this time..nothing had changed..not really.. 

BUT I FELT IT. it was the last straw,, it was a sheer drop off of a cliff into absolutely nothing. I don't pretend to be the only person to ever feel it, but I really hope not a lot of you have. A literal ending. Something that existed in the world suddenly ceasing to exist. I think it was in one of the star wars films when one of the jedi (im not looking it up) said that he felt as if a billion (sic) voices had suddenly been silenced. 

That's what it was. Love existed, then, by my own design....I strung some word together that I will regret till the day I die, and she said ok, and I hung up, and  I died. 

It sounds do dramatic doesn't it. I died. How would I even know, I had never died before so what could I compare it to? I don't know really to be perfectly frank. But when the phone fell, and her voice, and her presence was just gone from me, there was quite suddenly an empty space, and in that split second, the abyss, the laughing staring abyss took up residence in that hole. And I died. If I didn't I wish I had.

The PROFOUND grief I felt for what was lost...in all honesty I wish that I could turn back time and trade my life for someone else...die before I ever met her...I would give all my remaining days to live the next 24 hours without the memory of her. 

4 days. I lay on the floor, crying, there were 400 missed calls. i ignored. It was her, my mother, my brother....spam calls, life doesn't stop because one person dies. Only that persons life. And it did. for 4 days. I didn't go sit in a chair, or lie in bed, no I didn't move from where I had perished, curled up in a fetal position and I just wanted death. I felt her sweet embrace....she came and sat with me and I was gone...but 4 days passed and there I was. the phone ringing, knocks on the door, texts, emails, blah blah. 

I was filled with a living void, eating away at me, I had pissed myself, I hadn't eaten, it slipped my mind to eat my gun, or I know I probably wouldn't have been able to stop myself, not in the state i was in, not like so many times since...

We talked. But it wasn't her. she was gone, when I died, she died too. We died and in that devouring void, those corpses are not coming back...The girl I knew was dead. I would never feel LOWER...but for years now the only real progress has been lateral movement, I can't remember the sun. 

Pain. I feel it. imagine molten lava flowing through your veins, and imagine it being electrified. That's the physical pain I feel. The initial crash that toppled me I think created this pain..i take many meds, none help. It never stops and I deserve it. Don't I?

Sleep. I take cocktails of melatonin, seroquel, ambien, etc etc...sometimes I don't sleep for days, sometimes I sleep so much I piss myself and trigger welfare checks from my family. 

Anxiety. lean back in your chair. Keep leaning...lean so far back that you almost fall...now imagine that just as you are about to fall and you feel your fight for flight reflex kick in you are zapped with a taser...that is how I feel, all the time. ALL the time. 

I want to be better. For the girl I lost in that void. I can't say half of me died that day, it isn't true. All of me died. We both disappeared into that hole..except a part of me still remembers them...still sees their ghosts. I am haunted...I know she doesn't see them...I am glad she doesn't.

 I want to die, to remove myself from this place where I have knowledge of them, what they were, what they had..what he killed.....I miss her so much. 

There's a lot more I want to say...I just don't have the patience to type it out right now..I may or may not do it in the future...there's a lot of shit re: sleep that I need to say..",Anxiety,I can't hardly sleep no more..,2021-03-13 20:37:14

Never posted here before but here we go.

I have such a hard time talking to people, I don‚Äôt know where to look as I‚Äôm talking. I want to make eye contact to show I‚Äôm listening but I don‚Äôt want to stare and scare the person. So I just ping pong back and forth between awkwardly staring and awkwardly avoiding all eye contact. 

This problem is especially bad with girls. I‚Äôm terrified to talk to them because I don‚Äôt want to stare them in the eye and creep them out. I am also terrified of looking at their breasts. It‚Äôs something I actively avoid and try everything in my power to show them I‚Äôm not doing. But in the end I still feel like they think I‚Äôm a creep who‚Äôs objectifying them and that they think I‚Äôm a pervert.

It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I avoid talking to my mom whenever I can. No I don‚Äôt find my mom attractive (ew). But I‚Äôm still terrified that she thinks I‚Äôm staring at her breasts and thinks I‚Äôm a disgusting human being and a horrible son. 


After any interaction with a girl I feel mentally and physically drained and just hate myself regardless of how the interaction went. I think they hate me and they think I‚Äôm a perv.

Most of the time I just keep to myself and pretend I‚Äôm doing something on my phone, but I try to listing to what people around me are saying. Idk if people are actually saying things about me but I always hear them talking about me and it‚Äôs always the worst case scenario.

2083,throwawaydiode,1615622173,1,"I recently finished my bachelor's and am currently trying to get into a university in my gf's country but I just have terrible grades. 
I enjoy my major a lot and am really good at it but unfortunately, my grades haven't been the best until recently. 

Due to a lot of trouble I had with anxiety, depression and other mental health issues and hell lot of exam anxiety, I never really did well in my exams. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 11/12 and it kept getting worse.

I tried my best to showcase my interest in this field but obviously, grades are everything. I feel terrible that I've been nothing but a good student all my life and throughout my bachelor's but I still struggle with grades. Unfortunately, my bachelor's university only considered final/semester exam grades and assignments and other stuff didn't have any value so I basically had no chance to display my passion academically. However, I have done a few internships and worked at a place related to my field and all of them have loved my work. 

Now, I've found the perfect course for myself. It's everything I've ever wanted to focus on. The university isn't a top 10 university and I'm okay with it. I just love the course, it's structure and how much they value assignments and stuff you do on a daily basis. 

The problem is that their range for grades is 70%-100%. My subject specific grades are 73% but my overall grades are like 65%. The work I've done simultaneously in my field during my bachelor's won't be given as much value because they don't want a CV so yeah. 

I had convinced myself it was gonna be okay until my gf asked me what their range for acceptance was what was my GPA. Ever since then I've been shattered. It hit me like a train that I'm never going to get into that university and I was just setting myself and everyone up for disappointment. I am so close to applying but now I feel worthless and I wish I could do something about it.

Need to vent. Disregard this post if you don‚Äôt care.

The last 2-3 years have been interesting, to say the least. My mental state has progressively gotten worse as I approach new lows I previously thought unreachable.

Two years ago, I made an attempt on my life. The method I was working with was asphyxiation via hanging. The consequence of this was losing consciousness and waking up about two minutes later, I distinctly remember being tingly on the right side of my body.

After my failed attempt, I went to sleep. I thought that was it, I had finally mentally broke, but no, not yet. When I woke up for school that morning I did not have much concern for my safety. I popped quite a few xannies, and made my way onto the bus. Reaching school I managed to cop a bottle of strong liquor off of an ‚Äúacquaintance‚Äù, I drank the entire thing. What I did after that I do not actually remember, I only have information from what my peers told me, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important so I‚Äôm going to continue on. From that incident I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance where I was treated. I was punished with suspension and probation. My intention with this incident was not directly suicide, like I mentioned earlier I just didn‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Probation didn‚Äôt teach me anything. Not totally sure if it‚Äôs supposed to but I assume it is because I had to attend these dumbass classes where I met kids more fucked up than me. Might I say, those classes seem like a good way for druggie teenagers to network amongst each other.  This period in which I was on probation had me feeling more depressed, because I learned when I returned  from my suspension to school no one gave a shit or asked me how I was doing. My ‚Äú friends ‚Äú thought I was cool for a week before they found me boring again and slowly stopped talking to me, and when I say slowly stopped talking to me I don‚Äôt mean I was kicked out of the group or anything. I still sat at lunch with them, walked down the halls with them, what I mean is they just ignored me because I don‚Äôt have much of value to say. 

Once I was off probation the school year was up. I decided to go fully online the upcoming year, which grade-wise, turned out to be a good decision.

Over the summer a couple of things had happened which affected my mental state some more:

- caught my mother trying to commit suicide
- friends completely stop talking to me
- assaulted, incident handled with police

After that eventful summer, I got a new living situation and a part-time job. I ended up quitting the part-time job after only a couple of months because I‚Äôm a little bitch who can‚Äôt handle stress. Then COVID hit, I get another new living situation, and a new part-time job, which I‚Äôm now thinking about quitting. I‚Äôm at the lowest point I‚Äôve been. The cognitive decline has been awful, you can read my previous posts on r/anhedonia for a little more insight into that if you‚Äôre curious. I have no friends anymore. My reputation among family and those who know me is ruined. Nothing satisfies me or brings me happiness anymore.

Ive tried using sounds (mostly rain lol) when i had covid and was anxious about that to calm me down, which sort of worked, but not much, and now im using distractions to... distract myself, but its always there at the back of my mind. How do other people cope? I know its a common thing and many people have it and survive, but sometimes it just feels so awful. I hate it.

I dont even know how i got anxious this time, i wasnt really scared about much, but i know that sometimes anxiety can build up without you knowing. The closest thing i can tie it to is me reading a couple fanfics that include real life people (nothing romantic, if anyones wondering. Imagine shipping real people) going through serious problems (death, grief, etc), and so i guess i was unconsciously scared that what happened actually affected said people. But what i read all had very heavy fantasy elements to it and the problems they faced were 100% tied to those fictional elements, they wouldve never happened in real life. So why am i scared? Is that even what caused it?

At this point im just ranting, but even writing this has made me feel a bit better. What has helped for any of you? Is there anything you use to take your mind off things?

2108,RepresentativeNo3605,1615612360,1,"Hello everybody, I really need help or reassurance because I‚Äôm pretty scared / nervous right now.

I have OCD but not on medication, it‚Äôs the kind of OCD that genuinely makes me feel like I‚Äôve got something wrong with me even if I‚Äôm completely right. 

I‚Äôve always suffered with anxiety, but I‚Äôve ALWAYS found a way to deal with it, and I would be relatively fine in an hour or few anyway. Last night I had the worst experience ever though, I‚Äôm not sure if it was a panic attack due to my anxiety or what but I was extremely exhausted due to a messed up sleeping pattern, my girlfriend came over and we went shopping at around 5-6 PM, I remember walking around the shops and I was SO tired I could barely keep my eyes open. When I got home this is when the attack happened, it‚Äôs extremely hard to describe but I almost felt not real, it was genuinely the most terrifying thing ever; so bad I even called my dad (I‚Äôm a student). I can‚Äôt even describe the dread and fear, I just felt so empty, it‚Äôs never happened before.

Anyway, he calms me down and I go back to my room, I manage to stay awake watching a film and I was SO tired I fell asleep 3 times during it for like 5-10 minutes. I felt relatively ‚Äònormal‚Äô again when back in my room and was at the stage where I could only think about what just happened.

Anyway, I get to sleep at about half 10, exhausted I think I‚Äôll sleep like a baby but I just woke up at half 4 AM - still dark, and I woke up with that same dread, I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô at all, and I‚Äôve started worrying again.

The only thing I can think of to describe it is if you‚Äôve ever had a bad dream and you feel extremely ‚Äòempty‚Äô and a weird stomach feeling for maybe 10 minutes? Like you feel so weird, it‚Äôs kind of like that, I feel empty and I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll be like this forever.

I guess it might just be because it‚Äôs never happened before or a variety of different factors, the last time I had a major anxiety / panic attack it was because I geniunely believed I had gone schizophrenic and was hearing voices, but it was a different kind of anxiety which I‚Äôve always had - different to this which scares me. The thing is, that also was typical and lasted an hour or so and I was completely fine and this just still makes me feel extremely weird.

Has anyone got any advice for me? I legit don‚Äôt know what to do, it‚Äôs like it was such a bad experience I keep thinking about it and when I do I have that ‚Äòsick‚Äô feeling in my stomach, it‚Äôs kind of looming and yea, it‚Äôs horrible. Any advice or comfort especially would be greatly appreciated tbh because this is the worst.

Also, it‚Äôs still dark out, I said this to my dad the only time I ever get anxious or bad anxiety / panic is at night which is why I always feel completely fine the next morning, it‚Äôs not light but my anxiety is through the roof at 5 in the morning because I just don‚Äôt feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô at all.",Anxiety,"Guys, what is wrong with me?",2021-03-13 16:12:40

However, a few years ago, a specific event at school began triggering an intense response from me. 

The dreaded fire drill. 

It started when I was in second grade. We had a random drill during the day and it startled me, and I began wondering when the next one would be, because it scared me. This led to me being constantly on edge whenever the weather was nice outside, and even determining ""Danger zones"" during the times that drills were most common. 

I would look for fire alarms and strategically position myself away from them. If the classroom door was open and the alarm was mounted in the hall, I would find a way to close the door and hope nobody would notice. 

I even tried exposure therapy and listened to alarms on YouTube, but all it did was make it worse. The sound got stuck in my head and I was even more  on edge. 

In 7th grade I had had enough and went to the counselor for help, but there wasn't much they could do. They tried telling me when the drill would be, but that only made it worse. Once they tried letting me go outside before a drill, and that helped immensely, but my friends found out and gave me crap for that for a few months. 

I'll try to give you a rundown of what happens when I suspect that there will be a fire drill:

First, my mind registers my suspicion and I constantly glance at the alarm, but fear that if I look at it, that it will go off, so I look down and try to discreetly move away from the alarm. 

Then, if my suspicion gets even more intense (i.e. i hear a teacher say that there may be a drill), my heart begins to race and I want nothing more than to run away and get out of the building. I have trouble staying still and often resort to nervous ticks to keep me from having a breakdown. Friends have also said my breathing gets heavy and uneven. 

Now, in my new school, the fire alarms are mounted directly over my head in every class. And I have no idea what to do about it. It was one thing when the alarm was outside of the wall, but now it's directly over my head and I know its going to drive me crazy. And only a couple of my friends know about this phobia, so I don't have much of a support group, either. 

If anyone out there has something similar, how do you deal with it? Everything I've tried has failed to work and I was wondering if there were any techniques that may work.

Here‚Äôs some places it happened: 

I just moved to a new school and whenever I went into every new room, the teacher would introduce me to the class and my face would get really hot, and my eyes would sting and they would start to water. Some kids asked why I‚Äôm crying. 

The thing is I‚Äôm not crying, and it‚Äôs not like tears of fear or what not. It‚Äôs just something that happens to me.

Another example is when I was at my old school. A kid was being bullied and I went up to them and called out the kid that was picking on another. My face instantly felt warm and my eyes probably looks really glossy. The situation turned out fine though.

Last example is when I talked to someone new.

2144,TchaikenNugget,1615603656,1,"So, I've been having a really, really rough day. I live on a university campus for most of the week (I go home on weekends) and everything is online. Social events, classes, even therapy, which really feels counterproductive. I've been getting extremely depressed and hardly any of my friends live in the area, and the ones that do are as stressed and busy as I am, so I don't see them much, either. My anxiety gets really, really bad whenever I have to talk to people I don't know, so I can't really reach out and make friends. I've always had anxiety, but I also have an extroverted personality (I know, yikes), so as much as talking to new people is difficult, I need people in my life to avoid depression. I've lost all interest in my hobbies, and not being around people for so long has only heightened my anxiety whenever I talk to anyone new. I hardly have any opportunities to talk to people, so when I do, I'm extra conscious of everything and usually end up avoiding people as a result. 

The only thing that really kept me afloat was the library on campus. I'm really into learning and research, so it was nice to have somewhere to go that wasn't online where I could surround myself with books that interested me. I didn't have to worry about talking to anyone, but I could give myself some fulfillment by reading. I tried going today, only to find at least 80% of my favourite section being cleared out. I asked a volunteer what was going on, and she said the books were going into storage for an indeterminate amount of time, but they could be checked out online. And I know because of safety precautions with the pandemic and all that, it's the smart thing to do, so I shouldn't complain, but I've been really depressed over that today because that was the one thing I could actually go to and actually feel okay. I don't want to be all, ""books are my only friends!"" because that's 1) not true and 2) really weird, but what is true is that was the best substitute for social interaction I actually had, and now that it's gone, I don't know what I'll do. Online events feel pointless, I don't have many friends, and I'm just barely managing to get all my schoolwork done on time (last semester, I usually got it all done a few days before the deadline, and I had an even bigger workload then, on top of a job), so there's really nothing here for me anymore.

As if things couldn't get worse, I just got a snapchat from a friend from high school (let's say ""Alex""). The video was of her and a mutual friend hanging out, who I'm really close with. Said friend (let's say ""Gary"") moved out really far away, while ""Alex"" is still in our area, so it really, really hurt to see this without me having any idea Gary was in town, especially since I've felt so isolated. I'm feeling sort of mad at Alex, but it's really not her fault. She doesn't know how I'm feeling, but it hurts to see two of your friends doing *anything* without you when you're this alone. I just left her on read because I didn't know how to respond, but at this point, I'm just feeling absolutely shattered and excluded. I wouldn't have had a problem with it at all if my anxiety and depression weren't at their peak, but as of now, it feels extremely, albeit unintentionally, insulting. And with the whole thing about the library, I'm still worrying about the future because going forward, I don't know how I'm going to spend my time without any friends or anywhere I can go. I feel this is also causing my grades to slip, and I'm just really, really scared.",Anxiety,I don't know what to do anymore.,2021-03-13 13:47:36

I get incredibly anxious and even have panic attacks if messages are left on read or I read too deeply into them. This has been happening since last year after I left a very toxic relationship (my ex would degrade me and mentally abuse me if I wasn‚Äôt talking to him all the time or constantly working on losing weight) and many friends have come forward and told me this behavior is dangerous and toxic. I‚Äôm working with a therapist and this all stems from not loving myself and having 0 confidence with being alone. We decided to take the medication route and I‚Äôm currently on anti depressants and will be starting anti anxiety medication on Monday.

What hurts the most is the person I was very interested in recently asked for space from me because I clung to him and he took the full force of this toxic mentality. As much as he loves our friendship and wanting to explore more, he can‚Äôt emotionally handle me at this time and finds it best that I take time to focus on myself. I‚Äôve been told multiple times to focus on myself and work through this anxiety to become happy and independent but I always find myself falling back into that behavior. I‚Äôve tried quitting social media apps, distancing myself from friends, and exercising and it‚Äôs very hard to break this cycle of negative behavior. I just want to constantly smother my friends and overwhelm them every day. I know this behavior is dangerous but the feelings and thoughts are constantly buzzing in my head and I have no peace until I either give in or find something else to worry about. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose my friends and I want to become a happier person but this is such a major struggle trying to overcome this anxiety. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm now on anti depressants to help me sleep because I‚Äôm up at all hours of the night worrying.

2158,anprettycoolguy,1615600298,1,"**TL;DR - I feel like I'm in a constant adrenaline rush. Things that elevate my adrenaline, including light exercise, exacerbate my existing adrenaline and make me have panic attacks. DAE have this issue? Any tips?**

I'm going through a big anxiety episode this week. These only tend to last a few weeks, so the below is not indicative of my normal state, only my state when highly anxious.

My anxiety tends to manifest itself as what feels like a constant adrenaline surge. A whole host of other physical issues often come, but the adrenaline is my main complaint right now. The only true relief I get is when I'm asleep, and in the few glorious minutes before and after sleep. I feel like I'm almost constantly on the verge of a panic attack and, while it does ebb and flow throughout the day, it's always present to a degree, no matter what I do. I try lying in bed with the lights low and music playing, deep breathing exercises, talking to people, therapy, drinking water, eating, not eating. Nothing seems to work.

So I figure, a little exercise is a good way to burn some excess adrenaline, right? Well, turns out it just seems to make me feel worse. By the time I'm back inside from a brisk walk, my adrenaline is higher than ever and takes almost an hour to come down from ""there is a bear in your room"" to the former level of ""there could be a bear in your room in five minutes."" Sometimes just the first minute of exercise is enough to push my chemical and cardiological state to the point of having a panic attack, so I go back inside and try not to hyperventilate.

This applies to more than just exercise (e.g. watching suspenseful tv show, getting very excited, etc), but I specifically mention it because exercise is a good thing. I want to be able to exercise to help myself recover and feel like myself again, but this feels like a huge roadblock. I can normally exercise without any issues (aside from being a bit out of shape), but during anxiety episodes it blows up in my face.

Does anyone else have this same struggle? Are there any tips you can recommend for overcoming it?",Anxiety,Adrenaline -&gt; Anxiety -&gt; Exercise -&gt; More Adrenaline -&gt; More Anxiety,2021-03-13 12:51:38

2165,Newbie959,1615597747,1,"Hi everybody

Just before I start ranting, this is my first post to reddit ever. If I make any mistakes please let me know and I'll fix it asap. Also, if mods or anyone else think that this post does not belong in this subreddit, let me know and I'll take it down (or you can take it down, I backed it up elsewhere). I checked the rules before-hand, but I might have missed something.

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I'll start with some background: I am a 22 year old male with some pretty extreme anxiety I never got diagnosed (at least, it was extreme for me) as well as some OCD tendencies. Generally, everything in live creates anxiety for me. writing emails, talking to others, filling out forms, passing in homework (a huge one for me lol), my unhealthy lifestyle, if I am close enough to my parents, that message I sent through discord, that semi-sarcastic sentence I said to my classmate that they laughed at (and objectively, I doubt was really offensive), and much, much more. 

I have actually made progress on my anxiety from when I was younger on my own, and at least portray a calm-exterior for the people around me now. It used to be intense: If I was the last person to open the deep-freeze (which was two floors down from my room), I would have to go down before bed and look at the rim for like 5-20 minutes to make sure its closed properly, I used to have to count 13-18 important objects in my room before bed, etc. I worked on it, and dealt with them to the point where I feel little anxiety about it now.  I worked through it by facing the fears (or ignoring them in the case of the freezer) and got rid of most of the associated anxiety.

I guess the issue right now is that I am somewhat stuck in what to do about my anxiety. I have tried everything from journaling to mindfulness (and other meditations) and cannot seem to find a good fix on my own. I had tried and loved counselling at my old university but never got back into it after, and I am worried about paying for counselling and finding a good counsellor (its not necessarily a money issue, I just hate spending money I guess lol. Never know when you'll need extra money). I have always sort of vented to my mother about my anxiety, but I think she is sick of it and sort of just ignores it now (which I don't necessary blame her, if somebody came up to you worried if the freezer was closed every night looking for you to say yes to reassure themselves, you might get sick of it as well). I thought maybe venting to reddit would help lol, so here I am now.

The situation that really put me over the top today (which led me to making a new email and this reddit account) is with regards to my internship placement. As part of my program I am in right now (a human resource program) we have to do an internship after the course is over. I worked my ass off finding and contacting different places thanks to Covid-19 restrictions, and finally landed a good position at a stellar company (and they even want to pay me for my internship :D). I was filling out a personal information form today, finished filling it out, checked it over like 5 times as usual, and passed it in. After passing it in I redownloaded it and read it a few more times, and noticed some errors in this form (one super large error). One error that was sort of small was I missed my province in one of the fields, and only put my city. This set me right off and I went off to vent to my mother, who sort of just blew it off. Its not really a big deal objectively as they can easily infer I am from the area. The second error, which really threw me off, was that I missed the entire second page where the emergency contact is supposed to go. I freaked out and went upstairs, it led to a small fight with my mother, and I went back downstairs. I dealt with it as I should, emailed my contact asking what I should do as well as providing the emergency contact info through email. But now I wonder if she will stop the hiring process over this dumb little mistake and will be worried for a while (objectively I know it would be stupid to stop the hiring process over a dumb little form, as they already spent money and time accepting me, but it still doesn't stop the worries I have over it). 

And I guess that's why I am here now. This is just another attempt by me to lessen my anxieties at least a little. I know objectively I am doing well in life: I don't drink, don't do drugs, get good grades, have been working and volunteering since early teens, I haven't killed anyone, and I haven't destroyed the world. But these anxieties and little mistakes ramp up so much that it makes me feel like a loser almost constantly, and I am not sure what to do anymore.

Anyways thanks to whoever read this for listening to my rant. This is my first time ever doing something like this (I don't even use social media of any sort, let alone post a long personal rant like this lol) but have been lurking a long time. It sort of felt good to let it all out for the internet to see. I know i'll feel anxiety about this post after I post this, but I want to try something new.

I wanted to get phizer cause my gf got that one but j and j sounded safe and good too. Ever since I made the appointment I was scared of side effects or future side effects or it killing me. Everyday I would look up online the j and j vaccine and to see if its safe. All I find is good news thats its passing and who has deemed it safe.

      So last night I had so much anxiety and was feeling ill. Today in the morning I went to the appointment and took my girlfriend to be there for me.

All the nurses were worried and people who got vaccinated they were all trying to calm me down and I told them it was a panic attack. I left after I felt better enough but still shaken.

I‚Äôm a non-binary person in my 30s. I‚Äôve had moderate to severe anxiety/agoraphobia/derealization for ten years now. My symptoms began in February of 2011. I was taking benzodiazepines recreationally, and I withdrew from them without tapering. At the time I didn‚Äôt know you were supposed to. Over the course of three days I hallucinated, cried, and begged my family to bring me to the hospital for treatment; they finally relented after I experienced several seizures. I was put on a month-long taper of xanax. After finishing the taper, I began to experience derealization and extremely severe panic attacks, precipitated by nothing I could determine. The panic attacks led, as they often do, so agoraphobia. 
Long story shorter, I‚Äôve dealt with daily derealization from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep for ten years since then. I no longer consume drugs, alcohol, or caffeine. I don‚Äôt really have panic attacks anymore because I don‚Äôt go anywhere, really. I need to get treatment but I have no idea of how to go about doing this as I can‚Äôt go to a doctor‚Äôs office. The strength and duration of my panic attacks, when I have them, has put me off even trying to go anywhere. I used to be very active. I long to walk around my city again. The general consensus from therapists I‚Äôve spoken to is ‚ÄúYou have to just get over it and go‚Äù but I really and truly cannot do this.

I would describe myself as somebody who was socially awkward coming into college, but I've enjoyed being more social and just myself as my communication skills have improved.

Now, the thoughts aren't debilitating by any means, and I like to think that nobody around me thinks I'm crazy. But they just don't feel like anything I should be thinking as a normal person. It doesn't stem from anything I can think of, so I feel like I'm just gaslighting myself more than anything else.

To describe the thoughts, it's best to start off with a question. What's keeping me from acting out in public? Social norms and expectations. But I could easily just subvert those if I felt like it. The earliest I remember having these thoughts was around my third year of college.

I'd get anxious in lectures. Knowing that I could just stand up and start acting like a wild ape hopped up on speed had me itching. Fuck, it felt like I'd do it if I didn't tell myself not to. A conscious effort to redirect my thoughts to something else would usually keep me ground in reality. However, some of the things I picture myself doing didn't feel normal at all.

Just chilling in line and a police officer is in the store? Make sure to remind yourself not to try to swipe their gun or tackle them.

We're all only one impulse decision away from ruining the rest of our lives. So don't fuck up.

I haven't really figured out a good way to train myself to avoid these things. I've heard something similar when you're driving down the road and just wonder what it would be like to swerve into the next oncoming car.  I think it was dubbed ""the call of the grave"" or something.

I've gotten good at suppressing this to only an internal dilemma when in public, and I can usually come up with a good excuse for anything weird someone notices. 

But if somebody does manage to catch a glimpse of something weird I do, I can usually come up with a good excuse to brush it off as something trivial.

Is it normal to create your own intrusive thoughts about your fears??

So for example I‚Äôll have a what if thought about a future event so say tonight when I‚Äôm in my bed I‚Äôll think ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm lying in my bed and I think what if i start to think people are watching me, listening to me‚Äù this creates anxiety about a situation that I might not do when I‚Äôm lying In my bed.

2204,cv0102,1615583802,1,"Hi Im new to this sub and was wondering if anyone else would be able to help me out. About a few weeks ago I started getting sharp pains in my left side but just brushed it off as those are normal for everyone from time to time. But as time went on the pains started turning into a constant pressure that would effect my left side and center of my chest. It got to the point that there were a few times I genuinely thought I might be having a heart attack amd wanted to go to the ER. But i was able to push through these episodes. First off though, I am a hypochondriac on a sense. One time I found a lump under my armpit and was petrified it was cancer to the point of tears, only for it to be a cyst after a doctors appointment and an ultrasound. But I talked to my parents about the chest pain (Im 19) and they were certain its just stress amd anxiety. This went on for about 2.5 weeks before i was able to get a doctors appointment. He was pretty thorough, my regular is good like that. He performed an EKG and said everything was fine and diagnosed me with Acute Stress Disorder amd panic disorder. I felt fine for the rest of the day after the appointment. But then the next day, i started to get the same pressure and its been going on constantly for a couple of days now. Im trying to cope with it just being anxiety and that I need to calm down, but its not working. Its made my life hell for the past month almost. Its hard to work all day and just deal with the pains, its hard to hang out with friends, the only time I feel somewhat safe and comfortable is when Im in my own home with my parents downstairs.

It's a word you, unfortunately, hear all the time in the modern world and I've always been perplexed by this increasingly common malady. In the judgmental aspect of my brain, particularly being raised by an anxious mother, there was always something quite wimpy and pathetic  about people complaining about their ""anxiiietyyyy"", but I guess karma bit me in the ass because now, I'm sitting here having a panic attack as I type this.

December 2019: Hot date with this gorgeous guy. Got kinda drunk, had an amazing time, went home, binged on a ton of Krispy Kreme and went to sleep feeling great (albeit bloated). That day, I was ludicrously sleep-deprived and had obviously had too much sugar and alcohol, and for whatever reason, my body just couldn't handle it and I awoke to THE most horrendous feeling. My god. Shaking \*violently\* (in fact, one could describe it as spasming), unable to speak, blurred vision, a nightmarish heavy, floaty head-feeling, unbelievable nausea (dear lord, worse than ANY nausea). An unshakeable feeling that I was DYING - I genuinely f\*\*king thought, I don't know, that I was having some sort of stroke/heart attack/aneurysm or that I was poisoned or something. 

It felt, vividly, as if the world was a dark, awful place as this unrelenting wave of thick, heavy, obscuring depression and fear loomed all around me. ""Sad"" or ""scared"" is not a word to describe how horrible it was. My - ordinarily happy, effervescent - brain mulled over how relieving it would be to die or to kill myself to be away from this terrible, meaningless existence, which is antithetical to how I usually am! I have never been suicidal.

This PERSUASIVE alarm in my mind blared at me to seek emergency medical attention immediately because I am DYING.

Hell on earth is how I'd describe the feeling, as dramatic as it sounds.

I called an ambulance, the paramedics arrive swiftly. In dealing with me, they have obviously dealt with this many times before. They monitor my vitals and they quickly determine that it was just a panic attack.

From that day forward, I am now ""someone who has panic attacks"" - something I never thought I'd say. A concept from which I've always been far removed.

Humbling is the word I'd use to describe the experience. It makes me feel so fragile, small, and destructible. It puts everything into perspective. All judgment for others melts away. Looking ""down"" on people is difficult to do when you feel more ""down"" than you can imagine.

After the attack, I immediately felt ""Oh my god... THIS is a panic attack? THIS is what people are just living with?"". Suddenly, I felt visceral empathy for the ""drippy"" anxious people I've judged.

It's strange how my life has - at the risk of viewing things cynically - been cleaved into a before and after in how anxiety has always been a foreign concept and now it's simply something I live with and something which renders me incapable on a regular basis.

But I am just now making little victories with my anxiety as I‚Äôve struggled with it over the years. The most significant victory for me thus far, is identifying signs an episode is looming / exact symptoms. And they are as follows, with no real order:

Pre- episode signs / symptoms :

* very, very intense appetite. Eating rampage level 
* listening to certain songs repeatedly, with certain points of said songs repeated on higher volumes 
* mildly shaky hands , inability to focus / concentrate 
* repeatedly touching my hair, beard , leg , face 
* sensitivity to tone-of-voice 
* insomnia 
* racing thoughts 
* fight or flight reaction on standby 
* ringy ears 
* zoning out 

Actual episode symptoms :

* unusual amount of energy, drive and focus 
* little to no verbal communication desired ( exceptions are text, sign language and body expressions) 
* appetite can go from heavy to dead in a matter of seconds 
* heightened sensitivity to tone of voice, changes in weather and surroundings 
* staring off into the distance to the point of unawareness 
* constant need to touch something ( table, handrail, etc etc )
* OCD is hyper 
* heavy focus on white noise ( fan, things like that) 
* delayed responses to texts / calls 

Post- episode :

Just general feeling of tired , little to no motivation and minimal energy level.

Outside of some close friends, I struggle to let anyone into my life, the fewer people around the fewer that can hurt me right?  Nevertheless, I really tried this time, and I fell for her hard.  

Within a few weeks of talking and date-kinda-things, we were a couple and I was happy, when we were together I felt like I could finally take that deep breath I'd been meaning to for years. Even in public, I was better than I was before with her by my side.

Everything was great for around a month, I could probably pinpoint the exact night that I felt things turned sour.  I've been over that night a thousand times in my head and can't see what went wrong.

From this point, she decided she wanted to see me a lot less without really giving a reason.  I know there were some mental health problems and they probably had an impact.  We had a couple of brief arguments about the amount we saw each other, at one point I asked to see her at least twice a week which she couldn't commit to, despite her only working day shifts. For about a month I felt like I didn't exist to her.

I felt more and more like she just didn't want to be with me because who wouldn't?  For days at a time, I'd get really short responses and the odd glimmer of hope that she still loved me, but looking back I don't think she ever did.

She called me one night and said she wanted to focus on her new job and herself and a relationship would put too much pressure on that.  

That rocked me and I felt physically sick, my arms went numb as did my legs.

I made a point during the call to tell her I was going to remove her from all of my socials, I said seeing her with someone else would be really tough on me.  She took this the wrong way and blocked me on everything,

I didn't sleep that night, I couldn't sit still the next day.  At about 6pm I went for a drive, I drove for about 3 hours aimlessly around my town. Eventually, I went to see her. I needed some closure. 

We spoke, and every second was painful.  I could hear her neighbours listening but at that moment I had tunnel vision and continued talking.

I asked her for another chance, tried to make my case, I don't know why I put so much effort into this.

Since that talk, we haven't spoken.  

Since that talk, I am deathly petrified of running into her, even if the chances are very low.

Since that talk, I can't breathe in public anymore.

I visited a local store this evening and my chest has never felt so tight, even before her. 

This shouldn't have knocked me down so much.

2254,killerlime,1615567908,1,"So I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as I can without leaving out the important details. I found a new job and put in a notice at the beginning of the month to the daycare I‚Äôve been working at for over a year. While I did like the job itself, the management and pay was not the best. I found a nice family to nanny for now and when I put in my notice to the director of the daycare she was kind and said she was sad to see me go but happy for me as well. I gave them a three week notice and had every intention of finishing out that notice since I won‚Äôt start nannying till the end of the month anyways. 

A few days after I put in my notice, the HR woman comes up to me and in a not-so-friendly tone asks me where I am going. I told her I was going to nanny for a family. She huffed and accused me of breaking the non-compete contract I signed when I started (stating I cannot work for any daycares in a certain radius after 30 days of quitting). I said I thought that only applied to daycares and that I will be nannying. She then said ‚Äúwell you can‚Äôt steal parents from our center either.‚Äù I told her I am not stealing any parents, I am nannying for first time parents who have never been to a center before. She rolled her eyes and the conversation was over. It made me pretty upset but by the next day I was feeling better about it. I only had a small amount of time left with these people anyways. 

The next day I come to work and my coworker says she needs to talk to me. She tells me the HR woman went around and asked people where I was ‚Äúactually going‚Äù and why I was leaving. Now I‚Äôm not a lawyer but I do believe it is illegal for her to talk to my coworkers about me. It made me pretty upset and I no longer felt comfortable working at the center. I don‚Äôt like to be accused of things I didn‚Äôt do and I certainly don‚Äôt like to be talked about when I‚Äôm not present. 

Over the weekend I decided I would not be going back to that kind of work environment. I sent a long email to the director telling her everything that happened with the HR woman and that I decided I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable coming back to work. She told me that my story didn‚Äôt add up and that it couldn‚Äôt be true. I emailed back and said it was true and that I would not be back. She told me I can pick up my final check Friday afternoon (today) from the HR office. 

Well all week I‚Äôve been incredibly anxious. I‚Äôve had panic attacks almost every day thinking about seeing this HR woman again, especially now that I‚Äôm sure she knows everything I had said about her to the director. I don‚Äôt even want to go pick up this check but my husband and I need money for bills and it‚Äôll take too long if they mail it to me. I also need to bring them back my shirts or else they will deduct them from my check. 

I hate confrontation, I want to cry thinking about seeing these people again. I just want to get it over with but I‚Äôm also shaking thinking about it. I‚Äôm trying to take deep breathes and to remember that the worst that can happen is they‚Äôll be rude to me but then I can go on my way and officially cut ties with them. 

Another thing I‚Äôm anxious about is that these people have a habit of cutting employees last checks to minimum wage if they don‚Äôt finish out their notice. I signed a long contract with them and it is in the contract but I‚Äôve also done some research and if they try to pull this I could file something with the board of labor or whatever and get that money back. All of that makes me feel even more anxious because that‚Äôs just a lot more added stress to an already stressful situation.

I really just needed to get all of this off my chest. I‚Äôm an anxious wreck right now but I know that it‚Äôll be over soon I just have to get it over with. I hate having anxiety, it makes me feel like such a baby. I‚Äôm a 24 year old woman I shouldn‚Äôt be so scared of other people but I am. If you‚Äôve gotten this far, thanks for listening.

1. I make a planner: this sounds pretty basic, but what I do is that I organize per day exactly what and how much I have to study; this works great if you have a lot of time (prob more useful if you're in university) and/or have more exams to get ready for.
It's really helpful because it shows clearly that you have enough time, there's no need to rush or to feel overwhelmed. 
Ex - 12 march: page 1 to 5 Exam1; break; 3 math exercises; break; page 6 and 7 Exam2

2. In case one day depression hits me harder (or if you're sick/sad/whatever) I plan a ""bare minimum"" planner, where I decide what has priority and needs to be studied that day, and what can wait.

3. I sit there, look at the exams' planned days (again, mostly for uni) and imagine not passing the exam.
This can be helpful because most of the times what gives anxiety is the thought that if you don't pass the exam, you will never have a second chance or something similar, while 99% of the times is a lie. 

Ex: I can do Exam1 on the 25th of March and on the 3rd of April, so if I don't pass it, I have a week to revise it and try again.

4. For each exams, I make a list of what I'm struggling with (topics/formulas etc) , and decide if leaving that part ""undone"" is an option or not. Personally I get much more anxiety whenever I realize that I'm not understanding something that I need for the exam.

Ex: the Math teacher said the test has 3 exercises, type1/2/3. I can't do type1, can I just leave it behind? Do Type2 and type3 give enough points to pass the exam?

5. I try to do less but every single day, especially when I have more exams. Like that I always know that I'm doing my best for every exam.

6. NEVER try to repeat/study/revise before the exam. That will give you the perception that you didn't study, it will confuse you and probably make you do a worse exam. The limit is the afternoon of the day before the exam.

7. If it's an exam in which you have to repeat/study stuff (everything but math basically) ask someone to help you revise it, even 1 time is enough, like that you'll be sure that you studied correctly and that is a proof you've nothing to worry about.

This is all that comes to my mind, I'll eventually edit it if I get more ideas.

I had a bad experience with a teacher mocking the way I talked in front of the class so I dropped out cause it just got so bad, I wasn't wanting to go to classes or even get out of bed. 
At the beginning of last year I was taking general education classes online and had plans to transfer a few hours away to another school.
I was talking to people I knew and online who have done related jobs and was told the money wasn't worth it. 
So I now have an opportunity at the church I volunteer at to learn while also gaining experience with Photography and I'm going to take it.
In the middle of all this, the person I saw as my best friend, my person, and I had talked about renting an apartment together. The plan changed when I was going to transfer, but now I am not moving and she already has her own apartment, which is fine, and understandable.
I never lied, but because plans changed (sometimes out of my control), I'm afraid she thinks I'm just a liar. And I've probably ruined the whole living together thing by seeming unreliable.
We haven't spoken in a few months, which is normal for us, especially since the pandemic where we can't really do anything, but I texted her a few weeks ago and  she didnt respond.

This is my first post here, so please, be gentle...

I have chronic, pathological social anxiety. I can‚Äôt remember a time in my life when I have not (had it). This has, obviously, had a huge, and utterly disproportionate impact upon my life...

I‚Äôm 26. Male. A virgin. Never really made out with a girl. I‚Äôve had ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù, but they... Largely lacked the normal physical components one might expect from a relationship because... Well, largely because of this anxiety.

I‚Äôm terrified of intimacy. Utterly, utterly terrified. Even just thinking of this makes me feel a bit ill. At nightclubs, or gigs. or any other environment where that COULD happen, where I COULD be in the situation to meet a girl, and kiss her, I like... Break down. I get even worse when I get closer. Like, if I think she MIGHT be keen, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure, I fucking back out of the situation, and literally... Leave the venue, because I‚Äôm so scared she‚Äôll reject me. :-(

This has been disastrous, my whole dating life. Girls know I‚Äôm a coward, and they hate it. I also can‚Äôt start conversations, and I can‚Äôt ‚Äúcold call‚Äù, because I‚Äôm so scared...
Ask me to take my r√©sum√© around to workplaces? I‚Äôll end up a shivering mess. I avoid reading potentially hurtful emails and messages. I avoid texting people who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in too long, and feel bad about.

But the worst is those in-person romantic situations. Honestly, I am literally more afraid of that than bungee jumping. Or skydiving. Or swimming with sharks. It is quite literally one of my greatest fears, which is utterly ludicrous...

I wondered, therefore (if you read all this), if anyone has experienced similar, and potentially may have some tips to get better, because I‚Äôm not... Getting better.

So, I'm a teenager and I don't know if I had anxiety or not but I want you guys to help me because I really feel like shit these days, I've been trying to find online counseling but I can't find the free one at all because  I have no money.
I've been feeling this for a long time but almost every day I wake up feeling tingly all over my body, it feels like adrenaline rushing through me when I woke up, often my hand shakes violently and i start tapping anywhere or clapping my hand, my hobby is  to draw and now I can no longer draw (and write) because my hands are always shaking. 

After that,i feel my chest hurts like i've been doing a maraton and then immediately followed by crying (sometimes a mixture of crying and laughing) and my body is shaking while doing so. It happens often too,like everyday. 

From a long time,my mom always scold me for being a scaredy cat and some month ago i dare myself to told this to my father but he laugh at me and say that my complaints are silly and other things like im just lying for attention and it all just in my head (this one really make me questions my sanity)  And then after that i keep getting these panics attack and cry everytime im alone,one day my mom caught me crying and she broke down in front of me and told me that if i didnt stop this she will get out of the house and kill herself because she can't bear to see me suffer like this (literal guilt trip,i know).

Then i say to her that i want to see a doctor and that my father shouln't say that to me because i just want help,but she laugh and told me that im overdramatic and my father are just men being men,so i never went to any doctor because my parents didnt believe in mental illness.

another thing I feel is constant fear like example when i ride a motorbike and see a car, my mind is immediantely like ""you're gonna die! that car will lose control and run over you"". I even had to check money for 5 times before going to the supermarket and breaking down when going to the cashier.

and talk about trauma, I had a childhood trauma, I saw my friend was directly attacked by a monkey (so badly that his flesh was visible) this happened when im in pre-school, and after that incident I kept acting weird like sleeping walking  and screaming when I sleep, I still remember clearly my dream, Its like a blank white screen and then a very boisterous obscure black line messing up everything and im so fking afraid of that shit, sometimes my parents need to splash me with water so I woke up from that nightmare. (It stops now tho). I'm also afraid of road curves after I fell in one of them and injure myself.

And yes and the feeling of pain (that i need to touch my neck just to protect it)  everytime i drive through the iron zinc because I felt like my neck was cut even tho the zinc is far away. now I am also afraid of sugarcane trees because every time I look at the it I feel like my eye is scliced by the sharp leaves.

**Anxiety is the problem.**

Even though others think so sometimes, It‚Äôs not about:

* Not wanting to talk to others, or
* Not recognising my good qualities, or
* Not wanting to open up, or
* Not being interested, or
* Laziness, time management or lack of motivation

The anxiety tells me what I do could and should have been better, no matter the feedback.  The anxiety says this next thing I‚Äôm doing needs to be just right.  I feel judged, and that no matter how much I try to prove myself I will never be good enough.  I worry about how others perceive me and try to predict what their behaviour towards me might mean.  I‚Äôm always on the lookout for that thing that will come back to bite me.  **Because it has in the past.**  

**The anxiety feels like it is protecting me**.  If I can just:

* **If I can just** identify every flaw and mistake and error, and fix them
* **If I can just** work out how others perceive me, and then change that
* **If I can just** predict every possible outcome, and then generate a solution

I (28M) recently bought a house with my partner (31F) of 4 years and moved down to her hometown after working in the city. Its commutable and a really amazing place to live and her family are two minutes away whom she has a wonderful relationship with.

A few months ago however my partner, who worked at the same company as myself, was moved over to another company as part of a secondment, along with a bunch of her teammembers from her previous team.

I think the two large changes happening around the same time have triggered this but I can't be sure - but ever since about 3 weeks ago she's been slowly degrading mentally. At first she was constantly crying after work days, expressing frustration over things that didn't really make any sense - Excel not opening on her new Macbook sent her overboard for example. Didn't think anything of it because stuff like that is often the straw that breaks the camels back, and I knew that the changes to her role would have naturally been stressful and new to her at a time when she might not have been up for so much change in her Career.

But now its progressed to the point where she can't even speak or form proper sentences at times. Her family are over often and she's had to spend a few days over with them at times because she would just turn to me and tell me she hated me and that I was doing this to her. She constantly tells me she thinks her family are about to die despite having spent the entire day with them as they care and cook for her and make sure she's getting out and about.  
We talked to our GP who recommended two weeks off work and gave us beta blockers at a very low dosage. The blockers stopped any sort of panic attacks but she's now refusing to take them because she believes they're whats causing this - which again doesn't make any sense.   


We did an introductory session with a private therapist who would have assigned her an actual therapist, and she's refusing to do any sort of follow ups, which is really frustrating for all of us because I just don't know what I'm supposed to do to help her now. I know for a fact my partner would try and get this resolved any way possible usually but the anxiety and crippling fear / paranoia is stopping her from wanting to reach out for help professionally.   


The last week or so its been like talking to a brick wall at times, she can't work, she often can't cook or look after herself, and I get worried just leaving her in the other room whilst I have to work because she'll just sit there for hours doing absolutely nothing.  


Any advice on how I can actually do some good here?

This was just one of the many ways anxiety affected my life. I could sit here i pretend i wasn't scared at all, but the reality is that i was terrified.  

Yesterday i decided to write in my journal about what i was feeling. I told myself the process may be uncomfortable for me but the shame of not going through with it would be worse and would stay with me. I told myself growth comes from expanding your comfort zone and i told myself that beyond the discomfort i can find growth and this was just a learning experience put in my way.

More and more over the past year i have been expanding my comfort zone. I had to touch rock bottom to realize i needed to do this. It is important to take small but consistent steps. I am still not where i want to be, but i am hopeful i will continue to improve. I have proven to myself i will not let anxiety run my life.

Anxiety can take our mind to this place of dread, fear and unpredictability.

It can make us feel as though we have no control over what we are thinking but there are in fact many things we can do to help ourselves.

We may not see it but some of our subconscious habits actually create space for anxiety to manifest. Of course, we don‚Äôt do these things on purpose, but it‚Äôs really important to detect what actions are in fact to the detriment of our mental health.

2300,MakeupMua16,1615550008,1,I went on anxiety medication for the first time like 4 years ago. My previous primary doctor suggested Zoloft because I was having a lot of social anxiety. I didn‚Äôt really realize it but it had caused me a lot of weight gain when I was on it. so much that it caused me slight pre diabetes. That‚Äôs when I actually started having full on anxiety because I was scared of getting full blown diabetes and not being able to reverse it. I then had a huge panic attack over it the worst was being so nervous my body started getting internal tremors and everything. And that‚Äôs how my health anxiety started. Then I switched to a few different medications none witch really helped any. Until I was on Effexor. That helped my anxiety a lot. And even the almost 24/7 internal tremors went away finally. And then I started gaining weight on it because my body never felt full when I would eat anymore. I came off and was doing fine until I was hit with another health scare. Went back on and of course it helped but the weight gain came back. Then came off the second time. It‚Äôs been about two weeks fully off now. I‚Äôve been feeling fine mentally but now since like two days I‚Äôve been getting tremors that wake me up and usually go away within like 20 minutes. But today I woke up with them after only 5 hours of sleep and I‚Äôm still feeling the internal tremors in my arms and upper legs and I‚Äôve been up for almost an hour. I‚Äôm scared what if I‚Äôm dependent on anxiety medication now and I have to be on it forever. I love how the Effexor helped my anxiety and reduced symptoms but it‚Äôs the excessive eating that just makes me not so sure if I wanna stay on due to being afraid of getting diabetes from eating too much and gaining too much weight. I just hate this because I don‚Äôt want to have to be dependent on medication but I‚Äôm scared if that‚Äôs the only way to get rid of my tremors for good since when I had my first panic attack I shocked my system and now tremors are my main anxiety symptom even if I don‚Äôt feel anxious necessarily. I hate having anxiety I just wish it didn‚Äôt cause physical symptoms. I don‚Äôt know if I should just bite the bullet and go back on the medication if it helped regardless of weight gain or what I should do.

2305,MildHerdazian,1615548251,1,"This may be a bit of a long post so sorry. I just want to get this off my chest and organize my thoughts.

My best friend‚Äôs family is pretty much my second family to me. I have a really strong bond with my friend (D) and his sister (E), who is much younger than both of us. 

Backstory:

When I left my home town about 2 years ago for work, E had a hard time with seeing me go. I was a vent for her and would listen whenever she needed someone to talk to. D and I would listen and try to help her out, but D and the rest of the family deals with their issues by making light of them and shoving it away. If E wasn‚Äôt feeling well, her parents would interrogate her for a day or two, give up, and pretend everything was back to normal when she hid her problems from them. I was the only one there who would just listen when she talked.

It all got a bit more complicated when looking up to me turned into having a crush on me. I wanted to keep helping E with her problems, but I did a terrible job keeping boundaries with her. I wanted to help, but was stuck feeling awkward and paranoid that her parents didn‚Äôt trust me. I wanted them to be able to help E out, so I spoke with them to clear the air. We all seemed to have the idea that E needed to ‚Äúget over‚Äù me, and that when I left for my new job, things would get better. We all had a tearful goodbye, and I focused myself for the next two years as much as I could on my job so I could forget the awkwardness of that whole situation.

I still kept in contact with the family with limited communication, and I eventually stopped stressing about what happened.



Now:

I‚Äôm moving locations for my job, so I was able to come home for a few weeks before I ship out to the new place. Of course, I want to see D and his family since they are pretty much my second family.

D and I hit it off right away when I see him. He‚Äôs moved into an apartment with his girlfriend at this point and E is still with her parents, going to high school. We talk a bit about what happened before I left and he said E was doing a lot better and not to worry about any awkwardness with his family. Phew.

A few days later, E asks if I want to go for a hike. Her mom wasn‚Äôt feeling well, so it was just us. There was a bit of awkward tension the whole time while we were catching up. She has a boyfriend now and is doing her classes over Zoom.

When we got back, I offered to teach her how to drive manual in the driveway. Once we were both focusing on that, the tension completely broke off and I felt like I could talk with her comfortably again.

The next day, I took her out again to practice more and she got to second gear and learned to to park backwards. After that, E, her mom, and I went to the beach for the day. We just spent the day climbing rocks and watching the waves. Throughout the past few days, I noticed that she would have random tremors. I asked if she was cold but she said that she would just tense up and didn‚Äôt know why. On the car ride home, she just spaced out and didn‚Äôt really talk.

When we got home, her anxiety really started to pick up. E pretty much stopped talking for the day, and her sister prodded her, asking what was wrong with her. E left the table without a word and went upstairs. Her whole family is used to this and just blows it off, so I go and see what‚Äôs going on. 

She‚Äôs sitting in the dark and crying.

For the next hour, she explains everything to me and I listen. There‚Äôs her social anxiety, fear of losing people, her previous boyfriend being abusive, her weekly panic attacks, and her family digging for answers that she is physically and mentally incapable of giving.

I ask if it would be okay to talk to her mom about it and she says ok.

I speak with her mom, letting her know what E is going through, and she listens to me. There was a hint of hesitation in wanting to believe it all, but I think hearing it from someone with an outside perspective helped. We talked about getting E therapy and the possibility about speaking to a doctor and possibly getting medication. She was open to seeking therapy, but not so open to medication because of the side effects they can have.

We finish talking, E texts me to come upstairs, and she‚Äôs having a full-on panic attack now. I let her squeeze the crap out of my hand while she hugs me, and I talk her through breathing. She gets a bit better, until I say I have to go. That just reminds her that I‚Äôll be leaving in a few days and she doesn‚Äôt know when she‚Äôll get to see me again.

After I leave, E and her mom talk a bit, and her mom says she‚Äôll look into getting E virtual therapy. E is feeling better about talking with her, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like her mom knows the full scope of how E is feeling. 

I ask my brother about what he did for his anxiety in high school, and he really opened my eyes to how he has been dealing with it since. I didn‚Äôt even know that he struggled with panic attacks until I asked. He talked about speaking to his doctor about getting him medication, and all I could think about was how easy it would be to get E help if her parents just listened.

I ask E if it would be ok to speak with her mom again after talking with my brother and she said ok and that she wanted to be there too.

E is outside when I come over and she opens up to me more about how she‚Äôs feeling and things we both notice that stop her from shaking so much. 

It‚Äôs been long enough, so we invite her mom out to talk. I do most of the explaining, because E is quiet and shaking again. I talk about how my brother copes with his anxiety and how hard working and successful he is with the help he is getting. That seems to open E‚Äôs mom up a bit more to the idea. I show them both coping strategies they can use now, and how to talk to E when she‚Äôs feeling anxious. E is really tense at this point and is shaking a bit more. So I ask if she wants to squeeze my hand. Ouch

It‚Äôs weird being the one E feels comfortable with in front of her mom, who hasn‚Äôt really seen this side of E. Especially after I‚Äôve been gone for 2 years. Her mom doesn‚Äôt really seem to know what to do at this point while E is squeezing my hand and hugging me again, so I ask E to try to tell her mom how she is feeling. It takes some time for her to get the words out, but she does. I try my best to keep asking yes or no questions and it works out a bit better.

They run out of questions and things to say after her mom comes up with a plan for her to call her doctor the next day, so I change the subject and talk to them about my job.

Overall I think the conversation went well. E keeps saying thanks for getting her help, and I‚Äôm glad I could help.

I just hope her mom follows through and gets E the help she needs. I also feel like I put myself in a weird situation again, showing up out of the blue and giving E more attention than her family had given these past few years. I don‚Äôt want to be telling anyone how to handle their children, but I just want to help E so badly. 

TLDR:

We have not had a single case in weeks, our track and trace system is exemplary, everything is completely open and functioning normally. Over the entire pandemic, we have had fewer than 2,500 cases. 

Even though there is almost no risk, my partner has very bad health-related anxiety which is triggered by e.g. people coughing near him. It can be enough to make him unable to speak for a whole evening, or to make him very angry and irritated. It makes it very difficult for us to live a normal life at a time when everyone else is: I would like (for example) to go to the cinema, but he's worried that someone will be coughing in the cinema and that will make him feel anxious.

I'm not sure of the best way to handle this. Is the right thing to do to adjust my life sometimes drastically so that he's not exposed to potential triggers?

I have this strange anxious feeling that I have missed my last boat to try and change my life. I have done so much in the past 2 months in changing myself. mostly losing weight, working out and finally starting to study what I actually enjoy in life. Ive also stopped drinking alcohol to the point of not knowing where I am and have stopped binged eating burgers and pizzas. There are so many other things to be done but I just feel different in the sense that I should have had my shit together since i finished high school. I get nervous waking up and being envious at some of my friends and even my girlfriend for knowing what they actually want in life(though some of them may have been lying just to avoid discomfort). I am applying for engineering school this July and am just feeling so tense by the fact that I will be one of the older students there.

2314,thetruepan,1615543660,1,"Hey. So, ever since Christmas, I've continuously been losing weight, I'm currently down about 8 lbs of what I had before. The thing is, my anxiety tells me that I have some kind of cancer that makes me lose all that weight without trying to. 

I have been to the doctor before in January because I was so terrified something was wrong (had other physical symptoms like chest tightness and a low heartrate, thinking I was having a stroke). They did some type of blood screening and an ECG, turns out I'm apparently healthy. But obviously they didn't do any specific screenings or testing for cancer. 

That's why I'm still suspicious of losing 8 pounds in 3 months unwillingly. And as my anxiety told me to, I googled and found out that it's one of the first symptoms of cancer. 

Obviously, that doesn't really make me any less anxious, which leads me to sometimes forget about eating and all that. Still, I can't seem to convince myself that I just haven't been eating enough. Really, I just can't tell any more whether I'm eating normally and still losing weight or if I'm just undereating without really noticing it. 

It scares me so much and yeah, I kind of was in a dark place and the lowest I have ever been around that Christmas-January-ish time, but why am I still losing weight now that I'm kind of better? I just...don't understand and it terrifies me. Like...I semi-binged yesterday and woke up weighing a pound less than yesterday before bingeing. It's scaring me so much. 

Does any one else maybe have experiences like this? Am I really sick? How come I'm losing so much weight when my anxiety is so bad? Just whyyyy?",Anxiety,Losing weight and thinking I am dying of cancer,2021-03-12 21:07:40

2318,Gottchen,1615542652,1,"I suffer from major depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (now 21). I already tried 8 antidepressants of different classes until today (now: Amitriptyline 100mg). None of them had any effect, only sexual side effects. I already had 2 depth-psychological therapies and right now I have a behavioral therapy 1hr weekly. No success. My doc also prescribed me gabapentin now to try and said I can taper off Amitriptyline if I‚Äòm sure that it doesn‚Äòt do anything. I didn‚Äòt try the gabapentin or taper Amitriptyline yet.

The meds I tried:
Venlafaxine (+Quetiapin/Seroquel)
Escitalopram (+Promethazin)
Sertraline (Zoloft)
Paroxetine
Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
Opipramol
Moclobemide (Aurorix)
Amitriptyline

About escitalopram (Cipralex) which was my second antidepressant years ago I remember (after 3 weeks on it) having 2 great weeks of anxiety-relief, great mood, improved cognition and drive. It was great. So escitalopram showed some effects for 2 weeks but after that I was back to my old depressed and socially anxious me. Maybe worth another try? But why should escitalopram work for me again or more than other SSRIs as I already tried so many SSRI/SNRIs after it without success.

I think about rTMS but want to get through some other meds for depression and social anxiety first. Additionally rTMS is quite expensive. Ketamine seems promising but they don‚Äòt do it here in Germany yet. Also Nardil isn‚Äòt available here.

What other meds could be promising for me and my major depression and social anxiety (biggest source of my depression and self worth issues).

I noted some that I didn‚Äòt try yet:
Tranylcypromine
Pregabalin (as emergency medication only)
Buspiron
Clomipramin
Mirtazapine
Wellbutrin (as add-on only because alone it made me feel very weird and more anxious)
Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium)
Trazodone
Abilify
Vortioxitin (Serotoninmodulator/-stimulator)
Doxepine
Fluoxetine
Fluvoxamine
Amisulpride (add-on only, neuroleptic but very effective for social anxiety and lack of drive)

2320,thedeepcavern,1615541266,1,"Basically I think I could possibly have POCD but i don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm a 15 year old female and over the past 6 months have managed to convince myself I was a cannibal, that someone was reading my mind, and many many other things that I was genuinely afraid was happening. Like I was actually scared I as a cannibal. Now looking back on it I know for sure I‚Äôm no cannibal, ew. But it felt so real and scary at the time.

Basically I started having anxiety that I was actually bi, and I was scared that I would lose attraction to boys (despite being crazy over boys all my life and never once looking at girls)  and become completely gay. I was having groinal responses when thinking of being bi and was terrified because I‚Äôve always never wanted to be bi. Anyways after my sister assured me it‚Äôs rare to just turn completely gay after being straight, I worried about it less and my attraction to guys came back. I feel like my anxiety was telling me I was attracted to girls when I honestly wasn‚Äôt. Because now I‚Äôm on a different worry and my attraction to girls is gone I think. 

It all started this morning when I woke up, and thought about how my attraction to girls started and like developed against my will and how I was scared of it developing to being completely gay (which it never did) and then my brain just had to make me think ‚Äúholy shit what if this could happen with children? What if suddenly I got attracted to children and developed into a pedophile?‚Äù 

I immediately started panicking and crying because I got a groinal response against my will and now I‚Äôm horrified that I‚Äôm turning into a pedophile because my body responded.

I heard that as a teenager your body can respond to like anything and your hormones are out of whack. I‚Äôve been so confused with my mind body and feelings, just this morning I cried for half an hour hugging my mom over a sad mother child scene from dumbo. I‚Äôm so confused and I don‚Äôt know who I am or my thoughts or feelings and I‚Äôm scared of who I will become. logic is telling me this is anxiety just like all the other past things I convinced myself I was when I really wasn‚Äôt, but anxiety is telling me I‚Äôm a pedophile. 

I did some research and my symptoms matched up with pure ocd although I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed so I‚Äôm not claiming to have anything. But whatever it is it‚Äôs been ruining my life. I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôm a pedophile because i got a groinal response about it, I‚Äôve been crying all day because of this and I‚Äôm so scared of this developing and losing interest in adults. This is the exact mindset I had when I was scared I was bi and going to turn completely gay, and I‚Äôm seeing that was just anxiety (I think) but I don‚Äôt know how do I get over this?

2354,itdoesntreallymater,1615532156,1,"Since a week I'm unable to properly sleep. It's weird because I get exhausted - which is usually a great recepie for sound sleep, but even that is not working. I keep falling in and out of sleep.

So instead of getting a good rest for like 7 hours everyday, I now spend a longer time just *trying* to fall asleep or falling in/out of sleep (as in, I know I slept for a few minutes cause I don't remember listening to a few songs in the playlist) but I keep getting woken up on my own. It's not even the jerk thing where you imagine you are falling, I just regain consciousness. My eyes are heavy but it's hard to sleep which is weird because there's not much worrying or making me anxious in life right now.

When I'm not able to sleep for too long I get kinda tempted to scroll something on my phone which I know I shouldn't because usually it hampers sleep even more (but it helps me reach that exhaustion point. Many a times I would get sleepy while scrolling social media.)

I tried sleeping in the noon and in the eve but same thing - I keep falling out of it.

My eating schedule is a little different in case it matters. I have my first meal in the noon, a mild snack in the eve, second meal is dinner, and milk at like 2:30 in the night, then I usually sleep from 3 to 10. (But not now, yesterday I must've finally fallen asleep at like 5:30 or something). I don't think the schedule is the issue because I've been doing this for months and it worked perfectly for me.

I tried various stuff, from listening to music to staring at the empty ceiling in utter silence. I guess it's worth noting that about a decade ago my mother had a much alleviated version of sleeplessness and was eventually diagnosed with MADD (Mixed anxiety depression disorder). She was on medication for a long long time for this until a few years ago and honestly I don't want sleeping pills because that's a slippery slope. 

Is anxiety/depression genetic? I have been dealing with some issue for the past few months, I feel incredibly hurt (processing some childhood stuff) and an incredible loss (which is the cliche - the one I thought I would spend my life with left). But I have been dealing with these and keeping them in check for months, why would I get sleeplessness now? 

Right now (specifically in the last week) I haven't had anxiety/panic because of these those things, just sometimes getting that feeling of a gaping hole in the heart, which I guess is pretty much expected? 

As for not interacting with people cause of the pandemic - that aspect works for me because I get anxious in social situations. I do, at times, feel like I miss hanging out with a couple of friends that I made, but apart from that, I have no issues with not attending the classes physically (let's say it this way - I want the pandemic to end, but if as a measure of abundant precaution the authorities extend online classes for another semester - I would be happy about that). Being in my own space gives me immense autonomy and time to deal with things I would normally not be able to.

I think I'm just overthinking stuff? Maybe in another week or so things will get better on their own? Should I wait this out? I do not have the money nor the courage to seek therapy right now (I do hope to go there in about a year of so by which time I would hopefully have moved to my own place and be able to afford therapy).

I also was a very careful child and never wanted to do something where I could hurt myself in the end or similar (inline skating near railings was the most I could do and I was still super scared). 
Then around 7th grade I started to get regular headaches and other body pains (a lot of tension everywhere and shows similarities to fibromyalgia). Over time they got worse and worse and worse. After I finished school this pain became unbearable most times of the days and I took a lot of pain medication everyday for over a year. Everytime I went to all the different doctors no one really cared too much or tried to diagnose me (one thought I had ms but the mrt didn‚Äôt show that)... 

Now I am married and studying but I do struggle.  I also still have a lot of pain everyday in different areas and strong TMJ. I have these random panic attacks, sometimes only physical sometimes mentally and sometimes both.

Every single day, I feel like I go through a million little moments of anxiety over being scared of regretting something. It‚Äôs always the smallest of actions. For example, pretty much every time I text a loved one, I get anxious over saying the right things. The sorts of things that go through my head are like, ‚ÄúWhat if something happens and this is the last time I text them and I don‚Äôt say I love them?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat if I say something wrong and hurt them somehow?‚Äù even though I know these thoughts are pretty irrational.

2364,FunkySpacetime,1615528387,1,"Heya, so I just thought I'd share this because it has helped me alot:

* Anxious people tend to overthink and use their cognitive brains in almost every situation. 
* Over the past few months, I've noticed that a lot of problems can be solved by intuition and ""gut"" feeling. We don't realise that our sleeping unconscious brain is insanely powerful. It is like a quantum supercomputer predicts dozens of scenarios and possibilities in mere milliseconds.
* When something feels wrong, it probably is. Your unconscious brain has already done most of the work and it's letting you know by creating this feeling of uneasiness in your gut.  So instead of wasting an hour using logic and reasoning to determine what course of action you should take, start trusting your gut and acting on instinct a lot more. **E*****specially*** if you're an overthinker.

I've been doing this for a few months and it is insane how much this has reduced my anxiety. My brain is a lot calmer because I'm not using my ""rational"" / ""logical"" brain as much. I've gradually learned to trust my instinct (unconscious brain) and to act in ways which feel right (and what do you know... it's almost always right.). This not only reduces anxiety by creating less noise in your mind, **it also makes you live in the moment** because you are tuning in to your body which doesn't think about the past or the future because it only gives you signals in the present.

So, in summary:

\- Learn to listen to and trust your gut/instinct feelings (i.e your unconscious brain)

\- Your unconscious brain is insanely powerful and it is correct almost all of the time.

\- By doing so, you will reduce unnecessary thoughts (source of anxiety) **and** you will start living more in the present (counter source of anxiety)

TL&amp;DR: Trust and listen to your unconscious brain. It will reduce thoughts and CPU overload in your mind and reduce thought induced anxiety. You will also live more in the present.",Anxiety,Helpful Advice on Overthinking (TL&amp;DR at bottom),2021-03-12 16:53:07

Everyone tells me to think about what I should be thankful for and that I have a lot of good things going on. I do, they‚Äôre right, I have many things. But why can‚Äôt I be sad when I‚Äôm sad? Why does that automatically make me crazy? The first and only person I have truly loved has been gone for so long when we‚Äôve spent the last 6 years seeing each other almost everyday to barely being able to even have a phone call with each other. And when I‚Äôm sad about it, I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm crazy. Now that it‚Äôs almost over I‚Äôve realized there was no one I could actually trust. No one that could just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you must be having a hard time‚Äù. No one I could just hug. I have lots of people, but no one I can confide in. Because of this whole thing, I have to live with an anxiety disorder. I‚Äôve never had that before. I understand what‚Äôs happening to me and why but I can‚Äôt tell anyone. I have to adjust the rest of my life to live with this new problem and everyone thinks I‚Äôm crazy because of it. I have anxiety. I know that. I‚Äôm just sad right now. And that‚Äôs okay. People are sad sometimes. I‚Äôm not crazy for missing the only person I love.

Basically I bought a car in September when thing picked up at work and walking was less practical. I'm a student so it was most of my money, but I paid in cash and I've got plenty of money left to live off of. So I'm okay there.   


Thing is I rushed into it and didn't really use my head. It's a used Toyota with a clean title and low mileage, so it's not a bad car by any means. It's just a manual without A/C, honestly I probably paid $1500-2000 more than I should have given that info - I paid for what you would expect to pay for an  automatic with all the features.   


Now my partner and I are moving to her parents house in the summer and it's not practical to take both cars so I have to get rid of it. I know by the time I find a seller I'll probably be looking at a total loss of $2-3k Canadian. Ironically I was so upset about it that I went to look at another car which turned out to be at an estate sale. I didn't buy the car but I did buy a guitar amp for $20 - it ended up being one of the rarest Fender amps ever made and I've got a buyer who's agreed to take it off my hands for $2k.

Usually my anxiety is not too terrible and managed pretty easily with my lifestyle choices (less caffeine, exercise, eat okay, sleep enough, etc).  I've had these attacks rarely in my life - maybe less than 20 in total in 10 years.  

But there was a situation on Saturday that triggered me badly and escalated into the attack. Now it's Thursday, 5 days later, and I'm still feeling way more anxiety than I usually do. A lot of the anxiety is manifesting in physical symptoms (head tingles/wooshes, headaches) which always is the worst for me because then I start to spiral about my physical health and worry something is actually physically wrong with me. I'm 99% sure there's not anything wrong with me, I have gone to urgent care twice and had tons of tests and told it was likely just anxiety.

Is anyone else in a weird spot like this?
Like i feel like other people with messed up parts of their childhood learnt a lot quicker than I did. 
Learnt not to trust their parents. 
How to stand on their own 2 feet. 

Maybe that‚Äôs because all the fucked up stuff started at a later age (14) 
So people who had that stuff happen at earlier age, they were really conditioned so much earlier. The fucked up stuff was happening while their brains were literally like forming from toddlers to children to teenagers. 
Whereas mine started when I was a teen. 

It makes me feel really inadequate 
Like why haven‚Äôt I moved out yet?? 
I‚Äôm 19! 
This year I‚Äôm second year out of high school! 
My family has been so so shitty and fucked up (see previous posts lol) since I was like 14! 
Why didn‚Äôt I move out the second I could. 
It makes me so angry with myself. 
Maybe I have to cut myself some slack. 
The pandemic did start 2 months after I left school. 
But my area has not even been affected that much! 
Not even really at all! 
I live in Aus 

I just feel like when I here people talking about 
‚ÄúI knew I had to get out of my family home at a young age, 
So I worked since I was 14 and saved up and left as soon as I could‚Äù! 
I feel so like almost jealous! 
Not because I want to have had their experience but I almost wish it was worse. 

Maybe if it was worse I would of left earlier. 
It makes me feel like the stuff I went through wasn‚Äôt even bad because If it was I would of left. 
And it wasn‚Äôt even that bad! 
The physical violence I experience from my brother rarely leaves bruises. 
Other people get bruises and more. 

Maybe if I had not of stayed this long it would not of got to a point where police were called and I was painted as the physical abuser and told I could be charged because my brother is a minor and I‚Äôm over 18. 
Even though I don‚Äôt even hit my brother. He‚Äôs the one who attacks me. And I retaliate sometimes. But often I don‚Äôt because I know he‚Äôll come back 10 times harder.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve fully processed that event. It only happened the other night. But having the whole story being spun against me for the millionth time in the last 5 years and it being by police for the 2nd time. 

I have nothing going for me. 
I‚Äôm fat. 
No money. 
No job. 
No friends. 
My drivers license. 
I‚Äôve been out clubbing once since I turned 18. And that was with my cousin.  And we‚Äôve been allowed too (no covid here) 
I‚Äôm not in Uni. 

But I desperately want to go to a live in college while I go to uni because I feel so cheated because I missed out on the high-school experience 

But I can‚Äôt. I mentally can‚Äôt. 
My Mum told me barely 2 weeks ago that ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably normal for brothers to touch their sisters on the breasts until someone tells them to stop it‚Äù 
This was after I accused my brother of touching me there a couple years ago and no one believed me. 
But now she suddenly believe it could of but that it was normal!? 
How am I supposed to go to UNIVERSITY WITH ALL THIS SHIT IN MY HEAD. 
I can‚Äôt even instantly recall most of the shit that‚Äôs happened in the last 2 weeks because I block it out. 
That‚Äôs why I keep a diary on here. 
And on my phone. 
Keep records. 

I feel like a fraud. My bruise that I did get from one of my brothers sessions with me isn‚Äôt even that big. 

And no he doesn‚Äôt touch me inappropriately anymore! 
And no I‚Äôm not saying the time he did, affected me severely! 
It didn‚Äôt! 

My Mum said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise it traumatised you‚Äù in a gaslighting in condescending way when referring to me asking her why she thought brothers touching their sisters on the breasts was normal: 
I NEVER SAID IT DID MUM, STOP PUTTING THOSE WORDS IN MY MOUTH 

I feel so bad about the police getting involved last time. 
So this time when the police were called (a few days ago) I didn‚Äôt say anything to them. 
I only corrected them when they tried to make it look like I was the abuser. 

I feel so invalid. 
I‚Äôve made so many mistakes. 
I‚Äôve stolen money from my family during these times (haven‚Äôt for over a year now) 
And am working to pay it back through the casual babysitting I do. 
Why doesn‚Äôt anyone give a shit? 
Why can‚Äôt I be strong?! 
Why do I keep putting up with this shit! 

I‚Äôm not codependent to my Mum but I also am! She‚Äôs not dependent on me so maybe it‚Äôs just me dependent on her. 
I‚Äôm not talking about financially. 
I‚Äôm talking emotionally even thought that women had the emotional literacy of a door. 

I need to get out. 
WHY DIDN‚ÄôT I DO THIS SOONER.  

I don‚Äôt want any of my families help. 
Accepting their help would mean I‚Äôm not strong.

Just wanted to share my experience as an anxious G in her 30's dealing with the worst break up I ever had after four years of relationship. As you can guess, the first weeks after th BU where unbearable. I had to endure a lot of things (including moving out of our flat). Five months later, i have to say that even if my heart is still broken, i made a few steps to heal. 

The thing is, life moves on, and in my case it took the shape of a secret sex-friendship with one of my roomate (i know...) I'm thrilled to admit that sex is awsome, i never though i could have a good time with another guy so soon. But I'm so afraid of my feelings, i'm so unconfident since the break up I'm feeling like i'm very fragile, even though i should be exited by this new guy who likes me. But my level of anxiety these past days have been really high, because i'm wondering if i can bare a ""no strings attached"" relationship after the very serious and loving connexion i had with my ex. How to regain confidence after an ordeal like this? Will I be able to enjoy life and new relationships - which may be really different from what I knew- ?

When I was around 10 to 14, my older brother got heavy into drugs. Where we lived, there was also a depression so my parents were never around much as they were working just to keep our house (which I learned  later on). In other words, I was faced with a lot of his abuse, as my little brother was still too young and my older brother was always babysitting. I also have two older sisters. Our ages are almost 5 years apart. 

Anyway, I started therapy as there have been a lot of drama with my older sisters who were all moved out when things went down, and who never really reached out even though they knew what was going on. She was very blunt and it led to a breakdown for me, that I felt they had abandoned me but never put that word to it. 

My older bro got clean, but still has issues obviously. Him and I have actually grown close now. My sisters stirred up problems about his past and I blew up on them about how would they know, they were never around. They didn't respond well and shrugged me off.

But the reason I‚Äôm worrying is my parents said earlier today if a man becomes hard he likes whatever‚Äôs going on. I remember a few years back when me and my parents were babysitting I was holding the baby and I started to feel hard. I cringe so hard at this. I‚Äôm not sexually attracted to kids in any way. I‚Äôve also gotten hard from dogs licking me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I wanna have sex with the dog. I‚Äôm so worried I secretly liked the baby being on my lap and I wanna do sexual things

So can a man get hard without actually wanting do have sex or like what‚Äôs going on?

And am I a pedophile or bad person???

Also this happened when I was like 13 or 14 but the dogs liking me was like when I was 15 and 17 (just a few months ago). I‚Äôm really worried I‚Äôm a freak

I‚Äôm hoping it was since I was a young teen I just had a lot of hormones so if anything rubbed up against that area I got hard but never actually wanted to do anything. Like I said I would never do anything like that and I‚Äôm also not even sexually attracted to kids or animals

But, obviously, no one is keen for me to be taking 5-hourly doses of lorazepam, so they keep trying to put me on clonazepam, or diazepam, on the grounds that they are very similar chemically; seems reasonable 

The thing is, my reaction to these other benzodiazepines is drastically different, in the following ways: 

\- Need a substantially larger dose to get them to do anything at all, and I mean AT ALL; eg it takes 2mg of clonazepam to feel like I've taken 0.5lorazepam in terms of anxiety relief (I am told that this ""should"" be equivalent to taking about 4mg lorazepam) 

\- By the time I get any relief, I feel kind of like I'm drunk: unsteady, slurry, not at all mentally sharp, it's a pretty unpleasant experience (contrast with loraz, I get none of this at all and become decidedly sharper since I don't have to wade through brain fog)

\- Clonazepam, which is supposed to last longer than lorazepam, lasts about the same 5 hours

2481,JauneOG,1615496431,1,"I've wondered for a while now if it's possible that I could have some type of diagnosable anxiety to probably a smaller degree or if there's different types of it. I am not looking for a diagnosis I am just wondering if it seems possible or if I just feel anxious sometimes.

The main reason I wonder is because I do know quite a few people who have been diagnosed with Anxiety and it seems different to how I acted. For them it stops them from even being able to do many things and sometimes it can come out of no where for no reason. Also they experience many physical symptoms.

For me there's always a reason to why I feel anxious. I feel it in my chest heavily but I don't cry or breathe too irregularly. Sometimes I pace a lot but that's just how I think. It doesn't stop me from doing the thing that I am anxious about, I just deeply don't want to. I can still act confident even if inside I feel much worse. My main concern is that it doesn't just happen right before an event. 

Say for example: Right now I am working a security job at a seniors home for seniors with dementia. I get very bad anxious feelings before going but not just before going, If I know I work in a week from now it will ruin the week that I don't work because I know I do work after it. Or another example is that I might just get anxious before joining discord to talk to people I've been friends with for years and that I'm not too sure why, fear of being judged I guess.

My mind can easily spiral thinking the worst possibilities but all that said it doesn't stop me from going and doing my job or usually hopping in discord anyway. On the outside I can even be an anchor for those of my friends who do have anxiety, calming them down or going first in something so they feel safer about it, no matter how anxious I feel. I've been this way for as long as I remember. It's what used to stop me from talking to girls as well, and first times having sex I couldn't get erect due to anxiety.

Is this just me being anxious or could it be possible I have some type of low level anxiety, and therefore should I go to a professional to get it diagnosed and treated? I don't want to disrespect people who actually have bad anxiety just from getting anxious sometimes that's why I am asking here first.",Anxiety,Could it be possible that I might have anxiety?,2021-03-12 08:00:31

I advise that you read bits of each paragraph instead of reading the whole thing as I did not mean for this to be so long sorry. 



This is my first post and I just wanted help so I can get this question that‚Äôs been on my mind for ages, to go. I‚Äôm a teenager in school and I‚Äôve been recently worrying about if I have anxiety. I‚Äôve felt these ‚Äúsymptoms of anxiety‚Äù for years and with the added stress of school it‚Äôs making me think I am overreacting. 

The reason I think I may have anxiety is because my mum had it and I have always been told as shy and antisocial, whenever I get my name called I get a sudden feeling of stress and worry that something bad is about to happen. I don‚Äôt like talking to people who I don‚Äôt know very well, I can‚Äôt talk to any of my family either, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with anyone (talking about how I feel). This is the first time I‚Äôve ever talked to anyone about how I feel. 

I constantly worry about little things all the time, I wanted to know if it‚Äôs normal for that to happen (I worry about things like my very young pets dying and other stuff). When I was in online school we had to have our cameras on and I felt really uncomfortable and got really panicky and i wanted to hide. As I said when my name gets called I get very anxious even if it‚Äôs complementing me. I don‚Äôt like getting complemented and I don‚Äôt like getting attention. When I‚Äôm at school I always feel like people are saying things behind my back or have inside jokes about me that I don‚Äôt get. 

At home I feel I can‚Äôt say my opinion or say something about my day or myself as I feel my brothers are going to say something that makes me annoyed. My brothers do this all the time at anything I say and they gang up on me and my parents do nothing about anything they do. My parents don‚Äôt worry about my health and ignore me when I look sad. But I feel spoilt sometimes and like the favorite child as my parents are rich and I rarely ask for things but when I do I get them but it normally takes me  a week to plan out what I‚Äôm going to say. I have several pets as well but to get them my  brothers forced me to make a PowerPoint to prove we could look after them but now only me and my mum look after my dog and I look after my other pets. When I‚Äôm with any of my pets it is relaxing and calming. I wouldn‚Äôt call my parents bad as they are strict in a good way and kind and are probably the best parents out of my friends parents.


This part is less about anxiety so you can ignore this paragraph 

My brothers annoy me non stop (they are 21 and 18 but still at home) and when they do this I get very angry (I think I may have slight anger management problems but I have developed them over the years of teasing and almost bullying from my brothers). When I get angry at them I scream out of frustration which makes my parents angry and a whole family argument which involves me getting hit and cursed at by all my family including my parents. 

I have done some tests about if I have anxiety and they all said I did and said I have social anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I think is believable but I still don‚Äôt think that I have anxiety.

I found a lot of the posts on here are relatable, for instance, I found one which said anxiety was about smelling toast and thinking you are having a stroke and not someone is making toast, but when I smell toast I think am I too young to have a stroke. ( I don‚Äôt remember the person who made this please tell me who did so I can edit this and say)


I‚Äôm also scared to tell my parents I feel like I might have anxiety or to ask them for a test to get diagnosed or not so it‚Äôs off my mind.


I also think I might have anorexia as I‚Äôve done tests online that say I do but obviously they are not the real thing. I am constantly worrying about my weight and I try not to eat lots and I try to eat healthy food.


I‚Äôm very self conscious about how I look as I had 2 friends a few years ago that would tell me how pretty they where and how ugly I looked and that I should always wear makeup ( I dislike the feeling of makeup and rarely wear it). I have always felt self conscious before them though and  it just about my body also my work and what I say. 


Thanks for reading. I‚Äôm very thankful if you got this far. Please help in the comments as I spent time on this and it would mean a lot thank you.

He made the first move, but then I wasn't sure if I want to be with him and he had to go away for work for a couple of weeks. When he came back, I knew I wanted to try dating and opened up about my feelings, but this time he wasn't sure, although he didn't reject me in a clear way. 

Right now, I don't even know if I do want to be with him, but the whole situation seems to be triggering my anxiety like nothing else in months. When we're in touch, I feel more reassured and like I can think calmly about whatever happens in the future, but when we aren't for a longer time, I get really anxious - even though I did get over him to some degree. I do miss our friendship, we used to talk all the time which we don't do now, maybe because he's busy and I'm also not writing much because the situation still seems awkward, or he's ignoring me as in not to communicate feelings that aren't there.

These Past few months were very hard for me, I was severely depressed and had so much anxiety I could barely function. My doctor prescribed me lexapro anti depressants. I had anxiety about taking anxiety medication (hah) and never actually picked them up. It‚Äôs been a couple of months now and I actually feel little more positive (has some major life changes that made me better, new job, new relationship) and feeling more positive. My anxiety is still there though and makes it difficult. I don‚Äôt have social anxiety really I‚Äôm pretty good at talking to people one on one or small groups. But I still have anxiety in bigger groups or like presentations and such. Or just some days I‚Äôll randomly feel anxiety or dread for no reason. Should I ask my doctor to give me Xanax or klono so I can take as needed when I have a bout of anxiety?? Will this work? For example if I have a huge meeting with like 40 people and I need to present my mind goes blank and my anxiety is off the roof. So I just want something to help me with those cases.

2505,arkan0064,1615490094,1,"I will open with an apology for rambling, I am in a state of panic and seeking feedback.

Background: I am recently divorced after 20 years of marriage. Additionally I was recently laid off from work. First time in 25 or so Yeats unemployed.

While I have always fought anxiety and decision making, it has culminated to the point where any decision brings on anxiety and often full out panic attacks. I can't function as a human living in society. Leaving the house to go to the grocery store or pharmacy are left undone until I have no other choice than to leave the house. I was athletic. Exercised  regularly. Now, I can't even leave the house to go on a walk around the block. I am completely stuck in every facet of life.

Looking back while married and raising three children, I was very much on autopilot. I did what was required of me. I had a very successful career in Tech. I coached my kids sports teams. That said, I think I offloaded a lot of decisions with my ex. We could make decisions together knowing that I would receive feedback in the choices I had to make in life. Now I feel lost. Stuck in life. When I have my children over per our divorce agreement, I question whether I am even a good parent. I struggle to find activities to do. I feel less than my ex wife, that I am just a bore. All this has left me in a place where I don't recognize the person in the mirror. Who is this person?  What have I become? I live day by day, unable to plan for the future let alone for the day. I escape by just seeking out sleep, to not have to deal with any decisions in life. In turn, I am remain  unemployed. I have run through most of my savings which I was hoping to one day by a house again. In complete desperation,  I have turned to substance abuse to calm the brain. No one knows. I'm home going through the perceived perceptions of a struggling father who is unemployed. 

I desperately want help. I am looking into an inpatient mental health therapy. I just can't commit to it out of irrational fears. I am paralyzed.

When I say beat... really i'm just saying that because I know that's what people what to see and read. But in reality, there is no 'beating' Anxiety. Sorry to burst that bubble, but I had to. Here's the truth. 

Anxiety is a Fear, and so at any moment in your life, past, present or future where you experience fear, there is most likely anxiety. What's the point here? You can't erase Anxiety from your life. It is natural, it is a response to feeling threat, scared or worried... Anxiety appears in many forms, but every time it is FEAR! 

So... can one live a life without fear? My answer is no. I do not believe we should strive to live fearless lives, but lives of courage. For it is only in the face of fear that we can awaken what it means to be brave, and this... is an experience of growth and transformation. 

Anxiety is therefore, an opportunity for growth! And how does one grow from Anxiety? Simple, but not always easy. 

FACE IT. 

You have to face it. The other option is what you've probably been doing for long enough now... and that's avoiding it. 

Avoidance is often done through food, sugar, alcohol, marijuana, gaming, porn... whatever your distraction is... know two things. 

1. You're not alone! XD On rare occasion I get stuck too... And Wwhenever I try to escape from feelings i often end up eating cheese or smoking a joint... 
2. Your distraction will never solve the problem, and the only good thing it can truly do for you is make you suffer or bored enough that you simply can't be bothered trying to escape any more... 

It is often then that people come to experience some form of awakening. When they stop fighting. When they stop trying to escape. 

But wouldn't you rather make the change before you hit rock bottom? Is that even possible? Comment and let's discuss this. 

Personally, my life shows me that pain is what motivates us more than ever. But maybe there's a way to be motivated by love instead. The love for others and wanting to be happy and healthy for both us and them. 

The love for life, and wanting to live a great one. 

Something for your to hopefully benefit from. 

Anxiety can not be removed, but you can feel like a master samurai in the face of it, meaning it no longer has any power of you, it no longer scares you AND, it simply ain't a problem no more! 

Onto the next demon...

I was first prescribed anxiety medication shortly after I graduated high school, but refused to take it on a regular basis because I believed I could handle my anxiety without relying on medication. It was not until last month that I realized that I *do* need medication and I likely will for the rest of my life.

Some people can cope with their anxiety without medication. I am clearly not one of those people; I would take Lexapro on a daily basis only during times that I felt very anxious. Then, a few weeks later when I felt a little better, I would think to myself ""All good! Time to drop it."" That is obviously a completely flawed way of thinking.

I hate relying on medication to feel normal. I know that you probably hate relying on medication, too. But I am now just thankful that advances in science over the past hundred years have helped me to feel more normal...something that was not an option to those living long ago.

Hey guys.
I need to turn down a job before next week, and I‚Äôm going to do it tomorrow. The thing is, is that I feel like a major asshole about it.

I went to the interview yesterday and waited for almost 30 minutes, but the boss of the place didn‚Äôt show up. He didn‚Äôt call or send me any text messages regarding him being late, nothing. I sent him a message later that day informing him that I was there, and he said he had shown up an hour later with a simple ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù
That same night, someone I‚Äôm acquainted with messaged me and offered me a position in their company. This was a job that I had applied to before but unfortunately didn‚Äôt get, and the position is something I‚Äôm passionately burning for. I went to the interview today and we agreed that I would start next week.

Said boss at the first place who didn‚Äôt show up wants me to come back on Monday, and he wants me to work for him (his words) once a week. The pay fucking sucks compared to the other position that was literally fucking given to me, the boss is a well-known asshole since multiple of my friends have worked for him (discriminatory towards women, doesn‚Äôt pay on time, etc etc.) And I am MORTIFIED if he will flip his shit on me and yell at me through the phone.

This is stressing me out so much to the point of a panic attack, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this.",Anxiety,How to not feel like an asshole for turning down a job?,2021-03-12 04:25:32

I finally started getting treatment for my anxiety once it got to the point I was constantly unable to breathe. it happened a lot at work where i‚Äôd be literally gasping at the slightest stress, and even just like,,,‚Äùgetting excited‚Äù would cause the same effect (like getting excited over a conversation, my bf would grab me jokingly to play fight and i‚Äôd start wheezing so he‚Äôd have to stop and just be like ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, breathe, breathe with me‚Äù until I could finally breathe again. this has been getting better since getting on a medication, but my doctor said I need to see a specialist to get medication adjustments. 

another thing i‚Äôve noticed is i‚Äôve become significantly less anxious about my bf finding someone better, and a lot less stressed if I know he‚Äôll be around other girls. I knew he‚Äôd never cheat on me, I never worried about that, but I couldn‚Äôt stop panicking over things, and overthinking everything to the point of crying because I was scared he was going to leave me constantly even though our relationship was good. 

as well, I can FINALLY enjoy hobbies again. I had some much anxiety due to school because of my mom pressuring me constantly for all of my life about grades to the point that I would have panic attacks over assignments, and get so stressed id be in a constant state of panic anytime I tried to do anything I enjoyed because I felt like I was wasting time. I spent the entirety of my last semester doing literally nothing I enjoyed. I rewatched one show, and the rest of the semester all I did was schoolwork, hang out with my bf, and go to physical therapy to recover from surgery. 

after getting treatment, I can finally play video games again during the school semester, I can watch shows and movies with my bf AND on my own without freaking out the entire time. I can do homework and tests throughout the week without (as much) constant dread, and it‚Äôs so fucking relieving. 

my anxiety is definitely not fully handled, I think i‚Äôm going to need to either adjust my medication or try a new one if I want to fully stop having as many negative effects from it, but I just wanted to vent about how relieving it is to at least have some progress for the first time in my life now that I can seek treatment on my own since my mom, who knew, never wanted to take it seriously.",Anxiety,there are so many different things that I thought were normal to feel until I started getting treatment,2021-03-12 04:00:40

2535,drenh05,1615481319,1,"Hello. 

I have always been pretty anxious, but the last three years I've had shitty circumstances to go with it, which have made it a lot worse. 

Due to circumstances, my parents have moved out of our house and my brother and I have become the primary caregivers of two old dogs. Betty, the oldest dog has been living with severe arthritis and congestive heart failure for the past 2 years , which have progressively gotten worse. Due to various dips in her health condition, she has been handled quite a bit in the past few months, which has made her aggressive and causes her to lash out each time you try to help her, which has to be done several times, each day, since she can't get up on her own and suffers from incontinence. 

While she is having a tough time with her health, it has not affected her mentally other than the aggression, and she is quite receptive to love. She has an extremely strong will to live.

Two weeks ago, my grandfather passed away, and on the same day, my 15 year old had a stroke, which was extremely traumatizing to witness, since her body had gone limp, her tongue was blue and hanging out of her mouth, but she was still breathing. I was still reeling with grief from my grandfather's death, and seeing Betty in that state out of the blue flipped some switch in my head and I started screaming and crying outside my block uncontrollably and experienced something akin to a panic attack. We couldn't find our car keys anywhere, which made it worse, but eventually our neighbour lent us their car and we were able to get her help on time. 

Betty had had a heart attack followed by a stroke, which were triggered by an anger outburst. She has been put on medication for her heart. 

The past few years have just been a series of unfortunate events, one after another and I haven't truly got a break from them in a very long time. 

While I'm aware Betty is at an age where she could pass away anytime, I entered a horrible state of mind the day she had a stroke, and it still hasn't gone away. She is doing much better since, but still gets angry every day (though this is not constant). I'm the only one currently who she trusts, and have to calm her down each time we have to handle her for something (cleaning, tending to wounds, helping her get up etc). 

This process has become harrowing. Each time she growls, my heartbeat shoots up and I have to fight through unbearable nausea to continue keeping her calm, as I keep expecting the events of that day to replay once again. Other than this, I constantly experience free-floating anxiety, which makes me feel fatigued and uneasy throughout the day and my upper back becomes stiff and radiates pain erratically. 

I have lost all interest in activities I used to love, I feel like I've become a shell of the person I was and have been unable to break the cycle and do something for myself. I have also completely given up on college. 

Above all, I know things are going to be tough with Betty, but she's so keen on living, I want to help her the best I can, but my anxiety is constantly getting in the way and I want it to stop. My current state of bad mental health has not been caused solely by her condition, it's an amalgamation of numerous events that have occured over the last 3 years. 

I apologise for such a convoluted, disjointed post, but I have typed this out in desperation. I really need tips but I cannot, at the moment seek out a psychologist/counselor/psychiatrist.

2536,PeachCadaver,1615480367,1,"Hello Im(22F) new here and on mobile. I just want to know if what I'm experiencing is normal. 

About a month ago, I started training for a call center and was able to work at home. The training about call flow was alright but we started taking calls despite only being able to navigate two functions in the system. We were receiving calls that we were not trained for, dealing heavily with customer retention, and trying to type to our supervisor and waiting for their responses for help while on the phone. I am a nervous person with mild social anxiety, but this job took it's toll on me.

As a result, this situation triggered anxiety in me in a way I have never felt before. I woke up for several days feeling nauseous, nervous, and very tired. Sometimes I wouldn't even be nervous and just really nauseous. I quit that job for obvious reasons, but I still feel that queasy nervousness every so often. For everyday low stress situations or even in my down time that specific feeling will come up. Yesterday the doctor's office mistakenly sent me an email that I had HPV and I was sick for most of the day.

I won't go into too many details but my life is very stressful right now as well. Money, family, the prospect of moving out, bf issues...it's complicated and I find myself shifting between angry and sad often. I was wondering if anyone out there has dealt with this sick feeling or an event that has sort of triggered an onset of anxiousness that has stayed with them?

2537,No-Cat-1322,1615480210,1,"I've always struggled with anxiety when it comes to socal life and responsibilities, although I only realized it two years ago. Messed up my education because of it. Keep people at arms length because I'm embarassed of myself. Hesitant to engange in relationships, despite longing to do so.

Around this time last year I ended a relationship of 1 year, mostly because I couldn't handle the hardships and face the fuckups I'd caused us. I felt like I was dragging her down with me. Often things were great, but eventually something would come back to haunt me, and I would pretty much shut down. I pushed her away long enough for both of us to call it quits. I tell myself she's better of without me, but I keep reliving every good and shitty moment we had together. I keep thinking of all the stupid shit I could've done differently. And now every time I want to reach out to someone, I pull back and hide...

Just past autumn last year, I quit my old long-standing job to try something new. I was ecstatic at the time for finally taking a chance at something other than a soul-sucking job in retail. But now, I have doubts... I feel like I'm way out of my depth, and instead of trying to ask for help from colleagues, I'm dragging my feet and trying to avoid whatever needs to get done. My boss and everyone else has been really welcoming and offering their help whenever, but I can't shake this feeling of inferiority and just not belonging there.

The last 2 weeks my anxiety has been gradually building, with yesterday and today being the worst its been in a long while. Could barely sleep. Eating makes me feel sick. I'm barely working, and getting away with it due to most of us working from home. I've decided to jump ship from work, and find someplace else.

So, you want to.

Maybe you want to¬†stop thinking¬†about a recent breakup, or¬†feel discouraged¬†from a year of physical distancing and want to embrace a more hopeful perspective.

Unwanted thoughts can cause plenty of frustration and distress. You‚Äôre not alone in wanting to make them go away. It‚Äôs normal to have trouble convincing yourself to¬†look up¬†when feeling downcast in the face of stress and other challenges.

While actual mind control belongs in the realm of science fiction, you¬†can¬†work to change your mindset. It might take some effort to learn the trick of regaining control, but the 10 strategies below can help.

Identify the thoughts you want to change

You have to figure out what‚Äôs on your mind before you can begin to control it.

Nearly everyone experiences discouraging thoughts or emotional setbacks from time to time. If you‚Äôre currently experiencing some life challenges, you might find it even harder to maintain control over spiraling thoughts or your overall mindset.

Occasional¬†intrusive thoughts¬†are pretty normal, too. They can be distressing, but they often pass as quickly as they intruded, especially when you¬†don‚Äôt engage¬†with them.

Other troubling thought patterns might include:

rumination, or looping thoughts

negative self-talk

cognitive biases, or errors in thinking that can affect your choices or interactions

a fixed pessimistic outlook

Identifying specific thoughts and patterns can help you make the most out of the other tips that follow.

Accept unwanted thoughts

It‚Äôs human nature to flinch away from pain, so of course, you‚Äôd prefer to avoid thoughts that cause distress.

Yet pushing away unwanted thoughts isn‚Äôt the way to¬†gain control. That usually just makes them more intense.

Instead, try the opposite: Accept those thoughts, and let them in.

Say you feel a little low because nothing in your life seems to be happening the way you planned despite all your hard work.

Acceptance might involve telling yourself, ‚ÄúNothing seems to be going right, and that‚Äôs discouraging. There‚Äôs only so much you can do to create change yourself, but giving up entirely isn‚Äôt the answer either.‚Äù

Acceptance can even offer clues as to why specific thoughts keep coming up.

Maybe you keep thinking about a fling who¬†ghosted¬†you. Accepting those persistent thoughts leads you to recognize that you wanted your connection to last.

Their disappearing act left you with unresolved questions and an overwhelming sense of unworthiness. You worry you‚Äôve failed at dating and feel anxious about trying again.

Acknowledging these fears allows you to confront them and remind yourself that you‚Äôre not to blame for their bad manners.

Keeping the situation in perspective can help you manage your worries about it happening again instead of letting fear hold you back from finding someone new.",Anxiety,Tips on having a better mind control,2021-03-12 00:26:07

Let's say I feel relatively okay, then suddenly I start feeling this intense fear (usually after thinking of something or just walking around and feeling exposed, but often it's not something very clear). The fear might come gradually but quickly and I end up feeling unsafe, feeling this paralysing fear/dread so intense that I feel unable to do anything and it lasts for hours. I've been researching this topic to understand what is happening to me but I couldn't find anything like this, they talk about either anxiety (which implies worry, stress and thinking a lot, and at the beginning I might do that a bit but then when the fear appears I stop thinking about anything but the fear won't subside) or panic attack (I had a couple of those, they feel similar to what I have but the panic attack is more sudden and more intense).

2564,blanknewaccount,1615468372,1,"Trigger warning: sex abuse.

I hope this okay, I just needed to tell someone but I don‚Äôt want to have this conversation with anyone I know in real life.

I had a moment in the shower today when I was thinking to myself about when my mental health first started to go downhill and then I remembered something that happened when I was 13-14 years old.

I was at an al boys boarding school and when I moved there when I was 13. The environment there was very homoerotic while also being extremely homophobic. 

At night we would all sit on each other‚Äòs beds and hang out after the lights were out. 

One of my friends started coming to my bed to try to arouse me. It was definitely always him that approached me by initiated it. Eventually he started touching me and I liked it. Eventually he started doing things to me.

I was just too young for that to happen to me. I didn‚Äôt really understand my sexuality or sexuality at all. 

Over time, he started to do more stuff to me and started almost jokingly reminding me that he could tell people that I was gay. That would have destroyed me and ruined my time at school. He even would come into my rooms sometimes and try to make me talk about it without telling me there were other guys outside the door. I don‚Äôt think he told anyone, he just made sure that he could.

It continued but my mental health really started to suffer. I was in an unreal depression. I didn‚Äôt want to be gay, and side point I‚Äòm not exactly, and it absolutely ate me up inside. I became hyper aware of sexuality and was plagued by anxiety and self hatred. There were a few times that I didn‚Äôt really want to but, I suppose there was that implication. 

I grew into a really unwell teenager. I was hyper sexual but at the same time so completely riddled with anxiety that I was basically sexually terrified. I was honestly suicidal. That anxiety morphed into other anxieties and I forgot that original one. And I turned to drugs and alcohol whenever and as frequently as I could.

I was very angry in my early 20s. Drinking and university didn‚Äôt help. I saw a girl for 1.5 years but it was a toxic mess. I was so depressed and I didn‚Äôt know why, I was completely addicted to being loved but I was also so unable to have any real form of intimacy. It dissolved into a nightmare that I couldn‚Äôt see how I could have been like that. My parents had an awful divorce which added to my relation anxiety but there was something about ‚Äûbeing with someone‚Äú that I couldn‚Äôt handle. When that ended, I desperately sought female validation. I realised that I‚Äôve had this issue since I was a teen too. I very much think that came about as a need to define myself again women and not men because of the intense shame I felt at the time. 

I‚Äôve been confused about my sexuality for years now. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm straight or bisexual. It was an old worry for me but I forgot that it started with me wondering if I was gay or if I was straight and the things that were being done to me felt good. 

I feel more comfortable with it now. I went to a few gay bars and have kissed some guys to see. I‚Äòm in a long term relationship with a woman now so it hasn‚Äôt come back up. I‚Äôm still not entirely sure if I‚Äôm too straight or too unable to do this with men due to what happened to me. I feel really sad to think that potentially such a large part of my identity was totally suffocated by this.

At some points in my life I was so obsessed with idea of being a man, which unfortunately led to some pretty bad opinions which I‚Äôve since rectified, that I was completely unable to life in any sort of honest way with myself. 

I just didn‚Äôt realise how much it impacted me until today. I had really almost forgotten it and now its somehow really hit me hard to think about properly how so much of my issues of shame, anxiety, depression, and issues with some parts of sexuality, came from this I feel kind of empty. 

It‚Äôs been well over a decade since that all happened but I‚Äôve been living with it‚Äôs legacy everyday without even being aware of it.

2565,Internal_Manager8083,1615466734,1,"This is a deep personal rant about my anxieties about marriage,relationship and the shitty hetero laws about always having to be heterosexual in order to be concidered normal since if you're not normal you're bullied. I am also deeply concerned if I will attract toxic,abusive husband due to my trauma and high tolerance of abuse and not knowing how to call out/stand up for my self since I am too fragile. Self respecting people with confidence attract good and healthy and loyal friends, so I am anxious, since I am awkward, anxious, depressed mess I attract bad people into my life and don't know how to change or what to do. I improve but I do it, very slowly. I still don't know how to fix my broken core.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have had sometimes negative thoughts and a few  nightmares in my life about marrying an abusive man. I was wondering how to deal with my anxiety. I have pressure from my parents to marry but I find dicks to not be particularly attrractive. In fact no sexual organ is and I don't even know if I like men sexually but being lgbtq is forbidden and so is lgbtq marriage. I do like both men and women but that is not accepted so people like me get bullied a lot. I don't know how or why I should like me because theyr'e....so agressive and disgusting. I do find some cute, really want to cuddle them and date them, but they have no interest in me. That hurts me and makes me never try dating and generalize men and put them into all one group - bad/abusive/scary/creepy/ which is not fair. There have been many men who were good to me but due to being touch starved/jealous dumbass I forget.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I sometimes have nightmares, since I have many problems and a big trauma to deal with, I have watched that predators of any kind prey on people who are already hurt so when you're marrying someone, you never know if he will beat you up daily one year later and your children and come home drunk. My father tries to calm down my nerves by talking to me but I am still pretty much in my man hating period, since it feels physically safe to stay there. It is irrational but in my mind if I hate men, they can no longer hurt me or touch me anymore. I am pretty much afraid I will have to have sex with some man some day and have children from him and he will be abusive towards me and not loving at all which is what I crave from my partner, whether a man or a woman. How can I deal with my anxiety, this not something new, it has been going for a few years but I have no idea how to deal with it. I have talked to my mother but she pretty much never knows what to tell me and just listens to me which does not calm me down. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I try to read about different therapies such as CBT since I can't go to a real psychologist now, and plus I have to pay again. I want to heal before I get into a relationship but I feel like I will have to take a lot of time to heal from all of my traumas.  As in I may become 60 or so until I fully heal and I won't be able to be a mother at that age if you understand what I meant. Plus guys are not interested and don't want to date me which only hurts my ego. It's as if I am ugly or lack something that guys never fly towards me, but are attracted like a magnet towards girls who look objectivly sexy but to me they're manipulative, too loud and have horrible personalities because they don't mind being immoral-some of the girls who had the most boyfriends had a thing for stealing, constantly lying on purpose, cheating,etc. I am no angel, I am just oblivious and tactless,and misread social cues but I try to change that. I know I should have healthy self esteem before I enter into a relationship so I am trying to do exactly that, fix my self esteem, but I am also touch starved and desire to be touched so I just hug my pillow to sleep better but I can't shake the thought out of my mind that I could have an abusive partner since I know mostly abusive people from my childhood and teenagehood and developed unhealthy coping mechanisms.

To cut a long story short. A popular user was called out last year for general bad behaviour, spreading false rumours about people, nd for invalidating trans people. There's also big discussion on whether or not she's ableist. Some disabled people have commented saying she is and others have commented saying they weren't offended.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this has been going on for a year and doesn't seem like it will stop any time soon. 

Writing her name into social media comes up with huge amounts of people saying they hate her, she's a piece of sh!t, she's a dirtbag, her art is ugly, what she has done should never be forgotten, that nobody should interact with her, that if they see you following her they will block you, that people should stay away from her, and that she's a bad person.

I have PTSD from a suicide related incident and grew hypervigilant sensing that this could easily lead to her suicide. I made multiple comments saying that I understand why people are angry at her and that it's fair to criticize her, but it's not acceptable to say these hateful things online. I said that this is cyberbullying and ends in suicides. And that the people who originalloriginally made her callout need to take responsibility and reign people in, as they have the biggest platform. I got angry and said that because of the way this has escalated, it would be on them if she kills herself and that they all need to take responsibility and change the way they are going about this. I said that they have to be aware of the hateful messages their callout has prompted, and that it is their responsibility to put an end to the hate. I said that if they don't, they will need to hold themselves accountable for causing a suicide.

2585,Temporary-Island-259,1615457992,1,"(TW: non-familial domestic abuse, cursing)

I'm looking for advice, or just some nice words and support.

For context: I'm an adult man, I've been managing my anxiety with medication and therapy for years now. I'm seeing a therapist in addition to making this post. I'm just interested in how you all have coped when someone has seriously triggered your anxiety.

My roommate recently moved out, and it has been a messy process. She has made my domestic situation a misery. She has been aggressive, verbally abusive, and unable/unwilling to take responsibility for any of her mess. She's worn me down to a shell of myself, and I'm struggling sleep soundly at night. It helped to change the lock on my door, so that I know she can't possibly get inside, but I'm still struggling. Bringing up anything with her (calmly) was taken as an attack on her, and the most mildest, meekest of requests would result in a screaming fit. I ended up moving my table against my door because I was afraid she'd come into my room and try to do something to me.

My sleep has been affected, and my mood is almost constantly low. The move-out hasn't been finalised yet, so I still unfortunately have to be in contact with her to sort out some paperwork and stuff. Which is hellish. She is such a immature brat. I asked her about damage she'd done to the property (damage I was handling), and she replied by calling me a c\*nt. Charming, right?

I don't know how to handle a person who is so aggressive and frightening. I'm struggling to seek help for this, as she is younger than me, and I am a man. I feel like people don't take me, or my anxiety, seriously. Whereas if the roles were reversed, and I was a woman being mistreated by a man, people might find the situation more concerning. I contacted the police after she verbally abused me, asking whether they could help me, but they said that they wouldn't do anything unless she hit me. The cop on the phone sounded amused.

So, I'm just... on my own. Trying to sleep through the night, being woken by every loud noise, wondering if she's outside my door. I'm scared to go outside, I'm scared that she'll be waiting for me. I've never talked with a man about being abused by a woman.

Summary: 
My mom is an traditional-stubborn-irrational immigrant that has some crazy beliefs when it comes to mental health. Which are not allowing her to get any professional help or even admit that she has anxiety in the first place. 

She has really a bad case of anxiety and has had it for like a decade now. But recently it‚Äôs gotten way out of control with Covid and other things. She her anxiety attacks have grown to be more frequent and more serious. She also just constantly lives in a state of worry and fear.

However, when I try to talk to her about it, she stays quiet and ignores the conversation. 

It‚Äôs crazy because in her head she thinks that if the government finds out she has anxiety (which her doctors already knows) then they are gonna force her to take drugs that will make her go crazy. Then they are going to take my little brother away from her. 

I am lost on what to do. I have tried forcing her to see a therapist, I tried telling her to talk to her doctor, I tried creating a healthy loving environment, I tried talking to her myself. But nothing has helped.

2623,Zer0W0lfe,1615439834,1,"I struggle with anxiety related tics and I thought I would share some of my strategies to deal with them. I also hope some people can put other suggestions in the comments both for adding to the list and because honestly I would like to know more. 

First things first, try not to give them any significance. They say to ignore them but that simply isn‚Äôt possible in most situations. I find it much more helpful to just treat it like it‚Äôs normal and nothing to worry about, as opposed to treating it like it‚Äôs non existent. It brings down the anxiety. 

Second, I will try to do/say something else when I feel the tic urge coming on. I can‚Äôt always do it fast enough but often snapping my fingers can prevent a painful tic. 

Lastly, I tell the people closest to me about them and that they should ignore them and then avoid bringing it up again. This allows them to know not to be concerned when they happen, and decreases anxiety around it from having someone see them. I find that the more I talk about them the worse they get, so bringing it up once and not mentioning it often after that helps. 

I hope this is helpful! When I first got tics I didn‚Äôt know much about them, just that I shouldn‚Äôt think about them. That information didn‚Äôt help at all. So hopefully if you‚Äôre new to them and you read this it can set you on a good path to managing them. 

Remember this, even if the tics get bad, it‚Äôs not your fault. It‚Äôs really challenging to get in a mental state where you accept them and it gets better, and if you are having trouble, that‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt stress about not stressing about them. That defeats the point. If talking about it with people makes it less stressful for you, then by all means do that. Do whatever makes you feel calmer. 

If you reach a point when your tics are making you feel really frustrated or scared and you want to talk, put a comment here or send me a message and I will try to respond.",Anxiety,Three tips for tics,2021-03-11 16:17:14

I wanna start off by saying I would never do anything to anyone that‚Äôs young or doesn‚Äôt consent. That‚Äôs a terrible thing to do

But the reason I‚Äôm worrying is my parents said earlier today if a man becomes hard he likes whatever‚Äôs going on.

I‚Äôve also gotten hard from dogs licking me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I wanna have sex with the dog. I‚Äôm so worried I secretly liked the baby being on my lap and I wanna do sexual things

So can a man get hard without actually wanting do have sex or like what‚Äôs going on?

And am I a pedophile or bad person???

As a therapist I have seen employees so overwhelmed with the demands of caring for their children while still trying to work full time that they are on the brink of a mental health crisis. I have seen employers increase expectations on employees working from home since they no longer have a commute. Yet, despite all we know about how tough this year has been I hear time and time again about employers punishing and micromanaging rather than offering the support that is needed.

I myself ran into this on a day when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and had started a new job. When I explained to my new supervisor that I was feeling overwhelmed and my baby was sick, the response was simply let me know when your hours are posted along with a very invalidating message about how they had it much worse. If a mental health supervisor is unable to provide support and at the very least ask if my baby is ok what can I expect for all the other employers out there not in my field? How can employers be asked to hold their employees to the same standard knowing how drastically situations have changed?

I've had migraines over the last few months, one sided numbness, dizziness, tinnitus, heart palpitations, a stress rash, neck pain, a smorgasbord of visual disturbances, severe insomnia, derealization and depersonalization. Now I get a tingly cold feeling head, usually on the left side at night when I'm getting really anxious about things.

Despite this my blood panels are healthy. I had full exam examinations of my eyes and they are healthy. My general check up was healthy. The doctors do not think there is any cause to scan my head and say that even if they did scan me and find nothing it would only bring temporary relief (I understand but I still wish I could have the proof, you know?). They're adamant that I am well and have severe anxiety due to the pandemic.

I'm at the point where I'm scared to sleep because of the fear that something is wrong with me. I need to keep busy and be listening to something all the time or I can't deal with my thoughts. Every time I feel a symptom like the head thing, or feel slightly off in my body, I worry and spiral. I am on a waiting list for therapy but really struggling.

2662,danielerich,1615429616,1,"Hello all. How‚Äôs everything? (I‚Äôm a 21 year old male)I‚Äôll try to keep this short, yet descriptive as possible. 

Since I was 18, I‚Äôve had massive hypochondria, to the point where it‚Äôs killed all my motivation and caused depression. It all started heavily interfering with my life due to a panic attack on weed when I first turned 19, which psychologically screwed me up for a while. My biggest fear back then was developing schizophrenia. Boy, let me tell you, it was quite possibly the scariest and disturbing time of my life. I would have compulsions to check symptoms online, replay songs or videos to make sure I wasn‚Äôt hearing voices, looking at objects/people for a while to make sure I wasn‚Äôt hallucinating, and stay in my room all day so I didn‚Äôt trigger any fears. I heard it was possibly OCD but I never got a proper diagnosis. Anyways, that fear went away after I started taking care of myself and just accepted whatever came, which I‚Äôm quite proud of. 

......but then I started having physical symptoms like muscle fasciculations, panic attacks, brain fog, smelling wiffs of smoke for 1-2 seconds when there was none, high blood pressure, etc. I thought my fear for my health left, but it quite frankly came back and bit me in the ass. I started assuming the worst. When I had muscle twitches, I thought I was developing ALS (the disease Stephen hawking had). When I had brain fog, I thought I was having a psychotic episode. When I smelled the smoke (which I still do to this day), I immediately think I have a growing brain tumor, mainly because Dr. Google says so. It‚Äôs been flaring up and down between months. 

For the most part, it comes in waves and absolutely cripples me, mainly because I simply don‚Äôt want to die. Right now, it‚Äôs breaking me down and killing any sort of ambition. My new biggest fears are melanoma and a brain tumor. I have this small weird mark on my face all my life that hasn‚Äôt changed per say, but want to get checked out ASAP. It doesn‚Äôt fill any of the warning signs, but I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs melanoma because my brain is a straight up dick and wants to think it is. And I still have the brain tumor fear because of the wiffs of smoke I still smell. I have literally have no other neurological symptoms that would shout ‚Äúbrain tumor‚Äù, but again, i think I have one. 


I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis because I already have a doctors appointment in the next 2 weeks. But I know this hypochondria problem in itself is a huge issue that I need to take care of. I just have no idea how to deal with it because like I‚Äôve said before, it causes major depression. It makes it seem like everything I do in my life is pointless because I could have this stage 4 cancer or something that could kill me at any moment. I‚Äôve tried to apply the same acceptance philosophy that I used for my fear of schizophrenia, but it just adds on the whole pointless and bleak perspective I have on life right now. Everything looks dark and bleak for my future and I‚Äôm exhausted from worrying all the time. I just want it to end. 

I‚Äôm currently in college and taking a math class that I want a A in so bad, but can‚Äôt bring myself to do.

Usually whenever I need to go back on to Zoloft, 50mg works wonders for years.

However, since I had my last baby (10 months ago) my anxiety has been through the roof. Every day I have had terrible symptoms, like the ones you get when you‚Äôre having a panic attack. Tightness in the chest, insomnia, shortness of breath ect.

I am currently on 200mg of Zoloft now and it only has taken the edge off. I can breathe a little better, feel less mentally anxious and can sleep. But it is still there.
It has never been this bad, even diazepam (Valium) does not work.

Doctors are just telling me that the tablet may not be as effective now because I am older and because I am anxious over Covid (not true at all!)

My regular doctor has put me on such a high dose because he tell me it‚Äôs better the devil I know, because starting a new medication can give bad side effects.

2676,Smoky-The-Beer,1615424458,1,"I‚Äôve had anxiety for quite some time. I first was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 22 years old. It comes and goes. Each time I‚Äôve been diagnosed and placed on medication it was because some extremely stressful situations were occurring (for example: was in an abusive relationship the first time. The 2nd time I was diagnosed my father was diagnosed with cancer, my father-in-law was in the hospital for 7 months awaiting a heart transplant, and myself + 2 other co-workers were in the middle of a harassment investigation against our supervisor - all of this happening at once. The 3rd time I was diagnosed and given medication was May 2020 (I was 31 years old) because I lost my job, the pandemic was stressful, my father-in-law was very ill and then eventually passed away, and I felt very isolated &amp; lonely, both due to the pandemic lockdowns and from not having friends yet in the city my husband and I had just moved to a few months prior to Covid.  

The first 2 times, once I got past the things that truly fueled my anxiety and panic attacks, my anxiety subsided all on its own and life went back to normal, until the next string of bad events. However, this time, my anxiety will not go away. 

I finally have a job again (part-time remote job for the moment, but will be full-time and in an office by January 2022), with things slowly opening up we‚Äôre making some friends in our new area, we go hiking every weekend because the weather is so perfect where we are, and my husband and I just bought our first home (which we move into by Fall since it‚Äôs in a new-build project). Everything is falling into place and I genuinely feel so happy for the first time in years, except for the fact my anxiety actually is worse now than last year when things were bad. 

I attribute my increasing anxiety to the home my husband and I bought. I‚Äôm terrified of growing up. Although we‚Äôve lived together and in our own apartments for 6 years now, renting didn‚Äôt make it feel so real and adult. Owning a house does. I‚Äôm afraid of getting older. I‚Äôm afraid that since we lost my father-in-law last year that perhaps my parents and mother-in-law won‚Äôt be far behind. I‚Äôm terrified of losing my parents (something that keeps me up most nights). I‚Äôm also afraid of losing my husband. I‚Äôm also afraid that since we‚Äôll own a home, the next step is to have a child or two; I‚Äôm still very on the fence on if I want to have a child or adopt one... either way frightens me. I‚Äôm almost 32 now, but I don‚Äôt feel old enough or mature enough to be having children. It all just terrifies the heck out of me. And it all causes me to have multiple panic attacks weekly; always out of the blue. 

I wish I could see a therapist or psychologist regularly, but without health insurance it‚Äôs just not something I can afford. All I can afford is to see a regular physician per month and have her refill my anti-anxiety medication; something she wants me to be off of within the next few months - which perpetuates my anxiety because without medication, how in the world will I make it through my terrible panic attacks and anxiety-inducing situations? 

I wish I could be normal. I wish I didn‚Äôt have this debilitating anxiety. I wish I could just enjoy the journey of life without constant fear and worry. I wish I had the energy and motivation to do more with my days than waste them bingeing Netflix and taking naps (the days I don‚Äôt work of course). I wish I could just be ‚Äúme‚Äù again.

I am studying at the uni to become a teacher (it has been 5 years ,should have been finished last year )

And there are some subjects that require us to be more talkative and even present some long lectures for our friends ( we will also visit schools as interns )

The problem is, even though I got used to presenting in front of the class , there is a teacher who makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, I m pretty sure I am the only in the class who feels that way, I hate to use this word but the "" vibe "" is unbearable.

The weird part is she doesn't do anything wrong, she is considered to be one of the best teachers in my department, most students like her style (she is very thorough with her teaching) but I just feel like I have to drop out of school everytime I realize that I have to attend one of her lectures. I never stressed about other teachers and the grades I got.

2690,whoacoach,1615419197,1,"I have a very hard time believing that guys like Shaan Kassam, Trey Jones, and Jordan Hardgrave are actually legit when it comes to helping people overcome anxiety disorder. Shaan guarantees 100% recovery in his programs yet you hardly ever see or hear a success story unless it's from his paid Facebook group. He also charges out the ass to even do his program, over $3,000 I believe and it's only for people that are 100% in on fully recovering. Aren't we all?

I don't know much about Jordan, but I hear that he also only interested in money. If you ask him for his credentials he will say ""most people that ask that don't sign up"", basically tell you to fuck off since you aren't giving him money and says the only credentials you need to see are the positive reviews on his website. I read this from another reddit post from a while back and it really wouldn't surprise me if this were true. Also those ""reviews"" could be written by any motherfucker on the planet, could be someone who was paid off to write some shit or burner accounts made to make positive posts. 

Next is Trey Jones and while I think he's the ""best"" out of the 3, I will say that some of his stuff is bullshit and he repeats shit for the sake of his Youtube channel. You'll see videos of him covering topics that he already covered before, it's like he's struggling for content so he needs to repeat and remake videos he's already done for the sake of continuing to get views. I also purchased his bootcamp program that was a complete waste of money, and I should have known better but I was desperate at the time of purchasing it. It literally goes over things that he puts out for free on his Youtube channel, no lie. I'm not kidding, there's actually one section in the program that's about ""letting out your battle cry"" to combat anxiety. You've gotta be kidding me, this is that garbage he puts out for an $80.

This is just my take on these guys and I'd love to hear what other people have heard or experienced from these guys or even other anxiety ""gurus"" out there that claim they will cure you of all your shit for the small fee of a few house payments.

About a week later they resolved and for about two weeks I was good and felt that I had found a good combination. I was so good that I applied and started a new job, but as soon as the day to start came I got very depressed and anxious again. My doctor increased my buspar as well as zoloft, so I was on 200 mg of Zoloft and 20 mg of Buspar, and over time I got a little better. That unfortunately only lasted about 5 days and now for the past 3 weeks I've been going through insane mood swings. One day I will be totally good and feel like the worst is passed and the next I will be in tears on the phone with my parents saying I feel hopeless. My current dose of Buspar is 30 mg, and I just can't honestly say I feel like I'm doing better. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, but I just feel like I'm in such a low place and I don't know what to do to feel back to normal. I don't know if this is anxiety, or budding depression, or what, but I just know I've had a very bad go of it this last month or so.

Hello, I just wanted to post something as I have no idea where to turn. I had a major falling out with a friend over the weekend, and we haven‚Äôt spoken since as she asked for space between us.

Before I continue, this isn‚Äôt just because of what happened, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over 10 years ago, but this event has really honed in on my issues.

Since then, I cannot stop thinking about it and have had constant panic attacks. To make matters worse, I had been off work for annual leave and return tomorrow (11/03). I really don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to manage it, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the fallout which leads to anxiety and consequent panic attacks. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can hold it together work and how to move on/focus on something else.

2694,Thisden,1615418730,1,"**Time anxiety**

Time anxiety is the feeling that you have not done enough to meet your goals or that you're not using the time you do have effectively.

Time anxiety is more than feeling overwhelmed at times - it haunts your days and causes you to procrastinate on essential tasks.

**Three types of time anxiety:**

* **Daily time anxiety:** It is the feeling of not having enough time in your day.
* **Future time anxiety:** You feel paralyzed thinking through every *'what if?*' that may or may not happen.
* **Existential time anxiety**: The feeling of only having a limited time to live your life.

**Overcoming time anxiety**

*Overcoming time anxiety boils down to awareness, understanding, and action.*

Being aware of what you spend your time on can lessen your anxiety. But too much observation over every aspect of your life can add to your time anxiety. **It's about finding a balance between awareness and action.**

**Acknowledge your relationship with time**

* *Time exists.*
* *You can't stop the clock from moving or slow it down.*
* *You only have control over what you do in the future.*

Time anxiety increases when we try to ignore or manipulate the ways time impacts our day. Acknowledging these truths can reduce anxiety and help you move forward.

**Understand the planning fallacy**

We often think 8 hours of work time means we can schedule all 8 hours. However, **most people have at best 2.5 hours of real productive time a day.**

*At work, most people spend:*

* *15% of their time in meetings,*
* *25-30% on email, chat, and video calls, and*
* *40% multitasking and working sub-optimally.*

This breakdown can help you understand the limitations you have to work within. **The goal is to be realistic about what you can do with the time you do have.**

**Make space for the things that matter**

To feel motivated, you first need to act, then motivation will follow.

Look at your time well-spent activities and fit them into your day. In other words, **think about how and when your most meaningful tasks will fit into a real day.** Understanding how to use your limited supply of time on what truly matters will help you cut out time-wasters that add to your time anxiety.

**Practice being a ‚ÄòSatisficer‚Äô instead of a ‚ÄòMaximiser‚Äô**

* **Maximizers** try to make a choice that will give the maximum benefit later on.
* **Satisficers** make choices according to their set of current criteria. Nothing more.

Trying to maximize every day will lead to more time anxiety. Instead, use your time well-spent activities and **decide on what fits your time best** ***now***\*\*\*\*\*\*.

2699,CherylTuntIRL,1615418130,1,"Since I hit my late teenage years I have struggled with saying 'no' to people in personal relationships. It has never been an issue in the workplace, I have always been very confident in a professional setting and have held multiple managerial positions over the years.
  
I think the ultimate root of this anxiety is a fear of abandonment with a degree of feeling responsible for others' mental wellbeing. It has always been particularly hard to say no in a romantic setting, which has led to some really bad dates. I've also struggled with saying no to lending money to friends, and I'm down at least ¬£1k as a result. I've written it off as bad debt, but I never seemed to learn from past incidences. 
 
Until now, that is. As I'm nearing my 31st year on the planet, I feel myself becoming more confident and more able to say no. I put it down to my new job, which is mind-bogglingly busy. Even when not in the office I'm responding to emails and generally being involved with the charity, and I absolutely love it! It's a job with a high degree of responsibility and gives me a great deal of autonomy, which suits my working style.

***Sections to this post:***

1. **Things that scare me**
2. **Why I struggle to get support**
3. **My frustrations**

# 1) Things that scare me

* In brief: Loud noises, crowded spaces, new places/situations/people, spontaneous events where I don't know the rules, who will be there, how long it will be, what will happen ect, specific locations, specific topics of discussion
* My bedroom is my safe space, I don't leave it. I find it incredibly difficult (ranges from 7/10 as a minimum to 10/10 difficulty) to leave my room. Thankfully, this year at uni I have an en suite, but last year, It would take me a minimum of 30 minutes to talk myself into leaving my room just to go to THE BATHROOM. I would stand behind my door crying because I needed to go to the bathroom but couldn't work up the courage to leave for fear that someone will see me in the corridor. How STUPID!!!  This fear of leaving my room is still severe currently too. I cannot enter the kitchen, I avoid it to the point that I do not buy any food that needs refrigeration and just keep basic foods in my room that are able to be kept at room temperature. I stopped eating dairy and having milk in my tea and coffee because of this fear. I cannot enter the living room of this house for fear of people being in there. I avoid the living room, and go out of the back door when I need to go to the laundromat instead of taking the most direct (and 10 mins quicker due to a garden shortcut) route of using the front door. When someone called me out on this strange habit, I told them I just like walking and wanted to go the long way. I won't go to society events, even though I desperately want to. I won't see any of my housemates even though I DESPERATELY want to. I want to be friends with them, but I have such severe anxiety I can't make it out of my room to see them. I will battle with myself for on average 2 hours each night trying and trying to get myself to leave my room just to catch people when they're having dinner so I can socialize a little, but most of the time I just end up having a panic attack and stressing myself out so much that I pass out, vomit, induce a migraine, or a combination of the 3. Sometimes Im successful and I make it out of my room, but then last minute bail and run back to my room, hyperventilating. Sometimes (its happened 4 times in the last 2 months) I make it down to one of the shared rooms (kitchen, living room, garden ect) and socialize with people. I felt **SO** proud of myself, but to everyone else, I haven't made any achievement because no one knows of my struggles. Not a single soul in person. Not my family, not my teachers, not my housemates, not any friends (if i can even call the people I know friends), only one single person I met online, who I have alluded some basic things to (but they only know very surface level/ basic things about my struggles, though I am proud of managing to tell someone who already knew some things about me (and thus its not totally anonymous like this is)). So essentially, you people reading this post will be the first people on this planet to hear of my struggles in this level of detail. Im too scared to say everything, but I am about to vent about a lot of things. And you'll be the first to hear... To my housemates, they dont have a clue of my struggles, and so they just think I'm incredibly reclusive and possibly rude and want to avoid them (NOT TRUE!). I wish they knew. I want to have someone to support me, to understand me, to look after me when Im panicking and upset, to be proud of me when I do something that terrifies me, to help me when I am so bad that I cant even get out of bed. 
* Another thing that scares me, is telling people that Im not ok. I go to extreme measures to ensure people think that I am fine, that I am normal, and that there is nothing out of the ordinary about me. Essentially, I try to be so boring that I blend into the background and no one notices me. I hate this, but I cant stop. The idea of opening up to people scares me so much. There are so many unknown variables- *what will they think of me? Will they judge me? Think im stupid? Laugh at me? Tell other people? Hate me? Stop trying to interact with me? Tell me to grow up and get over it? To worry about something real? To think of all the people with worse lives than me? That I dont matter and they dont care?* The list goes on and on... some of these are things people have told me before, so the fear is reinforced with a memory of ""proof"". Parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, siblings, teachers, the school counsellor, strangers...Ive never really had people be nice to me before. No one understands me, and always reacts to me with anger, sarcasm, indifference, or some other sort of mean and unsympathetic/unempathetic. Those responses have only made me hate myself more. I think my fear of telling people that im not ok comes from childhood troubles. I was severely bullied from a very young age (it always surprises people how young I was when the bullying started). I dont want to think too much about what the bullies said and did to me for all those years, but In short, it left me, a small child who had only just started their formal education in elementary school, suicidal. I wanted to die. I dont even know how I knew that death was a thing at that age. But i did want to. I tried twice, but being so young, my attempts did not go anywhere. But the intention was there, which scares me a bit. I am glad nothing actually happened those times. I am glad for that. But i still have thoughts of harm and thoughts of self hatred a lot, those never went away. The worst of those are often intrusive rather than thoughts that I actually want to consider. I am too fearful of death to ever take my own life- no one needs to worry about that. I want to live a long life, maybe into my 100's if im lucky. But back to the story. Bullying left me suicidal, I started having big meltdowns/tantrums when I was at home, shouting about concerning things, and this led to my parents contacting the school. The school counsellors told me to grow up and ""stop telling tales"" when I told them of my problems. I sobbed about my only ever friend who moved schools, and they said ""just forget about her, you need to grow up \[name\]"". After that day, I vowed to never tell anyone I wasnt ok again. I just started lying to them to get them off my back and they forgot about me, thinking I was happy. I wasnt, I had just learnt that I couldnt trust adults to look after me or care about me, and I learnt that I was on my own so I better start protecting myself by not letting anyone in. And now I cant break this habit, I cant trust people enough to open up and Its really, really hindering my ability to get help that I need. 
* I have some bad habits (self harm (NOTHING SERIOUS!), restrictive eating which sometimes gets replaced with stress eating, going on runs until I vomit, maladaptive daydreaming), I am seriously terrified of people finding out. Because people may assume the worst, and tell others and think that im ""a risk"" or something. Im not a risk. I can promise everyone that. Im not stupid, these are only things to help me cope, not to cause actual harm. But because of this, I cant confide in anyone about these bad habits because no one would give me just plain understanding and support, they'd just tell me how bad these things are and would contact welfare services at my uni or something. And the uni might kick me out. That cannot happen. The fantasy of going to university growing up was one of the biggest things I held onto to keep going. I cant have it taken away from me. I cant. So i cant risk someone misinterpreting me and taking things out of proportion. But I dont know of any strategies I can use to replace these bad habits or to stop needing them (ive looked all over google, nothing has seemed to help and nothing is a good enough replacement). 

# Why I struggle to get support

If you read the previous section, you probably saw some of the reasons I struggle to get support. If not, these are the reasons...

* I find it difficult to trust people and open up to them. There are certain topics that, If someone held a gun to my head and said ""tell me about \[topic\], or ill shoot"", I would not be able to talk. Its that bad. Like I can try as hard as I want, currently, there are topics that my brain will not let my mouth talk about. My voice closes up, I cant breathe, I literally cannot talk about it. It is physically impossible. And I go to huge lengths to evade topics and to make people hear what they want to hear, so they think Im ok. And to be clear, I HATE THAT I DO THIS! I wish i didnt, but i do not have the skills or knowledge of how to stop this and how to open up and trust people enough o be able to talk to them. I would say that this is currently my no.1 thing that is hindering my getting support
* I don't know who to contact, or what I need. I want someone who can help me to battle my anxiety so that I can go to social events and leave my room without a second thought. Someone that can physically be there for me, and someone I can talk to without being afraid. I know this is different to support, but I also really want a hug. I really want one. If touch starvation is a thing, then I died of starvation over 10 years ago. I dont even know what physical or verbal affection is, because I never received it. I dont know if this is because I closed myself off to the world at a young age, or because my family neglected that side of my growing up. But I dont remember ever having any physical or verbal form of affection. I really want it. If someone hugs me I might cry but I imagine it feels really really good. Its embarrassing, but I go to sleep dreaming about someone hugging me. And I have a stuffed toy I sometimes hug. And I have a mountain of pillows and blankets. It kind of helps. Ive gone off topic. But maybe the last thing I just described actually plays into my inability to trust and open up to people. 
* Im terrified of people judging me and having a bad reaction. Like if i say something, and then theyre mean to me. If they say mean things and just make me feel worse. Like I sometimes have dreams where I open up to people and they tell me they wish I didnt exist or that they hate me or dont care about me.

# My frustrations

* maybe this one is obvious but - I WANT SUPPORT! I sorely want it, I am actively trying to get it (I dont think I made that clear, but I have been trying hard. I have accessed those anonymous helplines /crisis lines before and I am working up the courage to talk to a member of the welfare team at university or maybe my doctor. I dont know if it will happen, but in my brain I am putting myself into scenarios where I do it, to get used to the idea and to talk myself into it. I dont think I can do it, but at the same time, I know I have to. Its just so so hard. I cant even describe it. Maybe someone understands, but i dont know). 
* I want some true friends. And im specifically talking in person here, not online. Because online is different, and I think I need someone in person to help me and physically he there for me and someone I can physically be there for to and physically interact with. I want the friends who text me randomly, who invite me to events, who I can invite to go on walks with me, wo ask if im ok, who i feel comfortable talking to, and who can help give me the confidence to go to a social event. I dont mean this like they'd have a job of looking after me- all I mean is that if i had a friend, one who knows of my struggles and cares about me, then It will be easier to go to social events if they are also going. Because id have someone to go WITH, i could meet them before hand and we could walk in together and that would help massively. If im hiding in my room for weeks at a time if i had a friend maybe they'd notice and check in. That sort of stuff. Also, just the comfort and joy that comes from having a friend. It sound wonderful and I am jealous of the people who have this in their lives. Not jealous in a bad way, just jealous because its what I want and i know my anxiety is preventing me even having a chance at getting it. 
* my anxiety! also an obvious one. But i get so angry at myself when I have a panic attack or back out of leaving my room. I am so mean to myself in my head, which i know is bad, but i get so frustrated that i cant do something that another part of me sorely wants to do. I want to do it. but i cant. and i cant get help. and its a horrible cycle of loneliness, anxiety, anger, self hatred, depression. I feel trapped. 

# /////

I think I have talked about most of the things I wanted to get off my chest. There is more, but it involves past childhood events and more detailed things that im not comfortable doing even anonymously. Just for fear that someone will recognize the story. But yeah.

2736,Responsible_Form2611,1615402786,1,"
I'm 32 year old guy, a graduate of education and teaching with honors (with a bachelor's degree in education and a professional teaching certificate), in the past I coordinated areas, taught, mentored, etc.

But a personal cr that happened near graduation made me freeze for quite a while:

Depression and anxiety that developed in me, other chronic physical medical problems that I am learning to contain and live with (not serious problems at the level of disability, but a nuisance), becoming a close relative of a person in need of nursing care, lack of financial support - comes from a dysfunctional family Socio-economic is low and generally lacks a supportive and understanding environment (on the social side a large part of this is my fault, my gathering inside kept many friends away - before that I was a person with a rich social life).

And so it turns out that I did not work for about 3 years after graduating (I graduated at the end of 2017 and only in the summer of 2020 I officially started working for a nursing company as a part-time caregiver - in addition it fills my employment box in my resume for now).

My question is this:

Should I now turn to any channel of full-time employment just to make a living and get the cart of my life out of the mud, reach a state of financial independence, rent an apartment, save a little and continue to develop: jobs that will not contribute to improving my resume or advance me to a stable career. Which do not require special training, continuing to work as a nurse, cashier, factory, writers, supervisor of public transport, standard jobs, hotels) - initial work that will serve as a tool for me to build self-confidence, return to society and then move on to the next part. In this program the thought is to work in these jobs for about a year full time. And at the same time volunteer for something that will enrich my resume.

Or it would be better for me to rise above myself now, raise my anxiety and doubts and turn to a channel of work that requires education or academic training, say work in training, teaching and working with youth / and other jobs that will enrich my resume and be a lever for professional development.

I am currently still in a state of doubt about my abilities, to conduct myself in complex and binding social situations, low self-esteem and ""existential anxiety"", so it seems to me that choosing a professional academic path is farther from me at this time than choosing a minimum wage but less stressful job.

But I have a fear that I will get stuck in the unprofessional path and not be a self-fulfilling due to my anxieties. Afraid that if I ease myself now it will be the last nail in the coffin.

I also now live with my mother and her husband on a sofa and need to rent an apartment for myself for my peace of mind sooner than later - so the most accessible is simple jobs (because it is easiest to get to them quickly). I'm really lost. Because I do not have the luxury of continuing to shuffle in place - I come from a lower class family with no ability to continue to support me Thanks32-year-old man in existential anxiety : unemployment and return to employment",Anxiety,32-year-old man in existential anxiety : unemployment and return to employment,2021-03-11 05:59:46

I do manage to do what I need to do but my head is hell. I'm either only thinking of working or only thinking of distraction and I have to do things so in the end I just end up working and even when distracting myself I keep thinking of what I have to do.

Hey everyone! Got a quick one for you today. 

Have you ever tried breathwork before?

Breathwork is a super simple and effective intro to meditation. It‚Äôs a great starting place because it gives you something to focus on, and produces effects you can feel right away! 

So STOP what you‚Äôre doing and try this out real quick! 

Inhale for 6 seconds, then quickly exhale for 2 seconds. Repeat this about 20 times, or as long as you want! You should feel way more grounded and calm afterwards! 

Let me know if this helped you :)",Anxiety,Try this quick breathwork,2021-03-11 05:02:55

2764,Hefty_Rabbit,1615393745,1,"I'm a 22 yo uni student, and I just had an appointment with my GP to discuss the mental problems I've been facing for the past months (the isolation due to the covid measures probably made my 'sensitive' mental health evolve into a full-swing depression and social anxiety). It took me a while to realize I'm struggling and even more to put my pride aside and seek professional help. 

Basicly I've lost the interest and energy to do pretty much anything (as a uni student I keep procrastinating papers, studying for exams, etc). I wake up tired and I go to bed tired, and all I've been doing for the past few months was gaming, netflix and sleeping. I don't have mood swings, nor suicidal thoughts, but my overall mood is just plain passive without any feelings of joy with whatever I do. I'm also easily irritated when people I love (such as girlfriend, friends, parents, sisters) ask me something.

Aside from that I also think I'm suffering from quite severe social phobia. I have a slight stutter that over the past months has transformed into a quite severe stutter, which I blame as both cause and result of this social anxiety. Online classes have become a nightmare because once I have to start talking the anxiety takes total control of my body. Also I've lost a complete will to even meet friends. I always used to be quite socially 'attentive' (cuz of my stutter), but something like this I've never experienced. I'm pretty much anxious 24/7 cuz I became so extremely afraid of having to do presentations, or just speaking to people I dont know, etc 

My GP has given me a Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire that she wants me to fill in by friday (when I have the next appointment to see if I need more specialised help or so). I just got a score of 22, which (according to dr. internet) coincides with a mild/moderate depression. 

So are there people here who just like me seemed to suffer from both depression and social anxiety (and most ideally with a stutter) and were treated succesfully (by medication)?   
A friend of mine who studies medicine said paroxetine would probably my best bet, so I'm certainly gonna bring that up.   
At the moment I'm not interested in psychotherapy, but certainly considering it at a later moment (if medication should not help enough).

2776,anxiousreassurance,1615390695,1,"This is very long but I can‚Äôt afford therapy so I was hoping to share my struggles here.

In the last year my mental health has hit new lows but this is not a new development. I feel like my brain makes always me hyper-moral. Any mistake or possibility of a future mistake is absolutely corrupting and I should kill myself.

My elementary years were full of events of me making myself sick from stress and staying home from school. 

I spent most of my teen years and now my early twenties paranoid about being gay. My Mom repeatedly asked me if I was during my high school years. I never brought home any girfriends and my Dad was concerned that I did drama instead of sports. In unrelated conversations, my Mom has said God views homosexuals and pedophiles as equal perversions and sin. Gee thanks Mom. That‚Äôll haunt me later.

I feel like I pushed to lose my virginity before I was really ready just to prove I wasn‚Äôt gay. Having sex for the first time outside of marriage (which goes against my family‚Äôs strict values) made me have a nervous breakdown where I wasn‚Äôt able to leave my bed for a week and was puking off and on with anxiety spikes.

I moved out of the house pretty young to get out of that environment, left the church and surrounded myself with LGBTQ affirming friends. Very sweet group that I love to death. However in the comfort and openness of this friend group I realize I‚Äôm not gay. My brain didn‚Äôt fear it as much anymore so I was able to think much clearer. I also had lots of sexual partners in this process. Never any same sex ones. I was afraid if I had sex with the same sex and I truly wasn‚Äôt gay, then I would kill myself before ever coming out to my family.

That conversation with my mom though, stuck with me. Now I‚Äôve been paranoid that maybe I was not gay, but a pedophile. This fear only became a possibility after I turned 18. I‚Äôve deleted social medias that are high risk of having porn, including this one in the past, fearing some photos may be underage. I had previously planned to work in IT, but I changed career paths. I now completely fear the internet. It‚Äôs crippling. I love video games and when my friends moved to PC from console I refused for years just to avoid easy access to the internet.

My brother still uses a flip phone to avoid social media. He always told me about the dangers of
porn and it‚Äôs detriment to his marriage. That too has stuck with me. He doesn‚Äôt allow himself unmonitored computer time even when checking emails for a few minutes.

My mom and I are both on Lexapro for anxiety, she admitted to me that she struggles with extreme anxiety and thoughts of suicide. I told her only that I was suffering from stress.

2778,pinkfloydchick64,1615390058,1,"I have had a lot of pandemic-related anxiety, about the collective health and stability of the world, the health of my family and friends, how politics ties into all of this, missing loved ones that I haven't visited in over a year now, not being able to do certain hobbies I enjoy like going to the movies, etc. 

But I'd be remiss if I didn't say that I have had some personal benefits from a ""quarantine"" lifestyle and the pandemic. I've had more job security as a direct result of increased pandemic-related workload, I've been able to fully work from home (which I love), as an introvert it's been nice in some respects.

With widespread vaccination on the horizon, I've experienced some excitement of course but also some new anxiety about all of the unknowns of the ""new normal"". It's unclear if I'll be able to keep working from home, my social anxiety is really spiking at the prospect of seeing people again and what interactions will be like in the ""new normal"" (will we shake hands? Will we hug? Will we wear masks? Etc.). I'll be actually a little more worried about my job security post-pandemic. And I'm nervous about how the whole vaccination process will work. Don't get me wrong, I'm getting a vaccine as soon as I'm able to, but just the unknowns of the process and the question mark about what side effects I'll have personally is making me nervous. 

I had also been working out more in a pandemic world where I have more time, and taken on new hobbies like learning French. I'm worried that I won't have the motivation to continue these positive habits in a ""normal world"".

And, my partner and I have discussed buying our first house once we're vaccinated. While exciting, the thought of this process is also giving me a lot of anxiety.

Anyway, I'm self-loathing a bit because I have these feelings of anxiety about the pandemic ending. Of course the pandemic ending will be great for everyone, and I feel so selfish for feeling this way. I think this is also adding to my anxiety.

Is anyone else feeling this way? Do you have any coping strategies for dealing with these feelings? Just typing this out was helpful, so thank you if you stuck with me.

The charges were dropped and the tabloid article was removed.

However, I'm haunted by the email I sent. I haven't looked at it for a while, and I'm scared to. It's so incredibly embarrassing. 

I can't delete it, because what if at some point in my life I appear in the public eye again, even if it's in a positive way, and they decide to share it? It just feels like the kind of thing I should probably keep a record of.

However, I die inside when I think of it. I have OCD, GAD and a degree of social anxiety. Does anyone have any CBT strategies to deal with the anxiety and put it in perspective?

It's the horrible feeling of the bloodthirsty tabloid journalists having such an embarrassing email. It's not like sending a terrible email to your boss, who's neutral towards you. That's embarrassing, but your boss isn't out to get you.

Instead, in my case, it's with a group of people who actively tried to paint me in the worst light possible. I'm probably paranoid and catastrophising, but I think of them laughing at me and scheming against me. And then on a personal level it's embarrassing that I, a grown adult, sent a teenager-y dramatic email.

2787,MighiTheGreat,1615386802,1,"I apologize, this might be a bit long.

Some context: I'm 17 and I think I've had anxiety for a while, I used to throw up every morning before school when I was younger because the thought of going to school gave me panic attacks. It is not as bad anymore and it has been a long time since I have missed a  school day because of my anxiety. I haven't gone to therapy or anything, I learned how to control it by myself eventually. But it is still very much present and sometimes it confines me to my bed.

I have noticed that I get a lot of anxiety from assignments (I'm using this as an example), this is very normal I know so I do not get too concerned about it. This anxiety increases as the deadline gets closer, but I know what you're thinking, ""Just complete the assignment so that you get rid of it"", that's probably right and it does make a lot of sense, but for some reason, my anxiety dramatically rises when I try to. Let's say I have an assignment due in a week, I usually think that I should get onto it, but even the thought of doing it gives me a mini panic attack, so I leave it for another day.  I then try to actually do it, I open my laptop, I go to my assignment while fighting through the anxiety, then I get to the point where I'm supposed to start, and I freeze. The thoughts and stress just overwhelm my mind and I just have to shut the laptop and get on my bed to try to calm down a little. Eventually, the deadline gets so close that I have to do it, and once again I go through the same process, only that this time I have no choice but to do it. So I fight through the panic and I do it, it does take some time, for example, I may take some hours to complete a piece of work that should have been done in thirty minutes. Or, I send my teacher an email making up an excuse and I hope that she just forgets about it.

This has been going on for years, and I haven't found a solution to it, no matter how early I start. I was wondering if anyone else out there is affected by this as well, and if anyone has any advice.

Sometimes..... Sometimes when I'm doing something... i have flasbacks.... memories... of stuff that had happened.  And i freak out. I feel like people know. I feel like they're judging me. It literally makes me sick. In the sense that it literally gives me stomach cramps. 
I'm in university... and there's always this group that has no filter. They won't think twice about slamming your character.(especially if you're a girl and yes I am a girl)
I'm scared because I feel like they know. Certain stuff with a guy who then proceeded to cheat on me
(The thing that happened was that he had been cheating for a while and i was stupud enough to think i could keep him so i did stupid stuff not sex but close enough and I've never once forgiven myself for it because he still left...)
 logically I know they would never know....but i think they know and I think and think about it to the point I can't breathe. 
I used to have this addiction with my phone. To shut my brain down by watching movies. But recently I've stopped doing that (since my screen time was over 16 hours)
And the thoughts are back. They leave me crippled.  I just sit and overthink about the worst case scenarios..being shamed...being called the worst names imaginable. 
Sometimes ...i see people talking randomly and i think it's about me...they're shaming me...
I had problems leaving my house before this fiasco. I have no self confidence. I have nothing that would help me stand out. I think of a 100 worse case scenarios in under 30 seconds.

I'm a scholarship student in a university. Basically, I get most of my scholarship points because I need to manage a bunch of students, and whenever the need arises, take their concerns/queries to the teachers who are above us. During this time, we need to manage the classes, and if there are any problems with the students, we take it up to the teachers. More like a monitor or something, which sounds completely stupid because this is something that the teachers should be doing, not me. 

As you probably have guessed already, it isn't as easy as it sounds. There are political agendas along the way, there are my classmates who are just waiting for the opportunity to get where I am. Earlier it was fine, but since the pandemic kicked in, it is very overwhelming for me to deal with all this. There is alot of peer pressure, and the office management is shit and I feel like I am stuck in between the classmates and the university. It is a toxic environment, to put it lightly. 

The scholarship isn't much but it is something. I know that it is certainly the cause of my anxiety and I'd be alot more comfortable if I wasn't in this situation in the first place. Basically if I quit now, I will probably drop out of the scholarship window but gain my sanity back. And if I keep at it, I will probably stay anxious for I don't know how long but I'll keep getting the scholarship. The pay isn't much, but it still something. Will it affect my education if I don't get the money ? I don't think so. 

I've given it a good amount of thought over the past few months but I never could come to a conclusion. I never could discuss it with anyone because I don't really trust anyone to begin with. What should I do ? I'd love to have some educated advice/opinion on this topic.

Anxiety sufferer here, does anyone else just feel utterly ridiculous after an anxiety or panic attack and it just makes you feel worse? Like i feel like i am constantly over reacting to every minor issue or inconvenience. 

One example, I had my audit back at work this morning, i got 95%. Pass rate is 96. I failed on some very minor issues, mostly admin that do not affect the outcome of my work but obviously still do count, i get 4 audits a year and only have to make 96% overall and even then theyre not that strict about it as long as i am not making major mistakes. Well i still absolutely spiralled, crying for over an hour (thank god for wfh) thinking of ways i can quit or get a drs note to be signed off with stress, thinking im awful at my job despite getting nothing but praise for the last 3 years. Just a complete wreck for nearly 2 hours, i asked to go thru it with my boss and as we went thru things she noticed she had also made a couple mistakes and that i HAD done some of the stuff she said i hadnt so im not up to 96% and a pass! There was also something on there i hadnt been taught so i could not have known to do. She told me that she wasnt worried bcoz if someone audited her files right now she would definitely fail on a lot of stuff (we dont get notice of audits) and she had spent the whole day sorting her files out because she was worried she was going to be audited soon aswell. 

So it all pretty much worked out and there are no real issues. Things for me to work on yes. But nobody is perfect and there were no big mistakes made or any damage done but i still absolutely went into meltdown like i had just been told my entire career is over and everything i love was gone, and i just feel so ridiculous and over the top and i have no idea how to stop doing that.

1) As a child I was overweight, bullied, socially awkward and then I found myself at University and gained confidence an a boyfriend. 

2) 14 years later I am still with him and married but about 4 years ago cracks began to show in our relationship. We ignored them and focused on work. 

3) Work became a toxic environment to be in for me (issues with the boss, people being fired, strikes etc) and it became hard. My husband also took over the business he worked for. We were both stressed and didn't support each other. 

4) I faced a string of bereavements in close succession and some serious medical concerns. 

5) I was lonely and sought support from others which led to the start of an emotional affair. It came out into the open and we started marriage counselling. 

6) At my lowest point I felt suicidal but didn't talk about it. 

7) 12 months later and I have changed job, feel more in control of myself, cut off negative ties with some friends, and we have made some progress in marriage counselling but it is slow. Finally it was discussed that I should seek individual support for myself because, until I do, it is obvious that we cannot solve all the issues in the marriage.

Hi, thanks for reading. For context I took my ACT today and had a nuclear meltdown the entire time. 10 minutes before the test I had a panic attack and then had 3 separate anxiety attacks throughout the test itself.

It started with a watch issue because I can‚Äôt see far away (there were clocks on the wall) but we weren‚Äôt aloud to have our own approved watch for whatever reason and then I went down the ‚Äúnot being able to see anything (type of) anxiety‚Äù rabbit hole and I spiraled from there.

It has been 12 hours and I still have a headache, feel nauseous, and have pain in my chest and stomach. Is that normal? Shouldn‚Äôt this be gone by now? I‚Äôve ate food, hydrated, taken Tylenol and it still persist.

Thinking back, I‚Äôm more shocked than disappointed- I acted completely out of character. I showed my emotional distress in front of teachers/classmates, I literally guessed on entire sections (never a normal for me), and was trapped with test anxiety (also never happens).

Being disappointed is an understatement but feeling betrayed is the best to describe how I feel. He basically described himself &amp; made everyone think that I was that way. He was projecting. He not only was plotting against me for months, but he basically made all of his friends, literally, everyone believe that I was a terrible person who betrayed him. He dragged my name through the dirt &amp; made it seem like I have never been such a kind/loving person. But, he apologized. Not, really. But in his weird way, he did. And I forgave him for the peace of the household. 

But recently, I decided to cut off one of our mutual friends because she also was planning with him to hurt me. I saw that she now had an onlyfans in her bio on Instagram &amp; texted my brother that. He responded and basically told me that she said that it was her friend‚Äôs. 

Now, that just gave me confirmation to see if he was still talking to our mutual friend. In his apology, he mentioned how she provoked &amp; lied on me about many things that led up to him snapping on me. I assumed that he would drop her, but he didn‚Äôt. I also assumed that she‚Äôd drop him because I gave her proof , names, screenshots, and even numbers of third parties to show her that I‚Äôm not how my brother was describing me.

2857,Golitan11,1615351135,1,"When I was a child, I started to experience severe intestinal cramps multiple times a day around the age of 7 years old. It felt like pure discomfort and sickness, rather than pain (unlike stomach ache), and it was forcing me to go to the toilet really often. At the peak of these episodes, I needed cold water on my body to chill me down and my mom's support at all time. I was trying to live normally, playing in a soccer team and simply being a kid, but since it could strike anywhere, I was scared to be in a place where toilets weren't easily accessible. In fact, the worst moments were by far the ones where I had to wait because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Finally, it got diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lasted several years. At one point, I remember wanting to end my days and my daily suffering, but I was too young to really know how, so I kept anticipating the next day of terror. Fortunately, at one point, the whole thing just faded away, and since the age of 13 or so, I have never experienced such discomforts again. I have then proceeded to live my life normally as an happy teenager. It's good to note that I have always been a bit anxious in nature (small OCD, racing thoughts, overthinking), but really steady, curious and forward thinking (A+ everywhere, informed, I knew what I wanted to do in life from the first shot). It's also good to note that I haven't really had any existencial crisis, and I have always been really happy (never really depressed about life).

Fast forward to 2018 (22 years old), I experienced my very first panic attack following a random drug experience. It's important to note that I've never been a real user, and I was mostly curious about experiencing different mental states at the time. I was also extremely cautious, testing all my stuff and preparing / informing myself as much as I could. However, this one time, something went south and I thought I was going die. After this event, my life went on, but weed in particular slowly became a source of anxiety. Before that, I was smoking weekly and I there was no concept of being too high. But after that, I became overly aware of every sensation in my body (such as my heart rate, reminding me the panic attack), which made me paranoid no matter the amount. Because of that, I've stopped weed altogether (and other drugs), but the anxiety kept getting worst in my day-to-day (mainly hypochondria). Also, I used to enjoy drinking, but it now feels different. Most of the time, I just feel more detached instead of warm, and eventually become nauseous. So I usually don't drink more than 1-2 beers anymore if I don't feel it.

Last weekend, I have experienced my first true panic attack (not drug induced). My girlfriend and I decided to rent a lodge in the wood to ""disconnect"" from reality and enjoy nature (with no network). The first night, I expected to drink and have sex, but instead, I just felt like I didn't enjoy being there at all. It just seemed like because I was so used to be in my bubble working from home (a job that I love btw) and game during lockdown, this real life stimulus just overwhelmed me in a negative way. So the night went on, we discussed about how I felt calmly and expected better for the next day. The next day, we had a beautiful day outside and went back to the lodge late PM. I drank a coffee, and eventually, I just started to feel slightly jittery and cold. I thought the coffee and room temperature were in cause, so I kept it for myself (watching a movie). An hour later, the sun was down and my girlfriend had prepared us some food, but I was feeling worst. I sat at the table and couldn't eat, so I told her something was wrong. I have then proceeded to boil some water to warm me up, and meanwhile, I started to anxiously turn around the kitchen with my hands shaking. Then, my vision slowly became fuzzy and I had a feeling of loss of control, exactly like my first panic attack. So I laid down, and experienced pure madness for about an hour. Nothing felt good; music, lights, body sensations, etc. I couldn't tell if I was getting cold or hot anymore, and I had to go to the toilet several times (diarrhea). At one point, I thought I would puke, but I had nothing in my stomach and managed to avoid the thought. Eventually, we watched Nemo to calm me down and it passed. The next day, I was still feeling a bit anxious in the morning, so we left the lodge early and everything was fine back home.

In retrospect, I seem to experience more anxiety whenever I don't feel safe for my health. In fact, we were about 45 minutes in the wood with no network and nowhere near any public health services . Since I have been quite traumatized in my early age regarding toilet accessability, maybe my bad drug experience introduced enough anxious behavior in me to get this back up the surface (hence the fact that I'm also really hypochondriac now). It's also not the first time I felt anxious in such settings (nowhere near as that though). In fact, I remembered feeling quite anxious in nature while hiking (more on my way up than my way down) because  I was getting farther from potential help. I also had these feelings during long drives. The difference being that the panic attack from the lodge really came out of nowhere. It might sound like some sort of agoraphobia, but funnily, I feel way safer when I'm with people or in crowds. In these settings, I feel distracted from my inner thoughts and I know someone would notice if I was experiencing some sort of health problem. I can travel just fine. I just feel more anxious in nature than cities now. It also seems to be more dominant at night, since it's a darker tone and I feel more isolated.

Now, since it's not the first time that I experience such feelings and it seems to slightly get worst (possibly because of the lockdown), my girlfriend is really worried that we won't be able to do these things again (something we both used to love). Obviously, she puts my mental health first, but I know it's affecting her and I don't want to drown my 6 years old realtionship because my mental health is degrading. She truly is the love of my life, and I can already see this becoming a huge weight on her. She wanted to have a chill weekend and have fun, not experience more stress than her everyday life. It just seems like a lot of our plans already got fucked by how I felt, and I just want everything to be just fine for both of us. I love my job and live an happy life. I really don't feel that anxious in my day-to-day, but this weekend has been really scary for both of us. Do you have any advices?

Upon further investigation, the robbery seemed very planned, as it happened within the 30 minutes he had gone to pick us up. It was also strategic, as the expensive electronics were left there. After that, other relatives had similar things happen. Even my own home had the alarm system go off a while later. Again, I never encountered the people.

I finally moved away and lived in an apartment alone, in a relatively well-off and safe neighborhood. My mom gave me cheap magnetic alarms so I could use them, and one night they went off. I was pregnant at the time, and I screamed and ran down the hallway with no pants on (kinda funny). It was a false alarm and the glue had just come undone. From that night on I had to block all the doors and windows, set ""traps"" on the floors, and barricade myself inside my room. I even slept with a few knives nearby. I would jump at every noise. 

My husband went on a business trip recently, and every time I hear some creak, or anything I have a mini heart attack. One of the nights, something in our home fell over and I nearly had a heart attack and blocked off our bedroom door. I almost cried, and my palms are sweating just thinking of it now. We have security cameras and deadbolts, I have the same ""traps"" set, and even have wood blocks preventing windows from being opened. I purchased anti-shatter film for our windows and more motion sensors. I still have my door barricaded right now, and I want to cry. I can't sleep. I have work tomorrow. Every little creak scares me.

I‚Äôve had anxiety so bad that I turn into a robot I just scan the area slowly spinning around looking everywhere I can look for a threat or potential exit I look explicitly all over the place as far as my eyes can. 

So me and my bestfriend met in 8th grade. I‚Äôve changed over the years. We‚Äôve stayed together thabks to Snapchat and what not. We went to different high schools and I left the state we graduate in June this year, I doubt we will see eachother this summer but oh but we plan on seeing and keeping eachother in our lives. 
But I had a dream and it was perfect until my anxiety IN A DREAM. RUINED IT!  

I really only remember me and him watching sun set eating food and laughing with him, in an area like... imagine the OBX but tropical I guess. Then I drop everything snd become aware in the dream and guessed ok I‚Äôm lucid dreaming?

There was nothing it was peaceful but time slowed so much at that point I woke up in sweat and tears, I miss my bro, I wanna have no worry‚Äôs and chill w him. But god damn that would have happen. I just shell up in public...  I hate myself for it but I shouldn‚Äôt. 
In a year or 2 we should honestly be able to finally meet up after it‚Äôs been sooo long. And I hopefully can just be good. I‚Äôm going to be armed in public.

I can get better at handling it but it become a good thing when it‚Äôs right. I‚Äôve had situations where my anxiety‚Äôs saved my life.

2894,MarkDayette45,1615342576,1,"I've had anxiety for most of my life. As a youth, I was so nervous at school that my hands would tremble. 

This took on a bizarre form when I reached puberty. Somehow anxiety merged with my sexuality. For example, one day when I was 14, I couldn't get my Gym class locker open. I realized I'd be late for class since all my classmates were already on the basketball court. 

Not getting my locker open and being late for class combined with a sudden need to pee created a strange bodily reaction. The feelings of nervousness surged in my groin area and I felt like I was about to have an orgasm. Fortunately, I was alone in the locker room and no one could hear me moaning. 

That event was like the beginning of a new anxiety based sexuality which was most prominent in my dreams at night. Dreams of being late for school or running out of time to finish a Math test, all of these ordinary dream themes brought orgasms. 

I knew it was strange that my ""sex dreams"" didn't involve SEX so I had to keep this aspect of my life hidden.

2911,CapnFlisto,1615339509,1,"Hello everybody, I'm new here.

I've gone through some stuff recently. It's been extremely hard. I started getting pretty severe panic attacks (I've had tastes of them before). I went to a psychiatrist, and I currently still have a therapist. I have Ativan for emergency-use. 

I have proudly not taken any since I got it. I thought the worst was behind me. Today, out of the blue. I just started getting all of those symptoms again. It's overwhelmingly physical for me. I talked to my therapist as it was going on, and she said if I was having that many physical symptoms, I should take the Ativan, so I did, after trying just about everything else I could.

The main, immediate symptoms are a feeling like I can't breathe right, I'm suddenly breathing VERY manually and it feels unsuccessful. My heart races. I also get a very dry mouth. Shortly after, my hands and feet tingle, and I start cramping up all over. I had to go to the hospital once, just to make sure everything was ok. It was. (The situation kind of necessitated it since I was in public, with my car on the side of the road.)

When I have had them since, I fully understand that I'm ok. I can reason my way through the fact that none of this can hurt me, but regardless, it feels terrible. I'm not worried about dying, I'm worried about it feeling worse, and sometimes it does.

I have been given a lot of tools by my therapist and psychiatrist. I really want to avoid taking the Ativan, as it screws my whole day up. The mental exercises, while surely well-intentioned, definitely aggravate my symptoms. I have tried to stick with them and they invariably make me turn even more inwards. Things like using your five senses to notice things around you. Breathing exercises, etc. All of them just make my breathing even more manual and make me pay more attention to what my body is doing. The closest thing to help only arrives in the from of meaningful, stimulating distraction, but often it's even hard to get distraction.

I guess what I'm saying is I think, generally, mindlessness works better than mindfulness for me. Does anyone have any experience with this? My primary goal is to re-trigger automatic breathing as fast as possible. The second my breathing is no longer manual, everything else slowly comes back. It's the first thing that I notice, and it's the first thing that has to stop for me to be ok. Any tips?

2914,pinkdemoness24,1615338446,1,"I was diagnosed with OCD and panic disorder between 3 and 5 years old. I have always had hypochondria as my OCD focus, so Covid has obviously been the worst thing for me. I was managing with the stress of covid until November, around when my job was going to force me to interact with more people on a daily basis. My anxiety got so bad I was either pacing or rocking in my rocker for hours every day, not eating, only drinking meal replacement stuff. I went on disability and started talk therapy. I've been on Lexapro for over 10 years with very few panic attacks and most OCD symptoms controlled, but then it just wasn't enough anymore. My doctor had me start taking propanolol to help break the physical cycle of anxiety, and it did seem to help a lot. I started feeling better with that, so I went back to work in January. I've had good and bad days, but then CVS switched my birth control from brand name to generic, and I felt off that whole month. During my PMS time I suddenly became so depressed I couldn't get out of bed for two days. I didn't want to be awake anymore because I had been fighting my anxiety for months and I wasn't all the way better yet. My therapist told me to go into a behavioral health unit to try new meds, so I did just that. They tried me on Abilify, and for the first week I had some moments without anxiety, and a positive mood. But I also had extreme mood swings and would randomly crash and start crying again. The second week I was down more than I was up, and last Friday I felt suicidal again because I felt like I will never get back to normal. I went back to the hospital and they took me off Abilify and switched to Latuda. I was discharged Sunday, but then I developed crazy akathisia. I called my psychiatrist and said I couldn't handle the nonstop needing to move and agitation, so he said go back on the Lexapro until the next appt, which is Thursday. Now I'm back to feeling super anxious and crying again because I've been fighting this for so long, and I wonder if I'll never get back to normal.

2923,katiebakes94,1615336816,1,"A few months ago I started getting anxiety symptoms (racing heart, tight chest, breathlessness), usually on a Weekend night before going back to work. I am currently medicated for depression. I have had some anxiety over the years but for the last 2 years or so it‚Äôs been mostly depression. 

I mentioned the symptoms to my psychiatrist and she thought it was likely a result of anxiety and that we would keep an eye on it. 

Fast forward to December 2020. I went to the doctor and my heart rate was above 100 bpm. Unusual for me. My heart rate it pretty low usually but the PCP just kinda wrote it off as an outlier. 

Since December I‚Äôve had the ‚Äòanxiety‚Äô episodes more frequently going from once or twice a month to a few times a week. I had my 2nd COVID shot the other week and the tightness and breathlessness was really bad the day after and my heart rate was 140bpm. 

I went to my PCP today for a follow up on blood work and ended up needing a b12 injection. I‚Äôll need one a week for the next 4 weeks. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to that but I wanted to mention it. 

My heart rate was 114bpm during the appointment and my doctor asked about it. I told him the whole situation and he put a referral in for a cardiologist right then and there. I asked about it being an anxiety thing and he said it could be but he wanted to make sure everything was okay. 

So my question to y‚Äôall is what do you think it is more likely to be? I‚Äôm 26 years old. All my blood work looked great. It was just my b12 and vitamin d that were low. I have a BMI of 30. Which is bad but weight gain is really an issue for me with the medication I take. I eat pretty healthy but unfortunately the antipsychotic I take makes it hard to lose weight and easy to gain weight. 

I have also noticed that recently I over heat really easily and often spend the morning at work sweating and uncomfortable. I‚Äôve always had an issue with getting too hot in the shower but it‚Äôs definitely got worse.

So, I used to live with these two girls before March 2020, because I came back home due to the pandemic. Since January 2020 it was the worst period of my life, every part of my life was getting darker. Anyway I had argued a little with these two girls about some bills in our house, and even though i think it can be a common thing among homemates, they have been huge bitches. One of them has almost threatened me, and during that period I was scared to see them, although we had shared a house for more than one year. They probably thought I was much more stupid than them (I have to admit that I seemed stupid for sure, since I've never stood up against them) and took advantage of the fact that I am younger. Gladly, I haven't talk to them since November (one of them wished me happy birthday, like why? You've literally stolen from me, leave me alone), but there is something that really makes me feel bad: their ig stories/post together, they seem to have maintained a relation and who knows how much fun they have had in taking advantage of me. Whenever I see their post, I start thinking about the period of my life I've passed with them, how they tricked me, the bad things about me they've probably said. I fear that I will have to see them again, even if, at least right now, there aren't reasons for this to happen.

I am new to Reddit and I really hope I am using it right. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I am writing this here, because I have nowhere else to go, I am desperate and I can't go on like that for long. I'm a 23y old female and I've been battling with anxiety for like 5-6 yrs now. I also have chronic migraine - I'm on Aimovig for that (CGRP inhibitor), and I have PMDD. I tried almost every doctor there is, almost every test they could think of and it all came back non-conclusive. My symptoms are debilitating, they are getting worse and worse every single day and they have a huge impact on my social, family, school and everyday life. 

They are mostly brain fog, brain pressure, little shifting and shivers of the brain inside of head that happen like 5-10 times a day, it doesn't feel like electric shock, more like a wave of water or something like that in my head. Like my brain moved. It's extremly weird and I am really worried about it. I have constant head pressure, mostly in the back of my head, but sometimes also in the whole head. I'm a 5th year medical student, I was always on top of my class, but now I am actually thinking about dropping out, because I can't do it anymore. I can't study, even for 5 minutes, because my brain starts to physically hurt when I try and concentrate. My memory sucks. 


  ... I was wondering, did any of you ever felt anything like that? Did you ever find out what was the reason? And, if so, did you get any relief? Did you find anything that helps? I have had the exact symptoms for 2 years now, and they are slowly driving me insane. I've become depressed, angry, agitated, I snap at my people every chance I get. I also got suicidal, which I have NEVER been, because I'm in general a very happy person, but now I barely have anything left of me. 


I've tried sertraline and lexapro, and they both only made my symptoms worse :(

Thank you for reading and I would appriciate your answers and help so much! 

Best wishes,

2949,GooBeanie,1615330618,1,"I know this is nothing new here. But I'm really upset right now. 

I feel like all of my friends hate me. I feel like everyone I walk by is staring at me. I feel like everyone thinks I'm creepy because I dont talk to anyone. I feel like people don't want to talk to me. I feel like everyone ignores me when I talk to them. I feel like I cant even begin conversations with new people because I'm afraid they dont want to talk to me. I feel afraid because I dont want to be ""that guy"" that joins in friend groups that nobody wants me in. I feel like people are laughing at me. I feel like my teachers find me weird because I never talk to anyone around me. I feel like my best friends made new friends when they were in-person and I was virtual at school, and now they dont like me anymore. I feel afraid that I'll be told one day that my best friends want to move on from me, and I'll have no one else to fall back on. I worry that people think I'm like this for attention. I feel like people don't like my sense of humor, how quiet I am, how annoying I am....

This is how I feel every day. I always tell people I dont care what others think about me, but now I feel like I've been putting on a mask over how I actually am. I'm a shy, insecure, anxious kid. I was always told that high school was when you meet a bunch of new friends and it's the most fun time of school ever with new people. But that hasn't happened yet. I'm too scared to talk to anyone. Recently, I started sitting at lunch with a friend I havent seen in person since the start of the pandemic. She sits with 3 other people, two of which I already know, but there was someone new I've never met before. She is super nice and laughs at all of the stuff other people say. So, I tried to talk to her, and she just kind of ignored me. She just talked to my other friends instead of me. I tried cracking jokes in the conversations, trying to be a part of something, but I just ended up feeling like no one wanted me there. I feel like I'm invading a friend group that everyone was happy with before I got there. I honestly just want to sit alone during lunch because of this, but I feel bad about it because I have friends to talk to, I'm just afraid to talk to them. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone. I'm too afraid to do anything.


 My anxiety has never been this bad before, but I think the length of the pandemic and how it affected me has made me scared of socializing at all. I'm too afraid of rejection, and I dont want to be annoying to anyone. I just want friends at school.

 I want a friend that makes me laugh and I can make them laugh. I want a friend that I can walk with to my classes. I want a friend that I'm super close to, but i dont feel like that with any of my friends. I used to be really close with all of my friends, but now I just feel separated. My biggest fear is being considered annoying. And I feel like EVERYONE thinks I'm annoying. 


What happened to me? I used to not think like this at all. I used to be super close to all of my friends, not even worry about annoying them, but now I'm down to the point where I'm afraid of offending them or annoying them in texts.

2953,pmmecuteraccoonpics,1615328544,1,"Hello all,

I hope this is the right subreddit to come for advice with my conundrum since anxiety is the most apt way to describe what I'm experiencing.

I'm in this weird state of mind where everything feels incredibly overwhelming, whether it's responsibilities, aspects of my life (even tasks as simple as making cereal) or hobbies  I used to enjoy (i.e. reading, drawing, gaming, etc).

The best way to describe this sensation is that it's akin to feeling like you literally cannot do whatever needs to be done. I feel like some kind of force is stopping me from taking action. 

When I actually try to push myself to get the task done or partake in the activity my emotions start to rise up. I feel stressed, anxious, sick and exhausted. Sometimes, depending on the nature of the task at hand, I do feel a sense of panic kick-in and the frustration of not doing the task makes me feel even more frustrated and stressed.

I also noticed that I tend to get all up in my head when doing things. It's like suddenly I don't know how to proceed with doing the task. I think maybe it's because I just start doubting if I'm doing the right approach (I do have a lot of self-doubt with so many things - even when I'm feeling emotions I question if what I'm feeling is even real or if I am faking it.)

I have also tried to pay attention to my train of thoughts, and it seems that my way of thinking stems on this sense of feeling whatever I'm doing is pointless, useless and I should just abandon ship. I feel even more dejected, which ends up with me feeling super demotivated, hurt, angry (at myself) and sad. And lately the effect of this attitude has made me feel like my hobbies, dreams, interests and wishes are pointless and don't matter.

As I said this is affecting my everyday life now from my social life, my skincare, my work, my hobbies, my homework and more. The patterns of my effort would be really sporadic and scattered at best.

I do want to see a therapist, but I really don't make much. So I'm trying to formulate a financial plan since BetterHelp would be kinder to my wallet (therapy is super expensive where I live). 

But in the meantime this is driving me insane. Is there anything I should read up on or listen to? Any activities I can try to retake control of my life? Does this sound like anxiety, burn out, depression, an alien possession or something else?

Just as I was recovering from the 'maybe COVID', I had some bleeding - normally not a huge deal but I'm post menopause when everything that was okay before is now a warning sign of something worse. Worst case - cancer. So I was in weeks of anxiety as I had to be tested, wait for results, have a procedure...no cancer, so that's good.

I also have to have a colonoscopy.   


Can anybody help me with how to deal with this? It's all completely out of my control and I'm terrified.

I was seriously depriving myself of social interactions throughout my teenage years and early twenties, which resulted or was a result of (the reason and the consequence are not always easy to distinguish) social anxiety. 

Judging by what can be observed, I managed to overcome social anxiety - i.e. it takes me very low effort to, say, approach a group of people and start a conversation. 

The problem now is that I cannot be alone. I get completely absorbed by negative loops of thoughts, it feels like I will not experience anything good and that the best part of my life is over. I can describe it as a black dry fire burning inside my whole essence. And nothing helps with it really, besides spending time with people. Even 5 minutes of chatting and some laughter makes me feel alive, life becomes vibrant, I feel that I am doing good as a member of society and that great things are ahead.

Has anybody experienced anything similar? How can I function in solitude again?

I don't know the right way to describe it, but the feeling is like I have much less energy than I had before.  
I still enjoy some things, like watching tv shows or playing games or talking to family. I sometimes enjoy working on my business and developing software.

But most of the time I don't want to do anything and I don't have the same power I had before to motivate myself for something. Learning new things, finding interesting activities, I wish i did something like that, but at the same time **even the thought** of trying to do so seems too burdensome.

I am feeling that I don't improve anymore. And even though I am working on a lot of projects and I still have clients, my own business, new projects and loving family, at the same time I feel like I am stuck in one place and I am not moving in any direction.

Focusing on work is hard, relaxing is hard (because I am blaming myself for not improving and doing time-butning activities like scrolling reddit).

Now I am starting to have sleep problems again (hypnogogia) and I also started eating less.

But at the same time for a lot of time I feel.. okay. Not great, nut not bad too. It's just that sometimes I think about it and then it weighs on me so much that I feel really stressed about this situation.  
I am already visiting the psychoanalyst for a year now, but it doesn't seem to help with my feelings, it just helps me with understanding my situation and why I feel this way.

But even the thought of trying to fix this gives me much more stress than the stress alone.  
I just want to feel better and to do something ""alive"", without being stuck in a loop of the same projects and freetime activities.

Gnats were flying around my face constantly throughout the day and I could barely do my work because of the aggressive fanning to try and keep them away. There were both super tiny ones and regular sized gnats so I know they have nested somewhere and the fact that they are essentially growing up here makes me livid. I was fuming all day yesterday, I was so uncomfortable, and after showering and trying to relax on my couch, a HUGE roach comes crawling across my floor. I burst into tears. Minutes before I had just vented to a friend about how all of these bugs were driving me crazy and whatever maintenance had come to spray when I reported the issue before made no difference.

I have entomophobia. If I hadn't called a friend to talk me through it over the phone I would have had a panic attack. I was screaming and crying because that was the straw that broke the camel's back. Instantly I started having intense anxiety about having moved into an apartment community where I would possibly have to deal with all these bugs for the duration of my 13 month lease. I couldn't even get to sleep good, I feared another huge bug would come out of nowhere again.

Today I am a bit embarrassed to have carried on the way I did with my friend on the phone, but he did not judge me and stayed on the phone with me until I felt okay enough.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have bipolar 1. I was in heavy psyciatric care for 6 years, had an entire team i would see at least 1 time a month. I had an initial diagnoses of psychosis. I had a nurse, a metabolic doctor, a psychiatrist,

&amp;#x200B;

as well as a social worker.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been out of the care of tat team for 3 years and just got a medical doctor, I am also diagnosed as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disord

I recently had a breathing issue flair up and its hard for me to know if my new doctor is just being careful sending me to so many different appointments or if it is a need for concern. I cleaned a bachelor house for three days and got into mouse piss and shit as well as mouse shit and piss stains, dog hair, insane dust build up as well as everyting else you can expect in a house that hasnt been cleaned for 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor gave me a rescue puffer then a maintenence steroid puffer, then a nasal spray, now antibiotics. Then booked me for a CT scan, now she refeared me to a respretory specialist that I have not even talked to and now she has asked tat specialist to refear me to a doctor and as told me he may    

want a lung biopsy... so wtf am i suppost to expect? As soon as I told her i smoke she has seemed fixated on that as the cause but i have only been smoking for 4 years! Its not like i am a 60 or 80 year old wo as been smoking 50+ years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sent her a message expressing my concern about how this has excellated from rescue puffer- rescue puffer+ maintenence puffer- rescure puffer+ maintence puffer+ nasal spray and antibioticsm- a respritory terapist- a respretory doctor who may or may not want a biopsy! I am doing a good job to manage my anxiety but holy fucking jesus its hard.

3036,MistahBrukshot13,1615309854,1,"Hi guys, 

So full disclosure, I'm currently technically undiagnosed, but after years of research, I'm pretty sure I have panic disorder. The reason I'm undiagnosed though is because I don't feel like my doctor is taking me seriously. 

I've been struggling with this since my senior year of high school. I'd get random attacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, my chest feeling like someone is tightening screws all over it, shaking, and this terrifying feeling of adrenaline (I described it to my partner as being able to hear and see everything around me all at the same time). It got so bad in college that I was terrified of stepping out of my dorm room, even if it was to get food from the dining hall. It eventually got to a point where my partner and I were chilling in my room one day and I went to go to the bathroom and as I reached for the door knob I had this crippling panic attack that made me collapse and I was pretty much done for the rest of the day (I can't even describe the feeling). She forced me to go see my doctor after that. 

My doctor ran a bunch of tests and scans and told me I was fine and sent me home, but I was still having the panic attacks. I went back after another incident, the doc ran more tests, and told me it sounds like anxiety but that I was ""a big athletic guy"" so he was doubtful. He was pretty dismissive of my concerns, prescribed me xanax and sent me home. I repeatedly told him I was uncomfortable taking it because a bunch of my friends at the time had abused it, but again he brushed off my concerns and sent me home anyway. I ended up not using taking it and just smoking herb instead and looking up with my partner some CBT techniques to help me through everything, which really helped. In my follow up check up months later I told the doctor I didn't take the pills, and his response was ""see sometimes you just need to hear that your ok and you'll be ok.""  and sent me home. I haven't been back to see him since. 

Years later, I've definitely made improvements using the CBT techniques we looked up and don't get panic attacks nearly as often as I used to. My family supports me, I'm outside more and seeing friends and repairing relationships (social distanced of course) and I'm in a really good spot with everything. But I'm also getting ready to start law school in a few months and I'm really really concerned that the stress of law school is gonna trigger me like crazy. I'm also worried that because of the doctor I have, i won't have any institutional or medical support to help me work through it. I also don't have an official diagnosis from any doctor or anything yet, so I'm not sure how I would even go about getting help for it. All of this is really new for my family and me, and we don't really know what to do next. Do i see a new doctor or a therapist (money is tight)? Are there resources I should seek out? Any help with this would be much appreciated.",Anxiety,Need help navigating resources,2021-03-10 04:10:54

3043,MarioLuigi33,1615307909,1,"So i \[M26\] broke up with my gf in September and we have now recently back together. We have the same tight circle of main friend group. We have outside friends but this is the friend group we always hang out with. There's me, my two guy best friends and my now again girlfriend. We have been a very tight friend group for about 3-4 years and i have been dating her for majority of that time. We broke up for reasons of not knowing how to fix and move on from arguments but have amended them and are now back together and doing very well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However I just recently found out that they almost hooked up less than a month after I broke up with her. Apparently it was a mutual discussion because at the time my girlfriend was really hurt from the breakup, wanted to feel that feeling again and wanted to do it with a friend so she didn't have a one night stand with a stranger. (This is the type of person she is, i do not see it as a bad thing knowing her and how she is in everyday life.) I was her first sex partner and she was my second. Her thought process is that she wanted to be with someone that she knew and can trust. I see that this is an issue on its own but an issue that i believe i understand and can move on from.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The situation i cannot understand is how my best friend could even put this into his mind. The hook up didn't happen and i am very grateful for that, however it still stings and hurts. Wouldn't you think he would shoot down the idea of this right away? He was the person that my gf went to to talk about the break up and he was the one there to help you process all of this information. He is a very sexual guy and is into a lot of weird kinky sexual activities. One thing, he has a gf (yes they were together when my ex and him almost hooked up) and he lets his gf have hookups with other guy and even one of her best friends. So he asked his gf if he could now also hookup with his best friend (My ex at the time) and she said yes. I have always been curious if he would jump on the idea if we ever did break up just because of his sexual tendencies and now i see that I was right. I don't know his thought process of this all, I don't really want to talk to him about it, I more want to get pass it and still be friends because I do not want to ruin this friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR There is a lot if information packed into this. I am trying to process this all and wanted to get other opinions about this situation.

3047,FeelThePower999,1615307484,1,"I have always been a bit of a hypochondriac, as has my mother. But in the last year, for obvious reasons, it's gotten REALLY bad, to the point where I always feel I am in a life or death situation.

Before, I used to worry if I felt really unwell that I had something really serious. But only if I really felt unwell. When the pandemic struck, my mother drummed it into my head that she was going to die if she got covid. Over time, I became extremely worried that I had covid. I started constantly checking my temperature and making sure I could still taste and smell. This was for fear that I was going to get it and give it to my mother and kill her with it.

It got to the point where most DAYS, I was panicking that I had covid. The SLIGHTEST thing I felt, I assumed it was covid. I frequently got tested - all of them were negative. I started not seeing anyone or doing anything, and started living in the house 24/7 and never leaving, in case I caught covid and gave it to my mother.

Then my dad had a sudden heart attack and died. No warning. He died right in front of us.

Since then, my mental health has done a complete nosedive. I am completely alone and isolated from anyone my age, living with my mother. I feel I can't tell her about my health anxiety because it just stresses her out, so I'm always trying to hide it from her.

Now it's gotten so bad that I am constantly worrying about my health all the time. At least once a week I am calling the doctor. It's been this endless cycle. I feel the SLIGHTEST pain or thing not right. I panic. That makes it worse. I call the doctor and get checked. It's nothing. And then I feel something else, rinse and repeat.

I've had MANY over-the-phone doctor's appointments for things that turned out not to be serious. I even had an ECG and a blood test after I had a bad pain in my chest which turned out to be indigestion.

A lot of people do not take health anxiety seriously. ""Har har har, he thought he was having a heart attack when he had indigestion!"" ""He thought he was having a brain aneurysm but it was just a tension headache, LOL!"" But when it completely consumes your life to the point you can't get excited for anything anymore because you always assume you're possibly having a medical emergency, it is absolutely NOTHING to joke about.

I know that this is a huge problem and change needs to happen, and I am trying to organize therapy, but it's hard to do so during the pandemic. It's affecting my relationship with mom as she is constantly worrying about me now and that's consuming her life.

My goal is to try to rationalize things and try to tell the difference between ""nothing"" and a genuine emergency. Maybe there is still that underlying fear of giving mom covid, and as a result I've held off on many check-ups. 

Ugh this whole pandemic and dad dying has just crushed my mental health.",Anxiety,My health anxiety has become extremely debilitating. I can't get excited anymore as I always feel I'm having or about to have a medical emergency and die.,2021-03-10 03:31:24

3051,Alhon,1615306106,1,"TL;DR: I'm creative but the things I can create either don't feel like they're good or I can't complete, so I've spent the last 9 months playing video games.


Details: So, like I said, I'm a creative person. I used to be a cosplayer, musician, even at one point in my life a podcaster and a writer. But I've lost a lot of my joy in things, or I get so embarrassed at how awful things have turned out (even though objectively they're not that bad) that I put things down and I don't want to pick them back up. Even thinking about doing things that used to make me happy, like making outfits or DJing, podcasting or things like that just make me instantly tense up and start panicking.

I know this last year has been really hard, and I'm a very extroverted person, so that's part of it. But it feels like even looking back at the things I was once proud of just makes me feel embarassed that I ever tried to share it. I've tried picking up a few new hobbies, but being a novice at something just makes me feel even more embarassed, and knowing that it will take me years to be good enough to make a song or a story or anything just kills my interest in even trying anymore.

I know it's selfish and stupid to think that I would be an expert at something new right away, but I feel like if I can't create anything or do anything that will produce results in a reasonable amount of time (days rather than months), then there's no point and it's a waste of my life.

.... even though the alternative for the last 9-12 months has then been me sitting on my ass playing vidya. I'm tired of doing it, but I also feel like there's not much else I'm better at right now. 

I know I'm having a bit of a rough morning, and I'm just venting where I need to, but I also don't know how to make things better. I want to enjoy the things I used to, and not feel ashamed when I look at my past creative stuff, but the more I try to force it the more I just get panic feelings again and again. I don't want to lose what I've done before and the skills I've built up, but I don't know how to get past all the barriers that remain at this point.",Anxiety,Creative Rut,2021-03-10 03:08:26

3065,Electronic_Ad_2395,1615303214,1," Me and my boyfriend have been together for two year. Everything was going perfect until last months. He started having a lot of existencial crisis and started asking himself about everything in his life, doubting. Also about our relationship.

He is feeling really anxious. I've been there for him. Always. And he said he needs more time for himself, to take care of him, so we don't talk as much as we did. And I respect that. But at the same time started getting far away from each other, because we didn't talk almost anything (we normally do call at night and the rest of the day we talk by message, and now we almost don't do call at night), which I think it could be avoided. I think he can have both things, ya know?

So I talked to him calmly about it. I asked him if he thought this relationship was good for him now. He said it was. Because I understood him and I was the perfect girlfriend right now.

The problem isn't that exactly. I could wait as long as he needs, but the problem is what he feels about this relationship. He said he doesn't know how he feels about anything, about me, his family, about himself. And he told me that he doesn't know about us. He says he still loves me, but that love isn't as strong as before and it is different. He said that he knew our relationship could not work because it can happen to any couple, but now he's feeling that the end is closer and that he doesn't know what is going on inside him, and says that is a possibility that he might stop liking me.

But while these are more like 'first aid'-tricks, I'd like to find long-term strategies that help me to deal with it in the long run. That's why I would be really glad to hear about what had a positive impact on your mental health. Any advice is welcome!

I had quit my therapy sessions out of multiple reasons two years ago, and I can't consider to go to another therapist during covid. Thats why I'm searching for anything that I can do on my own without help from a professional.

I'm suffering from anxiety for nearly ten years now, so I know it won't be an easy and steady journey to let go of these destructive thought patterns and physical symptoms, but I am just done with hoping it will get better someday.

TW: anxiety, depression, suicide 

I feel like lockdown gave me anxiety and now I‚Äôm really struggling to handle it. I‚Äôm 18, based in the UK. This time last year, I was preparing for exams, looking forward to starting uni in September 2020. Then lockdown hit. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mean to sound shitty, but I never understood anxiety. I never experienced it. It always seemed so distant. Then, a few weeks into lockdown, I just started feeling anxious about everything. Interacting with people, friends, other students, uni people - just gave me anxiety. I‚Äôd just put these things off. This started a bad habit of not replying to emails/text messages just because I get anxious about it. I‚Äôd felt depression before, I kind of got over it and told myself it was a phase and that I was too young to know what depression was. Besides, I just buried myself in school work and was doing well and felt quite happy for the 2/3 years prior to being 18. 

Pre lockdown, I was super motivated, sociable and just happy to be a live. Now, I just feel shitty and like I‚Äôm on a crazy emotional rollercoaster. It‚Äôs like in a 14 week span, I‚Äôll spend 4 days feeling happy, being productive etc.  Then I just took crash and feel shitty for 10 days. And it repeats. 

I don‚Äôt know why this is. I achieved all the goals I had pre lockdown. I got into my dream uni, got some amazing funding opportunities. I really don‚Äôt mean to sound ungrateful, I‚Äôm sorry if I do. I just don‚Äôt feel happy with it. Idk why. Idk where else to find happiness apart from thinking up wild, elaborate fantasises which just make me feel depressed because they‚Äôll never be reality. 

I feel like my friendships and relationships are breaking down. I‚Äôve always been bad at letting people in and expressing my emotions. I always hold something back. Or everything. More of a shoulder to cry on for other people tbh. I always expected to grow apart from my friends I went to school with as everyone went their different ways. My new found habit of not replying to messages doesn‚Äôt help much either. But damn I‚Äôm lonely. It doesn‚Äôt phase me too much right now though, I like my own space. I just feel like I‚Äôll regret it in the future. Not building up more lifetime friendships during uni. I‚Äôve met one person at uni (Platonically), they‚Äôre super. I don‚Äôt share much with them, but they‚Äôre always good company and put a smile on my face. 

A lot of my anxiety comes from uni tbh. Lockdown started in March. I went from studying 24/7 to playing video games 24/7. Literally overnight. Until around July/August where I started being a bit more productive, but nowhere near as academically vigorous. Started uni in September and struggled but it‚Äôs a tough course so I‚Äôm not too fussed. Next term starts, I‚Äôm stuck at home, I catch covid and fall behind on work. Now I‚Äôm just anxious. It hurts my head. I dont want to be in my head anymore. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore. I just want to give up. I feel like I would‚Äôve already if not for my younger sibling. I love them to bits and the idea of them suffering at the expense of my freedom isn‚Äôt one I can justify to myself. 

This has been a long and rambling post. Sorry and thank you for reading. Idk what I want from this post tbh. Just wanted to tell someone how I‚Äôm feeling. Maybe talk to someone. I want to hear it‚Äôll all be okay, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll believe it.",Anxiety,Send help &lt;/3,2021-03-09 23:34:10

I transcribe a lot of voice recordings for work, and that's when this happens most often, other times when i'm typing. While nothing has changed in pace, it feels like the audio slows down and my typing slows down or rather lingers for longer even though I'm going at the same pace as before. 

My thoughts also become slower or rather it feels like it's being weighed down by something making it harder it to move at the normal pace.  I think the closest I can explain it, is when you become aware of your breathing and it goes from an autimatic to a manual process; this feels like evrything around me goes from automatic to manual and I have to keep up but I'm not able to. I'm also hyper aware that this is all happening.

It only happens in small bouts of maybe 15-20 mintues and not more and it's not accompanied with, preceded by or followed by a panic/anxiety attack. And while there is a level of anxiety when it happens, there's nothing that precedes it.   
I don't do anything inparticular to get rid of it, it just goes away eventually after I try to distract myself.

My brain went into pure panic mode. Because I thought I was in the way of an emergency vehicle in some high stakes situation. I remember thinking ""if I slow down, they'll crash into me and I'll die"" 

When I realized that it was for sure a cop that was pursuing me specifically, I knew I had been screwed by my anxiety.

 I realized I must have had a problem with my car or with my driving. Probably something minor if I didn't even think about it but that by I realized by that point I'd be accused of ""running from prosecution""

Little and often - drop by drop the bucket fills!

Supplements - I am not on any medication because I cannot tolerate it unfortunately. So I have been trying out supplementing with Magnesium 3 times a day and also a blend with L-Theanine and lemon balm in it. I think this is working to help calm my panic attacks and extreme mood changes! Some supplements can have very bad interactions with other drugs, especially SSRIS so please be careful and ask your doctor before you start. 

Weighted blanket - this has been so helpful for me when I‚Äôve started to get overwhelmed in those quiet moments alone by myself. If I feel my heart starting to race or I‚Äôm getting upset, I just throw it over me and the weight soothes me. 

Gentle exercise and sunlight - I‚Äôve been trying to go outside for a walk around the park every day. The sunshine, exercise and fresh air really helps. I have also sometimes been trying to do some yoga which helps too.

So... About a 6 months ago my stomach started acting weird (mostly diarrhea) and I was since diagnosed with IBS. Everything stays in if I take some imodium (diarrhea medication) so I have been living off of that whenever I go out lately. However, I skipped it once last week because I was feeling fine, and I almost shat myself in front of my friend. We had to run to find a toilet and it was really embarrassing. 

Yesterday was the first time that I went out since then, and I took the pill again because I really don't trust my stomach. However, just before I got to the store I could feel my stomach move and I had a full on panic attack (I have had these before as well and they're definitely connected to my bowel) I had to run through the store because I was so scared I'd need a toilet. By the time I got home the feeling was gone (didn't need to poo) but I was just crying and shaking from the panic attack. 

I'll have to drive 12 hours next week because I'm moving. I notice that my anxiety about my stomach problems have got noticeably worse and I'm already panicking about not shitting in the car. I'll be travelling with 2 other people and I find it really embarrassing. I'm scared I'll at least have a panic attack in the car if nothing else, just because I'm so scared I'll destroy the car. 

So, does anyone have any tips for this poop anxiety, or panic attacks in general? Any kind of coping mechanisms that could help me get through it? I'm not so much scared of the hyperventilation and such, but I'd rather not feel tense and nauseous for 12 hours in a car, so I would love any advice at all.

i mean of course after the years ive figured out whos worth the effort and who isnt but recently ive just felt like no one is worth it. Im 25 in august, my life sucks,  my mental health is concerning, my living quality is terrible, no one relates... i mean like ive had only one solid friend this whole time but he seems like an egotistical prick.

I decided to have a little challenge this year to have like a sort list of stuff i want to do or improve and building honest relationships is one of the things i want to accomplish. So i plan to go to support groups like AA or other kinds of places where i can just meet down to earth people. I have been getting therapy and meditating at temples but a support group would really help..


I just want to find peace this year, and i know i have to find it in myself first but i want atleast a little of what everyone else has that can make them stand this life more.. i want to meet others like me who have struggled in life.

3118,Dull-Chemical9854,1615276939,1,"TW: Police, Family Violence

The police were called to my house tonight. 
A neighbour called. 
Obviously we don‚Äôt know who. 
They told the police this had been escalating for weeks. 
It‚Äôs really embarrassing. 
My brother, Mum and I were fighting. 
My Mum was talking to my brother this afternoon. 
She said you can‚Äôt leave your shoes and school stuff all over the place in the living room when you get home from school. 
And don‚Äôt leave your money here because Blake might take it. 
I‚Äôm Blake. 
I heard it. 
I got really mad. 
I have not stolen money from my family in over a year. 
And I know that was a horrible and shitty thing to do and I have been paying them back. 
I did it because obviously I wanted the money but also because of how angry I was at my family. For putting me through shit. 
I have talked about this is my posts before. 
And yes I know heaps of people have gone through stuff and not retaliated like that, but I did. 
Anyway I was getting really angry. 
My Mum is more worried about my brothers money being stolen then she is about her son being violent. 
This is the bloody women who says that ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably fairly normal for boys to touch their sisters on the breasts until they‚Äôre told to stop it‚Äù 
She told me this a year and a half after I told it happened. 
Finally admitting it could of happened. 
When the whole time she made it very clear she didn‚Äôt believe me. 
I‚Äôm so angry. 
The police came in. 
I stayed in my room until an officer came to my door and said I had to talk to him. 
I told him the basics. 
Because they had been told by the neighbour it sounded like domestic violence. 
I‚Äôm fine. 
No I‚Äôm not injured. 
I don‚Äôt want to talk to you. 

And then I had to come out to the living room and talk with my Mum and brother in the room. 
There were 2 officers. 
And they basically said that I could be charged for domestic violence. 
If you have read over my previous posts and believe them, you will know that I am not the violent one here. 
The main officer was talking about us having ‚Äúto get on as siblings‚Äù and basically talking about our Mum just trying to manage this situation. 
I just so so wanted to burst her facade. 
He then said something along the lines of about initiation and retaliation. 
Except he gestured at me with his hand when he said initiated and gestured his other hand at my brother when he said retaliated. 

I do not initiate this. 
I recorded the whole thing on my voice memos. 

This whole experience really triggered me because in 2019 I told my guidance councillor about my brother touching me on my clothes on my boobs. 
He would come up behind me and hug me and touch them. 
I told her how he hit me with a belt for turning his PlayStation off. 
She called the police. 
They got involved. 
They were at our house. 
And they interviewed everyone. 
They said to me as they left ‚Äúyou have a nice house, food on the table and people who love you‚Äù 
And left. And nothing ever came of it. 

After the officer tonight was going on about how I could be charged if I‚Äôm fighting with him, I said. 
‚ÄúI have 5 shirts in my room that are torn, some nearly in half from my body by my brother‚Äù

My brother is 16 and I am 19. 
Because he is a minor and I‚Äôm an adult in this situation even if I did physically retaliate which I‚Äôve done a handful of times and got a mild hit in before he comes back at me 10 times harder, it would be considered child abuse. 

No one gives a shit what he does to me, because I‚Äôm an adult. 
Oh and I can just leave? Right? 
I am trying to get a job I really am. 
There is a chronic casual job vacancy problem in my city. Meaning it‚Äôs so hard to get one. 
I‚Äôm sending my resume to my cousin and re doing it too see if I can spice it up a bit. 
I know I need to leave I feel so stupid for not leaving before. 

And no I cannot go and live with my Dad. 

I hate the police. 
They talked to me like I was this horrible person. 
Like 
Okay Blake, If you‚Äôre hitting your brother that‚Äôs considered what? Huh? Do you know? 
Like they were trying to quiz me and I was stupid. 
Yeah duh obviously child abuse. 
And child abuse is wrong.
I couldn‚Äôt even hit this child if I wanted too. 
He‚Äôs 6‚Äô2. 
Apparently cause I‚Äôm fat that means that‚Äôs fair. 
My Dad once said well if that was really happening you could of stopped it, you‚Äôre like twice his size. 
Yeah that really hurt. 
He also called me pathetic. 

And that my Mum, him and I were fucking up my sister and my brothers lives. 
He apologised for saying that after I questioned him not realising that I was apart of the marriage breakdown that started the collapse of our family. 
Last time I checked I was a 15 year old when they got separated. 

The violence isn‚Äôt what hurts me most. 
Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt even leave me with bruises. 
It‚Äôs the fact my parents and the police don‚Äôt believe. 

As soon as I get a job I‚Äôm out. 

There‚Äôs no one I can really stay with in the meantime. 
My Mum also asked the police to do routine visits of us. 
God she tries to make herself the victim any chance she can get. 
This act she put on. Ugh. 
Like she actually cared. 
She doesn‚Äôt. 

This woman kicked me out in the middle of year 12 and I had to stay in a homeless shelter for a week. And then had to live at my Fathers until graduation. 
I moved back in to her house because it‚Äôs surprisingly more stable than my Dad‚Äôs household. 
And she won‚Äôt kick my brother out for physical violence? 

I can‚Äôt believe everyone thinks I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs violent. 
I‚Äôm so angry. 

I pushed my Mum the other day. 
I‚Äôm not proud of it. 
It was a little push. 
I wanted to see how she like it. 

I‚Äôm going crazy. 

But I need to say in form. 
In line. 
Because everything I do will be hyper scrutinised. 
I can‚Äôt make one mis move or It will be used against me to the end of time.

And by the fact that I pushed my Mum shows I‚Äôm losing that.

I am in the process of tapering off medication that has saved me from sporadic and awful anxiety attacks.

I‚Äôm planning on giving myself an assortment of natural remedies instead. I have decided to not use CBD oil or L Theanine and instead perhaps use Valerian, Passionflower and Ashwaghandha one by one and see how each one affects me.

My question is, is it better to use them as teas or in capsule forms?

For the most part, without medication, I may be able to stave the lingering anxiety that weighs me daily. It‚Äôs really the attacks that I want to be able to contain as they can cause me to think and behave irrationally. That‚Äôs why I think tea may be better as having to physically make it and then drink it might help me refocus from an attack.

Bit of background, I‚Äôm a 23M, the stereotypical strong and tough manly man type or what have you. I‚Äôve never really had mental health issues before. 

A friend of mine and his entire family were killed in a house fire last October. Him, his Fianc√©, step daughter, and six month old son. The fire didn‚Äôt kill them, but the carbon monoxide did. They had open caskets for the funeral. Our friend group walked the line. I saw his step daughter in one, him in the next and his fianc√© and the baby were buried together. The old farts in front of me weren‚Äôt moving because they were chatting so I was stuck staring at his fianc√© and their six month old son. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off of him. He looked like he his sleeping and that he would wake up any moment. I‚Äôll never forget his grey outfit with his little shoes. I started feeling sadness. A sadness unlike any other. My older brother grabbed by shoulder and snapped me out of whatever it was that I was feeling. 

Fast forward to Saturday night. My girlfriend and I went to her hometown to see her friends newborn baby. It was a little boy. He swaddled in a blanket and was sleeping, you could barely see his face because of the beanie he had on and all the blankets. It didn‚Äôt really bother me. Then later on in the evening he woke up and he had to have a diaper change, no biggie. My girlfriends friend was getting ready to change the diaper and unwrapped the baby from the blanket. Something tripped in me, that feeling of sadness came back. I‚Äôm incredibly good at masking emotions. So I did. 

There was a bonfire in the back and we brought chairs, so I said I would go to my car to grab them. I started to lose control of the tears and sat in the dark car and starting hyperventilating. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, all I could think of was my friends dead son, in that casket. I could swear they even looked the same. I tried to control my breathing but nothing helped. I felt like I was going to die. I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene or draw any attention to myself, so I didn‚Äôt text my girlfriend. I just sat there and I was starting to get light headed from the hyperventilating. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

I managed to get ahold of myself and calm down. Obviously I had been gone for maybe 10 minutes, so as soon as I got back to the fire I apologized and said my older sister had called me. 

After the fire, my girlfriend and I were taking the chairs back to the car and I told her about what had happened. She used to suffer from anxiety and said it might have been a panic attack, and told me that she felt horrible that she wasn‚Äôt there when I needed her. I told her it wasn‚Äôt her fault, I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene or draw any attention to myself.

We had a great rest of the evening and I held the baby and didn‚Äôt have any feelings of sadness or anxiety 


So what do you all think it was? Just a round of grief or was it something more? 

TL;DR  Friends entire family was killed in a fire, all had open caskets, saw his 6 MO son in the casket with his mother and it messed me up. Fast forward to last Saturday and my girlfriend and I saw her friends new born baby. This made me think of my friends dead family and son and I broke down when I got to the car and had some time alone and think I may have had a panic attack.",Anxiety,Panic attack or?,2021-03-09 16:28:51

3137,ivymaori,1615266355,1,"Hi everyone, first time poster here. I (20F) just wanted some potential clarification and/or advice with some issues I‚Äôve been having lately. I think I have struggled with anxiety slightly for a long time, especially in social situations and many other scenarios that would cause many others to be nervous/anxious. However, in the past 2 or so years I have started having periods of time for a few months at a time where almost daily I experience this sinking feeling. This results in my heart racing, my stomach and chest feeling very dense/heavy, increased rate of breathing, and trouble focusing on tasks at hand and the environment around me. I tend to overthink generally, but these fits I have started having are much more of a physical reaction and, in my opinion, more unpleasant than just worrying about things. The thing I find strange is they usually come on with no apparent external stressor that would cause me to be anxious. Examples: yesterday i got back in town after being out of town with friends for my friend‚Äôs birthday. The trip went great and everything was fine when I got home, but once I got ready for bed I started to get very lightheaded, nervous, and my heart started racing. There was no apparent reason for me to be nervous, which is confusing to me. Another example, I spent today with the same 2 friends and we had a picnic and read all day together. On my way home out of nowhere I began to feel my heart racing, I got very nervous and felt the same strange feeling in my chest and stomach. I find it takes a lot of concentration to calm myself down, usually having to retract myself from things I‚Äôm doing, people I am interacting with, etc to be able to calm down. 

My mother has suffered from depression for most of her life, so any time I bring up any sort of issue I have with this she kind of blows me off just saying stuff such as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just depressed like me and your grandmothers, there‚Äôs no fixing it‚Äù. I also sometimes try to mention it to my older brother (24M) who tends to be very supportive but he usually uses it as a way to blame my physical health, implying if I work out more, eat better, etc that I would not feel this way. 

My question ultimately is does this seem like anxiety? Do any of you guys experience similar symptoms and if so, do you have any recommendations on ways to help it? Any advice is appreciated.",Anxiety,"Anxiety, depression, both, neither? Help :(",2021-03-09 16:05:55

3139,nina0013,1615265640,1,"Hi all! I've recently been set a creative writing task on fear. Me being me, I chose to base it around anxiety. It would help me a lot if any of you have feedback on how I wrote it out, anything is appreciated! 

What I have so far: 

While there is no simple definition of anxiety, the main idea is fear, nervousness, and general worry. Generally, anxiety influences an individual‚Äôs feelings and behaviour, just like it does mine. If you told me 5 years ago that I was suffering from anxiety I wouldn‚Äôt have believed you, however, 4 years ago, that was the beginning of my story. My anxiety became so out of control that I lost my strength to get out of bed, I stopped eating, and stopped sleeping. I tried to smile and be content, but nothing worked. In my case, my brain was making conspiracy theories all on its own. It was absolutely petrifying. 

The idea of even getting up in the morning and going to school is daunting. The symptoms; fiddling with sweaty hands, a tight feeling in my stomach and heart, while a thumping increase in heart rate takes overall I can hear, the feeling of someone gripping your throat as though you‚Äôre chocking and running our of breath, legs wobbling side to side, and the voices in my head. The only way to feel the relief is slow breaths, although to what extent does that really work? My anxiety is unwanted background noise, every day. Like a hum that constantly distracts me; A hum I don‚Äôt want to hear, and then, it starts to sing, out of tune.  

My most frightening experiences? The attacks. The panic began as a cluster of sparks in my abdomen, tension growing in my face and limbs, replaying the last attack over and over in my head. My breathing? More rapid and shallow, like the quicksand was steadily starting to choke me; Like I was paralysed to the spot. These were the moments before my own internal, personal hurricane. I like to describe these moments as a spider web, it‚Äôs difficult to isolate one strand from the rest, just like anxiety, it‚Äôs challenging to isolate one factor from another. So there I stayed, curled up, feeling as if I‚Äôm being crushed as the whole world is sinking further and further away from my body; Frozen in time, unable to move a muscle. 

Every day feels like missing a step as I‚Äôm walking down a staircase in the dark. My stomach lurches in my throat, my breathing stops. Only for a second am I at peace until there is no next step, it feels like a free fall, you can‚Äôt see that next step ahead of you, and there is nothing you can do about it, except tumble down. 

My anxiety is like a tug-of-war. Me on one end, anxiety on the other. If I let myself fall, I lose, and anxiety wins. So how do I keep myself from falling? It‚Äôs not by pulling harder, it‚Äôs simply by letting go of the rope.",Anxiety,Anxiety creative writing help?,2021-03-09 15:54:00

3144,trickyhunter21,1615264079,1,"For the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been in a very peaceful mood. With the help of my 10-month stint in therapy, helpful spiritual practices and strengthening of friendships, I‚Äôve been able to move through conflict both major and minor, and have defined a much stronger sense of self-worth.

This was after of course, a tumultuous 2020, which concluded with me ending a five-year LDR where I was co-dependent and emotionally unfulfilled, which had compounded my feelings of worthlessness.

However, this morning I had my first panic attack in months after I couldn‚Äôt find my wallet. I live in a country where I cannot leave the house without my residence card without risk of a heavy fine, not to mention all my cards and cash I have in there. I also had to leave for work in less than five minutes.

The more I looked, the more I threw myself into a frenzy, and I was on the verge of tears.  I called my parents, who of course, were concerned about my behavior, but they did their best to help me. I ended up taking a half-unpaid holiday so I could have more time to look for my wallet.

I found it eventually‚Äîit was in my backpack, where I always put it, but it was in another smaller bag, so I didn‚Äôt catch my eye the first time around. 

I apologized many times to my parents for worrying them like this, and felt deeply exhausted and ashamed because I simply didn‚Äôt use the tools I had developed for almost a year. In that moment, it felt like all my work was for nothing, and I wondered that if my newfound peace and happiness was ever real in the first place. 

They said I didn‚Äôt have to apologize, and that this incident doesn‚Äôt negate my progress, especially since I openly said I knew I was being irrational and that this was not normal behavior on my end. But I‚Äôm still unhappy with how I panicked.

I spent the rest of the morning catching up on some much-needed sleep. I‚Äôm now on my way to work. I would like to know how not to beat myself up over this.

3149,franikolai,1615262134,1,"I want to keep this short, because I could probably write for hours. But it‚Äôll be a bit long.. 

My family has history of schizophrenia. Both my aunts have it, one more severe than the other, and not so sure about my dads side. 

Lately I‚Äôve been keeping a journal because I‚Äôve started to notice patterns in my mood/state of mind. It goes a little something like 2 weeks feeling amazing, 1 day of some sort of ‚Äútrigger‚Äù (usually late at night), followed by some time feeling down/anxious every night, and then slowly turns into a week or 2 of feeling great, and repeats.

My last trigger was last night. It was around midnight, and I noticed my bedside lamp was moved, my book wasn‚Äôt where it always is, the dust on the items on my night table was cleared off. Then I got pissed. Someone was in my room. I live with my parents, btw. I started looking around my entire room, furious, saying shit, and realized that it seemed like someone came in to clean. Probably my mom. Which I‚Äôm thankful for. At first I was very pissed off. So pissed off in fact, that I bought a camera on Amazon to see who enters my room. I cooled off after 10-20 mins, but my ‚Äústate of mind‚Äù was off. I went to bed.

Today, I woke up feeling bad. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how hard my parents work for us and started getting sort of sad. Realized what an amazing heart my dad has, my mom, how sometimes I‚Äôm mean (not actually mean, but maybe don‚Äôt let them know how much I appreciate them too often). Now it‚Äôs bedtime, I have anxiety... I read some shit about kundalini meditation and it freaked me out even more (I don‚Äôt meditate). Not fun.

Some ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù I notice, and these are not necessary related to schizophrenia, just what I feel, are:

- Anxiety late at night
- memories of past anxious times/mistakes I‚Äôve done in the past. Like PTSD of my mistakes.
- Feeling like as I get older, I see things the way they actually are.. and it‚Äôs scary sometimes
- Sometimes I get so into a thought or idea, that I start to believe it. (An example: might feel like parents don‚Äôt trust me. Other times it‚Äôs things like thinking my dad is depressed, or mom is depressed, or maybe completely ignoring the consequences of something simply because I‚Äôm so lost in my idea). A common one is thinking everyone is an asshole, but now I know/remind myself of the good people can have inside, and how normal/similar we all are.
- When I‚Äôm in the shower, I like to role-play random situations. Today it was me walking through a sketchy neighbourhood, and some kid pulls a gun on me, so I grab it and put my head against it and tell him to shoot cuz I noticed the safety was on. Then I hit him and take it, the gun was empty just as I had suspected. And I tell the kid he has no reason to do this, he can go get an awesome life, not go to jail for what? An empty gun? A shitty mistake? Then he thanks me, and asks what my name is, so I point to a sign behind him, and I‚Äôm one of the richest people in the world. Then I walk away like a bad ass after I wiped the prints off the gun. Giving him a chance to leave it there and never be linked to it.
- My shower has these nice stone tiles, big ones that have grooves and texture on them. If I stare long enough, I can literally see images. Not in a weird hallucination way, but I bet if I were able to draw, I could draw what I see. I‚Äôm able to see these same things again if I look again and focus on what I want to see. Most of the time it‚Äôs skeletons, mad scary faces, angry lion. Weird abstract shit. 
- I‚Äôve been like this for as long as I can remember, just now it‚Äôs more noticeable since I‚Äôm more aware. Sort of like when you‚Äôre young and you cover your eyes cuz you think no one can see you if they‚Äôre covered? That delusion? When I get lost in my ideas it feels similar to this. If that makes sense. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to a therapist but my brain is really good at making me feel completely normal the day of the appointment. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh, therapist appointment? Nah, you thought you needed that but you‚Äôre totally fine!‚Äù.

Then I leave, and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwas it just a bad day? Or am I messed up?‚Äù At first i thought it was a bad day, but these patterns of on and off are telling me that‚Äôs false. 

Ive always had this ‚Äúisolated state of mind‚Äù where I‚Äôm in my own world. Partially. When I was younger I‚Äôd do the stupidest shit. I stole my friends Bluetooth device, threw it down an underground parking during school, and when he was crying looking for it, I pretended to find it to see his reaction. Always had mischief inside of me. Still do, except now 1. I can get in shit for real and 2. I‚Äôve learned to not like this ‚Äúguilt‚Äù feeling. 

Wrapping it up now, the anxiety I feel is bad... I‚Äôm good at managing it and taking it, but it makes me feel psychotic. I‚Äôm a little scared of myself. Most of the time my lost-in-idea moments are non-violent, but if I get mad I make the most wild scenarios in my head. An old example: when I was younger I read stuff about animals being abused, and wanted to start my own secret agency that would kidnap the abusers and torture them exactly how they tortured the animals. I went into detail. 

And I mention shit like this to my parents all the time and they get upset because it‚Äôs fucking gruesome. Don‚Äôt really want to talk about that in detail. But it gets super detailed.

My thoughts and comments are always very creative but odd. My family always jokes around and calls me Spielberg. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs basically what I feel. I don‚Äôt know if anyone relates to this... is it anxiety? I mean, anxiety is there, but it feels deeper. 

*Also, I experimented with drugs not too long ago. Not a lot, but I did it because life is scary. So scary that it was better to focus on something else. Bad idea? Probably. Didn‚Äôt really make things better or worse, except the PTSD like feelings. When I get anxiety, I remember of the last time I ever did drugs/alcohol. That was a horrible time. So bad I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. (Comedown). That‚Äôs another story though.",Anxiety,I think I‚Äôm showing schizophrenic/psychotic symptoms.. or is it just anxiety?,2021-03-09 14:55:34

I tried to explain why I couldn't waive the charge (she pays late every month and always misses appointments and never calls to cancel or apologize for not showing up), but she wouldn't stop. What was annoying was that she was smiling through all of this while talking to me like I'm stupid.

It was worse that having someone yell at me, because if that happened, the doctor probably would have stepped in and kicked them out.

My pyscarist believed when on Lexapro I became manic and believed I was developing Bipolar 2 Disorder. I could not believe it and felt so upset from another diagnosis. I had to stop the Lexapro after 5 months and go on a mood stabilizer for my mania. The mood stabilizer made my panic attacks come back and I felt so awful. After stopping all of that and currently on no medication for lack of a better word I feel like garbage lol. I been having 2-4 Panic Attacks a day (I been home in class.) I been having awful stomaches and barely been able to sleep. 

I have been meditating, relaxing when I can, and not pushing myself so far but it's been difficult to stay afloat. Does anyone have any other natural remedies or just some advice on how to go through this because it is really difficult?   Or even if you relate I don't know care I hate looking for help but I really just need support during this very awful time.",Anxiety,Ive been,2021-03-09 13:58:50

But which to say always think something bad is going to happen. I always saying that a freak accident is gonna have been, on gonna get a middle of the night phone call, something is going to go wrong.

 For years I don't sleep And I wake up at all hours in the night if I do.

3165,ProxyWoxy,1615257049,1,"My anxiety first arose in 2012, and it took a while before it got properly diagnosed as anxiety. I thought I was having physical issues and saw a few specialist who said they couldn't see anything wrong with me.

I was first prescribed clonazepam, but I switched off of it because it wasn't working. I then took Xanax, which was a real lifesaver and has helped turn my crippling anxiety into a controllable anxiety.

It's been 6-7 years since then, and I've been taking it as needed. My anxiety is still here with me and still has some control over my actions, but lately I've become increasingly aware of an inability to focus.

I'm in a constant state of being in a daze, unable to focus on anything, like I'm in a dream and could wake up at any moment. This has absolutely crippled any sense of going forward in my life since I can barely function apart from doing the basics.

I've been thinking this could be a possible side effect of taking Xanax for so long, so I want to try and get off of it and see how I feel. The main issue is I don't want to go without meds altogether. That'd be like trying to swim without a lifejacket, knowing safety could be several days or weeks away until the soonest doctor appointment. I could be fine, but I could also regret it and my anxiety could get ten times worse would having meds to control it.

3191,Fr0gbabey,1615249613,1,"I'm really sorry this is so long, there is a tl;dr at the end. 

Hi, so I'm 16 and in March 2020 I got my learner's permit. 

In August 2020 I got into a car accident. I was in the left turning lane on a big intersection and I was getting ready to turn left. All I remember is seeing the car turning right in front of me and my stepmother yelling stop then the airbags going off. 

All that happened was that I ran through a red light turning left and hit the car turning right in the lane across from me in the intersection. I don't purposefully run red lights, I especially don't drive recklessly as my family has gotten into many accidents before. 

It felt like my mind had gone on autopilot. I stopped thinking, I stopped registering that I was driving a car, It was like I blacked out. I saw the light turn yellow then red but I didn't register that it happened. Right before I hit the car my stepmom yelled at me to stop and I was suddenly thinking and able to register what was happening but at that point, it was too late and I couldn't avoid hitting them. Since I was turning left, I continued turning without realizing it and hit the car in the left turning lane on the road I was turning onto, if that makes sense. I completely totaled two cars and hit a third. 

I would rather not go into what I was experiencing when everything stopped because it's still really traumatizing and it still gives me really bad anxiety just thinking about it.

Thankfully, nobody got seriously hurt. The woman I hit first had a few small cuts on her arm and everyone else was okay. The cops, an ambulance, and a tow truck came and everything got sorted out. 

In October 2020, my mom took me to a psychiatrist and I got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and have been on varying quantities of Adderall and Prozac since.

Now, 8 months later, I still haven't been behind the wheel of a car. Even being a passenger in cars with drivers who have had years of experience still gives me bad anxiety. My mom once ran through a yellow light in the same intersection and I had an intense panic attack; She pulled over and I sat in the back seat barely able to breathe or even think. 

The problem is, I'm getting a job soon and I have tons of extracurriculars that I need to be able to drive to and from. I want to start driving again but I'm still so afraid that I'll completely blank out while I'm driving again.

How do I get over it? How do I prevent blanking again like that? Has this happened to anyone else?  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I got into a car accident a few months ago because I went on mental autopilot and accidentally ran through a red light and hit two cars. Nobody got injured but 2/3 cars got totaled. I still have intense anxiety because of it and I want to know how to get over it and start driving again. So how do I get over it?

3194,huckthecupcakes,1615248725,1,"My doctor is sending me for an ultrasound, and I have the most ridiculous phobia, stemming back to a car ride as a kid where we were stuck in gridlock traffic for 3 hours and I needed to pee.

3197,LegrandRichards,1615247718,1,"Unsure exactly why I am writing this. Maybe just to get assurance I am not alone. 

Jan 25th: I go out with some friends. Have some alcohol come home and fall asleep. Wake up after a nightmare to some weird racing thoughts and building Anxiety. I have a panic attack. I use what I learned in CBT therapy and just rode the wave. It came and went. Uncomfortable but manageable. 

Jan 25th - Feb 6th: After a Panic attack I will get what I consider to be an ""Anxiety Hangover"". Some generalized anxiety and pressure in my chest for a couple days. Uncomfortable for sure but most of the time my confidence and mood stay in an alright place and I ride it out. Not this time. This time I could slowly feel my confidence slip away. Derealization, Depersonalization, Severe anxiety, and a Complete destruction of self confidence. 

Feb 7th: I let my wife know that I have started to cycle. I am in what feels like a constant state of Panic. ""Riding the Wave"" is now so fully exhausting all I can do is weep. I become so depressed that I question if life is even worth living if you can be in this much mental and emotional pain at once. The Depersonalization gets extreme and nothing I used to care about seems to matter, let alone be real. At this point my wife talks me into taking a Benzo (I am usually pretty against it and worried I will get addicted). I take one and call my Doc. Make an appointment for the next day.

Feb 8th: Doc ups my celexa to 20mg. Tells me to not be scared of Benzos and it is important to get out of the state I am in. Puts me on .5 twice a day and 1mg at night of Klonopin. Also starts the process of getting me enrolled in medical Marijuana to see if we can experiment there. 

Feb 9th - 23rd: Took the Benzos and basically white knuckled it through the depression. Tried to live my life like I normally would. The depression was unreal. Got my medical marijuana card and have been experimenting a bit with small doses. out of a pen it can make me a little more anxious at first and then I calm down. As a tincture low dose.. I get some good relief. 

Feb 23rd - Present: I would say I am on my way out of this thing. Mood is improving as I taper off the Benzos. I am down to .25mg once in the day and once at night. Exercising a lot. Practicing CBT and DBT techniques. I feel hope and I guess that is a crucial part of recovering. Although that episode was severe ( I have had about 10 of these episodes throughout my life ) I learned a few things that will hopefully help during the next one. I will share them with you because.. why not.

1. If you are above a 8 out of 10 in your anxiety... you are no longer in a place to practice your CBT or DBT techniques. Do not be afraid of a pill if you get to that point. 
2. Once you start to cycle also do not be afraid of Benzos.. I personally need then to reach out from the void and if tapering starts a couple weeks later withdrawal symptoms are minimal. 
3. Keep moving. Do not stay home from work.. do not avoid anything you think will make your anxiety worse. Avoiding will only make it worse and can lead to things like agoraphobia. Just push on.
4. You WILL be ok. Maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but you will be ok. 
5. If you do not have a doctor AND a therapist as part of your support system you are missing out. Find both (That know anxiety disorders like the back of their hands ).
6. When you are out of this cycle.. cherish the moments you THINK are bad, like.. getting bored, having a bad day at work, or having aches and pains. Remember.. there is a hell your mind can go to that makes all of these ""Bad"" things look like a nice day at the beach.

3198,pippipcheerio607,1615247682,1,"So i am 25F and recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Nothing was even wrong feeling with me, i just went to a normal doctors checkup and was told i had a thyroid nodule that i should get an ultrasound on, but that i shouldn‚Äôt worry.

Well, i got an ultrasound but then they wanted me to get a biopsy, and that‚Äôs where the real stress started to kick in. I went for the biopsy and they took my blood pressure beforehand and said absolutely nothing. Then after i had the biopsy procedure completed, they took it again and told me it was high and asked if i was alright. I was internally freaking out during the biopsy so i wasn‚Äôt surprised, i mean there were needles poking into my neck so of course i was tense and not alright after. 

Ever since then though i am constantly stressed and on high anxiety alert. I got the results back a week later and was told cancer. Luckily i don‚Äôt have to do chemo but i do have to get my entire thyroid removed. When I went to my appointment to schedule my surgery, the nurses had to take my blood pressure about three times because it was so high and they didn‚Äôt think it could be right. It was initially 153/115, but eventually we got it to 143/106. I was so stressed because my ride to this appointment dipped last second and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make it on time. With Covid I was not allowed to have anyone else come with me to the appointment which made my anxiety worse and I was also in an area I‚Äôve never been before which always makes me uncomfortable. 

Since this I have been super paranoid about my blood pressure. Even when I think I‚Äôm not stressed or tense, I really am. I mean i just went from being fine to all of a sudden having cancer, so wtf? I took my blood pressure at home the other day and at first it was 132/106, but after trying so hard to calm myself down i got a reading of 117/95 which still isn‚Äôt wonderful but felt like a miracle. 

I was feeling somewhat more hopeful, but then i had a dentist appointment today where they took my blood pressure and of course I started to panic especially since I kind of rushed getting to my appointment, so in my head i was like ‚Äúoh no this is gonna be bad.‚Äù The dental assistant told me it was high at around 140/103 or something like that, but i just said i kinda rushed to get there and that was probably why and he let it go.

Well after this all i can think about is my blood pressure again snd i can tell i am constantly tense and having anxiety over any sensation in my body and mainly chest. My arm has red lines from the blood pressure cuff due to how many times i check it. So many bad thoughts are going through my head too, like that i HAVE to get it down or else i‚Äôm going to die on the operating table when i have surgery. But then I think my surgery is only a month away and that I really don‚Äôt have enough time to try dramatically lower it with the rate i‚Äôm stressing at.

But for years, I‚Äôve just felt like I can‚Äôt form deep bonds with people. My anxiety makes me feel disliked and judged by lifelong friends. I‚Äôm unable to feel like I can trust them or really rely on them.  

It‚Äôs easy for me to say I don‚Äôt have friends, even though I technically have 2.

He suggests making plans with them almost every weekend, where they treat me like their own and we stay up catching up, drinking wine, playing board games. 

Meanwhile, me? My friends (again all 2 of them) are too busy to even respond to my texts half the time. And when we do hang out, they have to go home 2 hours later to do laundry or run errands or whatever.

I've had an anxiety disorder since I was 7, now a 27F. It's been really hard in a lot of ways that I won't go into, but let's say that I live with daily anxiety and panic and have hit several points where I was unable to work/leave my home/go to the store for periods of months. I've been in therapy for decades and am medicated. 

I'm a sort of chef and dream of doing fine catering one day. Recently, I got an offer to cater a wedding in another state. I got so excited. I had full control over the menu and execution, the planner loved my food and was even interested in being a silent partner for me to start my own catering company. 

It was a dream. And it was my shot. 

I had to say no because one of my triggers is travel. I don't travel well and cannot put the success of someone's wedding on the line. If I freak out, their day is ruined. It's not a chance I am willing to take. 

And now, I feel so hopeless. I've come face to face with the reality of my life. I can never in good faith let someone take a business chance on me. I can't pursue my dreams, because I don't know if I will be able to leave my home next week. And even further...I can't have kids because what if I can't take care of them? What if I can't keep a job? What if I never have a fulfilling career because of my mental illness?

   January 12th in the emergency room I arrived to fake  a prescriptions for 2g of Phenobarbital and fentanyl (to end my life)
  I place the catheter  and start the phenobarbital (barbiturate) 100mg by 100mg in a glucose serum infusion alone at home.  then 100mcg of fentanyl, I let myself fall asleep (the pheno makes you sleep ...) thinking that I would never wake up ...
   a friend had called me multiple times who ended up calling the fire department (he knew that was suicidal ...)
   3 seizures, inj of naloxone 2 days of coma with a score of 9/15 I go out without sequelae.  ...
  I refused to give details I said it was a salty serum infusion because it was hypotensive ..
  * February 10 I get atropine (10 ampoule of 1mg) that I could have them by prescribing to a phantom patient  as well as 5 ampoules of adrenaline.
   I still prepare an inf with 10 mg of atropine and 5ampl of adr√© theoretically this dose is fatal
   unfortunately or fortunately I don't know the same friend (my best friend at the same time) called The 15 
   once in the emergency room they unearthed my prescriptions for atropine (for a phantom patient) and quickly understood that I threw in hypocholenergy and inj of B blocking, injection of cholenergic then 20min I regained consciousness
 in short, I am not fed up with these crappy suicide attempts, I was given ""sick leave"" for 6 months
 antidepressants don't work for me i have tried almost every SSRI, TCA, MAOI for months.  I finally want to go.
 I got thiopental when I was in reanimation room for work but the dose is insufficient then I am afraid of the after-effects, dying is  better than waking up after 10mins of respiratory arrest ...
  it was just a message  that I wanted to write while having 5mg of clonazepam in my blood and 1g of alcohol ...
i lost the right of  giving prescriptions for 6 months  
i have many ideas in my head  , like cutting the Jugular ... potassium inj .   i have lidocaine  i can use for topical anesthesia and cutting some vital veins ..",Anxiety,SUICIDE,2021-03-09 09:21:39

The last few years have been the best of my life. I feel like I've finally learned to manage and accept my anxiety and it hasn't really been too much of a hinderance in my life.


Even with the pandemic I managed well. But a few months ago I started getting chest pains. Initially it was really bad, to the point where I couldn't turn while driving. It went away temporarily but recently came back again.


I went to the doctor. After examining he wasn't worried about it being my heart and said it's probably a muscle strain. After I insisted, he ordered a blood test, chest MRI, and later an echocardiogram and a CAT scan. I keep getting told I'm too young to have heart issues, especially since there is no history in my family. All test results came back normal. I've been checking my blood pressure and pulse ox every few days, everything seems OK. But I don't feel OK. I feel like my heart beat has gotten weak, I feel lightheaded. I get heart palpitations, and the pain is really bad sometimes on the left side of my chest. I know these are all symptoms of anxiety, but it's crazy to think anxiety can cause so much physical discomfort. I feel like this could lead to something bad like a heart attack


I do have a lot of stuff going on in my life right now:


-Work is the most busy and stressful it's ever been, and I'm working 10 hours a day.


-I am getting ready to propose to my long-time girlfriend in a few weeks, which I'm stressing out about of course lol


-I am losing a lot of money these past few weeks in the stock market. I'm sure others can relate, as it's been a rough few weeks. I also bought some Bitcoin at its all-time high before it tanked 


-I haven't been able to exercise since I'm worried about my heart. Exercise has been a huge help for me in the past to keep me grounded, so this has been an unfortunate catch-22


-I'm worried about my elderly parents getting Covid. They haven't been able to get out of the house and do what they would normally do, and it's been taking a toll on them. Dad was hospitalized a few weeks ago after getting dizzy and taking a fall, non-Covid related. So that's been on my mind.


So with all this going on it makes sense that it's anxiety causing my chest pains. But I've never experienced physical anxiety like this before.

3236,drytears00,1615239527,1,"The lockdown was a tough one for me. When it started in late March I had no idea what all I'll go through.

Before covid I used to meet my coworkers everyday, live with my gf and visit parents once a month. 

I had to live with my parents and home for me is very toxic. My dad is the micromanagement type and lots of verbal and physical abuse to everyone in the family. I kind of forgot this trauma as I didn't live at home for 5 years.

My gf and I couldn't talk much. She got caught up with her life that she couldn't talk to me over chat for even 10mins everyday. To the point that I begged her to since I was depressed(she just said no to it). I even created fake problems to grab her attention.

My anxiety was so bad that I stopped eating my weight dropped from 92 to 68 in a few months without any exercise. This malnutrition also brought a hair fall issue. And my work was also so uninteresting(I'm glad I had a job however). 

In November, I decided to move and stay at my friend's flat in another city. Back then my friends were not there, I lived alone for a month. But being alone was better than living in toxicity so my situation improved. 

In December, I managed to change my job(a good upgrade), got a cat, my friend came and still had a gf. 

In January, I and my gf had a bad clash. It was mostly that she neglects me too much. And it was tough for me to satisfy her needs(like helping with stuff, which was pretty frequent) for which she wasn't ever grateful to let alone tend to my needs. I couldn't manage to share this much which I shared with you redditors. So, I broke up with her. After which life became a bit more better. 

What keeps me awake at night even now is. I used to consider my gf family, someone I was ready to live with forever. But it became obvious that she was with me prelockdown because she was alone then. 

I got my cat to call something my family. I need a sense of that. I think that's what I need. I can't really call my friend whose flat I live in my family because it would be very overwhelming. 

I just want to vent out. I want to cry. I want to feel good again.

From personal experience, I can tell you with absolute certainty and conviction that Awareness is the key to liberation from the suffering of life and to attaining unconditional happiness. Awareness is how I overcame my Depression, anxiety and many other mental illnesses and found immense unconditional joy and satisfaction that cannot be found anywhere else. 

Awareness is extremely simple and straightforward: All you have to do is to observe (and stop identifying with) your sensory perceptions (sights, sounds, smell, taste, touch), bodily sensations and most importantly your mind (thoughts and emotions) in a distanced and detached way, from the present, silent and empty space of Awareness. 

As a beginner, you will want to do this in sitting meditation (start with 5 minutes and work your way up to 30-60+ minutes, if you want to be serious about this you should meditate as much as possible) but eventually you should also remain in this state of Awareness outside of meditation, basically 24/7, whatever situation you are in. 

You will realize that you ARE this Awareness that is observing all phenomena, that all phenomena (including your mind, body and even the whole world/universe) are taking place inside of YOU (the Awareness), not the other way around. You will realize that your mind-made sense of self with which you have identified yourself up to this point has been a lie created by the limited human mind (that is also taking place inside of you and can be observed). You have believed yourself to be the combination of your body and mind and have suffered because of all the lies of your mind that you have believed, without realising that your True Self of empty Awareness was hiding behind all of it and observing everything all this time. All of your suffering comes from this false identification with your finite body and mind. 

Awareness is the unchanging, eternal, infinite, absolute Mind and ground of reality (aka God), inside of which the whole universe and your life takes place. Your life with all its experiences is like a little bubble inside of this infinite field of Awareness. It comes and it goes, but the field in which it arises is eternal. 

Reality is not material, but a shared dream inside of this Mind. Everything arises within this Mind and there is nothing but the different direct experiences. There is no universe outside of your perception of it. You are God himself, temporarily limiting yourself to this little human avatar in order to experience this world with all its pain and joy, and to rediscover your magnificent nature. (Which all will do upon death, but you can do this right here and now) 

Realizing and entering this infinite field of Awareness is what is also known as ""Awakening"" or ""Enlightenment"", and exactly what all the true prophets and saints like Jesus (""The Kingdom of Heaven is within"", ""I am one with the Father"" etc.) and the Buddha (Buddha-Nature, No-Self, Emptiness etc.) have discovered. 

This post pretty much sums it up, but if you want to hear more about it, I suggest you follow some teachers that talk about Awareness on YouTube, like Eckhart Tolle, Rupert Spira and Mooji (there are many more, but these are probably the best). 

Here is a video where Mooji talks about Awareness specifically in relation to Depression: https://youtu.be/BJQvt4AkMB8",Anxiety,How to overcome anxiety,2021-03-09 08:29:04

It's important, it's gonna help me someday in the real world and it's too big a responsibility to just read it. How do people just sit and do stuff. Like don't you need to set the room right, have all your material around you and minimise distraction. Create the perfect plan and then execute it. Couldn't any moment in our lives be the one that defines us for the rest of it, don't we need to walk on egg shells or something? How do people pretend like things are easy and just go around acting on thoughts and getting work done. 

I'm so tired of being the odd one. The one who thinks herself into overthinking and gets nothing done. I'm tired of being pulled back from leading the so called normal life. I want to be like others. I don't want to spend my day in bed due to an emotion. I don't want this emotion to determine the kind of life I deserve to live. I want to break free from these chains and for once be able to study without feeling like the world rests on my shoulders.

So... I (F20) might have anxiety but I don't know. The thing is that I've been feeling this way for as long as I can remember but everyone always brushed it off saying that I'm just shy. But deep down I always knew that it wasn't just that.

Lately, with Univerity's work and exams it got really bad. In a month I'll have my first oral exam and I'm already starting to feel sick. It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about dropping out (I don't want to but it's a constant  thought). And thinking that a few days before the exam I'll be even more of a mess makes me feel even worse. I just can't deal with that, I'm having trouble sleeping and I don't know what to do.

I want to go see a doctor because I can't do this anymore, but the problem is that I'm still economically dependent on my parents and they don't understand it at all! Where I live, mental health is still pretty much a taboo (especially in small towns) and no matter what I do I can't get them to help me or even understand my point of view. I tried many times in past years to talk with my mother about it but she always brushed it off with a joke untill I broke down crying one night because I couldn't take it anymore for many reasons. After that night she took me to a herbalist shop (idk if the term is correct but it's the shop with all the natural remedies) because, and I quote, ""all the psychologists are more troubled than the patients"". So... nothing changed. I completely gave up until a year a go when I went to a chiropractor for my neck and back pains and he told me (without even me telling him anything) that I absolutely had to do something for my anxiety. I told my mom and she told me that we will figure it out. But it's been a year and again nothing changed. 

I feel hopeless. I considered doing it alone but public health care takes a lot of time (especially with covid), and I don't have the money to book an appointment with a doctor. And on top of that I'm not even sure how it works (I'm 20 but I don't feel like an adult, honestly).

I don't really know the point of this... I just wanted to get it off my chest I guess, since it's just me, myself and I (my friends know I'm very anxious but I've never told them the complete situation because I don't have a diagnosis and I always live in fear of having imagined everything).

Hey everyone. I am a 27 year old male. 5'5 and 140 lbs. I take Xanax as needed, I quit smoking 4 years ago, and I have no current medical issues aside from the psychological ones that cause debilitating symptoms that I will explain. 

Panic attacks and fear of my heart is ruining my life to the point where I am CONVINCED they will kill me in certain situations (such as a plane). Therefore, I'm missing out on vacations and feeling completely ashamed about that. I have a trip planned in June and I don't know if I can go through with it. I am literally convinced I will die from panic.

No doctor has been able to explain to me why a panic attack can't help me.

In 2017 I developed panic disorder and this soon lead me to be terrified of my heart because the attacks make me feel like my heart was going to explode. This fear has not subsided at all. It is ruining my life and doctors and cardiologists I‚Äôve seen just brush me off and tell me I don‚Äôt need to worry without explaining to me why.

In 2017 I had a full heart exam. Echo, ecg, and 48 hour holter moniter and the cardiologist told me everything is normal. The fear of the panic has not subsided though.

If you have time, I would really appreciate asking you some questions related to some deep fears I‚Äôve developed around my heart including not being able to go on a plane because the panic will send me into cardiac arrest. I am convinced of this and the shame is eating away at me because I want to travel with my fianc√© in June but am convinced I will die if I get on the plane.¬†

Lastly, I figured I should mention that I do have a script for Xanax but even when I take 1mg I can still be in a state of panic so I feel skeptical that any benzo will help enough to sedate me for the trip.

3252,defcon1one11,1615236481,1,"28M here.

In 2018 I was diagnosed with  anxiety depressive disorder, was on meds for  some time (Sertagen) until it eventually got better. Then I stopped  taking the pills, started running and living more healthy, my life  improved a lot overall. I am saying this just to let you know I have a  record of mental health issues.

Anxiety  or depression episodes still used to happen from time to time but it  didn't impact my life significantly. I have quite a stressful job on top  of that, but the money is good.

Well, I had.

Until  4 weeks ago after a very rough confrontation with my boss who is an  absolute worst person in the world, I swear. He basically was even a  worse a-hole for the past few months, throwing tantrums for no reason  and stuff. There came one month that I did not meet the sales  expectations, but only for a slight, and most people in the company  failed doing so (January was kinda bad month for our business). He went  absolute mad about it and basically said that he's going to reduce my  salary and that's by 20 f-ing percent.

I  said that it's kind of a big deal for me and I understand that the  month was bad, and that I will improve and I will meet sales  expectations for the rest of the year. He said that either I take the  salary reduction, or I am leaving, with a 3-months termination of a  contract. I was like woah, but I said yeah okay, then you left me with  no choice. I wanted to spit in that man's face. I think that I never  experienced genuine, sincere hatred towards someone, until now.

After  5 years of hard work and gaining a few big clients for the company,  they basically threw me away like a garbage (well I had a choice but  honestly - how could I accept this?). I feel worthless.

So  I still have to work until the end of April, and then I get my days off  which I didn't use, so I will also receive the salary for May but I  won't have to work.

It was on  Friday 12th February. 6 days later, on Thursday 16th, my girlfriend  broke up with me saying that I became distant, because for a few days I  didn't speak to her much. I obviously didn't receive any encouragement  from her, or any support whatsoever. Well, after all, I am the MAN and  MEN get S done and they don't complain, right?

My  life has become an absolute living nightmare. Over the past 4 weeks I  barely did anything in order to get a new job. I prepared a CV but I am  too anxious to send it anywhere. There was not a single minute in which I  did not think about what happened to me, about the injustice I  experienced and about the necessity of finding a new job. I think about  it when I wake up, when I brush my teeth, when I have my breakfast, when  I leave my apartment, when I work, when I come back, when I go running,  when I take a shower, when I read, when I play, when I watch Netflix,  when I study German, I did not stop thinking about this for a single  minute. Somatic symptoms start to raise up, I have troubles sleeping,  eating and I feel like I started compulsively scratching my skin on arms  and biting my lips.

I would just  love to have a 5 minute relief from the panic, but I also know that I  need to start looking for a job. And it makes me panic. What if I don't  get any replies? What if I fail on the interview? What, just what will  happen to me?! I just have no idea what I should do. I don't have anyone  to speak about it.

That's a long  rant and sorry for that. I never thought I was gonna suffer so much from  losing my job. I just feel kind of hopeless, like the fear is going to  stay with me forever.",Anxiety,Not a minute of relief from anxiety over past 4 weeks,2021-03-09 07:48:01
3253,bluedot33,1615236252,1,"Hello all,

I have a case that has puzzled doctors all over my city. My symptoms: A few years ago, and every 4-6 months, I experience a health event.

During this event - sometimes in afternoon, sometimes in the middle of the night - I feel extremely poor (generally unwell). Everything goes white. I want to pass out, my limbs feel strange and weightless. There is a pressure in my chest and my heartbeat raises, i sometimes get cold sweat. 

These severe symptoms subside after 20-30 minutes. Following that, I get nausea for like a week+.

I've ran through many tests - my blood is clean, my blood pressure is perfect, etc etc etc. My heart sounds OK. I've had chest and stomach MRI's. I do not take and have never taken any pills (not even advil etc).

So, one of my docs suggested that I investigate the mental angle. I went to 10 sessions with a therapist, and we both agree that I do not fit the bill. I have no issues with bad thoughts of any kind, I do not live a stressful life, and everyone is safe and healthy and financially secure. I sleep like a baby. Anytime these ""events"" happen, I am not in any sort of stressful week or situation (most times its middle of the night!)

So, is there such a thing as subconscious anxiety? I am stressed without realizing it and having no thoughts of it? How would I even get that diagnosis confirmed? MRI brain scans? haha

3254,quietwaffle,1615235566,1,"(F25) I'm pretty positive and optimistic most the time, and when I go out I know there's likely to be anxiety but everytime I get even that slight feeling of panic and wanting to run away, my instant response is.. Despair?!

I usually control my anxiety these days and don't panic although it can make me very uncomfortable for a while. Even feeling it for 2 minutes feels like a lifetime, I hope you all agree. Feeling it just makes me instantly sad, like I remember how truly evil things can still get you even when you're OK and having fun even. It's like realising I might have to leave or have a panic attack even, despite just having fun or relaxing etc.

I had a picnic today and it was wonder, but I felt a little full which triggered the anxiety and it was like suddenly everything was meaningless and horrifying because it all just led to this. It hasn't ruined my day, but I'm so annoyed it happened even tho I stayed calm and I'm pretty sure the person I was with didn't even notice. Just...

3255,Chigga443,1615235374,1,"Had anxiety for two years now after weed withdrawal.  Don't feel much of a panic or anxious except for times but have this constant thinking pattern and thoughts process that i think has just been fixed into my brain after getting anxiety.

Well things are all over the place but please do read it.

Hello, i cant concentrate i keep staring at things i feel like I've recently developed astigmatism , or just vision disturbance , the worst part for me is i keep making scenarios up in my head and get stuck up in it , even when I'm around people , so i'm not really conscious around what's happening around me,  i am conscious but i feel like more on autopilot than anything else, and there are times when i am aware and times when i feel like i'm just stuck day dreaming  even when someone is infront of me trying to communicate with me ,  and i'm  making up a scenario talking to this person right  infront of me like ""he'd say this, i'd say this, and more"" i do reply to their conversations but when they're talking to me i just feel like I'm zoning out and my mind is just day dreaming about the conversation itself or something completely random. Zoning out and thinking of something random is disturbing but i feel like its common, but whats more disturbing and difficult for me to understand is sometimes i am sleeping with my girlfriend , my eyes are closed and I'm thinking of her in a scenario for few minutes and i'm drifting into it and when i open my eyes and see her right infront of me i get sooo confused, like she's the person I'm thinking about but she feels so diff, like a diff person or sth, its hard to explain, basically when i open my eyes ik its her but it feels like i was thinking of someone else. Its really disturbing and happens often  what is this?  and kinda builds up a fear . Especially when I'm sleeping I think of something and when i open my eyes i feel like where am i. What's going around , that kinda fears me into thinking if I'm going mad or developing schizo , because of the fear sometimes after a long day with someone while sleeping and drifting into sleep  hear random words inside my head  from the people i have spent the day with kinda like a recall of things but i feel like if its schizo but i had these two years ago and i still do sometimes after a long day and I usually have this when I'm drifting off to sleep especially when drunk. So I thought its pretty common but idk. Also the constant overthinking and always thinking about something a scenario or something else This makes me feel like I'm living my day on an autopilot just getting through everything properly but not being really conscious or aware. I do get feelings of depersonalisation or disassociation from time to time and I've learned a little bit about how to handle it but please any tips more would be welcomed

My main problems rn are

Constant tired / fatigued / sleepy. Tips for it? Must be from all the overthinking 

I feel like something i did just recently feels like a distant past. Like if i spent an hour in a restaurant with someone and after we're done and get in the car i feel like even tho it happened just a minute ago, it feels like few hours ago and yesterday feels like a long time ago. Like the continuous feeling isn't there or sth. What is this? How do i combat this, anyone else had this feeling?

Vision disturbances like astigmatism or bright lights kinda disturb me and even sounds like sometimes even low volumes seems too loud for me , but i go clubbing and that sound doesn't disturb me but again  i sometimes feel echo in a big space where people don't usually notice it until i make people aware about it and they'll be like yes or maybe or little bit. Its really disturbing the light and sounds. Sometimes i see weird patterns after just seeing a bright light or torch its really disturbing, sometimes even on my phone screen, 

Depersonalisation and disassociation like when i look into the mirror i feel so weird at times  like i have been thinking of me in fake scenario in my head and when i look into the mirror it just feels so weird

I keep making up scenarios in my head, like i'll have scenarios with my friends talking to me back and forth. Like i'll say this and he'll say this . Or i'll just picture myself doing something and get really excited about it like accomplishing something or being successful its good in a way but it really just keeps continuing and i cant stop. And sometimes when I'm around people and i am making scenarios talking to myself and fake situations, sometimes i feel like I'm thinking about it and nodding or smiling or doing something and when someone sees me its super embarrassing and disturbingly weird . Its really disturbing. But sometimes i cant stop it . What should i do? 

Help guys. I really need help with re wiring my thought process. I can stay calm and not panic at times. But the thought process and everything just makes me feel like i'm living on autopilot or its just really disturbing and hampering i went to a therpaist once and she did nothing but tried to scare me more. She gave me a very generic advices didn't tell me any combat or tips I couldn't even explain her everything properly. She was really bad even my friends who have went to her tells

So, some back story - I have diagnosed GAD, for the last 20 years of my life I've had underlying anxiety, and every year or so I'll have some sort of breakdown. Last November through to this January I had a pretty severe anxiety/depression episode which led me to paying for 6 sessions of private therapy while on a waiting list for NHS talking therapies. 

After finishing my paid therapy and making some changes in my personal life, I actually did a full 180. My mood since the end of January has been positive, I haven't had any depressive thoughts and barely any anxious episodes, which for me is all very new and great, I feel like a weight has been lifted. 

However, I've now come to the front of the NHS therapy waiting list. My first session of 6 is tomorrow. I'm wondering whether going ahead with the sessions is the best idea since I'm concerned about re-living my break down with this new therapist, going back into my childhood traumas and generally re-opening old wounds. 

I'm also concerned if I cancel these appointments, if I have any future need for NHS therapy I will be denied a place on the list for turning down the help now. 

So essentially, should I cancel the sessions or shall I go ahead and do them feeling like I don't have anything to talk about?",Anxiety,Should I continue with Therapy even if I feel better?,2021-03-09 05:19:50

3291,Far-Campaign-3790,1615226086,1,"Hello all,  I‚Äôm looking for help, how do I help wife with her anxiety issues.  I‚Äôm trying really hard to be supportive because I love her so very much.  She knows it‚Äôs an issue, and is talking on the phone to a therapist. 

Birds eye view
She has never been a go getter, always needs a nudge to keep moving, basic things like, bathing regularly, housework, child care, cooking cleaning.  Let me be 100% clear, these are not tasks/chores I see as exclusively her jobs.  We were both employed full time when we married, we talked about each other‚Äôs expectations/needs and delegate work load as needed.  So the things I listed are things we were both supposed to do regularly and that she was just not keeping her to her word.  At first I thought it was laziness and getting comfortable in the married life.  So after a few years of pushing my own feelings down inside we started taking much more and agreed to do our part without letting the other down. 

We now have 3 kids 4,8,10.  Wife is home running a small business and doing the home mom thing which is great because it‚Äôs always been a goal of ours.  After years of her hating her job she finally gets to be a stay at home mom and she gets to take care of the home... her dream.

So here we are in the life we both dreamed of Her crippling anxiety is affecting everything she wants to do.  Constant procrastination, She has panic attacks over her health, keeping her from even coming to bed at night.  Some days she just lounges in PJs all day long.  (cool once in a while).  We‚Äôve talked about this a few times, she maintains that she really is trying.  I‚Äôve taken varied approaches, and it usually ends with her feeling incredibly guilty and in tears before I can even get through half of the things I need to get off my chest.  She tells me to talk about how I feel, but when I do it breaks her.  And it hurts me knowing that I‚Äôm hurting her, at the same time hurting our relationship because things get put on the back burner.  I‚Äôm not sure what to do.  We‚Äôre not in the brink of divorce or anything. 

Another thing if concern is she has not processed grieving, with her grandmother passing 5 years ago Indus not notice as much. He mother passed last year and it was hard in all of us kids included. 

To be clear and this is not meant to sound like rant about her help around the house,  these care just the examples I used.  I‚Äôm really at a loss at how to help how and how much to nurture her.  

Do I just give it to her straight no matter how it makes her feel?

By sugarcoating things am I making it worse?  

Does she need recognition for doing things that I see as second nature and just normal things I do as needed?

I genuinely just need to vent in a place where I think people could relate. 
So the backstory is I‚Äôve had anxiety since I can remember, my parents are divorced and when I was in 4th grade I used to make myself throw up so that I didn‚Äôt have to leave my mom, I thought if I left her she would die and if I was with her I would be gone too so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go live with my dad. I went to a therapist, I didn‚Äôt like him and haven‚Äôt gone to one since. My mom has her own problems, my sister has worse problems and so my anxiety was just something I kind of dealt with and it didn‚Äôt get in the way too often. 

Fast forward I‚Äôm now 24, I grew up in a nice suburb but I‚Äôve lived in a big city in a not great neighborhood for about 4 years now. I‚Äôve always been scared of break ins, I don‚Äôt like to be home alone, I can‚Äôt sleep if i‚Äôm home alone, etc. I used to be pretty into true crime because I was fascinated with the mind behind the crime but in the past 2 years I‚Äôve started thinking about it as if I was the victim and now I‚Äôm convinced that something terrible is going to happen to me. I barely leave my house because I‚Äôm scared someone will pick me, follow me home and then do something terrible to me. I have a big dog, I‚Äôm armed and I have multiple people who live in my house but I can‚Äôt like stop myself from thinking about it. 

Last night is when I realized this is a huge problem. I was laying in bed, it was about 1am and I was about to fall asleep when I started thinking about all the ways someone could break in, if I would be able to hear them if they did break in, etc. The worst part was that I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking that no matter what I did, no matter how I armed myself or came up with a plan, if being a victim of a terrible crime was going to happen to me it was gonna happen to me. I felt the blood drain from my face, I started shivering, my legs started shaking, I felt like it was about to happen to me even though it wasn‚Äôt and it didn‚Äôt. I ended up not being able to sleep, I felt like if I fell asleep I would wake up to something horrible. I ended up just patrolling my house occasionally to make sure no one was in here until like 4am I eventually fell asleep by accident and slept through the night. 

I‚Äôve stayed awake all night before when no one was home because I wasn‚Äôt sure I would wake up if someone were to break in but I‚Äôve never done this when everyone was home. I don‚Äôt know why it just keeps getting worse, I just keep getting more paranoid. I went so long without letting my anxiety dictate how I live and now it‚Äôs all I can think about. I told my mom thinking she would understand but she kept telling me that I just need to face my fears and leave the house doing little things but it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm afraid of leaving my house it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm afraid of what could happen to me later as a result of going outside if that even makes sense.

One big one is someone unexpectedly knocking on my door or thinking I missed someone who knocked on my door while I was away. I installed a door cam that will send a notification to my phone when someone has activated it. That has helped a bit. Another is opening the mailbox and finding a letter that I can't automatically guess what it is. I signed up for informed delivery thinking that it may help for me to know what is coming, but I think it may be making things worse. Instead of worrying when I open the box and see it, I see it in advance and have to wait to open it and find out what it is. Granted, these things dont actually happen that often.

But my problem for today is... I am receiving a piece of mail, addressed specifically to me from someone I do not know. I looked up the address and it is a residential address, not a business, that is less than ten miles from me, so that does not give me any more of an idea of what it may be. I even tried a Facebook search to no avail.

However, unlike depression (which was induced by my previous abusive relationship and MDMA overuse), my anxiety is chronic and I will try anything at this point to feel better.

After doing research, I'm not really interested in benzos (as much as they feel great), purely because they apparently can leave you worse off. 

Ive tried CBD and that really helped, but I'm from Australia, so it's very inaccessible and expensive (I paid $200 for 30ml 1000mg).

3320,SWRamblings,1615220899,1,"I've got an appointment later today with my GP to discuss upping my Prozac dosage after 6 weeks on 10mg daily. Figure it's as good a time as any to introduce myself to this subreddit I've been lurking for months, and just to give my experience. Reading other's experiences on here helped me with medication hesitancy. So, here's the journey so far:

I was a heavy nicotine user from age 17 up until 3 months ago when a minor cardiac episode exposed a minor heart defect, thus forcing me to quit cold turkey. I was literally pounding down about 4 pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine every day (Vaping high strength juice). It had been 13 years since I had less that a pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine in my system. It wasn't until after I was forced to quit that I realized I was self medicating my anxiety. Now I'm on a low dose of Prozac with plans to up my dosage if my doctor agrees (appointment on Monday).and it's life changing.

The best way I can describe it is that my rational brain is always puppeteering my body and lizard brain with a bunch of strings. And my anxiety is like an ultra-sharp knife slicing through all of these strings at once. My rational brain knows that there's zero (or very little) reason to worry or panic. But it no longer has any control over the my body or the less ration portions of myself. Sometimes that baser side of me will become obsessive, or violent (thankfully, I've never lost control to the point of physically harming another living being), or even go into a full blown panic attack; complete with vomiting, full body shakes, etc. All along, my rational side is powerlessly flailing to reign myself back in

Basically, I was using nicotine as a rescue inhaler. Whenever the anxiety knife would cut the strings, nicotine was like firing super strong grappling hooks with steel cables to catch my primal brain long enough for my rational brain to tie its normal, natural puppeteering strings back together. Now, on my Prozac, it's a totally different approach. The knife still swings just as hard just as accurately, and just as often, but it's just a **little** bit blunted. Just enough that it doesn't quite cut through some of the puppeteering strings. Thus giving me enough time to pull the surviving strings out of the way of the next swing, or to attach new natural strings. My hope is that by upping the low dosage I'm on. The knife blade of anxiety gets blunted even more, or maybe swing less hard, or even stops swinging so goddamn often.

As for side effects, I've fortunately only had two minor, easily controlable ones: The first being a drastically elevated appetite. I packed on 15 pounds in about a month before I realized. But I'm handling it now with willpower alone.

The other side effect is my sleep is... Just as bad when unmedicated, but in a different way? I never remembered it, but apparently (according to my partner) I thrashed around a lot before I started the Prozac, never remembered my dreams, slept through the night, and I rarely felt super well rested in the mornings.

Now, after starting Prozac. I'll wake up in the middle of the night (like right now in fact, it's 12:45am and I went to sleep at 9pm, up for work at 5am). I'm remembering my dreams a lot more. I think that's a sign that my REM isn't as high quality? Checking with my doc on Monday. But even with all that. I feel more well rested than I have in years.

3330,Footloose27,1615218756,1,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old male who has a mild speech disorder and have suffered from depression and mostly anxiety. At times I would wake up heart pounding since the moment I opened my eyes til about 4:30 pm pretty much just contemplating the purpose of life while handling responsibilities or working out. I was a functional anxious/depressed person. I could still get good grades and be active while suffering. I was wondering because you hear all these stereotypical ways of relieving anxiety such as sleep better, exercise, set goals, etc. I was curious, if you have lessened your anxiety by any extent, how did you do it? For me since I have a speech disorder I first exempt myself from presentations and that did wonders for my mental health. Usually if I had a school presentation my life would be in shambles 3 months leading up to it in pure terror of maybe stuttering or not being able to say a word right. But I did presentations for literally my whole life and by facing your fears you supposedly become more braver and that I feel just isn't the case with anxiety (for me anyways). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to therapy and they told me I had social anxiety (in reality I have speech anxiety due to the disorder) but I also just have general anxiety and I truly feel it is impacting my life negatively because I seem less competent because of it. I have literally tried everything to combat my anxiety - I have been taking a speech program which seems to help and bring more security to me, but I have tried CBD, marijuana, wine at night, exercising hard, eating right, sleeping well and consistently, etc. and although it brings temporary relief, I still have an existential angst every single day. Is it normal what I am going through?

3333,Damion_,1615217963,1,"I'm quite surprised, I just went into an appointment, and walked out with a prescription. 



So basically, I've been trying to get meds for years, the last person I talked to said that I would be prescribed meds IF I did therapy alongside them. I did the therapy, they changed it to needing to FINISH the therapy before getting them. I finished the therapy. Then it was ""Pshhh, you don't need meds, you did therapy!""


My anxiety has definitely gotten better, but it's still hindering my life, and even prevented me from seeing a doctor for eight months (I had weird lumps that I needed to get checked)


And since I'm starting college soon, I really need those meds.


Then finally, I see a new person about it, and she spends ten minutes talking, and getting a bit of info on what I'm hoping for, ten minutes explaining what the medication does, and the side effects.


Then she asks me to pick between the two that are used for people my age, and I picked the most common one, thinking that I'd be having a few more appointments, or at least another hour of talking before medication was actually even considered.


But guess what? She got up and said ""Alright, well I'll just go grab your prescription.""


Like...Wha? Huh? I didn't even say anything, I spent the whole tome nodding my head, and leading my mum speak for me. The last few times I did that, I got rejected HARD.


So now I have a pack of anxiety meds, and I'm going to start taking them tomorrow.


I had to choose between starting anxiety meds and ADHD meds, because doing both at the same time would be difficult, since you wouldn't know which one is causing which side effect, so I'm going to go back after I've adjusted to these.


I did not expect to get any medication today, after years of jumping through hoops, I started to think that I wouldn't get anything until I was an adult. Perhaps it's because I'm going to be seventeen next month, that they thought it would be fine to give me them?


I'm just very surprised.

So a couple of months ago I was at work (I sell smokes) and this older lady comes in (just me and her in here) and she has a seizure right in front of me. Just falls to the ground. Of course I called for help but they had to pull me out of the room because I was hyperventilating and crying and almost passed out. It freaked me out so much, and terrified me to the bone. I‚Äôve talked to some peers about it and everyone just says it will pass and just get over it, but now every single time she, or an older person comes in My heart immediately starts racing and I feel like I‚Äôm going to die right there. Tonight a lady came in and she started shaking trying to get her card back into her purse and then slammed her purse down like it was a big twitch and I almost fell backwards so fast. I had to sit down because I thought I was literally going to have a heart attack because it was pounding so fast.

i just adopted my second cat today. i was expecting the wave of anxiety that would come with him as i experienced the same thing when i adopted my first cat back in august. when i got her, i think it was just the sudden lifestyle adjustment and it made me feel very anxious and almost dissociated for a few days. i really wondered if i had made the right decision. months later, i am absolutely in love with her and can't imagine my life without her. 

getting a second cat has presented a unique set of anxieties. i'm experiencing the same anxiety/dissociation and a lot of it right now is just me worrying about integrating my cats together and being scared that they won't work out, or being scared that i won't be able to provide them both with as much love, or that my first cat will start to resent me, which would break me. i'm keeping them separated for 14 days as per the humane society's instructions and i'll be doing some site swapping, but i'm just very concerned about my first cat as she is very high energy and attached to me, so i'm very worried it will take her a long time to adjust to him or not at all.

3365,anprettycoolguy,1615170925,1,"I posted this yesterday in the migraine sub first, then decided it would be valuable to get input from this community as well. That's why some of it is more geared toward the migraine side of it.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I should say that I have a history of migraines. They were a pretty typical case of migraine with aura, and I had them about once a month between the ages of 13 and 17.

# 2016

Fast forward six years. When I was 23, I began feeling dizzy and sensitive to light seemingly at random. It made me worry a lot, but I tried hydration and rest to get it to go away. That night, I ended up in the ER because I couldn‚Äôt urinate to the point that it was excruciatingly painful. I ended up relieving myself shortly before being seen, but the doctor told me I had an impacted bowel that may have been pinching my bladder shut, so I was put on laxatives.

The anxiety, dizziness, and sensitivity to light kept getting worse over the coming week until I reached a point where all I could do was sit on the sofa with my eyes covered and be miserable. Here were my symptoms:

* Severe anxiety with a constant feeling of adrenaline
* Panic attacks
* Chills and hot flashes with sweats
* Severe photophobia
* Nausea made worse by movement, light, and smells
* Vomiting (twice only, each time after eating)
* Loss of appetite (even water was hard to stomach)
* Muscle weakness
* Very restless legs
* Mild to moderate aches in head, neck, and body

I then saw my GP with my mom‚Äôs help, since I couldn‚Äôt drive and even had trouble speaking to people and walking around a lit room. He diagnosed me with an impacted bowel and anxiety and put me on escitalopram, trazodone, and stronger laxatives. I also saw an ophthalmologist, who suspected that I might have status migrainosus, and that I should see a neurologist if it gets worse.

I was absolutely miserable for a while. Feeling the need to stand up and pace the floor due to anxiety was so difficult when I felt almost too weak to move at all. I struggled to get food and water down and was constantly scared of withering away into nothing. One thing worth noting is that I would tend to feel more like myself toward the end of each day, and I would have a few hours where I could eat without feeling too sick and try to do something I enjoy like playing a video game (from across the room with the brightness all the way down).

After a grueling three weeks or so, I was finally starting to come around. The impacted feces passed at some point and my miserable parts of the day started getting shorter and less severe. I was also sleeping better. I returned to work on a provisional basis, though it was another month before my problems with lights and balance gradually faded away. All in all I‚Äôd say it took about three months from initial onset to complete recovery and feeling 100% like myself again. I stayed on the escitalopram and trazodone for a few years.

# 2021

Fast forward another five years. I‚Äôve since gotten off escitalopram in favor of buspirone since it is milder. I still take trazodone at night. I‚Äôve had other anxiety episodes over the years where I‚Äôve felt anxious and a bit sick for a week or two, but nothing so bad as in 2016. I was never out of work for more than a few days at a time. The severity typically depends on the stressor that triggers it.

But good things never last, and a few weeks ago, amid many stressful things happening at once, I began feeling that sensitivity to light and dizziness again. This time, they came with headaches, mostly in my forehead and left temple. I went to a clinic and was put on something for sinus infections. It didn‚Äôt help, and I was starting to panic. I saw my GP yesterday and he said it sounds like ‚Äúmigraine presenting in an atypical manner‚Äù, of which he seems very convinced, especially because of my history with migraines. He prescribed amitriptyline and referred me to an ophthalmologist for a CT scan to rule out serious brain-related things. I was skeptical of the diagnosis until I got home and started feeling a headache that felt a lot like one of my migraines of old, but mild. It made me very happy to have a proper diagnosis and I felt great the rest of the day.

Well, that was yesterday, and today is where the 2016 part comes in. After a great, stress-free morning, I started feeling pains in my abdomen and chest that I attributed to gas, and I still think that‚Äôs the case. However, with each little pain came a huge wave of panic and nausea. These started freaking me out over the course of the afternoon, until the fateful, terrifying moment when I realized I was sitting in bed, legs bouncing, face covered, feeling just like I did in 2016, with all of the miserable symptoms I listed above. And all I could think was ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this f\*\*\*ing sucks‚Äù and began mentally planning humble emails to my boss and my professors at school.

But along with that realization came a lot of questions:

* Was the incident in 2016 migraine-related like the eye doc thought?
* Why would my migraines be presenting themselves in such a weird way now, especially on days with little to no head pain?
* Do other people get daily migraine symptoms without pain for weeks or months?
* How much of what I‚Äôm feeling is migraine and how much is anxiety?
* Are my migraines and anxiety intrinsically related or is it incidental?
* Will the amitriptyline that I‚Äôm starting tonight help me feel better?

Of course, I‚Äôm not expecting you guys to have medically sound answers to these, and I certainly don't expect fortune tellers, but I do think it‚Äôs worth speculating amongst people who have gone through similar things. It would help just to hear that someone‚Äôs been through something similar. It took me two hours to type this out because I need frequent breaks to stave off nausea, but if someone connects with me on it or gives me insight, it was well worth it.

Thanks for reading all this if you did. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be this long but putting everything into words helps me calm down.

tl;dr - My first bout of severe anxiety may have actually been caused by or related to migraines, despite atypical presentation (see bullet list of symptoms). Now I‚Äôm feeling it coming on again in the same way and I want to know if anyone here has had similar experiences.",Anxiety,Migraines and Anxiety - please weigh in on my weird brain,2021-03-08 13:35:25
3366,Zerandis,1615170559,1,"This past month has been horrible for me and I have no idea why my brain is doing this to me.  I work in IT and I had a pretty easy slow paced helpdesk job that I didn't get paid well or treated well at.  Our staff was overworked to the max and they treated us like we were garbage.  I got covid from the boss there and was told I was ""allowed"" to work from home as I was having a hard time with covid and I passed it to my family because of the company.  Then when I get back to work they give me this small raise and triple my job duties and it just snapped something in me. 

 So I started putting in applications and got picked up by a contractor company to work for a much bigger company doing help desk stuff.  The pay was a 50% increase in pay and lots of opportunities to move into other fields in IT.  I aced the interview and all the tests they put me through but since they gave me the offer I've been just an absolute mess.  I've not been eating and been in a bad place mentally thinking about how I'm going to fail and lose my home and my wife and kids and everything we own because I don't feel capable of doing the work. 

 Then after I started my first day I find out it is more of a call center than a helpdesk which just increases my anxiety more and all of that good stuff.  Then I found out my Dr moved me to wellbutrin from lexapro then told me wellbutrin wasn't for anxiety so now I'm in the process of moving back to lexapro.  All I can think about is just leaving the job before I even give it a chance.  I've only been doing it for 3 days and tomorrow is my 4th but I just feel like I'm a failure and made a horrible decision and should have just stayed where I was before.  I should be happy I found this place and that I'm making more money and the company has its choices of employees it doesn't have to take anyone.  Apparently they can and do hire only who they think are the best and have a very lengthy process they look at people through before offering.  I just feel like I slipped through and I'm going to get in there and mess everything up then just lose everything I have and love because you can't make a mistake here you know?  

I feel like a failure as a person.  I don't have a degree and only have a hs education and work exp.  I am not suicidal at all but I often think about how much I wish I just would go in my sleep but then I'd miss my kids and my wife.

I've never been tested or diagnosed with anything, I don't have a psychiatrist but I just need some place to dump this.

I want to try and explain what I am going through

I'm not the brightest person, I always considered perhaps I have some condition such as autism but have never gotten myself tested and so I don't claim to be.

Over the past 6 years, my life has essentially fallen apart. My family had a massive meltdown because of things my father did. I was never properly sorted out and part of my family moved across the state. I was moved from homeschooling and being quite healthy and athletic to going to a public school and being too self conscious to interact with each other. I quickly became unhealthy, and depressed about the situations that happened.

I made it through middle school, I had okay grades, but never had the motivation to do anything.

Once I had gotten into highschool, I ended up making some friends. I had trouble getting work done and ended up dropping out in my junior year.

Going back a little bit, in my freshman year of highschool, one of my friends had asked me out and we started dating. There were a shit ton of red flags that just went over my head, in hindsight, the relationship was a terrible idea and the person I dated was a whore with various mental problems of her own.

We dated for two years, when I was finally slapped to reality via one of my close internet friends. I stopped it immediately and had a 3 month long breakdown.

I found it reasonable, but extremely difficult to disconnect with this person I thought I had a future with. On top of that, many of my highschool friends were behind it aswell, and from what I understand knew about her behavior aswell as encouraged it. I cut all of them off.

In the timespan that I had started going to public school, my father managed to get fired from his job and stopped paying child support. My mother was working 9 - 10 hour days and making barely any money or support from her side of the family. She decided that we should move to a cheaper house, we moved right after I cut everyone off.

Around this time I considered everything to be... well life. I didn't expect it to be easy, but as I started to get older I feared major personal problems. I just turned 18, I've failed to get a job, I've failed to get an education and I still can't drive.

I've been starting to work on my physical health, but my mental health is abysmal. I got over my ex, it has been almost a year since I broke away from her. but my main problem is that I don't do anything.

I have no motivations, no character, I am a blank nothingness. The time where I should have developed the most, I dumped into one person and ended up losing every part of myself. However I also lack the motivation to do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been starting to pull myself together. I'm trying to get into hobbies like woodworking or tinkering with electronics. I started working out to improve my health, try eating better, spend less time just sitting on the computer doing essentially nothing (not even playing video games as I had basically lost interest in them)

&amp;#x200B;

Relating to the title of this post

I've recently developed this problem where I vibrate quite intensely when I get nervous. I don't know how to explain it very well, and I can't find much online describing what it could be except for extreme anxiety.

I first noticed it when I had gone to Sunday church by myself, I hadn't slept that night so I thought, well I will likely be asleep later in the day so I should go now. The church was surprisingly full, and due to the pandemic shit going on, there were few spaces and only the front pews were open. I felt like it would be too awkward to turn back and walk out, so I just sat down.

I hadn't showered and I looked ""musty"" in my opinion, the church was full of old people who probably go there often, and the only thought in my mind the entire time was like ""they're watching you"" or some bullshit.

I felt like I was going to die, I couldn't look up I would just start shaking really hard so I kept my head down most of the time there.

I considered, okay, im just tired as fuck, but then I noticed this happens almost everywhere I go.

I can't make eye contact with strangers anymore, and I find it difficult being in a room where (I think the best way to describe it is) something is expected of me.

This wouldn't be much of a problem to me if it was just a sensation, but it is quite visible, I went to the dentist recently and they had to check my temperature with their sensor. I just couldn't stop shaking my head, and they responded to it so I consider it is not just some random sensation of panic.

I've never had a problem like this, and I've never felt like this before in my entire life and it is making it very difficult for me to do something like apply for a job and go do an interview.

Being a fairly young person (25-30 y.o) I have an active social and social media life that I‚Äôm not really willing to give up. I looked at the Light Phone II as an option but it lacks gps function and the city I live in has incredibly frequent construction, accidents and incidents that can heavily affect my commute.

For weeks, I have not talked to any of the people I used to talk to. I stopped talking to them because of my anxiety and I wanted to be alone but it got me thinking, aren't they curious why I suddenly stopped talking to them? One friend of mine who is my current classmate, we used to chat about school works or any kind of stuff but I got pissed at him because it got to a point where he doesn't reply anymore. He just reacts to my long messages and that made me pissed so I never bothered to share anything to him anymore. Other than that friend, I don't have anyone I used to talk to in the last few weeks. I used to talk to some past friends but its been a month since then.   


So i tried to post my thoughts through Instagram stories to kind of let them know that I don't feel good. It made me think that maybe if I do that, someone will message me and ask me how I'm doing. I checked who have seen the stories I posted and most of them were the close friends I used to have yet none of them asked how I'm doing.

3413,creativeglitchbro,1614937050,3,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I follow the rules as this is my first post here. I just need to let out how *worried* I am rn. I'll put a TLDR at the end because this will be a doosie.

&amp;#x200B;

The following paragraph is just backstory/who i am:

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 23, straight male, just finished college (bachelor's in General Studies). Also I'm a talented musician and have had somewhat of a small business going for a couple years now, utilizing a variety of instrumental and technical audio engineering skills. I live on my own, single, in a nice little apartment and drive a 2010 Malibu. Music is a legit income, and I also drive as a Doordash driver. I'm fresh out of school and applying for entry jobs in finance and social work. In the meantime, I  got an easy job part time at a restaurant my best friend works at. My circle of friends is typical and I have an amazing immediate family (2 bros, 1 sis, all same parents) My credit score is considered 'good' on the scale thingy

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like I'm doing not too shabby right? HAHAHAHAHAH no. Let me get into my stressors now.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with ones that folks know of. I have PTSD that tends to sideline me out of nowhere. It sucks, but I've been pushing thru since the event happened at 17. everyone who loves me knows the details and supports me well. They also understand that the entrepreneurial lifestyle I have chosen puts a lot of stress on me. They know how hard I work and the sacrifice it takes. I'm the black sheep brother/friend who is always 'too busy'. Along with every human, the coco sniffles have also been a dark cloud over my life the past year or so.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have mental illness and a busy schedule weighing on me. Join the club, right? Life is hard and I'd say the things above add up to pretty 'normal' stress factors as a human. But these are the tip of the ice burg. Let's break down the real demons below (**trigger warning for addicts**). 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the college thing. Since PTSD had me bed-ridden right after high school graduation, my mom pretty much held my hand and pushed me into an easy college program. I'm not bitter with her, but that in itself could be a whole post. I just question the decision these days because my love for music is pretty much all my existance contains. Most people assume I had a full ride to the degree since both of my older siblings have grad degrees and are doctors. everyone supported my college journey like a 'plan b' as I kept hustlin music on the side. Well, that degree put me 20k in debt and idk if i'll even use it. Time will tell, but it's just eating me alive realizing that for the next two decades I may literally spend 5 Microphone Booths worth of cash on a degree that just sits there.  So yea, big debt lingering from school and lots of people don't know the details.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up, cars. It looks like I own it but I'm making monthly payments on my current car. Those payments are set to go to my sister, who owned it before me, for 9 months (hopefully i pay off early). That one is nothin' compared to the first car I ever bought, which I kinda regret buying. I owe 9k on a 2016 ford focus that is now on a lot because i totaled it in december (remember December - key detail). I had full coverage but the deductable was huge, like 2k. i literally don't know how TF im ever going to pay back the lender if it amounts to thousands and they won't take payments. Being self-employed all of 2020 has me up a creek regarding acquiring loans. I've been denied so many times I'm on hold with it, knowing too many inquiries can ding credit score.  The worst thing is that it's MARCH. IT'S MARCH AND I'M STILL WAITING ON A FINANCIAL RESULT FROM A CAR ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN DECEMBER

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of credit, I've been excellent at keeping balances low on the 2 small credit cards I have . . . . until about a week ago. This will make sense shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the real grit . . . I've been battling porn addiction since around 14. So pretty much 10 years of just trying to get through each day without jerking it to fake people pretending to have sex. I won't go into detail with the porn thing, just know that it's pretty much my darkest vice and with every fleeting moment I ask myself: will I ever break the habbit? I mean, I'm not a ""3 hours every night"" addict but I can't stop. I **can't stop** fleeing to it on occasion. I feel like a monster and an out-of-control sex addict. You may wonder, at this point, and to answer your question: no I was never sexually abused (PTSD is from something way different) and I've had a pretty normal sex life/dating history. But man, I can't say no to the porn screen sometimes. At my lowest point, which was last week or so, I paid a bunch of money trying to buy sex from snapchat hookers. They all either fell through or scammed me (probably a blessing). If this vice keeps winning, will it get worse? Where is this ***drug*** taking me? I don't like thinking about those questions, because this unseen drug is one of the most life-threatening ones (see r/nofap). It's my secret vice. No one sees it, but it's a constant war. The hookers are where those credit cards went, by the way . . .

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, substance abuse. I'm pretty moderate with drinking alcohol and smoking weed, but recently I've found myself wanting to drink and smoke as self-medication. Until recently, it was just a drink here or there with friends. For the first time in my life I am seeing these activities creep in as an escape from reality. This is a new realization, and I haven't spoken to anyone. I could be overthinking this one, but man, I've seen too many victims go off the deep end before even realizing what the heck was going on. To my friends, I know I probably seem perfectly normal. But they haven't seen the couple of times I completely blacked out all alone. While they're at work and assume I'm driving/in studio, that's not always the case. Every once in a while I just mope around smoking loads of weed and watching you-know-what.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I feel like on the surface, I look like a confident young man with a lot going for him, and not a lot of red flags.  But in my soul I can feel these lethal vices coming to get me.  I haven't been this stressed since my PTSD incident at 17. I know this has been a long post, so if you're still here, I genuinely appreciate you. Any comments are appreciated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Bless. Stay safe everyone

3415,yovngblxxd,1614933468,1,"I've had social anxiety since I was 10 and got therapy for it when I was 15. At 18/19 it was pretty much gone and I was so proud of myself. Sure I am still nervous or anxious when I have to call someone and present something in front of people but who isn't. My biggest issues were using public transportation and going shopping/ordering something and now I don't even get nervous anymore.
I was/am very impressed by myself for that everyday in one of those situations.


Now even though my social anxiety was pretty much gone... I was still very anxious about everything else. Especially my future. Then I dropped out of Uni because it got so bad and had to check myself into a psych ward.



I didn't know what to do with my life but wanted to move in with my boyfriend in another city, pretty far away from where I live. I was pretty much in the moving process, when suddenly the panic attacks started, seemingly out of nowhere. They started (really bad, with trips to the ER) in April and by September they where gone. Again... I'm pretty impressed.


I wasn't really a living human when they started and did everything I could to get help. I got mild medication and after a few months I did it.
Haven't had a panic attack since.


But what it did bring me, is extreme health anxiety, not only for myself. I'm CONSTANTLY scared that I, or someone I love dies.
I'm at the doctors at least once a month.
I found out through that that I have asthma, which is really impacting my psyche.
I'm extremely scared that there's something wrong with my heart, because of palpitations. EKGs have always been fine. Even one I had for 24h, where I had really bad palpitations but they didn't even show up on the EKG.



Last week I felt exhausted and kind of sick, then my stomach started hurting really bad. I went to see 2 docs and both didn't know what it is. I guessed it's the appendix and just got more and more scared the longer it took for them to diagnose me and give me treatment. Turns out I was just constipated.
I thought I was dying.


Also last week I woke up with bad pain while inhaling. I was sure it's something bad.
Turns out the facia roll I used the day before was too hard and now chest/ribcage was hurting from that.



Not only am I clearly a hypochondriac but I'm just never calm anymore. I'm ALWAYS scared and it's so exhausting and tiring. I feel like shit because I'm so exhausted from worrying about my health. I just want to be a normal, healthy 23 year old.


When anyone else has some mild symptoms I immediately go into panic mode and worry for them too.


I'm always so scared that my future is in jeopardy. That I'm going to die and that the people around me are sad, that someone in my family or my boyfriend is going to die and I won't be able to survive it mentally.



Of course all of it got worse because of covid.
I'm getting my first dose of the vaccine on Monday and hope it will calm me a little.
I'm also getting a pulse oximeter today, because OF COURSE my finger nails have to constantly be blue and make me think I'm low on oxygen (went to the ER for it last year... Oxygen was fine)



I'm just sick of it all and completely exhausted. My depression is getting worse everyday because of it.",Anxiety,I think I don't have my anxiety under control anymore,2021-03-05 19:37:48

Problems I'm having, I'm anxious about all of them:

-Never had a job before. Just turned 18 a few months ago, so not like that's a bad thing. Still in high school

-Never worked in a professional kitchen. Just my home kitchen

-I seem to have some memory problems that interfere with my daily life

-I TOLD THEM IM ABLE TO START TOMORROW (march 5th) AND ITS A FRIDAY. ONE OF THE BUSIEST DAYS OF THE WEEK. WHY DID I AGREE TO STARTING THEN INSTEAD OF A MONDAY WHEN IT'S SLOWER AND I HAVE MORE TIME TO BE TRAINED ON HOW TO WORK IN THE FRONT AND BACK OF THE HOUSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Some things that I'm trying to focus on:

-I have cooking experience. Nothing on the menu is more complicated than a burrito with housemade country gravy, really

-I have my food handler/manager certificate already, which is required

-I got a good look of the kitchen after hours

-Staff are very helpful and friendly

-If I was able to overcome my anxiety and ask if they're hiring, without anyone suggesting I work there, I should be able to handle it

-I may actually get an apprenticeship under the executive chef! I'm enrolled in some schools that have culinary courses. This would be extremely beneficial

-I'll learn how to prep food and make it better. I don't practice flipping eggs, but I'm able to do so. Could still get better at it

Oh jeez I'm still so nervous. People at restaurants expect perfection in their meals. I just gotta get prepped. Make a simple smoothie for breakfast. Get dressed in my new outfit. Walk in there, say good morning, ask if I can help prep anything before they start my training. Acting confident will help me become confident, I think.

3439,Jennnytoomany,1614923642,5,"Hi there,

My doctor is suspicious that I have chronic anxiety - on top of waking up with panic attacks daily at the moment, I‚Äôve got a bad stomach, sweaty palms and feet, rapid breathing and racing heart, constantly clenched jaw, trouble swallowing, all symptoms which came on after the sudden passing of my pop about a month ago.

With that said, I‚Äôm finding my legs and arms are constantly sore - especially the more I have these panic attacks? Even my hands - especially when I type.

Classic googling it has made me think I have something worse - does anyone else share these symptoms or do you think I should look to explore this further?

Currently not on medication but looking at easing into Lexapro in the next fortnight.

I‚Äôm new to the world of panic attacks and anxiety, so appreciate your guidance and support.

3441,Key_Leg_2591,1614922185,1,"I know I've had anxiety and depression for 15+ years. But I've considered that they are symptoms of another condition (perhaps bipolar, ADHD, autism) and not the main condition themselves.

I also know that fear of losing control/losing one's mind can be common with anxiety so this could be just anxious thinking.

But I regularly think or feel that general, impersonal things apply to me. I know something like this is called ""delusions of reference"" in schizophrenia.

For example, a body was found in my city today. When I read it, I was struck by terror/anxiety thinking it could be my ex who has expressed suicidal thoughts in the past, even though there are no details to suggest this, and it's not a small city.  I've been anxious about it all evening, although I've talked myself down some.

Another recent example: someone in an apartment facing me put up lights similar to mine (they can see mine). I remember having this slight feeling that they were inspired by/communicating with me, even though I can reason with myself and know there are other explanations for them having similar lights.

Is this kind of thinking normal anxiety/normal human psychology? Or is it a sign of more profound mental illness?",Anxiety,Anxiety vs. paranoia/delusions,2021-03-05 16:29:45

3450,Greenpaper92,1614917664,2,"I've always had anxiety, but after this, I'm starting to think it might actually be a disorder. 

I work in a hospital and applied to a different department. I forced myself to go talk to the director just to ask questions about the day to day duties of the position and got an interview, which I went to today. During the interview, I was given a tour of the department and duties, and it looks like a great deal more demands and stress for only slightly more pay than my current job. However, I absolutely killed the interview, and they tried to hire me on the spot. I wasn't completely sold and wanted to contact and wait for HR's decision on the starting pay, as they would be the ones to decide how much more it would be than the base pay, based on experience. I asked them to give me a few days to think about it. They were clearly taken aback, and I could tell they weren't happy, but polite enough about it.

 HR is giving me an answer about the starting pay tomorrow, and I'm going to make my decision then. I'm basically filled with this irrational guilt and anxiety about feeling like I potentially wasted their time, feeling like I lead them on if i don't take it, worrying that if I do take it, it'll be a stressful hell,  etc. The only negative that my husband and coworkers have said was that asking for a few days might seem slightly long, though they were impressed that I got the offer in an interview. I hate feeling like this, where I get offered a job and instead of being happy, I just think myself in circles and obsess over that one negative moment at the end.

I realize that there is an adjustment period that could be up to 6+ weeks before some of these go away.

Some of the symptoms that I‚Äôm curious if others have had with Paxil or SSRIs are:

1) Body almost feels like it‚Äôs vibrating or shaking even though visibly it doesn‚Äôt appear to be.

2) lips, tongue, and mouth feels different almost like it is salivating more. Lips having like a tingly sensation. 

3) Headache that feels like it‚Äôs a band around your head and at times pressure at the back of the head. (I‚Äôve had various head CTs and MRIs done in the last few weeks for different issues to try to rule out MS lesions). 

I was having more frequent panic attacks as of the full first week on Paxil but that may have been due to the prednisone that was given to me for a few days, due to a systemic reaction I had to my allergy shots.

I was a bit confused, since this has happened more than once but I didn‚Äôt know why. I thought about it a bit and I realized I used music as background noise so I could properly focus on my phone and not be distracted by my hallucinations. Pretty much using it for mental support cause I CANNOT sit still in a quiet room. I need the fan on, my volume on my phone all the way up, and the tv on. Could I subconsciously relate that music to a time where I was in a dark place (going crazy because I was hallucinating)?",Anxiety,does this sound like a reasonable answer to why some music gives me anxiety?,2021-03-05 12:42:02
3473,100862233,1614908421,1,"This is going to be a bit of a rant post but please if you can read them and tell me what to do if you can? 

I have been having mild depression symptoms for a good of 6 years, but in the past, I was able to manage and still function, however recently everything seems to get worse. For a long time, I had a strained relationship with my parents, but at the beginning of this year, my and my mom are working on repairing our relationship, I also wanted to set new goals and wanted to improve away from the mild depressions I been having, 

At the beginning of February, I wanted to restart our relationships, I wanted to break out this slow burn, and I wanted to make some major improvements this year for me, my mom, and my friends. but something has hit me hard. My stepdad has cancer, at first, I wasn't worried too much as one of my coworker's dad also had the exact same kind of cancer but after surgery, he recovered. so I mentioned it to him but he told me his cancer has metastasized to the bone, so he can't do the surgery and I was confused, didn't know what it means at the time, he said he would seek another treatment, but after looking it up on the internet, I learned that metastasized to the bone usually mean it will be ""terminal"" soon, and he also caught TB. he made appointments for some experimental treatment already but I am fearing the worst. and in the past few weeks he definitely appeared visibly weaker to me,  he said it's the TB medication that is causing him to feel uncomfortable. 

This really got me worried and fearful.  I always afraid of the thought of dying and losing people I know, but this news really hit me even harder, why does it happen when I am just about to change my life for the better!? now I am losing sleep, nausea,  I am not even being able to function properly.  I also developed some kind of weird stomach ache constantly, could be acid reflux could be stomach ulcers, could be a heart attack, anything I even went to the ER and went to UC clinic I been trying to see a doctor, but I didn't have a doctor, I have insurances (state and work) but I didn't know anything about my health insurance besides the fact that I have the state one and didn't found out my workplace also had insurance until much later. However I don't have a primary care provider, never bothered to check any of these things before because I didn't really have any other physical health issue prior, so now it's a whole another level of stress to find a primary care provider while trying to get my stomach ache figured out. 

It doesn't help when I look online and the symptoms of my own problem it always mentions ""cancer"" along with other more none cancer common causes. and I feel especially awful in the morning, I have a terrible feeling of impending doom, made worst by my stomach ache.  Diarrhea. 

My mother is also suffering from chronic sleep problems for a few years, and seeing how weak everyone has gotten much weaker just as I thought this year would be different really feels awful.

We are also suffering from finical problems, our rents have been rising, for the past few years, we don't have housing assistance, for the past few years, it has been supported by me working at my part-time job and my step dad's SS.  But with his declining health, I don't know what to do when he is gone, I been trying to get another job, but I only ever worked in retail after college. and my retail job pay alone won't be enough to support the family. I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have anything, I don't know what to do.

Basically, I came to pick up the keys a few days before moving in and noticed a cigarette smell in the hallways. Over the past few days it hasn‚Äôt improved. The apartment itself doesn‚Äôt smell (I think). 

Because nothing smelled at all when I originally viewed the apartment, I almost feel like I am holding out hope for it to not smell every time I walk in. When it does smell, I feel a wave of anxiety and anger. 

I‚Äôm anxious about the smell coming inside my apartment, about inviting someone over and they think I live in a dump, about the smell getting on my clothes when I walk through the halls and about who my neighbours might be (because why would someone want to smoke in their own home). I‚Äôm worried about possibly having to move because it was so fucking hard to find a place. I was going to stay here long term, and I want to get over this because I would like to stay (apartment itself/everything else is perfect). 

I am trying so hard to rationalize it but I‚Äôm struggling so bad. I can‚Äôt eat, sleep or study. I have a constant pit in my stomach. I come home on my lunch just to put air fresheners by the door because I am worried. I wake up in the middle of the night to wipe things down and clean.

I would say it‚Äôs been gradually worsening over the last year or so, now to the point it‚Äôs truly starting to negatively affect my life, mood, and overall happiness.

I feel as if the cause is from my actions the last 2 years of my life. I graduated college got a decent job and was making decent money.

I‚Äôm going back to work soon after a period of being laid off (for the off season) and this time home alone with my thoughts made matters much worse.

I feel the best thing to do would be to take a big step and finally confront someone so I get used to confrontation.

My dad says a lot of racist stuff. He uses slurs and says things he thinks are jokes but aren't actually funny. Dad thinks its fine because he doesn't actually believe the stuff he says and nothing is said outside of our house. But its not. He also uses lesbian slurs and thinks its okay and I sit there very uncomfortable as an out lesbian. 

I want to confront him on this so the house is more comfortable for me and my brother and possibly my mum (I don't know if she's bothered) to be in, as well as what he's saying is just plain wrong. The problem is I get talked down to or over and interuppted when discussing things and dad never listens unless he finds out the information for himself one day.

I tried watch some videos to hype myself up to do it but instead I kind of just made sure my mouth was full of food when he started saying stuff. üòÖ

3503,Remarkable-Actuator5,1614900122,1,"Posting this is a terrible idea.

Firstly, because I don't know if this is the right place for it. It might not be an anxiety problem. I have no idea what's wrong with me. If someone does, then I would appreciate being pointed in the direction of a more appropriate sub. Or anything that might help.

Secondly, because I shouldn't be on social media anymore, especially Reddit. This place hurts too much.

But I've exhausted every other option. I have tried every trick and exercise I can find to help me stop feeling this way, but none of it works. My problem is too wrapped up in internet culture for my therapist to understand. I am grasping at straws. 

I don't feel safe in my own mind. For years now, I've dealt with these obsession. I find something that upsets me and I don't let it go. I start seeing it everywhere and making connections to it and eventually all aspects of my life are poisoned by it.

The last few times this has happened, there were safe havens; places I could go in my mind that were fortified enough with positive associations that the bad stuff couldn't hurt me as much.

But this time, it's those safe havens that are being attacked. It's my whole identity being attacked. Anytime I come across someone being critical online, I find a way to connect their grievances to something I've done or thought about. I feel guilty for things that have absolutely nothing to do with me, which starts this downward spiral of thinking about everything I've ever hated myself for, and then coming up with new reasons to hate myself. I've become so defensive in the inside. I just want it to stop.

Seriously, I have no idea where this comes from. I've always been very, very sensitive, but most of my episodes only last a day, at most. The clouds eventually part and I can see the light again and everything is fine. I can hang on to that knowledge when I'm feeling really bad.

But not this stuff. For some reason, some issues just will not go away. Sometimes, I'll get frustrated that I have to hide from things that upset me, so I seek out something that might trigger the obsession to test myself. That makes it worse, as you might expect.

I just feel so fucking trapped. Unsympathetic. Amoral. Disgusting. I am forever casting myself as the villain. 

After getting some of that out, I'm starting to feel a little better. I'm remembering that there is some hope for me.

I've gotten out of one of these obsessions before, and I know the issue is probably just chemical. The solution is just to wait till quarantine is over, when I can get back on campus, talk to other people, and feel like a real human being again.

First point, we are also animals. Weird because we have really complicated societal structures/hierarchies. Etc. 

This might sound really messed up, but the more I see of human society, it just starts to make sense to me. Humans can fall I to categories of predator and prey.  I don‚Äôt mean to generalize and say everyone falls into one category. I grew up Mormon, super ‚Äúreverent,‚Äù sweet, kind, overly empathetic (now have moral OCD related, extreme anxiety over less fortunate and social issues). It sucks. Also gay! Tons of bullying. 

And sometimes I think myself into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just some straight jock who has had it easy and is isolated from poverty, suffering, ever knowing mental illness‚Äù and it calms me. 

And I realize bullies, sociopaths, serial killers, ruthless go-getters, politicians, some corporate billionaires, selfish/myopic people (not that ambition or self interest is bad) have tendencies of predators. TW: I‚Äôve also been abused/assaulted and have prey tendencies. And they definitely had predator tendencies. 

I think about rabbits or other prey- the racing heart, freeze response, dissociation. I was just talking to someone today who started saying classist things and it gets to me so much. I‚Äôm not in financial risk, thankfully, but this person felt so justified and pumped up thinking he was better than others.

3527,Calltheseacaptain,1614894865,1,"
I (31F) called off my relationship today with my fianc√© (47M) after 7 years together :( 

We started out our relationship in the worst way and so it‚Äôs probably no wonder I was pretty insecure through our whole relationship, not all his doing as I wasn‚Äôt resilient enough to cope with certain situations. I‚Äôd also been cheated on by my previous bf of which I found out over text.

Last Summer I found out my OH had been messaging a former 23F colleague throughout the entire lockdown and was not open about it. Admittedly they weren‚Äôt messaging all the time (maybe 10-20 messages each a month) but he never mentioned it which I found strange seeing as we‚Äôve met a few times. It was this lack of openness that really got me questioning our relationship.

Since then I‚Äôve had really intrusive thoughts that I‚Äôm not good enough for him and he‚Äôs more interested in his much younger co-workers. I would obsess over the smallest details, see streams of smiley emojis on his work Slack from a few metres away (we‚Äôre working in the same room during lockdown) and worry about what was being said. 

I struggle immensely with brain fog (possibly CFS related) and my constant fatigue, body aches, visual problems have been wearing me down.

I was finding that we don‚Äôt have much to say anymore, which was making me even more sad. I feel that if you‚Äôre in a relationship communication and laughter is so so important. Surely being anxious around your partner is not how things should be? 

Because of not having any thoughts on my mind except intrusive ones, I would pick up on the fact that his work colleagues would have so much more to say to him in 10mins than we would for the whole working day, things weren‚Äôt much better in the evenings. It sucks when you‚Äôre suddenly comparing yourself to a younger, more beautiful woman that has only known your fianc√© for less than a year but can manage a much better conversation than you after 7 years together :( I was really taking this to heart though he tried to reassure me I didn‚Äôt need to compare myself to anyone.

Today I finally sat him down and said we have to come to a decision about this. That I can‚Äôt go on like this because it‚Äôs making me physically and mentally unwell, and I can‚Äôt be the person I really want to be with him. He honestly does deserve someone who doesn‚Äôt overthink everything in the relationship.

I‚Äôm just terrified that I have done the wrong thing and that I will forever feel guilty of losing the one man I know I will love always. My gut though says this is unhealthy.

3528,Whatareyouonaboutm,1614894785,1,"Been thinking about my neuroticism lately, and keep returning to this fear that I had that led to full blown anxiety and panic attacks. Before they started, I felt relatively normal. I was bright, usually at or near the top of the class, and looked to have a promising future. After this fear developed, I became completely disinterested and had chronic anxious thoughts. It feels like once these episodes started happening, my life fell off the rails. I genuinely believe this is what caused me to be this way. 

I now know this fear to be called apeirophobia. I was raised Catholic, so I was led to believe I‚Äôd live in eternal paradise once I died. This sounds like a great deal on paper, and many people live their lives in hopes of this outcome. But while paradise sounds great, I couldn‚Äôt get over the eternity part. Even if it had everything I ever wanted, after a billion years it‚Äôd surely get old. And that isn‚Äôt even one percent, it would keep going on forever with no end. And these thoughts, this attempt to work out what eternity feels like was awful. It filled me with dread, it trapped me in a prison in my mind.

My GF (25yo) has some undiagnosed form of anxiety- it probably isn't a severe case but it's definitely there. Generally it's totally manageable but recently she's been under a lot of pressure.

She works in Media/Advertising in NYC which, as anyone who knows anyone in this field is aware, is a thankless, nonstop grind of an industry. She decided to start taking the steps to switch careers to some kind of nursing in the fall, and began taking prerequisite courses for a nursing program so she's been balancing that with her job. 

Recently her job has become unbearable to her, and causing her so much stress, anxiety, and depression that it's seeping into every moment of her life. Her heart starts to race any time her phone gets a notification because it might be a work email. She can't fall asleep even though she's exhausted every day because she can't stop thinking about what she has to do the next day. She starts getting the ""Sunday Scaries"" at around 7pm on Friday evening, dreading the things on her to do list for the next Monday. She breaks down crying out of nowhere about twice per week, and I could go on but I think you can get the idea.

She tried going to a GP yesterday to explain her situation to see if the doctor would support some kind of leave (Short Term Disability/FMLA) and all the doctor offered was a Xanax/sleeping pills prescription, which she is very averse to as her dad is a lifelong (but 35 years recovering!) drug/alcohol abuser, as well as a recommendation to seek counseling. 

We're kind of at a loss for options on what to do right now. The doctor she saw this week was not her regular doctor, who does not have availability until next Tuesday (which she does have an appointment for) and we're hoping she might have a different solution but if not we're back to square one. My GF is REALLY struggling right now and I'm feeling so terrible for her right now but it feels like there's nothing we can do. Her company does offer 12 sick days per year, but she had to use a sick day yesterday because she was in too bad of a place to do any work and even was almost too anxious to send the email saying she was going to be out. HR has recommended using these sick days for a 1-week leave, but that seems more like a temporary solution and she needs something NOW.

Last year I moved to a big city to go to colllege, I became really close with another friend (B), we now hang out almost everyday.

To make it shorter I'll go straight to the main point.

I now realise that it was all because of her, because just before I felt bad she always accused us of letting her behind, not calling her (she expected us to call her 4 times a day), making plans without her,... she is convinced that we abandonned her and that we are mean to her when actually we are trying our best to maintain a good relationship with her to the point where it is making us physicaly ill of stress.

3542,jonnytekno,1614892106,1,"Hi my 7yr old son has recently started showing signs of fairly constant anxiety, mostly at school.

He's dyslexic and potentially has autistic traits.

Looking back it's something that's been bubbling for a while, but he clearly struggles to explain it and so it had manifested in different things he's appeared to have issues with, such as specific games at break times or certain lessons.

But as it's gotten worse I'm now realising that he just has this underlying sense of anxiety that I don't think he can explain other than to say he is scared of school, and when questioned about it he will point out some thing or someone, but that changes all the time.

Lately he has started to express this and will say he just can't explain how he feels but doesn't want to go to school.


It's so heartbreaking to not be able to understand and help him, or know the best course of action. School are good and have him in counselling each week with a kind of play therapist, but not sure it's having much effect. 

We're just coming to realisation we should speak to doctor, but wary of them just going down the medication route.

3552,firewolf8385,1614889832,2,"Sorry for the length. Part of me feels like writing this out will help me rather than keeping it bottled up. TL:DR at the bottom.

I have had Asthma all my life. Despite this, it has never really impacted me... until this past weekend. Friday night I began to have trouble breathing. Allergy medicine and my inhaler had no effect. I could not fall asleep over it. This had continued through Monday, though I was able to get some rest thankfully. However, Monday night came around and things took a turn for the worse. It became very difficult to breath, and I could not sleep. I contemplated calling 911 at one point, but decided against it. Tuesday morning I had called my local doctors office expecting a simple nebulizer treatment. My mother also has asthma, and has had to do this a couple times. The office called me back later that day telling me to go to Urgent Care, which promptly sent me to the Emergency Room.

This alone had my anxiety up. I‚Äôve never been a patient in a hospital before, and never been in one by myself (I‚Äôm only 19). They took my vitals and sent me to wait for a room. My anxiety only worsened once I made it to a room. Rather than a nebulizer, I was hooked up to a heart monitor, oxygen monitor, ecg, and an IV. I had blood drawn and a chest X-ray taken. Afterwards, they had pumped fluid into me due to having a high heart rate (140-150). Due to breathing problems being a covid symptom, I was also covid tested. I was also unable to begin treatment for almost 4 hours.

Eventually, the covid test game back negative and it was time to begin the nebulizer. This should have been simple, since a nebulizer is just a machine to get the inhaler medicine deeper into the lungs. The nurse handed me the mouth piece, said that she was going to do 2 now and 1 later (whatever that means), told me to breath, and left the room. The sweet relief I was looking for never came. The medicine was making it hard to breath, and my body numb. At first I couldn‚Äôt feel my feet, then my legs, then my hands/arms. Despite this, I continued breathing. The heart rate monitor started beeping, reading 170. This made my anxiety skyrocket. My mouth and neck started going numb, and everything started going white. The highest I remember the monitor going before blacking out briefly was 192.

At this point, no less than 4 people were in the room, 3 nurses and the doctor, though I don‚Äôt exactly remember then coming on. One nurse told me to take deep breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth (which helped, and I still use now), while another went to get more IV fluid. My heart rate eventually stabilized at around 110, and I was given 60mg of prednisone. After another hour I was starting to feel a bit better, and after 6 hours in the ER I was discharged with a prescription for prednisone and a new inhaler.

A few hours after getting home, things started to turn south again. However, this time I am almost certain it was due to anxiety. Being hooked up to those monitors gave me a strange peace-of-mind, that no matter what happened, a medical professional could make things better. Without this, I was having an anxiety increasingly hard find breathing, and sleeping proved futile again. Due to my exhaustion over the past few days, I slept nearly the entire day Wednesday.

This brings us to today, being mostly caught up in sleep, I can‚Äôt nap my feelings away. I feel even worse than I did Tuesday night, and I am certain it‚Äôs due to my anxiety. As a college student, this is having a severe impact on my ability to complete coursework. While I‚Äôve always considered my self to be an anxious person, it has never impacted me this bad before. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to lessen my anxiety?

Every morning before work, I wake up about an hour before my alarm. My heart is beating like crazy, I feel jittery and the need to continuously stretch. My stomach is usually in knots and I feel nauseous and diarrheal. Some mornings I do throw up, others I don't and just feel sick for at least a couple hours. 

I've noticed, however, that if my shift is scheduled for later in the day, my anxiety is much much worse. I feel all the gastro symptoms; nausea, stomach pains, diarrhea, etc. I can't focus on anything to use for distraction, I tend to putter around my house shivering and holding my breath. No matter what reassurance I speak to myself, it never gets better. Anyone else struggle with this?

That's okay though because he's been understanding as best as he can. I've not been as open about it as I've wanted to (duh, I'm anxious about my anxiety lol) and after a disagreement last week I've been bottling up my emotions to where my body is like wtf. Yesterday he was joking about my anxiety, and I couldn't tell he was joking (he has a terrible sense of humor btw, but I love him for it anyway) and I just burst into tears. He was sorry, and I was mad at myself for not addressing underlying issues in the first place that led to that dramatic moment.

Anyway he went to bed early since we ran out of coffee, and I used the evening to finally journal like I told my therapist I would. Verbal expression has always been challenging to me, and journaling is therapeutic; it helps me focus my thoughts. I've been avoiding it lately because it's also exhausting to work through things. In the middle, I had to stop. I knew I really needed to write this all to my boyfriend. I haven't really written to him before, even though I love to write because it's not his preferred communication. He's a firm believer in having your actions speak for you, and on top of it English is his 3rd language (It's very good though). But by accommodating him, I've been feeling like I'm really depriving him of hearing my voice and getting to know me better. 

So I got out a legal pad and wrote him a letter explaining why I was writing, apologizing for not being open, reaffirming the importance of our relationship and really laying bare a couple things that had been on my mind and how anxiety was making it worse. 

This morning I woke up to a note he wrote in the space left below, addressed to ""Big Kitty"" (I have two cats, and they learned everything from me lol) about how he loves me and supports me. You guys, it had me crying all over again but from relief. We've been talking about forever together, but I've still been trying to hide how broken I feel bc how can someone so broken love and be loved (that's anxiety talking I know). When I got up, he asked if I was doing better, and said not to worry about my anxiety getting in the way of our relationship and he'll support me how he can. He's also like, a picture tells a thousand words... I'll make a picture and you'll write a thousand words.

We're VERY different people, but this morning I'm reminded of how our differences just make what we have more special. This ended up way longer than I thought, but I just had to share.

So I had severe anxiety around October and it involved daily constant anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. I started practicing some lifestyle changes and reading some therapy books so I got really better. I haven't had panic attacks for months and Although I still sometimes feel mildly anxious, it's not overwhelming and I can pretty much deal with it.

But I have this fear that my anxiety will come back in a very severe form and I can't do nothing about it , it'll make me disabled and unable to work and nothing (even medication) can't make it better (I've never taken anti-anxiety or depression medication, I've rarely taken beta-blockers, last one months ago).

So I know that usually major depressive disorder may lead to disability and I haven't heard about disability due to anxiety much (and I've even read that anxiety responds well to medication) but still I perhaps irrationally fear that I'll be disabled for long term due to anxiety and all my skills and things I learnt in college will be of no use.

Fast forward to this morning 

We have something called 7:17 liturgy on thursdays which is optional, but if your club is hosting you have to attend. I‚Äôm in NHS and we were hosting this time 

I‚Äôve been in church thousands of times even while being non-binary, gay, autistic, so many alienating things but I‚Äôm usually able to stomach it and get through it with mild annoyance that I have to take time out of my day for this. But today was different 

I haven‚Äôt been relatively anxious since starting my medication, and religious stuff usually doesn‚Äôt make me feel like... this.

When I was there, it started as mild annoyance at some bible contradictions, nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle but.. as time went on, as I noticed everyone singing in sync, everyone so happy and comfortable, everyone else was right where they were supposed to be it seemed. Everyone knew I wasn‚Äôt religious but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the subtle side-stares of my teachers and classmates as they realized I wasn‚Äôt singing/praying. One of the youth ministers gave me a hymn book halfway through because I didn‚Äôt grab one because I‚Äôm not religious, even though I refused it and,... I‚Äôve just never been so aware that something about me is wrong.

It felt... unnatural, how in sync everyone else was, how normal this was to them and wrong how scared I was, how choked I felt, how I felt like I was harboring some dark, slimy, inky black evil mass inside of me working it‚Äôs way through my veins. Five minutes before the bell rung I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I ran out, and once I got out of the room I could breathe again, even though there should have been no issue breathing before 

In my first class everything still felt wrong. Not just me but.. everything. Touching my head long enough to fix my hair felt sinful. Everything I looked around at felt wrong somehow even though I knew these rooms. The items inside and the people inside felt fake. 

I know the objects around me in this room are what they are, and if I touch them I will feel them and they will behave according to their properties. I know that. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs a cover for something. That hell is lying underneath. The room I‚Äôm really in must be different.

Im in my second semester of college. I went to one of the best high schools in my country and i was successful even without studying much. I was always like this, i was at the top of my class even without studying throughout my life. I was always believing myself and i was confident. 

I got accepted to one of the best universities in my country. first semester of the college started out the same way. I was again confident and wasnt studying much.  understandably my grades suffered very much. I understood that i have to work hard. and honestly i was already doing some work because we have so many assignments throughout the year but i realized i had to put some work.

I am studying more this semester but i dont feel confident in myself at all. Both because i am not used to working, and also because i lost my confidence i feel extremely anxious. I am overthinking future constantly. Remaining three years of the college is extremely scary to me and after that there is work life also.

I‚Äôve had all the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck going to the jaw enlarged for 2 years. Can they stay enlarged sometimes normally?



25 male. Two years ago I had a very bad upper respiratory infection that took nearly 2 weeks of antibiotics to kick. I coughed up blood it was so bad. Anyway two weeks AFTER the antibiotics all these nodes flared up. Never once been tender. I can feel 4 roughly baked bean shaped in the posterior cervical left side, one a little further back along the change behind the head, as well as 3 along the anterior cervical left side a bit bigger more like kidney bean size, and 2 under the jaw and chin both peanut MM size. All mobile all non tender etc. docs felt them and ran bloods; they ruled out EB viruses including mono, they ruled out HIV, thyroid normal along with other basic stuff. The only oddities were mildly low WBC which I continue to have to this day (like just under normal) mildly low MPV and very weak positive ANA (such a low titer they didn‚Äôt even read it according to the report) The did an ultrasound of the neck which said ‚Äòlymph nodes on the L side of neck are noticeably more prominent than the right however not large enough to qualify for biopsy‚Äô so basically saying they agree they are enlarged but not quite enough to investigate further. 

Largest node was 2.4 cm X 0.8 cm I have over 7 that are longer than 1cm. I though anything longer than 1cm was abnormal??

Anyway I‚Äôm just confused, why would nodes get stuck? Doc said sometimes they just don‚Äôt go down, I‚Äôve heard a couple people mention they have one or two that they can still feel but to have 14 all on one side of my neck?? Isn‚Äôt this concerning?

3628,Adamrileynz,1614868958,110,"My whole life I really didn't understand anxiety.

I knew I often felt an overwhelming response to things that didn't match my situation, but I wouldn't have called it anxiety.

It wasn't until I started to learn about anxiety that I realised, in fact I had been suffering from it my whole life.

But what is it?

Well, what do we know?  We know it doesn't feel good.

It's an uncomfortable, sometimes consuming feeling that can be activated in response to something, but our reaction is way out of proportion.  Or it can just be there seemingly without reason, triggered by a thought or with no obvious cause.

Here's what I've learned studying with my teacher Daniel Packard.

This horrible feeling that is out of proportion to the situation around us is because of a build up of neglect.

A build up over your whole life of situations where you or other people didn't treat you well.  And, often the mistreatment wasn't just once.  You may have been in situations where you knew you weren't feeling good and you stayed in them because you were afraid to get out.

**Here are some major areas of neglect to your emotional system:**

* Not setting boundaries
* Saying yes when you mean no
* Not telling people how you really feel
* Not sticking up for yourself/avoiding conflict
* Not going for something you really want
* Setting goals and beating yourself up for not achieving them
* Beating yourself up for anything
* Needing to be liked
* Caring what people think
* People pleasing

Doing some or many of these?  Then it's natural that you would feel a build up of neglect, i.e anxiety.

The anxiety is a warning system that is saying ""I've had enough!"" I can't take this any more.

It's not the cause of your problem but the warning bells going off to let you know that there is a problem.

Then when something seemingly small happens on the outside you can have an out of proportion reaction because your system is overloaded.

Of course, you probably already know you need to take better care of yourself right?  We know we need to but we don't always do it.  Why is that?

It's because these things are scary to do.  It's scary to speak up, set boundaries, say no.  It's scary that people might not like us so we need to make sure they do.  Beating yourself up also comes from the fear of what might happen if you don't whip yourself to do something.

So, one of the main factors under why you've not being taking care of yourself for so long, and why you have a build up of neglect you call anxiety, is because there is a fear underneath preventing you from taking better care.

I won't go into full detail here but this fear and inaction are also connected to two deeper elements which are the real root cause of anxiety and much of human suffering in general.

These are two false but strongly ingrained beliefs;  ""I'm not worthy"" and ""I'm not good enough""

With this post we can at least understand a bit better what anxiety is, we are more ""problem aware"".  If you'd like to know more and hear about the solution feel free to get in touch.

So, you want to.

Maybe you want to¬†stop thinking¬†about a recent breakup, or¬†feel discouraged¬†from a year of physical distancing and want to embrace a more hopeful perspective.

Unwanted thoughts can cause plenty of frustration and distress. You‚Äôre not alone in wanting to make them go away. It‚Äôs normal to have trouble convincing yourself to¬†look up¬†when feeling downcast in the face of stress and other challenges.

While actual mind control belongs in the realm of science fiction, you¬†can¬†work to change your mindset. It might take some effort to learn the trick of regaining control, but the 10 strategies below can help.

Identify the thoughts you want to change

It goes without saying that you have to figure out what‚Äôs on your mind before you can begin to control it.

Nearly everyone experiences discouraging thoughts or emotional setbacks from time to time. If you‚Äôre currently experiencing some life challenges, you might find it even harder to maintain control over spiraling thoughts or your overall mindset.

Occasional¬†intrusive thoughts¬†are pretty normal, too. They can be distressing, but they often pass as quickly as they intruded, especially when you¬†don‚Äôt engage¬†with them.

Other troubling thought patterns might include:

rumination, or looping thoughts

negative self-talk

cognitive biases, or errors in thinking that can affect your choices or interactions

a fixed pessimistic outlook

Identifying specific thoughts and patterns can help you make the most out of the other tips that follow.

Accept unwanted thoughts

It‚Äôs human nature to flinch away from pain, so of course you‚Äôd prefer to avoid thoughts that cause distress.

Yet pushing away unwanted thoughts isn‚Äôt the way to¬†gain control. That usually just makes them more intense.

Instead, try the opposite: Accept those thoughts, and let them in.

Say you feel a little low because nothing in your life seems to be happening the way you planned despite all your hard work.

Acceptance might involve telling yourself, ‚ÄúNothing seems to be going right, and that‚Äôs discouraging. There‚Äôs only so much you can do to create change yourself, but giving up entirely isn‚Äôt the answer either.‚Äù

Acceptance can even offer clues as to why specific thoughts keep coming up.

Maybe you keep thinking about a fling who¬†ghosted¬†you. Accepting those persistent thoughts leads you to recognize that you really wanted your connection to last.

Their disappearing act left you with unresolved questions and an overwhelming sense of unworthiness. You worry you‚Äôve failed at dating and feel anxious about trying again.

Acknowledging these fears allows you to confront them and remind yourself that you‚Äôre not to blame for their bad manners.

Keeping the situation in perspective can help you manage your worries about it happening again instead of letting fear hold you back from finding someone new.",Anxiety,Tips to gain better control of your mind.,2021-03-05 01:01:44

The next thing I realize, I'm playing through a run and doing way better than my average.

That ""most likely"" triggered... something. It was like I was stuck in a loop of thinking. ""I changed my grip for this mouse. But when did I change my grip? Why dont I remember?""

3654,adobemaster,1614859148,1,"Hi,

i will try to describe my situation with as little words as possible.

26 years old. It all started when i got a job in another country and had to move there. No friends there, everything is new and i lived alone in the apartment for about 10 months.

After i quit my job back then to move to the new one, i got a Atrial Fibrillation attack and that destroyed me mentally (i was a very active &amp; health person back then). Since my job in the new country asked to travel a lot with a car, that wasn't a problem until a Atrial Fibrillation attack happened again when i was stuck in a highway traffic jam. Seems like i developed a fear that when i am somewhere where i can't exit to safety or when i am far away from a ER (or any hospital), i get so much nervous because i think what if a AFIB attack happens again and i die? Luckily my cardiologist told me that there is a low risk for me to die since my heart is healthy and strong. I was given propafenone to use as ""pill in the pocket"" solution when the AFIB kicks in.

I went to almost every doctor to find out what was happening with me because that AFIB attack was new to me and some new disease came along (GERD, bowel inflammation...) that i haven't had before. They said i was almost perfect healthy and that i need to check with a psychiatrist. I was given alprazolam 0,25mg and that helps when the anxiety skyrockets because when i get in the situation that provokes my anxiety such as being in a place far away from safety or ER (highroad, plane or lets say woods), i could trigger a AFIB attack. 

I try to do the exposure therapy by facing my fears but it is not easy since the symptoms are so hard to manage (heart palpitations with potential AFIB depending how intense does the anxiety get, pins &amp; needles, chest and stomach tightness , feeling very lightheaded as i am gonna faint, face gets hot and feels like i am losing blood from my head, hands and legs).

What would you guys suggest? I hope i am not the only one.

But the thing is that sometimes it works, and sometimes is not, and when not I suffer mentally and physically and it affects my life completely. Can't focus properly have no mood to go somewhere besides my home and so on.

It only took the one for me, since I'm 21, don't smoke, no history, no problems exercising, everything came back great. I have also had very frequent checkups for other things lately and they've listened and everything still sounds OK. My blood pressure has never been bad, nothing. 

Recently, I started birth control, and I think the clotting risk (though it may only be for people with a history of clotting?) may have kicked it back up again. Also, I think reflux may have just caused a burn or something, because there's this pain at the center-left of my chest that gets worse when I breathe and just sits there. It's been there for a couple of days. 

Tonight was particularly bad because I woke up feeling weak and had waves of nausea. Cue mild shoulder, arm, and jaw pain (this has always happened; my body mimics symptoms of things when i know about them). Then, of course, I started feeling like I couldn't breathe. My panic attack calmed down pretty routinely, and I can breathe again, just not too deeply. Still, I can't shake the feeling that this chest pain/tightness that's still sitting there might be the one time I'm wrong. 

If anything, I'm just getting this out somewhere while I wait to feel OK enough to sleep. I want to put all this to rest, and maybe someone who has experienced this may have some tips for convincing themselves it's fine for long enough to avoid a trip to the ER.

3674,diagnosticshiftsres,1614850619,2,"Hi everyone! I am a researcher in the School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland, working in a team that are recruiting participants to hear their lived experiences of changes in their psychiatric diagnosis.

**Have you engaged with mental health services?**  
**Have you ever had a psychiatric diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis?**

**Consider participating in our research project!**

We are a team of researchers from University College Dublin conducting a project called Lived Experience of Diagnostic Shifts in Adult Mental Health. This study has received ethical approval from the UCD Research Ethics Committee.

For people experiencing mental health difficulties, it is fairly common that their diagnosis will change over the course of their engagement with mental health services. Diagnoses can be changed for many different reasons. Despite the frequency with which this happens, no research has explored how people experience these ‚Äòdiagnostic shifts‚Äô. Our study aims to identify how diagnostic shifts affect people‚Äôs lives and any challenges they may present. We want to use this information to improve support to mental health service-users during this time of transition.

For our study, we would like to interview people who have experienced a diagnostic shift. We would like people to tell us, in their own words, how they understood the reasons for the change in their diagnosis, and any positive or negative implications it had for their lives. Interviews will take place over videochat software (eg. Zoom) and all participation will be completely confidential.

By contributing to this study, you will help improve our understanding of people‚Äôs experience of diagnostic shifts and raise awareness of the challenges diagnostic changes can present. We hope to use the research to improve clinical communication of diagnostic changes and make it easier for people to adjust to these changes.

If you are aged over 18 and have previously experienced a change in their psychiatric diagnosis (i.e. had a diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis), we would like to invite you to take part in this study. To find out more about participating in the study, please email the researcher, Dr Cliodhna O‚ÄôConnor at the details below. She will explain the study to you and answer any questions you might have.

I deal with large amounts of anxiety now and depression to the point where I just want it all to stop. I don't want to kill myself nor hurt myself and I dont want to die. 

Basically I am suffering from thoughts of failing in college then being in a sea of debt. It has left me restless with imsomnia and made me worry or fail more. Im in a viscous cycle and I just want help. I also found myself in the wrong genre of music which also contributed to this. Slipknot, Korn, Five Finger Death Punch, Disturbed, etc. That was what I listened to until recently it was nothing but slipknot and korn. I also live in isolation in a apartment styled dorm and normally go outside 2 times a week. Im am introvert and shy around others. I also have bad social anxiety and I have hardly any trust in people I dont know. I feel as if someone is out there following me or stalking me. 

My friends have sent me to a hospital after my anxiety or panic attacks so I could seek help there. But hospitals have been known to put me under large amounts of stress or anxiety since I fear the worst. I didnt want to go but I thought I had no choice. When I was finally in they did the usual procedures up until they said they needed to do blood work on me. Now call me a wimp but I get weak and lots of more anxiety at the sight of any blood. (Hemophobia). I refused to let them do it to me and since I am old enough to make decisions. They couldnt do anything. But the thought of it as I type this out is making me squirmish. I have had it done before and I did get very close to passing out with my face flushed white as snow. I dont like the procedure nor the pain. 

Call me more of a wimp, I also cant swallow pills. I have taken pills before by either turning it into dust form and eating it in a sandwich (worst sandwich ever). Or by sucking on the gel pills and drinking the liquid with the help of water then spitting out the gel casing. I have tried to practice with ice or m&amp;ms but I just cant swallow it. I either gag or panic from the stress or anxiety it causes me. It also does not help that someone I knew passed away on accident not too long ago from taking anti-depressants and non-prescribed herbal medicine together. 

I want and need help, but because of the things mentioned above I feel as if I am barred or restricted from receiving professional help from a psychiatrist or whoever. I dont want anything medicinal, I just want a more natural cure. There has to be another way rather being prescribed happiness pills and relying on those. I just want someone to talk to that knows natural ways in which I can fix my mental health and not force me into a corner with no help unless I get blood drawn then get pills.

But basically I'd been anxious for days about travelling somewhere. It goes up and down and I was at a peak for a while and decided to let it out on Twitter a bit about how it sucks. I was asked to suck on an ice cube. I didn't want to do it. I usually just go through it and even if I did it it's just going to go down and come back later. I explained this and they asked me to just do it.

When I don't follow through the advice given I feel guilty like I'm choosing to suffer and I don't really want to heal or feel better. Accidentally telling people who don't understand It is also a pain. They just tell me ""see you're not going to do this. You're doing this, you're not going to be scared"" like it doesn't work like that. I also get sent random things they find online about anxiety, and I know it's done with good intentions but I'm not just anxiety? I appreciate it but like I don't know how to explain this. I will then have to accept it and do as told or I'm lying.

I was assigning myself a task to go to the store and buy something once for my social anxiety as someone had suggested. I told this to someone to make sure I follow through and don't back out. They told me ""go every day. Just do it. I know someone who was scared like this and he did this and it helped.""

Being told I‚Äôm only in this situation because I‚Äôm not trying hard enough to get better is the biggest slap in the face. I just wish I had someone who understood that I‚Äôm doing all I can do right now. 

- 

Sorry for such a long post. I don‚Äôt know what else to do right now and am hoping someone who‚Äôs gone through something similar can offer support or advice on how to not give up. 

-

Last October I finally made the decision to seek professional help for my mental health struggles because I was in a pretty dark place and finally worked up the courage to see a therapist. I wanted so badly to just feel better. My grades were the worst they‚Äôd ever been (I‚Äôm a junior in college), and all the things that I‚Äôve been ignoring and suppressing my whole life were finally catching up to me and I felt like I was drowning. 

In December, my therapist suggested I get screened for ADHD due to some symptoms he thought could be related. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and got officially diagnosed with ADHD - combined type, anxiety, and depression. I started stimulant medication for ADHD which my psychiatrist told me could make my anxiety worse at first. 

A month after starting my medication my psych prescribed me an antidepressant to help tackle to anxiety and depression as well. I was on Prozac for 3 weeks and felt like I was literally going insane. I have never experienced anxiety that bad in my entire life. I started having anxiety attacks multiple times a day, my intrusive thoughts became so overwhelming I could hardly hold a conversation, and I experienced physical symptoms that included headaches that never went away, jaw clenching and teeth grinding, sweating, and swallowing become really difficult because I had a constant lump in my throat.

My psychiatrist took me off Prozac a week ago and told me to start Zoloft today. I can barely function and feel worse than I ever have before and am terrified to start Zoloft because I don‚Äôt want it to effect me like Prozac did (and still is). 

Today I met with the same therapist I first started seeing for the first time in 3 weeks and was hoping I‚Äôd feel at least a little relief by talking through it to someone who could offer support and advice. I have developed a really good rapport with him and he‚Äôs been pretty helpful thus far, but today‚Äôs session was awful. 

The session started normally and was fine for the first 10-15 minutes, and then he said some things that really hurt me and made me lose hope that I‚Äôll ever get better. He basically insinuated that the only reason I‚Äôm not making progress or feeling better is because I‚Äôm not trying to get better. That I can‚Äôt keep making myself the victim and doing nothing to help myself and expect to ever get better. 

The whole session made me feel so hurt, hopeless, and frustrated. I am trying to hard just to hold on and not let myself drown in the shit show that is my brain, as much as it may look to him like I‚Äôm not. I am constantly overwhelmed and doing my absolute best to not give up, but hearing someone I have confided in and felt comfortable with say these things to me has destroyed me. 

I feel like no one can see that I‚Äôm doing everything I can to hold on. I‚Äôm not making any obvious progress because all of my effort and energy is going towards simply surviving. If even my therapist thinks all my problems are my own doing, I can‚Äôt imagine what everyone else in my life thinks. I am so scared and running out of energy to keep myself afloat. 

I don‚Äôt even know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. If anyone is feeling the same way, you are not alone. If anyone‚Äôs gone through something similar, how were you able to save yourself?

I was already anxious about this quiz, and I logged in a few minutes early to the class, where there were a few classmates there but no professor. Once the professor and everyone else joined, she started talking to us about the quiz, and told us to turn our microphones on, which mine was.

I'm 27 years old. I live at home with my parents. I made bad financial decisions when I was younger, before I understood any semblance of math behind it. Incurred quite a bit of debt. Just a little background, where I'm at.

Well, today I quit my job of about two years. I've worked alot of different jobs, this one I would say was the best job I've had. I learned alot, I was making about 33k a year and I was really good at what I do. Thing is, job is high stress, dispatching at a plumbing company inside the call center. I hated call center work in the past, but as a dispatcher I thought I had broken out of that phase since I was really just talking to the technicians mostly. Then I realized I was still working as a call center rep, just talking to my coworkers and not the customers as often. I had alot of duties, because I was reliable. But it was just growing depressing and tiring, 4 aclock hits the corner I get 80 people calling me asking all types of questions. My boss, my foreman, the techs, etc. Anxiety.

Bad sleep pattern, couldn't eat due to stress I've become a twig, no fitness. No cardio. No social life. All of this due to the long hours, and the exhaustion. The dread. Today I quit, I emailed my boss and said I resign and I can turn my work phone in tomorrow. And I clocked out. 

Now I'm just feeling like a bad person, leaving them high and dry like that. I've done alot to get us where we were, but I put us in a bad spot with no notice to end my story there. I oubviously feel guilty. I just want to rely on my savings for a month or two and devote all my time to bettering the essential habits I had long neglected. The fitness and everything I mentioned. I'm prescribed xanax and I want to figure out how to get off it. All the vices that got me by in a high stress environment, I just want time and space to seperate myself with these crutches. And improve my well being.

I quit vaping almost a month ago due to health anxieties making me afraid if what it could possibly be doing to my body. The first week, I had such bad panic attacks that I was convinced I was having a heart attack and was about to die. My pulse was over 100 even while i had been resting, and I was constantly taking my blood pressure which kept rising and rising.

I went to the ER, everything looked completely fine and my heart rate went down to a 75-80 as I sat in the hospital bed. I knew that it was anxiety at that point and I was fine for the rest of the night. Come the next day, a new bodily sensation sent me into another spiral. I then went to my gp again where she and my nurse practitioner both said I was completely fine and everything looked normal and that I‚Äôm most likely harboring guilt about my vaping habit (which I kept hidden from my parents until the day I quit).

I‚Äôm seeing a therapist now, but it‚Äôs getting to be too expensive because of an accident that happened to my family about 2 weeks ago, so I‚Äôm currently trying to scramble to figure out how I‚Äôm going to keep going to therapy. 

I‚Äôve talked to my mom multiple times about my triggers, how my thought process goes, etc. and she said she understood... yet she keeps doing and saying all of the things I asked her not to, but adds a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to trigger you or whatever, but..‚Äù as if that makes it alright. 

She keeps saying stuff like she can‚Äôt wait until I feel better because it‚Äôs getting annoying having to deal with me like this. Or she‚Äôll snap at me when I start panicking and tell me that my panicking is gonna send me into an early grave... which is again not something I wanna hear when I‚Äôm having health anxiety (as well as something my therapist very clearly pointed out as a false statement anyway).

I started having really sharp chest pains after basically being in a constant state of panic (with varying degrees of severity) since i quit smoking, and I started getting really scared about it all and spiraling. I kept it in as much as I could and tried to deal with it before going to my mom, but I couldn‚Äôt handle it on my own anymore so I went to her. 

She‚Äôs always invalidated my feelings whenever I would talk to her growing up, so repressing is something I‚Äôve done since I can remember and also why I started vaping anyway.

3718,slothsandllamas,1614832009,7,"As a child, I've always felt anxious and a sense of dread going home after leaving a friend's house or somewhere fun. (For context, my friends were always way more well off than us.) Originally thought it was because I hated the shitty apartment we lived in (and was really embarrassed by it.) And I assumed this feeling would go away when I was no longer poor. But for some reason, the same feelings still come up, sometimes with no trigger. I feel intense anxiety and dread about driving home or even being home, even though this is the most comfortable home I've ever lived in. I end up driving to pass the time or going on a walk to avoid going home until it fades. I live here with my husband and our dog and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the house. We've made so many happy memories here so I'm really confused. It doesn't make any sense. If anything, this would be a dream come true for my inner child (no cockroaches, mold and it's an actual house?!)

I‚Äôm new to this sub and new to everything that‚Äôs going on with me. At this time I still don‚Äôt have any answers, but I‚Äôm almost certain I‚Äôm dealing with high anxiety. 

This past November I took a trip to Colorado and on the second night there is where this all begins. I laid down to go to bed and all hell seemed to break loose in my mind. The room started to spin and I felt extremely confused. After finally finding my way out of the dark room I noticed that my heart was beating crazy fast +200bpm according to my Apple watch and I could barely breath. My throat was closing and my extremities, including my head were tingling and going numb. 

I was 100% certain that I was having a heart attack and was dying. When EMS arrived I remember that they gave me Ativan to calm me and that was all I remember from that night. The next day the nurse at UC Health told me when I got there they could see my heart beating through my clothing and that I was near heart failure. My Troponin levels were elevated during my first blood test but not during the 2nd and 3rd so this could have been a false positive. All X-rays, EKGs, and CTs were good and I was released to go home the next day. 

However, this was only the beginning as I‚Äôve been struggling with this ever since. I ended up back in the ER a week later with the same exact scenario, just not on the same extreme level as the week prior in Colorado. 

Fast forward to today and my heart doctor found nothing during the echo test and doesn‚Äôt seem to think anything is wrong with me. 

I‚Äôm having a very difficult time believing this and honestly feel like I‚Äôm dying. It‚Äôs getting harder to fall asleep at night as I feel like I‚Äôm struggling to get enough air when I breathe, my vision is constantly blurry and leads to dizziness. I‚Äôm having trouble just basically functioning right now. It‚Äôs hard for me to talk about things because it can easily throw me into what I‚Äôm assuming are panic attacks so I don‚Äôt talk about it often but it‚Äôs getting to the point to where I can‚Äôt even get out of my bed and there‚Äôs no way I can continue down this path. 

I‚Äôm two weeks away from my first therapist meeting. I‚Äôm hopeful that this can be beaten as this is terrifying and it‚Äôs completely overtaken who I am. 

Any input is appreciated. Also, feel free to ask me questions if I wasn‚Äôt clear enough on certain aspects as I‚Äôll gladly answer. 

Thanks!

Since before COVID-19 our family goal was to support and get my husband to be a full time manager of his restaurant. That was his goal for him and his family. He worked a lot of hours, and up until covid, we were in our normal routine. I had my son then back around the month before we all shut down. When we did we got stuck, we got discouraged. We were depressed and hopeless that our life really was a mess and now unknown. That was a pretty scary time.

All mobile all non tender etc. docs felt them and ran bloods; they ruled out EB viruses including mono, they ruled out HIV, thyroid normal along with other basic stuff. The only oddities were mildly low WBC which I continue to have to this day (like just under normal) mildly low MPV and very weak positive ANA (such a low titer they didn‚Äôt even read it according to the report) The did an ultrasound of the neck which said ‚Äòlymph nodes on the L side of neck are noticeably more prominent than the right however not large enough to qualify for biopsy‚Äô so basically saying they agree they are enlarged but not quite enough to investigate further. 

Largest node was 2.4 cm X 0.8 cm I have over 7 that are longer than 1cm. I though anything longer than 1cm was abnormal??

Anyway I‚Äôm just confused, why would nodes get stuck? Doc said sometimes they just don‚Äôt go down, I‚Äôve heard a couple people mention they have one or two that they can still feel but to have 14 all on one side of my neck?? Isn‚Äôt this concerning?

I was a full time stay at home mom to my kiddo, we moved 12 hours away from all our friends and family in the middle of a pandemic, and I got bored. So I got a job nannying. I watch 2 kids and bring my daughter along, their mom is WFH. A few months later, we bought a house and my commute turned into an hour each way. With a toddler. Oh, and now I‚Äôm 4 months pregnant. 

To put in perspective how bad my anxiety is, I have been driving 2 hours a day with my 18 month old while I throw up and sacrifice nap time to take care of someone else‚Äôs kids and house for 8 hours, 5 days a week. I‚Äôve been wanting to quit for 3 months, and apparently would rather do this EVERY DAY than have the conversation about quitting. 

On Monday I decided I was going to do it. I have a pelvic condition that flared up over the weekend and I was going to use that as the entry point. Their mom asked how I was doing, I started telling her how much pain I was in all weekend, and was going to let her know that she might want to start looking into childcare options. But i completely panicked and didn‚Äôt do it. 

All my friends have told me ‚Äújust quit! Just tell her you‚Äôre done! Give her a date!‚Äù And I know. I know that‚Äôs the answer. I know I need to *just* do it. I just cannot get past this anxiety. Because I see her throughout the day everyday, I would feel weird writing her a letter. And because the kids are usually around, times we can chat uninterrupted are unpredictable.

My friends always invite each other at their house and they never invite me. Even when they hang out after school, they don't invite me either. At first, I tought it was because i was new to their friend group which is reasonable enough. But another guy became our friends and just after 2 weeks of even knowing he existed, they started inviting him.

For example, I feel absolute peace and happiness when I sit alone on the side of a bustling street in the city, drinking some tea, watching people rush by unaware of my existence. Each person has their own life, each sound of a train or distant horn reminds me of things that exist outside of my awareness, every light in a building  shows me that there are entire worlds within rooms that do not need me to exist. 

It feels like I am watching an entire universe play out before me, like a third person view, like I'm not really important in the grand scheme of it all. And it makes me feel so unbelievably at peace with the universe and myself and all of my anxieties seem to not be important anymore. 

However, since I have been at my parent's suburban house since quarantine began, I've felt nothing but overwhelmed. Here, I dont have bustling streets full of people or trains or horns to remind me of that insignificance. Here, all I have is my immediate family, my quiet woodsy town and myself.

It's like I'm constantly in a world where only me and my family have significance. I'm stuck with my own thoughts and nothing to take me out of them and remind me ""nothing you're anxious about actually matters in the grand scheme of things"".

I've been having a lot of symptoms lately that might suggest that I'm too stressed. Sometimes my left arm feels a little lighter, every 2 days my forehead tends to have muscle tension making it feel tight. 

At first, i had the cold in mid January. I thought ibwas just sick and now I'm better but i still keep getting muscle tensions even when i do the massages still come back.

The thing is now I'm tired, my body is tired, my face is tired yet i still can't sleep. Long ago it was because i couldn't make myself tired to fall asleep but now that I'm tired and i still can't fall asleep.

I do have a racing mind so sometimes i do tend to stay up think about things when trying to sleep but as im typing at 5 in the morning, i had a thought or 2 but that's it i wasn't having a racing mind like usual.

I don't get it, i meditate i took a break but I'm back on it. I exercise tryna build muscle mass. I take break from screens to the best of my ability. But i still cant have a good sleep. I've always had sleep problems my whole life, it was very hard for me to fall asleep and then stay asleep but i still had some good sleep. Now it's juat all over the place, sometimes i think that maybe i did fall asleep and jyst didn't remember cuz i feel tired and yet I'm tossing and turning but idk. It feels like my mind is never shut off and i can't just calmly lay down and sleep.

I was probably like 8 years old and I remember saying out loud ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre all going to die‚Äù. So yeah, I‚Äôve had a problem for a while now (almost 30 years old). I‚Äôve talked to a therapist once or twice but never committed really as most of my bouts of anxiety last a week or two and then die off.

My wife is pregnant, and I haven‚Äôt slept in a week. I keep thinking about worst case scenarios and my breathing speeds up and suddenly I‚Äôm picturing terrible things happening. I can‚Äôt even type them out because as scary as they are they‚Äôre also pretty unlikely and as far as everyone else is concerned not worth worrying about. Anyways, if I continue like this until my kid arrives I might not have any hair left and I‚Äôll look more like a grandpa than a dad. I can‚Äôt see the obsessive thoughts and anxiety tapering off with this one like they usually do until at least after my wife gives birth and thats months from now (she‚Äôs due in October).

I really need these thoughts to stop ASAP as I‚Äôm driving my wife nuts and that‚Äôs probably doing more harm than anything else.

I'm basically just looking for something like, ""Yeah that sounds like it,"" or ""Probably not but it might be this other thing,"" since I'm not familiar.

Alright, so I'm a niche freelance writer as a profession. I've been doing this for more than a decade, and I'm well-known and sought out in my particular industry, which is cool except for the part that I feel like my body is about to explode or something every time I write for work.

I'll try to summarize the situation the best I can:

* I feel like my head starts racing or something when I even think about sitting down to do some work. It's like a physical sensation almost like there are a bunch of little things in my head, arms and chest that are pulsing with energy. It's not a comfortable feeling.
* My breathing feels like it changes almost like it's harder to take a breath. My heart-rate also increases; I've measured several times doing sort-of science on myself with it.
* It's doesn't happen when I write for any other purpose, even in the same environment with the same programs on-screen.
* I'm not sure that I've felt this feeling with anything else before, but I've felt this or similar since I started doing this for work something like 12 years ago.
* After about 2-3 minutes of starting, I can definitely feel a major difference in myself that's pushing me to stop and just lay my head down or something to try to chill out and get some relief. If I try to ""power through"" and just keep pushing, it ramps up until a certain point. Sometimes I get to the point that it's difficult to form the sentences that I'm trying to write if it's particularly bad that day.

Anyway, this sucks, and I didn't ever really consider that it could be anxiety until a friend mentioned it, so I thought I'd ask people who would know if this sounded like it might be anxiety of some sort.

She swore up and down that she has not been talking to him, and that she had not done so since we got back together. I just don't understand why I feel the way that I do.

I hope it can help someone else. \[I'm posting under a pseudo username because of how personal this is to me. I also removed names and work places\]

Please don‚Äôt apologize for getting mad, I just feel so bad that you‚Äôre feeling this way. It breaks my heart seeing you sad. Don‚Äôt ignore it and hope it goes away, really seek help. I know that mental health awareness by and treatment is so stigmatized, but I promise it will help and make life so much better. You don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúemo‚Äù to have a problem that‚Äôs in your head that you can‚Äôt handle alone. Trust me I know personally about facing some mental demons. 

I guess I never really told y'all about how my anxiety affected me. I don‚Äôt know if you are feeling any way similar and can maybe relate and not feel like you‚Äôre the only one who feels like this or has a overthinking problem (cause I definitely did, which I think is why i never brought it up) or if this little story will encourage you to maybe seek some help and see my example of how great things can be with a little help because I also have felt a little low before. 

So I guess as a kid, not too much anxiety. I think the first attack I remember is doing homework on that tan booth thing in the old house lol. Probably about 7 or 8. I was supposed to be reading in my head from a social studies textbook and it was some passage about a ancient religion and how they believed when you die you just go away and it‚Äôs like going to sleep. Well, I starting overthinking that. The idea of not existing and not even knowing it. The idea of how inevitable it is and how I can‚Äôt control it no matter what I do. That used to freak me out so bad a lot. But I specifically remember that first time. I started sweating and felt flush and heart was pounding. It felt like a shockwave went through me and I the worst part was feeling like I couldn‚Äôt control it, which only made it worse. I remember running to y‚Äôall and just crying about something. I think I said my stomach hurt or something lol. It eventually passed and I just tried to not think about that. Those didn‚Äôt last long and becoming more religious as I got older has helped dwelling on death. But that‚Äôs what I think was my first experience with it. 

I can only recount a few more times before like 13. One was getting older and having to move out of the house and ending high school because I was so happy üòÇ That honestly brought on an attack, being so happy and not wanting anything to change and not being able to stop change. Another funny one is when i was having stomach pain and we went to hospital and they wanted to do surgery lol. I didn‚Äôt want to do it and said I felt better not because I cared about getting cut on or the surgery. I was mostly scared about being put to sleep and not having control on falling asleep. I guess everything up to about 15 wasn‚Äôt really a ‚Äúpanic attack‚Äù more like 30 second bout of panic. And these weren‚Äôt often at all. I would say to this point, maybe 80 total events. So it was deal with it when it happens. 

I guess around 15-16 they got worse and became real panic attacks. These are what freaked me out and eventually almost destroyed me, slowly and over years of course. So here‚Äôs how I would explain what happens: first I would feel spacey and for some weird reason like I‚Äôm not able to focus. Next my face would start to tingle in one of my cheeks super lightly at first and then move to the next one. All of this is happening as I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm dying. If it is a really bad one the tingling moves down my face to my jaw and neck and chest. It‚Äôs like a pin and needle crawling feeling like my face was falling asleep. The worst one I ever had it moved to my arms and hands and I couldn‚Äôt speak. Spoiler: This sounds super horrible and intense but I later learned that this is because I was basically hyperventilating and more focused on the side effects of that instead of breathing correctly to fix it. All while worrying that I‚Äôm dying and crushing impending doom lol. Definitely not fun. So those are the times where I‚Äôve been freaked out and called y‚Äôall on the side of the road or that time on the way to the beach when y‚Äôall had to come get me an hour away because I freaked out. So these happened randomly and that was the most irritating part. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why it was happening. To make them go away i would have to just lay down and focus on breathing for like an hour. So that‚Äôs when I decided to bring it up to dr --- because 1) I thought I was dying or something because I didn‚Äôt know I was hyperventilating and 2) the frequency increased and I couldn‚Äôt stop it when it happened and it would basically randomly ruin a day. 

So I tried to explain it to him and he immediately diagnosed it as anxiety and assumed it was because I was stressed as a sophomore in college. That‚Äôs when he prescribed me Zoloft. It did lower the frequency slightly but the side effects were horrible. I was always sleepy, I went from 160lbs to 200lbs in less than a year, my normal ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù was gone. It dulled the lows but also dulls the highs. A little numb feeling. It also had some ‚Äúother‚Äù side effects (performance sexually, which basically ruined my last relationship). So after a year of that I told dr --- I can‚Äôt do it and I‚Äôd rather just deal with the attacks. 

So this is around 2014. I‚Äôm not on anything and the attacks still suck but I unfortunately found something that also makes them stop: alcohol. I guess it just calmed me down and relaxed me and I kinda went on a bad phase then where I was drinking almost every day just to avoid having an attack. This lasted like 8 months and \[ex girlfriend\] was mad at me, I got that drinking ticket, I was fat and I was unhappy. I had to make some change. So I went back to dr --- and didn‚Äôt tell him any details other than just asking ‚Äúis there anything I can take for when the attacks happen instead of daily because the SSRI made me sad and fat‚Äù. He gave me the Xanax and said use very rarely. I guess I was alternating school with alcohol and Xanax and I ended up ruining my relationship with \[ex girlfriend\], getting a ticket, failing some classes, and ending \[undergrad\] with a crap GPA. Still graduated but I wish I was in my current state then. I would‚Äôve soared. 

I ended up moving in with -- and -- and working full time, drinking every day after work, repeat. I would carry an emergency Xanax in my pocket with me at work everyday in case I had an attack so I could finish the workday, but I‚Äôd just end up passing out as soon as I got off until the next day. I was unhappy with my routine, I wasn‚Äôt dating anyone. It turned into a bad depression, I lost my job at \[former job\]. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything but sleep the entire day to treat the hangover from the night prior or make plans of what to do that night. I felt like I was losing me a little bit and only happy or ‚Äúmyself‚Äù when the anxiety was treated with alcohol. It was a unhealthy and toxic way to try and treat the anxiety and still be happy without having to take a pill that made me feel a little numb. But in turn gave me social anxiety and just made me really not like myself. (Side note: I have NEVER done any other drugs other than weed and I have NEVER had or will drive after drinking. Also I don‚Äôt think there was an alcohol problem, I think it was just the only think I found that was easily accessible and didn‚Äôt make me not feel like myself. If anything I was more social, in turn this made me feel ‚Äúweird‚Äù sober and almost unable to properly socialize without overthinking the most basic situations. 

I guess I was forgetting who I was sober. So I hit a realization point that I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I didn‚Äôt want to keep doing that and I honestly went to a very dark place that I never wanted to see. I felt like a failure and blamed myself for not being able to just ‚Äúfix it‚Äù on my own. Why couldn‚Äôt I ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù this?, I would ask myself. I‚Äôve never been depressed in my life but something as seemingly simple as over worrying has put me in a situation where in the first time of my life I was disappointed in myself. 

I was super embarrassed at first when I even brought up my anxiety again to dr ---. I only said that ‚Äúmy anxiety has gotten worse, i think i want to try something daily again but not Zoloft or anything similar‚Äù. So he gave me the lowest dose of Lexapro in mid 2018 and I‚Äôve been on the same thing since \[only increased dosage from 5mg to 10mg\]. I honestly didn‚Äôt think it would work but i was willing to try. I chilled out on drinking and did the full 4 weeks that they tell you to try to before it works (and the side effects suck for the first week) but since starting the Lexapro, it‚Äôs so much better. 

Slowly but surely I didn‚Äôt want to drink as much, I didn‚Äôt feel unhappy or stuck in life, I felt driven again. I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it if I told myself that 5 years ago that I wouldn‚Äôt have daily panic attacks or be scared to go anywhere without an emergency Xanax in my pocket, just in case one crept up. I would literally bring on panic attacks by worrying about and being scared that i would have a panic attack. I don‚Äôt even think about having an attack anymore \[ofen\]. The Lexapro doesn‚Äôt make me feel numb or spacey, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel tired, and it gives me the time to think situations through before obsessing and panicking. I still feel all emotions and feel like my old self. I still have about 2-4 attacks a month but I‚Äôm able to think my way out of it now and I have still have a few Xanax just in case but normally i can fix it without. The social anxiety went away, I got that administrative job at \[current workplace\], I was confident enough to meet and start dating \[current girlfriend that I met at my current job while I was sober\], I was able to get my own apartment with my own money and I retook the mcat. And now I may get a med school interview. Bad situations like the one with Mawmaw \[died in a house fire in June from smoke inhalation, 90 year old grandmother\] still make me sad but I‚Äôm confident now that I‚Äôm able to handle sadness in a healthy way without going to the worst case scenario or doing something drastic out of pent up emotions that I wasn‚Äôt able to control before. 

I‚Äôve never told anyone any of this but the reason I am is that: it has to be treated. If not, it will overflow and be way worse than the initial problem. Also because everyone has issues. Mental, physical, emotional, regardless. No one is perfect and it‚Äôs not a sign of weakness or something you should be embarrassed about when asking for help. I am so happy with my life right now and I‚Äôm living in the moment and really enjoying it instead of worrying about things I can‚Äôt change or obsessing about the future. I still am driven to succeed and actually feel like I can now. Also lost 30lbs lol but I think that was just because I‚Äôm so much happier. I‚Äôm also able to have a drink like a normal person without trying to use it to hide my anxiety. I wish I could go back in time and shove that pill in me 5 years ago and I think I would‚Äôve done better in college, but I can‚Äôt change that now. But what I‚Äôm saying is that life is way too short to waste feeling bad when the answer could be so easy and so worth it. 

Honestly from what you've told me so far, yours sounds like you‚Äôre going through a lot and are experiencing depression right now and it might not be a real issue for you. It might just be that you need something for the short term until things calm down, but you should speak with a professional because I can't diagnose you. But whatever you need, I‚Äôm here for you always for anything anytime! I‚Äôm always down to talk or listen or share my thoughts or take advice or even plan a trip for ya to disappear for a few days if you need an escape lol. I love ya so much and we‚Äôre gonna figure this out and it‚Äôs all gonna be okay, I promise. You‚Äôre way to important to all of us and way too special to the world to ever feel like anything different than.

Sometimes it‚Äôs like my swallowing muscles don‚Äôt engage, like I ‚Äòforget‚Äô how to swallow?

Occasionally (typically with liquid but a few times with solid foods) when I go to swallow my muscles just don‚Äôt engage, it‚Äôs like the liquid or food gets shoved to the back of my throat and then normally gets forced down but those muscles to force it down just don‚Äôt engage and I‚Äôm sitting there like an idiot for a few seconds until I finally restart the whole process and it works. Like I said typically with liquids, occasionally with food. Very rarely does it happen more than once in a row and never has it ever stopped me from swallowing for any time at all. It always just goes away but it‚Äôs an unsettling sensation. 

Online it says nothing but neurological disorders, however given how this is rare (maybe once or twice a month) and minor I doubt that‚Äôs the case. Also I‚Äôve noticed once I actually start thinking about it that it happens much more frequently! So it really seems someone conscious related when I think too much about swallowing. 

Anyway given it seems to be something that happens more when I think about it and otherwise never causes a major issue I assume it‚Äôs anxiety based, has anyone else ever noticed this too?",Anxiety,Anyone else ever ‚Äòforget‚Äô how to swallow then panic?,2021-03-04 08:12:24

3829,priceforsun,1614803850,1,"Alright I dont know where to start,

about 4 months ago I started waking up with racing heart. I didnt mind it at the time but one day it was accompanied with a slight grainy-like vision (prolly cuz of adrealine) and jittering. I thought I was having somekind of a heart problem. I went to the hospital and they checked my heart and they said its healthy and normal. I went home reliefed but the symptoms didnt stop. I had chest tightness and heart palpitations the whole time.

 I went to my doctor the next and he said that I prolly just have mild panic attacks and to not worry about it that much. I tried to ignore the physical sensations but they kept coming and it felt extremely real. 

One day I had a pretty bad panic attack, I started feeling chest pain so I went outside for a walk to relieve it, suddenly my heart started pounding and I felt so much adrealine. I didnt know what to do, I kept moving forward, the pounding finnaly stopped even tho my heart was still beating fast, one minute before I was sure I was going to die or something so I bursted into tears, a grown ass man alone in the woods crying. After that I started doing hard physical exercises to tire myself for the night and I started to listen to a lot of music to chill. It got a lot better when I started to understand that its all just anxiety. 

Sadly its not over yet. I still get a lot physcial symptoms like palpitations and random short chest sensations (kinda like a mild pain) which can make me panic a little but they only happen at night, before I go to sleep. I noticed when Im in a group with other people that I don't even feel any anxiety, It mostly happens when im alone left with my own thoughts. I think thats why its the worst at night, also I think the night alone with darkness and silence can trigger a lot of anxiety for me because I cant distract myself with anything. Sadly I cant go to a therapist cuz my doctor doesnt think its anything serious. I could go to a non-state therapist, but that would cost me a lot of money. I cant say my life is rly on the bright side right now, thats why the anxiety started probably (or I had it my whole life and I didnt noticed it until I got the physical symptoms). I think I need some break from work and focus on my hobbies and see my friends more. I think music and sports are also great helpers.

 I would rly appreciate some more advices from you experienced guys and gals out there, I gotta say understanding can be rly helpful sometimes:==)

&amp;#x200B;

Btw I gotta add, I never hyperventilated or passed out from anxiety, my heart can go up to 100 when im anxious, but the only thing that I suffer from are those strong heart beats and short lasting chest pain (this one makes me so nervous, I hope someone can relate)

About 3 years ago, my doctor referred me to the Heart and Lung clinic because I had trouble breathing. I went, they recognized I had heart palpitations, but simply told me to cut down my coffee intake (after stating I drank one cup a day). He also told me it was ""probably just stress"" and that I was ""too young to be there"" (I was 24).   
I have definitely undermined that this is a disorder I have, but since going to the doctor, I felt like I truly don't have anxiety and that maybe I'm just too sensitive.  
Do you have any recommendations of what I should do? I would like to try to get meds for it. I Just don't know how to go about it. I live in Edmonton, AB, Canada. How did you guys go about it? Talking to your family doctor? I apologize if I sound extremely ignorant, I just don't know if my family doctor will take me seriously since the clinic he referred me to believes it was simply caffeine-induced anxiety.  
Otherwise, what do you guys do on days when it's just too much. No triggers, but you know an attack is well on its way but you don't have anything (meds) for it? What do you guys do to subdue the anxiety, even just a little bit?

Now I've called my doctor and she is going to refer me to a psychiatrist, but that might take a while so she wants me to come in so she can get me started on some medication. I have been going through a divorce and have been struggling financially because of it. My spouse has the income. I have a job but it is much less than he is able to make because I was a homemaker during our marriage and have no experience or training for a better job. 

Anyway, because I haven't had a good enough job to be able to pay any pet rentals and fees, I had to let him keep our dog for now but not having her has made all of this so much worse. I have a little better of a job now than I did at first so I could feed her and take care of her now but I live in a place that doesn't allow dogs and moving to a place where I could have a dog and then paying all the related costs to have her there would still be too much for me to manage. 

I don't know if he would let me have her, I would probably have to fight him for her but I really feel that I need her. We did everything together before my marriage ended and I talked to her all the time. I didn't realize how significantly she improved my mental health until I didn't have her anymore.

I‚Äôve had this problem lately, where when I go on webcam and I get paranoid that people are making faces and judging how my face looks.

For example the other day I lost my job and before I found out about the bad news I had to have a meeting with my manager and HR and a co worker who was a witness. They had to ask me some questions before making up their mind if they would sack me or issue a warning.

My supervisor isn‚Äôt handsome or anything and he has never seen me on cam as I don‚Äôt feel comfortable and also my other co workers don‚Äôt either. I had to have my cam on because it was a serious meeting. My co worker turned hers on as well and when I saw her she was kind of giving looks to the screen and then my manager I couldn‚Äôt really tell because I‚Äôm shy and I didn‚Äôt want to see his reaction. He looked disappointed and a little angry. 

I looked so pale and not the best and it was their first time seeing me. I was more worried about what they thought of my looks than when they told me I was fired. I don‚Äôt know how to get this memory out of my head. I now keep thinking if I met these people in real life do think I look different to what they thought I would look.

Then I‚Äôm thinking imagine if they saw me without make up would they think I look ugly etc. 

I‚Äôm kind of glad in a way I don‚Äôt have to see these people again but then I‚Äôm worried that what if I have another meeting or interview and I have to face people again.",Anxiety,Paranoid that people don‚Äôt like how my face looks,2021-03-04 03:54:06
3873,afallenflower,1614790263,1,"When I was in middle school, my anxiety was at it's peak. I have a mixture of social/performance anxiety. I liked school itself, but was so insecure that being in a school of people who I felt were constantly judging me was my worst nightmare. I could not say even a single word in front of the class without nearly passing out. I'd get lightheaded and start hyperventilating at the thought of it. There was nothing worse than this feeling that I couldn't even describe. I would do anything to avoid it. I could not do a presentation or anything where people had to even look at me.

Of course I knew something was wrong with me, but I didn't quite understand what ""anxiety"" was. I only could describe it as general fear when truly it was not just fear but absolute panic and dread. I was too young to get the point across to my teachers and parents. Only one social worker at school thought that I may have anxiety but my parents denied to get me help as they didn't believe in any mental health disorders. Most people thought I was just being a shitty kid that didn't want to go to school.
Because nobody would listen to me I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands.

If I knew I had to present something to the class, or even say a single WORD in front of the class, I'd skip school. My parents were sick of fighting with me to go so they gave up. I could not even imagine the thought of doing anything in front of the class; I'd literally pass out. I missed so much school that a social worker and the principal came to my house to tell me I was about to become truant and need to go to court if I didn't go.

So now I had to go to school. Great. But how was I going to avoid having a panic attack? My parents were actually forcing me to go at this point. I knew I couldn't go, as I would have to swim in front of the class my first period of the day.

So I did what any normal kid with horrific anxiety would do: run away from home and hide in the woods until school was over. I eventually got cold and sat in a nearby Burger King, when I turn around and see my mom and aunt walk in. 

The whole neighborhood and the police were looking for me at this point. Well, shit. Now my parents were onto me so I HAD to go to school, right?

Now I went TO school, but didn't go INTO the school. I figured I'd be fine if I skipped my first period gym class; the rest of the day would be okay. I went BEHIND the school and literally hid in a bush until my first period was over. Then I went into school, signed myself in late, and all was good. But nope. They were onto me. My parents were notified I was late, and now they had to drop me off everyday to be sure I signed into class first thing in the morning.

I started hiding in every place in the school I could think of: bathrooms, lockers, the showers by the gym, literally anywhere. This all came crashing down when I was found by a teacher. 

That same week I was notified that I was officially truant and had to go to court. I missed well over 100 days of school that year; not counting the days I was late. My court date rolls around and I'm sitting outside the courtroom with my family. Unfortunately they decided to take everyone with last names starting from Z through to A. My last name starts with A, so I was literally the last to be called into the courtroom.

I actually watched kids come out of the courtroom and be taken away from their families by the police. A lot of kids who were truant had to be put into foster care. This was terrifying. My parents were so nervous.

I walk in, and the judge was super nice and said my case was minor. I had to do 3 weeks of community service at a local library.

After this, I was put on an education plan at my school and put into smaller classes. That finally helped, but my anxiety never truly got better until I finally went to get medication as an adult. Things are great now and I'm a Computer Science major.

When I think about what happened to me now, I'm pretty pissed off. Nowadays I feel like it would've been obvious I had anxiety and I would've gotten help instead of being treated like a shitty kid that just didn't want to go to school.

Any of you have a similar story?

3874,whitesummons,1614790103,1,"Have you ever experienced the sensation of going on autopilot before doing something big. For example, just before an important presentation or maybe a speech at a wedding where you feel super nervous, tingly and as if you could pass out. Then you go on auto pilot and you somehow get through it until you begin to settle in and slowly come back to yourself. But before you do it seems your perception of reality is totally different due to the auto pilot aspect of the nerves.  

If you know can resonate with what I‚Äôve described then you know feeling I‚Äôm talking about and may be able to help me.

About a month and a half ago I ate these weed edibles and got that feeling of nearly passing out and being on autopilot but 1,000 times worse and it was coming in waves. At the base level it felt as if I was going in and out of being on autopilot really fast and the more severe waves I felt so anxious and scared that I was actually losing my mind and could not walk or talk straight and felt detached from reality. I had major panic attacks and believed  I was was losing my mind for good and was having the most horrible intrusive thoughts of everyone I know saying stuff like ‚Äòit was only a matter of time before he lost his mind‚Äô and it was harrowing. I went to bed and woke up feeling so much better.
Over the next week I began to feel better while experiencing these symptoms much less severely. Through healthy eating and exercise I got back to normal. 

Today I was walking to work and I was transported straight back into that feeling of being on autopilot, really bad anxiety about losing my mind and had to stop multiple times because I felt as I couldn‚Äôt walk straight and people would think I would look crazy. I was trying my best I pretend to be on my phone to look normal. I also knew deep down that if I met anyone I knew they would know something was seriously off with me because I was in no way fit for a conversation with anyone. I felt it was hard to interpret my surroundings and as if I was close to passing out and was super sensitive to light and sounds. I ended up being 10 minutes late to work and was shaken up when I got in and was trying to gather myself while speaking to my colleagues and putting on a normal front. 

This is really scary stuff for me and here is some background info:
I am 22 years old. 
My grandmother had schizophrenia.
I have not taken drugs besides drinking alcohol in the last 6 months and I won‚Äôt be taking drugs going forward besides drinking alcohol.
I have abused recreational drugs both regularly and irregularly for the past 3/4 years varying from once a week or two weeks in college to once a month or two months with coke, molly and occasionally ketamine while drinking. Ive also tried acid and mushrooms maybe less than 5 times each. I also have gone through phases of smoking weed since I was 14/15 with the phases getting heavier as I got older. 
I have experienced milder versions like what I went through when I was a kid and only when I smoked more than I could handle.

I then worked yesterday, but I felt even worse. I hardly did any work. Today, I'm on like an hour of sleep. I told my boss about this and she suggested speaking to a doctor.

I had to go to the ER for tachycardia when my heart rate was consistently at 140-150 bpm no matter what. They cleared me for any issues and said my heart was just reacting strongly to infection. After a few months I was still experiencing occasional palpitations so I made an appointment with a cardiologist. After a seven day heart monitor and a 40 minute heart echo the doctor said that everything looked normal (except for 2 episodes of SVT, which my doctor said we not concerning). Despite all of this, however, I still find myself incredibly anxious about doing anything that raises my heart rate. I'm convinced that something is wrong and was missed. Just walking up the stairs makes my heart race. Then I notice it racing and focus on it, which undoubtedly worsens the situation. I used to be an active guy, and now I'm crippled with fear of just going for a walk around the neighborhood. Does anyone have any tips for getting back out there and returning to normal?

**Short Background:** 

All my life I have struggled with social anxiety. As time has gone on, I have slowly come out of my shell and learned to deal with these situations. 

In my second year of college, I got recurring strep throat. 7 times in a matter of 6 months. It took a huge toll on my mental and physical health. I was on antibiotics 5 times, couldn‚Äôt drink, couldn‚Äôt go out like a normal college person, roomie/BFF ghosted me, left depressed, lost 25 pounds.

That summer I got my tonsils out (worst 2 weeks of my life) and experienced anxiety attacks every day. I visited my boyfriend at the time back in my college apartment for a weekend and experienced my first panic attack. (thought I was dying, dissociated, felt like I was losing consciousness- scary)

This prompted a doctor‚Äôs visit in which he prescribed me Cymbalta (antidepressant) and after 2 weeks I felt like a normal human again. Stopped all my anxiety attacks.

I also started therapy- and I still see her to this day every 2 weeks. This made a huge difference. 

**Fast track to lockdown 2020:**

I am from the UK but live in America. All my family lives in the UK, besides my parents and siblings. In December 2019 we downsized homes as my parents informed me they were moving to Germany for my dad's job. I got offered a job after graduating in May and was to stay here in the US with my older brother. I have been suffering from anxiety attacks all of that summer to now. My parents moved with my little sister to Germany in August and I cried for 2 months straight. It is normal to be depressed if your family leaves- but I normally don‚Äôt cry due to the antidepressants. I went to my doctor in October- she increased my dosage of antidepressants. In December, before visiting my parents for Christmas, I was still having anxiety attacks and asked for an anxiety medication that would help with flying. (I have never been scared of flying, but twice in the past few years I have thrown up on the plane from anxiety attacks). She gave me 10 .25mg of Xanax for as-needed situations. 

During winter break, I needed to use a few of these as I was anxious for a couple of days straight- feeling ‚Äòon edge‚Äô, no appetite (which is not like me), and scared. 

When I came back, I went back to her when I found out my brother was moving to the UK and got a job (which he‚Äôs been planning for forever now). I felt like the increased dosage of antidepressants wasn‚Äôt working and still felt anxious. She prescribed Buspirone. It‚Äôs now March, and I have been using it for over a month now. I felt an improvement in my mood, less fatigue but headaches every day. Also- remembering to take it 3 times a day is hard, normally I take any medication right before bed. 

This past weekend‚Ä¶ I felt like I‚Äôve backtracked completely. I felt depressed and anxious on Saturday, which led to a whole episode that night while I was by myself, self-harm (which I haven‚Äôt done since high school). Sunday I was ok, until around 5 pm at my boyfriend's house I felt an anxiety attack coming on. He made me take an ice-cold shower to shock my system, which helped for 10 mins until I started to panic again. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt in my body. I left as I feel more anxious when I am around people and drove 30 mins home during a panic attack. (reinstating I haven‚Äôt had one since my first one 2.5 years ago). I was hyperventilating, arms/legs went numb, thought about going to the emergency room, dissociated from my body and scared. I ran into my house with weak limbs to throw up. I don‚Äôt know what triggered it, which is the worst part.

Monday and Tuesday, I‚Äôve had rolling anxiety attacks all day. Depressed, confused, and anxious. Going into the office while being this anxious is very hard. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I exercise every day (sometimes twice), I eat healthily, I see my therapist often, I call my mom every day, I see my friends when I can, I go to work, I practice yoga, try manifesting and have crystals, I take my meds, yet I have severe anxiety to the point of not being able to function sometimes. I have been trying my hardest since my parents left in August but I feel like I am drowning.

3913,Vast_Courage7741,1614779885,2,"1. Meditate or do yoga.

One of the first things I did was head to a yoga class. It took my focus away from my thoughts and brought my attention to my breath. Yoga is also very relaxing, which helped ease my mind. Yoga helped me stay present to my experience so instead of jumping to what could happen, it brought me back to the now‚Äîthe only moment, the most important moment.

2. Smile.

I didn‚Äôt do much of this during the weekend, so I literally had to bring myself in front of a mirror and force myself to smile. It really does help change your mood and relieve stress. I also felt lighter because it takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown.

3. Surround yourself with positive people.

I called a friend who I knew could give me constructive yet loving feedback. When you‚Äôre stuck in a negative spiral, talk to people who can put things into perspective and won‚Äôt feed your negative thinking.

4. Change the tone of your thoughts from negative to positive.

For example, instead of thinking, ‚ÄúWe are going to have a hard time adjusting to our living situation,‚Äù think, ‚ÄúWe will face some challenges in our living situation, but we will come up with solutions that we will both be happy with.‚Äù

5. Don‚Äôt play the victim. You create your life‚Äîtake responsibility.

The way I was thinking and acting, you would think¬†I was stuck. Even if our living situation becomes unbearable, there is always a way out. I will always have the choice to make change happen, if need be.

6. Help someone.

Take the focus away from you and do something nice for another person. I decided to make a tray of food and donate it to the Salvation Army. It took my mind off of things and I felt better for helping someone else.

7. Remember that no one is perfect and let yourself move forward.

It‚Äôs easy to dwell on your mistakes. I felt terrible that I acted this way and that I wasted our weekend. The only thing I can do now is learn from my mistakes and move forward. I definitely don‚Äôt want to have a weekend like that again.

8. Sing.

I don‚Äôt remember lyrics very well and it‚Äôs probably the reason that I don‚Äôt enjoy singing, but every time I do sing I always feel better. When we sing, we show our feelings and this provides an amazing stress relief.

9. List five things that you are grateful for right now.

Being grateful helps appreciate what you already have. Here‚Äôs my list: my cats, health, a six-week trip to Asia, a new yoga class that I‚Äôll be teaching, and for my mom‚Äôs biopsy coming out clean.

10. Read positive quotes.

I like to place Post-It notes with¬†positive quotes¬†on my computer, fridge door, and mirror as reminders to stay positive. Also, I‚Äôd like to share with you a quote by an unknown author that was shared in a meditation class that I attended:

Watch your thoughts, they become words.

Watch your actions, they become habits.
Watch your habits, they become your character.

FYI: I created a new account because I have a lot of private stuff on my main.

So I used to lead a self help/mindfulness book club alongside a support group through a community based mental health association in my hometown. Then I had a baby, and pregnancy was a triggering experience for me, so I had to step away from leading the groups. My child is now three years old, and I'm in a good place in my life. When the pandemic started I thought that my anxiety and OCD would consume my life, but I've actually been coping fairly well (waxing and waning). Anyways, I've been thinking about starting an online book club, but I'm not really sure the best way to go about it, in terms of platform, how to find people who would benefit, or if there's already a place online where I could offer my services?

I guess the reason for this post is, I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in something like this? Would a subreddit dedicated to this be helpful?

3917,DumbBitch77,1614778760,3,"To be clear I have never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but last night something happened and nothing like that has ever happened before to me. I was wondering If I could get some advice or thoughts on this. I was trying to sleep but I couldn't stop thinking about things, finally I must have drifted off only to wake up at 1 in the morning. (I never wake up in the middle of the night, so I was surprised) It's not like I woke up like ""oh, I woke up, it's still the middle of the night,"" I literally woke up shaking and I had to get myself to stop shaking and I just remember feeling so scared. I just knew I needed to fall back asleep so it could be morning again. I wanted to get up, get some water, even wake up my parents but I was too scared and couldn't move. It felt like I closed my eyes for a second then I blinked and it was 3 am, and it was the same shaking, terrified, sweating feeling all over again. It happened again at 4-5 am and I finally fell back asleep and I was so relieved when it was morning, 7 am. I've never felt that scared, it wasn't like nervous jitters going on a rollercoaster or taking a test, I felt absolutely terrified. I woke up and sort of told my parents I didn't sleep well but it was hard to fully go into it. I know it affected me pretty badly because I woke up still shaking and I'm shaking as I write this. I don't want to be alone, and I don't even want to sleep in my own room anymore. I have no idea what happened, but was it a panic attack? Did I have a nightmare and not remember it?

So im squeemish as fuck and i have yet to been able to find my people for this. I never see or hear of anyone remotely as squeemish as me apart from like bob belcher.

It's such a legit problem but its soo hard to dealw ith the same way anxiety is - the thought of trying to get help activates the symptoms.

So ye it really gets in the way and i wanna get working to fix it. 

&amp;#x200B;

so like any sight of blood makes me feel feint, anything body related. and i mean anything. Makes me feel a bit feint. Pores - feint. blood - feint. scars - feint. Just anything  other than like your outsides makes me feel feint. Anything related to breathing, organs, blood, skin, needles, the idea of going feint (self fulfilling prophecy yay) - it all makes me just woozy and need to catch a breath.

Ye any thought about a human body results in me feeling feint. Talking about it makes me feel feint too.

&amp;#x200B;

So ye. whats that called and how do i go about remedying it? Especially considering that if i have to read anything about it ill probably feel feint too.

3923,Joemag007,1614775925,1,"Tomorrow I return to school for the first time in 4 months to get a covid test before going back to lessons on Monday 8th March. I‚Äôm not feeling anxious about returning to school but instead it‚Äôs the anxiety that I will feel nauseous and need to vomit on the bus there. I‚Äôll explain it a bit more:

When the school term started back in September, on the first few days I was nervous about going back and was dreading it at the time and normally I‚Äôd get the school bus to School. I remember vividly on the first day, I had the worst feeling of nausea on the bus and I was holding it in for about an hour. It was agonising. Luckily, I managed to make it to school and vomit in the toilets and the sickness went away. This exact thing happened for the first couple of days of school but then after that the anxiety went away and I could get to school without feeling nauseous.

Then a month later I had to self isolate for covid related reasons for 2 weeks and on the day i had to return the school the nausea returned. I‚Äôm not too sure whether that was anxiety related or because of something I ate that morning. But on that journey, the nausea episode was worse that any other one I had and even worse the bus was stuck in traffic nearby the school. In hindsight, I should have probably asked the driver if I could get off and vomit but at the time I didn‚Äôt do that because I‚Äôd been in that situation before and had managed to get off the bus and vomit in the toilets. However, it got worse and worse and I ended up throwing up on the school bus. I had to get sent home 

I remember coming home smelling of vomit and I was deeply embarrassed so I went up to my room and turned on my TV and sat in silence. There was a news programme on at the time and there was a section about something called ‚Äúthe box‚Äù breathing techinique where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 and exhale for 4 so I decided to try that out the next morning. Once again I was feeling very nauseous on the bus journey then I decided to try the box techinique and it worked wonders and I ended up getting of the bus and vomiting in the toilets. A successful outcome considering the circumstances. 

I then decided to try and skip breakfast on school mornings for about a week and this seemed to complete cure my nausea on the bus. Instead of having breakfast before school, I would take an apple to eat in school after I‚Äôve arrived. This worked until the schools shut in early January.

I‚Äôm going back tomorrow, and I know that just having an apple isnt a sufficient enough breakfast but if I eat before I go to school I feel like it would trigger my nausea. Even worse, the bus arrives at my house at around 1pm so that‚Äôs even more time without eating. I‚Äôm seriously debating whether I should eat breakfast in the morning or whether I should just skip and eat a big lunch at a later time.

3962,pistashyluv,1614757673,2,"My parents were awful to me as a teenager. I had the best childhood until all of a sudden they turned on me. They meant well, but they started worrying about me too much...  ‚Äúhelicopter parenting‚Äù as they call it.  They would catastrophize any failure which only made me afraid of failure.  They would ridicule fast food workers and tell me if I don‚Äôt go to college and get a good job I‚Äôll be ‚Äúflipping burgers at McDonalds‚Äù, implying shame in having a working class job. They fought over how much money to spend on me playing softball and blamed me for the fights they would have over it and made me feel really awful when I failed classes my senior year of high school because it torpedoed my chances at an athletic scholarship, so they didn‚Äôt get to see any return on their investment. They constantly talked to me about their money problems and marriage problems. I was never trusted with anything independent. I didn‚Äôt get a smartphone until I was 19, didn‚Äôt start driving until I was 18, didn‚Äôt get a job until I was 18, etc.... yet was constantly compared to my peers who were away at colleges in sororities or dorms who had stable home lives/emotionally supportive families. I was told as a teenager so many times how the stress I caused my dad was going to kill him because he would suffer a heart attack (not like I‚Äôm the one force feeding him so he stays 300 lbs). I was always told how my parents are older and gonna die sooner than other kids so I need to go to college even more because they‚Äôre gonna die. All of this I know was meant well because they ultimately care about me and want me to be able to take care of myself, but after years of this emotional abuse I eventually developed an anxiety and panic disorder. I really resent my parents because of this. I would have been fucking normal if they weren‚Äôt so goddamn crazy. I was always very laid back with a good head on my shoulders.  Since I never felt confident to do anything on my own, my parents convinced me to stay home and go to school in my hometown, but it‚Äôs been hell the whole way through. Imagine being 22 y.o. and waking up to sixteen missed calls at 2 a.m. after falling asleep at your boyfriends house. It‚Äôs made me feel like such a child. 

I‚Äôm 25 now and I‚Äôm in my final quarter of school. I graduate in June 2021. I‚Äôve sacrificed everything to get through it, but mostly my sanity because I‚Äôve lived at home the whole time. I have $18K in credit card debt from supplementing my life during these 8 long years of schooling. There‚Äôs no simple ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just move out?‚Äù  I can‚Äôt quite yet. My income is below the poverty line because I can only work part time while I‚Äôm in school. I‚Äôll be able to start saving after I graduate though. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on relationship issues haha. Codependency, fearful avoidant attachment, and relationship insecurity. It all fucking sucks. I‚Äôm pretty sure my boyfriend is breaking up with me tomorrow because my insecurities push him away so much, but I feel like such a fucking loser living at home at 25. 

I‚Äôm actually a very independent person when given the opportunity (and when I have money...) I quite enjoy being on my own. Ive solo traveled a lot. I went to Cuba for a week, Europe for a month, and California for a summer (this past summer) for an internship. Living in California was the best time of my life because I finally was free from those fuckers checking in on me and talking to me about their problems. But eventually I had to move back to finish out my schooling and right back to prison I went. 

It drives me up a wall being here every single day, in the same house and with the same people who have traumatized me. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to heal. I got a little taste this past summer, but it was just a tease. 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I feel like a need a therapist 24/7 to deal with the torture of being here. Idk how to cope. Tomorrow I‚Äôm losing the guy that I love and I still have to live her for at least a few more months. (Likely through summer üòû). I‚Äôm just frustrated frustrated frustrated. I just want to be normal and resent the fuck out of my family for creating such insecurity and anxiety within me. I love them, but I just fucking hate them until I can get out of here.

\- thrown up &gt;5 times in an hour and pretty much after every meal (i throw up whenever im anxious so thiss is actually normal to me just worse than usual)

\- felt really dizzy and just overall weird and out of it

\- have had crying spells by throwing up til i cry then crying til i throw up

\- felt really really out of control, unstable(?), out of touch with reality. in a weird breakdown (which has happened before) just an hour ago, i felt like screaming (but couldn't because others were home) ended up hitting myself til my arm turned red, ripped whatever i could grab apart (thankfully just pieces of paper)

\- then i tried to calm myself down by distracting myself with funny videos but ended up laughing so much i felt all floaty and euphoric. the intense swing from feeling so on edge to feeling euphoric really scared me. and has happened before which is why i'm even posting here

\- paranoia, jealousy, horrible self image (but i've always been super insecure so i don't think this is very concerning) just that it's gotten worse recently, like i've been skipping meals to keep myself underweight and stuff

i'm already on meds and my doctor actually increased my antipsychotics dose by a little a few weeks ago because of some of these symptoms. i just feel a bit alarmed by this whole week of increasing weirdness and the breakdown i just had and i don't know who to turn to and don't want to end up googling my symptoms to no avail or something. i'm worried because i have school and actually have quite a bit of work to get done but haven't been able to because of all this bullshit.

I wasnt raised particularily religious. I live in a pretty athiest country. 

It started when I was like 16 and I happened upon some fundamentalist christians online. I was blown away that people actually lived like this and believed these things with every cell in their body. 

What started out as morbid curiosity turned into fear of burning in hell for all eternity. I started to obsess over which religion was correct, what kindof person I was etc. 

It consumed my thoughts and I was filled with dread all the time, concerned with what would happen after I died. This turned into a strong fear of dying. 
I consider myself very atheist but every now and again this ‚Äúobsession‚Äù starts again and lasts for about a week each time. 

it goes something like this: 
‚ÄúWhich religion has the right idea?‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut I dont agree with these things‚Äù 
‚ÄúI dont want to go to hell‚Äù 
‚Äúwhat if all these fundamentalists were right?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat if I choose the wrong religion and end up in hell?‚Äù

This semester is killing me. Mentally and physically. Balancing work, school, and my life outside of school/work is becoming mentally draining. I‚Äôve been a 4.0 student for 3 years and now I‚Äôm bombing exams and half-assing big assignments.. I‚Äôve always cared a lot about my schoolwork and I‚Äôm not saying that getting all A‚Äôs reflects that because grades don‚Äôt necessarily determine your work ethic or intelligence (tho usually a combination of the two will lead to better grades). I guess my point is that I‚Äôm just not quite myself and I‚Äôm starting to lose my mind balancing everything. 

I‚Äôve always had a large course load and a lot of readings, papers, and research required in order to do well. I‚Äôm not trying to blame anyone or accuse professors of not caring, but I‚Äôm very frustrated with what is being expected in such a small amount of time. For one course I‚Äôm reading 4 different books simultaneously in order to write a large paper in addition to assignments he gives throughout the week. I‚Äôm just like dude.. i have 4 other courses i have to dedicate time to and eventually i have to sleep. All this staring at a screen just can‚Äôt be healthy. I find that I‚Äôm busting my ass just to get by and even to bomb some of my assignments. Ever since we went virtual, it seems like professors just aren‚Äôt realistic about the amount of work they expect students to complete. Cognitive load is a real thing, and eventually too much information overload results in students not remembering anything. Even if they‚Äôre doing the work.

I guess I‚Äôm just venting. I‚Äôve had two close family members diagnosed with cancer within the past 3 months, an uncle that was in a deadly car accident, and i just feel the world coming down on me sometimes. It‚Äôs been hard to focus with everything going on, but I‚Äôm trying not to use that as an excuse. Everyone struggles and everyone has it tough, I‚Äôm no exception. I‚Äôve just kept this all bottled up and tonight has been my breaking point. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm lucky to be able to get an education and I‚Äôm lucky to have a fantastic girlfriend and family. Life is just really getting the best of me. I hope i can turn things around and get my motivation and confidence back. I used to love college and now i pray for the day it‚Äôs over. 

Anyway, to those reading, i appreciate you listening to a few paragraphs of bitching because it felt good to get this off my chest. I feel alone sometimes and like i have to take on the world myself. My girlfriend is supportive but i keep a lot of my anxieties and sadness to myself. I don‚Äôt want to burden her and i know being a hot mess and stressed all the time can really push someone away. She works 12 hour shifts at the hospital constantly and is tired and needs support.. i just want to be that rock for her. Again, I‚Äôm just venting and I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm saying makes sense to anyway. I just feel like I‚Äôm in a world of chaos right now. I guess we all are. 

Stay safe everyone, and keep plugging along. I‚Äôll do my best to do the same ‚úåÔ∏è",Anxiety,What is happening to my motivation..?,2021-03-03 15:40:49

I‚Äôm so sorry if this is to much information but I just kinda went off lol.  I have been struggling with GAD and OCD for a while and don‚Äôt know how to get control of my life.  Hear are somethings I‚Äôm struggling with.

‚Ä¢ I have a tendency to see myself and the mirror and hate it and be mad for hours until I forget what I look like and think I look like a completely different person and look in the mirror and get made again.

‚Ä¢ It no surprise to the people that know me that I have trouble talking to people.  I haven‚Äôt been able to keep consistent friend for my life.  I am so hesitant of what I‚Äôm going to say so I just end up not saying anything.  I am just so awkward.

‚Ä¢ I always feel like everyone hates me.  When I feel good I forget about this mindset, but when I make a mistake I just get the memories of everything embarrassing I have done in front of that person and just think that they hate me.

‚Ä¢ I hate my voice.  When talk to people in public my voice is monotone.  My voice isn‚Äôt even like that but from talking so much like that for years it stayed like that and I hate hearing my self talk.

‚Ä¢ Ever since I was little I was scared of everything.  Random things.  First it was burglary, the gummy bearüòÇ, and death.  Now it‚Äôs swallowing pills, living a miserable life, and afterlife. Really weird lol.

‚Ä¢ When I was little I had the best conficrnce.  I would go into school and have my hair all messed up but I didn‚Äôt care because I learned from Disney Channel to ignore the haters and follow your heart (didn‚Äôt work lol).  In tenth grade I got a major reality check that I was not as pretty as I thought.  I hated my self so much I couldn‚Äôt look in the mirror.  If I looked in the mirror I would see everything ugly about myself and also every mistake I‚Äôve ever done.  When I‚Äôm feeling really down and people talk to me I can‚Äôt help but to think there staring at my insecurities and freckles I have and makes me think that they think I‚Äôm ugly. 

‚Ä¢ This one is so silly, but it‚Äôs getting in the way of enjoying life.  An example is sometimes I will find an artist I like listening to like Rex Orange County.  I will love the music and then I‚Äôll get to thinking and think people would think or say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs weird for listening to indie (lol)‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat Dominican listens to alternative music?‚Äù, or make assumptions about me and that makes me start to distance my self from the music and make me not like it as much.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve always had this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm different‚Äù attitude since I was little.  I always had to like everything that wasn‚Äôt popular.  I also used to like traditionally ‚Äúboy things‚Äù (probably because I never had guy friends).  I actually liked these things, but now I just feel like somethings I was doing some of it to make friends. Now it would probably be called a ‚Äúpick me girl‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt want to be like that, but I still want to be myself.  I‚Äôm trying to break that habit.

‚Ä¢ I think that being in quarantine made me realize how bad my communication is.  I‚Äôm not good at talking to strangers or anyone that‚Äôs not my immediate family, but I realized I can barely talk to my parents.  I even struggle answering the question ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up‚Äù lol and I can‚Äôt keep the conversation going and maintain eye contact.  It‚Äôs getting harder because I just became an adult and people expect me to at least say a few things to them.  I feel like the thoughts I have are what I really want to say but my mouth says something different.

‚Ä¢ I am Dominican and I don‚Äôt speak Spanish.  I completely understand it but I can‚Äôt speak it.  It‚Äôs like my fear of taking to people, but times to because it‚Äôs in a different language.  I am just so scared to of what I‚Äôm going to sound like or mistakes I‚Äôm going to make it what people are going to think.  It‚Äôs a regret of mine not being able to speak it and my family pressures me on it all the time.

‚Ä¢ This one is a little sensitive because I don‚Äôt think I have had a conversation with someone about this but I would say that if I want one thing in life that would be love lol (sorry for saying lol so much).  I don‚Äôt want to say that to sound selfish but I just want a person to be my equal and do fun things with.  I am not confident that it‚Äôs going to happen because I‚Äôve never been in an a relationship, never had guy friends, I‚Äôm not that affectionate , I‚Äôm a bad communicator, and I can‚Äôt help to think about something my parents might think of that person.  I also feel like it won‚Äôt happen also because I‚Äôm a bit conservative when it comes to romance but I‚Äôm also very weird and silly 
and I want a relationship that is full of humor and was fun like David and Liza lol.  I just feel like I‚Äôm kinda all over the place.  I also can‚Äôt help but to compare myself to other girls and that makes me think no one wants me.

I know that was so much and sorry for putting all my problems here lol but I even have trouble with getting help.  I‚Äôve talked to two therapists and I never stayed enough to make any improvements in my life.  I‚Äôm feeling really discouraged especially since I‚Äôm going to college soon and I can‚Äôt even make a phone call.

4032,RemarkableCode6655,1614738704,1,"TW// Hello! I have never posted on Reddit before but I will just get into the full story.

I had Covid and pneumonia back in December which unleashed an amount of anxiety I never knew I could have.  and in college, so I was quarantined by myself for the month. I live in Iowa and it was extremely cold so I could not go outside. I have been dealing with panic attacks since I was about 16 due to a very troubled past, but after Covid everything got much worse. The whole time I was sick I was obsessing over my every bodily sensation, which was constantly convincing me that I was dying. I have an irrational fear of death so this caused me an extreme amount of stress. The constant dizzy feeling I had while sick caused many panic attacks. The first day I was out of quarantine, I was driving on the highway after being inside for so long. I had just used the inhaler they gave me from the hospital, which I had used before with no issues. While driving, the dizzy feeling I had before was in full swing. I thought I was just tired but it seemed like the world around me began to fade out. I then pulled over on the side of the highway until it passed, and I have not been the same since. 

Ever since this incident, I have hated driving. The dizzy feeling is gone but is replaced with daily panic attacks. I constantly feel like I cannot full focus on the road ahead of me, and it gets worse when I am on the highway. This slowly progressed into me panicking constantly at work and ultimately me quitting my job. I have been keeping up with my classes, but recently it has begun happening there as well and the rooms feel extremely claustrophobic. It is unbearable and I want life to feel meaningful again. Some days are a lot better than others, and other days or weeks I obsess over random thoughts or emotions. I am constantly paranoid and feel like I need serious help. I have no known health conditions, other than my anxiety which I am not yet medicated for. Has anyone else went through this or anything similar? I am desperate to know that I am not alone!

4034,Nelroth,1614737886,5,"2019 had been a very rough year for me, I had been dealing with so much depression and anxiety that I eventually made the decision to see a therapist. Therapy had been immensely helpful, and by 2020 I felt much better about myself (in fact, if it wasn't for COVID, I would consider 2020 to be one of the best years of my life so far).

Flash forward to 2021, and it's been going on a very rough start. I'm graduating in the spring and I have so much anxiety about life after undergrad, and I'm also depressed finally realizing how much of my college years had been sapped away due to COVID. To top it all off, I have to finish a thesis for my senior year that I honestly dread doing. It's simultaneously the most monotonous and stressful thing I have done in my entire life.

I've tried coping with all these obstacles by myself for the past few months, but after a mental breakdown two days ago I finally decided to see a therapist again. I noticed that the mere decision to go back to therapy and schedule an appointment made me feel much more hopeful about the future.

But at the start of my freshman year, I really tried to crack down on getting better at not only talking to other people, but also speaking publicly, like in front of a class or a group. I have a lot less issues now since I've been working really hard to build up my courage. I even went to a few open mic nights and read poems that I wrote to a bunch of strangers and managed to do it very well. But then covid hit and schools were shut down, and somehow it erased my progress when it came to speaking publicly. I can still speak to random people 1 on 1, but my stage fright somehow managed to skyrocket. I missed the first full semester of school because I was doing school online, and I guess because I stopped socializing for a while it affected me more than I thought. I decided to come back to in-person school this semester. And when I had to give a speech in front of my class today, I seriously almost fainted. I started speaking, and about halfway through I got super light-headed and the edges of my vision started to go dark and my ears were ringing. And then I realized that I wasn't breathing at all. But at that point in the speech, it would be super weird if I just stopped for a second to take a deep breath, so I rushed through the rest of it without breathing at all. And when I was done, my hands were literally trembling and my heart was pounding. 

I haven't felt like that in a really long time. It was super weird because I've actually come to like speaking in front of class. But today it just... I don't know what was going on.

‚Ä¢ her being out too late, by herself

‚Ä¢ her smoking, doing drugs

‚Ä¢ her being someone who she's not

But when the nurse put the needle in and my blood started going through the tubes, it felt like the blood drained from my face and I got really sweaty and lightheaded and almost nauseated. It felt like claustrophobia mixed with motion sickness. I was okay for like the first half of the process but then I started thinking about my body being connected to a tube and how I can't pull the needle out of my arm and like ""what if they take too much blood and my body can't handle it"" and I pretty much just spiraled. 

I'm nearly certain that it was a psychological reaction rather than a physical one because I have been hydrating, avoiding alcohol, and eating well the last few days and the feeling passed within minutes once the needle was out.

4102,doometteowo,1614721722,1,"  Since I was a teenager, I've experienced manageable social anxiety. I'll also add that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about seven years ago. The anxiety was a symptom of that, so it fluctuated depending on my moods. I have never taken medication and haven't gone to therapy for four years now (I always end up quitting). 

  My anxiety WAS manageable, until this year. In the beginning of January my fiance was shot in his vehicle and sustained a life threatening injury to his abdomen. He needed emergency surgery and spent three weeks in the hospital. He didn't know the people who shot him, and the police informed us it was gang related. One person was identified and she only spent 24 hours in custody before she got bail and was released. At this moment, the three assailants are free to hurt whoever they want. 

  Lately, I've been fearing for my life. In these instances I'm convinced I am going to be shot in public, or stabbed and bleed out, or kidnapped to be murdered. I don't feel safe in broad daylight in public or in my own home. Last week a vehicle drove behind me for blocks and when I arrived at the store they drove there too, I was convinced the driver wanted to shoot me. I locked my doors and accepted that I would die, in the parking lot. My fiance would wonder why I never came home, or worse, they would find him and kill him too. In these moments I am utterly terrified and convinced that I'm going to die.

  These waves of extreme fear wash over me at random times, no matter where I am or what I'm doing. However, it's much worse in public and when I'm driving. I know it's related to the trauma but I don't know what to do. I've never been more afraid than I am when this is happening. Does anyone else experience this?

I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night; when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur and replay all the way through or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. Therapy was useless for it. I found nothing to help. 

But I've just hit four months on medication, 20 mg Celexa in the mornings and 50 mg hydroxyzine at night for insomnia. They have been a *godsend* during the day, I can't say enough good things - but hadn't had an impact on my dreams, that was one issue completely unaffected by either therapy or medication, apparently impenetrable. 

And then about a month ago I had my first non-nightmare in all these years. Just one of them, and it was honestly a miracle. Before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Then I had *another* normal dream a week or so ago. And last night - *zero* nightmares. At all. All night!!!! I can't believe it. It doesn't feel real. I'm *amazed.* I thought it was hopeless.",Anxiety,Just had my very first nightmare-free night in SIXTEEN years! I can't believe it.

4131,doinwhatIken,1614714214,1,"I have IBD (not IBS), I barely survive on disability. Spent about a year homeless after my landlord of 8 years died and the estate sold the property to somebody who evicted us all. Felt abandoned by friends and family. 

Eventually ended up renting a room from a friend I hadn't seen in years. That's where I am now. Ended up with a high stress job for minimum wage. 

Then the pandemic hit. I got it early on in my essential worker job, but couldn't get tested at the time due to rationed tests in our area going to only those admitted to hospital. I spend two weeks getting things organized in case i died. I mostly recovered with some lingering effects. 

Went back to the crap job to pay bills. Started to have sleep disruption and waking with a racing heart and inability to fall back asleep. I knew from past experiences that this can happen when by b12 and folate get too low due to IBD and some genetic. Started a supplement. Still having anxiety attacks and thought spirals.

And now the Landlord/friend has covid, he's high risk. He seemed to be beating it but is now in hospital with low blood oxygen, fever and chest pain. And his wife has started to feel under the weather, she's also high risk. 

And when she took him to hospital she forgot the housekey, and came in here when she came back to use the bathroom. Then spent a hour in my living room trying to figure out what to do (it's /-15C here right now) And I did as much as I could to help, eventually arranging for her to go pick up her keys.

And for some reason the last two days I've had hives popping up, and fear I might be developing an allergy to one of the few foods I can eat that don't give me food poisoning symptoms.

and another friend of mine in another state recently developed a chronic disabling health condition, was looking to come back to the area, is now self isolating after developing a fever.

So, right now, I might lose two friend in the next week, might start losing weight and being unable to eat much if I'm allergic to one of a dozen foods that were safe, might lose my living space if my friend/landlord dies... or end up having to take care of his wife.

4134,LeXam92,1614713476,1,"So I'm relatively new to this whole situation. It started about 3 years ago. Work and life in general built up on me, and I was under a lot of stress. I was in a trolley heading home, it was scorching hot and I was packing a backpack and a big suitcase in a sardine-packed, Tokyo metro style situation and suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe and went into full on panic mode to the point that I actually ended up in E.R.

They did all the tests and told me I'm as healthy as can be and that this was textbook panic attack and recommended CBT. I went a couple of times but therapy is super expensive so I couldn't exactly keep going. They gave me some kind of med which was basically an escitalopram, and gave me the least possible dosage (1/4 of the pill a day) due to my condition not being that bad. I took them for a year and then decided to start cutting down to the point that I ended up not needing them. Every now and then I had a slight panic attack ofc but I could always curve it with breathing etc. Lately, with corona and everything, and recently me undergoing wisdom tooth op, it's beginning to come back. I think it's partly because I don't get enough airflow through the nose and my brain automatically goes into ""omg you're gonna suffocate"" mode. It's been even disrupting my sleep as well. And the worst part is I'm surrounded by my family as I went back to be with them due to corona, and I know nothing can happen but there is still this knot in the stomach and chest muscles spasm that won't let me function from time to time.

so being the stupid 13 year old i am, i was playing around on omegle with my friends and a few days ago and someone asked for my nudes and snap. i wasn't thinking so i gave it to them. they claimed to be 14 but when i asked them to prove it they sent a really low quality photo that didn't even include their face. after 10 seconds of sending the photos i deleted them from our conversation and blocked them after apologizing for being uncomfortable. i'm grateful the situation wasn't worse and that i didn't send them more racy photos or hold a conversation with them. 

the problem is, as long as i can remember my parents have tried scaring me out of social media by talking about online predators and stalkers. this has since made it very hard for me to interact with people online because my brain's immediate response is ""what if they find me, what if they hurt my family"". right now i'm scared the person could find me somehow, especially since it's easy to grab an ip address from omegle (even though an ip address doesn't give off your exact location, more like city). i know i'm thinking too much but i'm genuinely scared. i realize this person has probably collected a lot of photos considering they had a snap score of 10,000+ and since it's snapchat there's a good chance my photos aren't in their camera roll. my face wasn't shown in the photo/videos either. i'm disgusted in myself and i'm never trying that again. i apologize if this isn't the right subreddit to post this in, this has to do with my anxiety disorder tho",Anxiety,"i need reassurance, i'm freaking out",2021-03-03 05:59:22

4149,astroh03,1614710025,1,"Hi everyone, hope you're all staying at least somewhat sane during this very bizarre time. I'm looking for advice on an issue that I guess falls into the category of social anxiety. I've always had a touch of social anxiety but for a couple of years there it was okay; I could speak in a group of people and not feel embarrassed even if I misspoke or stuttered, and even if there was an awkward moment I'd gloss over it and never think of it again. In the last year or so, that has changed. 

I started to notice it when I took a new job in September 2020. I had new job jitters but to the extreme, would overthink every email I sent and conversation I had and if I had a slightly awkward meeting or social interaction with a colleague I would obsess over it for weeks. This resulted in extreme self loathing which made the anxiety even worse. 

I recently left that job (I ended up having really good relationships with a lot of the people there btw) as it was a temporary contract. I've just started a new job and the anxiety is ten times worse. I can't sleep. I'm terrified of coming across as rude in emails or not saying the right thing on a zoom call. I'm scared it comes off as unprofessional if there are tech problems on my end. It's an internship in an organisation I'm really interested in and I'm worried this anxiety is going to prevent me from taking full advantage of it and building important work relationships. 

This anxiety has also started to seep in to my social life. I can't have a chat with a friend or acquaintance without worrying afterwards if they took something I said the wrong way or if they secretly have a negative opinion of me. I feel insane. The worst part is I'm actually quite extroverted and really do enjoy the company of others, so this is proving a real hindrance.

4151,blahblah1111234,1614709636,1,"Please let me know if you've had this type of anxiety before- stressing about anxiety itself and other mental illnesses. ssssss

I have generalized anxiety disorder, as well as depression and adhd. Lately i've found myself being super anxious about my mental health itself- I could spend hours overthinking about what I need to do to ""make myself better"", what I'm doing wrong, obsessively making sure im having positive thoughts(my therapist told me to monitor my negative thoughts to help depression). It's super annoying because I feel like i'm just incredibly anxious even about anxiety itself. I get really anxious about if I might enter a dissociative episode again, or if i'll have an anxious day, I stress so much and think so much about this on a bad day. Also I think my adhd makes this overthinking worse, because I can't organize my thoughts so i get more clouded. 

It seems that I literally get anxious ABOUT anxiety itself, I feel this urge to get rid of it, and I panic, because I hate it. But now that I think about it I really don't have major anxiety about a lot of things, only about anxiety itself? 

I know that the key to this stress is to just accept my mental illnesses and struggles, rather than fearing them. There have been times where I've been super anxious and scared of the anxiety itself, and then I tell myself ""I accept that I have this anxiety"" and somehow I get a lot better. Anxiety is hard because the more I fear it and hate it and want it to stop, the worse it gets. DOES anyone have tips on how to accept it and go about your day? I can usually accept it for a second but my brain is almost addicted-- I forget it for a second and then automatically go SEARCHING for that anxiety again. It's almost like I want so desperately to solve the problem but in trying to do that I just overthink more and get more anxious.

There have been times in my life before my anxiety was flaring up like it is now where I was accepting of my depression and such. But  now I feel like I'm trying to do EVERYTHING right--- trying to do positive affirmations, meditations, etc. But I'm just doing too much and going through the motions, stressing too much about it. I think I may need a break from trying so hard. It's just that everytime I try to let go, my brain goes searching for that anxiety again.

4164,killin_time_here,1614707485,1,"Hello!

I‚Äôm new here but I figured this might be a community worth joining as I‚Äôm sure there is lots of helpful advice to be shared and someone is bound to have been in a similar position as me.

So over the last few years since graduating college (2017) I‚Äôve been paying more attention to my behavioral patterns/trends at various companies that I‚Äôve worked at.
I typically am not an anxious person when it comes to most things, but when it comes to being at work, I just can‚Äôt shake it. Every company I‚Äôve ever worked at I‚Äôve had a hard time feeling any amount of confidence in myself and projecting that to my coworkers. 

Well, that compounded with my fear of being wrong, looking or sounding stupid, making bad calls, not knowing what I‚Äôm talking about, and the all time favorite: stressing over not knowing things that I think I should know already...

A bit of background, I‚Äôm an engineer who‚Äôs been in industry since 2017. I‚Äôve been at a few companies for a year or 2 each, and I landed at a great company over summer. Anyway, my boss left the company in January, then my project manager left the company in early February, and I was given his responsibility as the new PM.

Since then, I‚Äôve been dreading going to work even though I love my company and what we do. Every day I dread my meetings because they‚Äôve begun to feel like just a concentrated period of time where I‚Äôm being put on the spot and feeling/looking unprepared or misinformed. It‚Äôs an awful feeling.

Now that I look back on how I felt at previous jobs, I realize I eventually developed the same feeling. I think as soon as my ‚Äúnew to the company‚Äù phase wore off and I was no longer to have that as an umbrella, I developed performance anxiety (I don‚Äôt know what to call it but that seems right?). Hosting my own meetings always made me nervous, and I never quite felt fully prepared for what I should be ready for. 


I‚Äôm coming to this group for some advice on how to break through this feeling, or how to unlock a stronger sense of confidence in myself, and shake the fear of looking/sounding dumb.
I would agree that it‚Äôs a good and healthy thing to have some degree of stress/anxiety related to work because it shows that you care and want to do well, but to a degree. It‚Äôs begun to impact me more and more, and at times I feel so overwhelmed or just buried that I don‚Äôt get anything done.

So tips, advice, similar stories, anything are welcomed in the comments!",Anxiety,Vent/Advice Related to Job Anxiety,2021-03-03 04:51:25

I think it is because they are timed. In the most recent test that I just finished, my mind pretty much blanked on the short answer sections even though the questions were simple and straightforward. I did manage to type like one, two sentences for each though. For instance, one of the questions asked about the difference between net-zero emissions and zero emissions, which is so simple to answer yet I blanked while taking the quiz and tried to quickly search it up to jog my memory. Even though I knew the answer, it didn't come to me. This sometimes happens to me in social situations, where I for instance forget a person's name who I know well.

Panic attacks

Panic attacks are sudden, intense surges of fear, panic, or anxiety. They are overwhelming, and they have physical as well as emotional symptoms.

Many people with panic attacks may have difficulty breathing, sweat profusely, tremble, and feel their hearts pounding.

Some people will also experience chest pain and a feeling of detachment from reality or themselves during a panic attack, so they may think they‚Äôre having a heart attack. Others have reported feeling like they are having a stroke.

Panic attacks¬†can be scary and may hit you quickly. Here are 11 strategies you can use to try to stop a panic attack when you‚Äôre having one or when you feel one coming on:

1. Use deep breathing

While hyperventilating is a symptom of panic attacks that can increase fear, deep breathing can reduce symptoms of panic during an attack.

If you‚Äôre able to control your breathing, you‚Äôre less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms ‚Äî and the panic attack itself ‚Äî worse.

Focus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four:

2. Recognize that you‚Äôre having a panic attack

By recognizing that you‚Äôre having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you‚Äôre OK.

Take away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms.

3. Close your eyes

Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you‚Äôre in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.

To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.

4. Practice mindfulness

Mindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what‚Äôs around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it‚Äôs approaching or actually happening.

Focus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.",Anxiety,4 ways to handle an immediate panic attack.,2021-03-03 04:18:19

4185,glassfloww,1614703738,1,"School was really tough for me. I was a shy kid growing up and by the time I reached the teenage years I hadn't had much social 'practice'. I was shy awkward, weird and embarrassing. 

Bullying was strange, it seemed so subtle yet years on I'm still seeing how much damage it caused me mentally. I was often made fun of &amp; left out of activities and get-togethers. My 'friends' were very cruel at times and played some evil tricks on me (such as posing as a boy to text and flirt with me to find out secrets and embarrassing bits of info) I spent a lot of my school years alone and anxious.  

Anyway I'm still suffering from all the torment. I've repressed a lot of it but still all the memories I have left are bad ones. I still have nightmares every week about being in the classroom or around the people who bullied me.

I'm a very socially awkward person, most of the time it feels like I'm looking at myself from the 3rd person since I'm always trying to analyse the way I'm acting and presenting myself when I'm around others. My life sucks because of it. I've been in a new country with my boyfriend for over a year now and I've still not made any new friends. I meet a lot of people (my bf is a social butterfly) but I know my awkwardness makes boring and forgettable. The only friends I have are the group I have from school and even then they don't feel like genuine friends who would always have my back. I still feel like an outsider and I still always have the feeling that they talk bad about me when I'm not around. 

My brain is just still stuck in the school years where everyone is bitchy and cruel. I can't get over it and it's preventing me from being happy. While I was there it didn't feel like my school experience was *that* bad but as the years have gone by it honestly does feel like I suffer ptsd due to the way I was treated. 

I talked to a therapist briefly about this but due to financial reasons/Covid I had to stop seeing her. 

Other than therapy it seems the only way to get over this is to cut off everyone from my school years. But then I would have no one since I'm still too shy and awkward to make any new friends. It just feels like a ball and chain sometimes. I never post to my Instagram anymore because I was waiting to take a photo that is perfect and makes everyone who knew me go ""wow she really glowed up! Can't believe how beautiful and confident and successful she is now"" but I know that moment will never happen.

Yesterday I was pretty much crying all day ( I‚Äôd be good, have a thought and then start crying ) and my son told me I wasn‚Äôt acting like myself, which really set off the water works lol. Today it‚Äôs a little bit better, I‚Äôm telling myself constantly that ‚Äú live in the moment - the past &amp; future don‚Äôt matter right now.
