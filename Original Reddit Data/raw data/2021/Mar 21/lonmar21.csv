2,astralgingerbread,1617188241,1,"So, I am male in my early twenties. Currently in university. One thing I have identified with me is that unlike most other people, I don't form groups of friends. My friendships are loose and often I feel like a background character.

Sadly, I see a lot of friendship groups around me l, but somehow I cannot form my own. To be honest I am not very good at maintaining contact with my friends (even with family). Somehow I feel I lack behaviors other people have naturally which are responsible for prosocial behavior and relationships.

I lost all of my friends in HS and I am not good at maintaining friendships probably due lack of communication. I went to a psychologist, the analysis shows that I don't have friends because of low self esteem and feeling of not being good enough.

People don't approach me, but they characterize me as kind, helpful, funny and well read individual. Sometimes I ask myself where did I go wrong?

I think if I made myself a chore to communicate with people I would end up more successful with having more meaningful relationships. Also I struggle with OCD.",lonely,Lacking prosocial behavior,2021-03-31 21:57:21

Right when I think I‚Äôm at my lowest point, I manage to end up in a worse spot. I have nobody to talk to. I have no real friends. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve really had many true friends in the past few years. Or anyone I‚Äôm honestly super comfortable talking to. I end up just pouring my thoughts into these subreddits only to go unanswered almost every time. It‚Äôs ok though, I‚Äôve been trying to become more comfortable with the fact that I‚Äôm just not meant for this meant. Posting here allows me to get my thoughts out at least. I have come to terms that I‚Äôll never be truly loved and I‚Äôll never have real friendships. I understand some of it is my fault. I just don‚Äôt trust other people that much and I don‚Äôt make myself vulnerable at all. I‚Äôm more reserved/shy until I get to know people, so I probably come across as anti social. These are just some examples I guess. It‚Äôs not like I have much close family at all in my life except for my mom. She has always provided for me and I know that she loves me but I would never share my deeper thoughts, feelings and concerns with her. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever talk to people face to face about any of my struggles, thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Again that‚Äôs why I guess I just dump them all here. I just feel so stuck. I‚Äôve said it in other posts but as each day passes suicides becomes more appealing. I‚Äôve always tried to hang because I‚Äôve always had this slight piece of hope that things could turn around, but as time goes on I realize that it probably won‚Äôt, and that hope continues to fade for me. I just wish I had someone who cared, or believed in me. Someone who depended on or needed me. I just don‚Äôt care enough about myself to do things for me, to succeed for me.

My only friend right now is a FWB I had when I was still in Uni

My coworkers are turning out to be not so great as when I first started

My friends from Uni started a group chat that died in a week

I don't have anyone to chat with; no boys to crack open a cold one with, no girlfriends to make flirty jokes with, no group chat to dump edgy ass memes into

The last movie I saw in theatres was when Endgame first came out and I was by myself because the lads I would've seen it with had already left the state. At least it was a matinee on a Monday, just after Detective Pikachu came out so I had the whole theatre to myself so that was a unique experience. I just wish I had the boys with me to geek out about it like we did when Pacific Rim came out.

Any friend I make eventually just fades away, and it really fucking hurts. When meeting a new person I feel like I can't even maintain a normal friendship since I just resign to that eventual drifting apart (which usually happens in a year), then when I feel like something solid might be happening I get way too attached and pushed away.

16,Instant-Ocelot,1617176719,1,"For me, the hardest part of being lonely.. attempts to solve my loneliness often make it worse.  When I'm alone in the dark at my computer, like I am now, it's (kind of) in the background, like elevator music.  But when I'm ""socializing"" or around people, it goes from the background to a figurative ""raging beast,"" lonely so bad it hurts physically.    
I've been doing therapy on and off since the 90's (I'm 49) and the therapists, one and all, say that the solution to loneliness is socializing. They all say ""socialize! socialize!  socialize!""  ""Join clubs, groups, meetups!"" 

 I remember being in the gaming club in college --- something I tried because of the therapist's insisting that I socialize.  I was welcome there.  I was included.  I was around people who shared my interests.  I was so popular that I ended up unanimously president of the club.  I was among friends, I think.  


And I almost died of loneliness, or so it felt like it.    


To date, the only professional advice I am still getting is ""keep socializing!""

17,ExtremeRequirement3,1617175848,1,"Heeeeyy you! Yeah, you. I want you to know that.....

You have room to grow, and that's okay. It doesn't make you unlovable, ""wrong,"" or a bad person. If you're not growing, you're dead. 

It's okay to feel insufferable. It's okay to be so tired of yourself that you'd rather crawl out of your skin rather than spend another moment alone. Crawl out of it if you gotta. Punch something that won't get hurt or hurt you. Find a way to scream without scaring the neighbors. Write in your journal about how much you fucking hate that one thing about yourself that won't seem to go away unless your in the company of another. Run until you can't anymore. 

But remember to cut yourself some slack. You're struggling, and it's not fair for you to always lay it on heavier everytime you're in a shit mood. Give yourself a hug, even if it feels stupid. Have some candy or ice cream and enjoy it for what it is rather than forcing it to be a hopelessly-less-than placeholder for something else. Say something nice to that part of yourself you struggle to love. 

You have inherent value. If you didn't, you wouldn't exist. Nobody can take that away from you; not by abandoning you, not be being mean to you, and certainly not by not showing up in your life exactly when you want them to. 

You are loved, even if by nobody else, by me. I may not know you, I may not be able to hold you, or talk you through the day, but I have love in my heart for every single person struggling in their experience of loneliness.

I know so many people who keep saying ""you're too young to be lonely or depressed! Just go out there! Make friends!"" But it ain't that fucking easy. Having to come to terms with dying alone is hard for anyone, and doing it at such a young age is just that much harder. 


I don't know how to make friends. Either I'm just too dark and weird and depressing for some people, and for others I'm too clingy. Online friendships aren't really a thing for me because 1. I'm ugly 2. I'm a guy. Even then, I come on too strong for online folks. I live in small town suburbia, middle of fucking nowhere where everyone who knows of me hates my fucking guts. So no friends for me. Even supposing I had any avenues for friendship, I'm too awkward, socially inept, and lacking too much self confidence.


I'm never gonna be loved, either. I've been in one relationship so far. Just one. 7 months of abuse, lies, and cheating. Then she up and leaves me. Fucking hell... not only do I have a great distrust of relationships, I don't even have any avenues to persue relationships. No friends, no connections, even my family wants as little to do with me as possible. 


I'm genuinely fucking hopeless. 

Honestly, I don't see the point in even trying anymore. No one is gonna notice how fucking lonely and painful it is. No one is gonna care. If I just disappeared, no one would notice. It's a bitch being the most forgetable person alive.


Not only did I see life as good as it's gonna get already, it spat in my face and tried kicking me in yje dick but hit my pancreas on accident instead. (Anatomy isn't my strong suit, sorry).

For as long as i can remember, i've always dreamt of having a relationship with someone, someone i could cuddle, nuzzle and hug with, and game with, and countless other things i wont clog this post with. Im incredibly affectionate, and i just recently found some new great friends through this sub, but im still missing one thing. I think we all know what that may be, majority of you can likely relate. That empty hollow feeling, a feeling no amount of money or distractions can fill. I could have everything ive ever wanted, but if i didnt have anyone to experience it with my feelings wouldnt change much...

Yet i cant help but feel like a fool. Like i said, im asexual and always craved having an intimate relationship with someone with very little to no sexual interaction. True love after all is a much better feeling in my eyes. But, i feel most women would feel opposed to having such a relationship, and it hurts... i feel like im destined to be single forever...

I have a crush on someone too, well i believe im developing one anyway. I met her on this sub while helping some people out originally intending to be friends, but i dunno how she would feel if i ever confessed, assuming my feelings are even true! Knowing how i am, it's unlikely i have any chance... 

I guess what im asking is, am i just some asexual, foolish dumb teenage idiot with false hopes and dreams destined to burn in anguish? I sure feel that way...

As months passed by we started to get busy in our studies and activities we kinda slowly kept losing interest in each other... Mostly it was my fault since I cared less nd didn't give much attention to her.. Like... I definitely could have put more effort into our relationship. In the end both of us decided to mutually breakup as things started getting toxic between us. Reminder... The first year of our relationship was like... The best moments of our lives and we both were really happy... I felt like I had everything I wanted in life at that point of time. 

After breakup we both started to miss each other, we again patched up nd broke up soon after... Nd this continued many times... Nd ven our separation was finalised it was all blank for me. I couldn't get her outta my head... I tried a lot to frget abt her... She wud come in my dreams a lot of times... My heart wud rush venever I see her pic on social media, venever we texted randomly, venever a friend mentioned me about her, ven i recieve any news about her. Then the corona virus lockdown began nd tbh it was like the loneliest peroid in my life... I was almost suicidal... Didn't have the slightest ounce of energy to live in life but I kept crawling step by step surviving everyday. Didn't have much friends too... 2020 was a misery. Did I miss my ex? Countless times... I seeked help online nd thru other platforms so dat I cud just frget her... For 1 nd a half years I've bin suffering this just cuz my heart is weak and didn't have the courage to move on.

Our texting began getting more consistent, we talked more, we started talking about our past, she understood me, she knew I've realized my mistakes nd how toxic I was in some situations even though i didn't tell her directly. Y'all be confused since I'm shortening my story a lot. March, one random evening she called me to a cafe and we decided to meet.... The moment I saw her it was written in her face dat she was almost going thru the same situation as mine... Major missing each other... Bunch of idiots we both are tbh. We talked a lot nd ended up asking her propose me lol which she happily did nd i accepted. One of the best moments that has happened in my life if I'm being honest. She's a keeper guys... One in million. 

Why am I posting this, why here? This subreddit has one of the most relatable stuffs i go thru in my day to day life... Literally all my thoughts are being expressed here is almost like a biography of mine. The intention behind me posting this story is not for you guys to go back to your exes, or not to give up thinking about ur ex. Even though I wanted her back like real bad I didnt have any intention in asking her out again, I was just expecting a short meetup but as we talked, i understood dat she felt the same way about me. Listen to your heart, focus on yourself more, this one and a half year break was somewhat positive for me as I got time to improve myself... Still got a lot of room for improvement but still progress is progress. To all my fellow buddies out there feeling hopeless, start doing what you love doing, don't give up just yet... Fuck everything nd be part of the simulation nd slowly start deviating from it nd be urself. Stuff that worked for me: Hit the gym, start making money be it part time or passive income or a full time job, start reading books. 

Thanks for reading my cheesy nd cringy post till the end... Sorry for making it long but trust me this is only like 50% of the whole stuff. Hope y'all understood what I was trying to convey to you guys and hope y'all got an idea about my story... That's all.

And there's quarantine too.
Not that I left my house that much before the pandemic :) but I was building up courage to join more events, so this situation sucks.

As a child i kept making lists in my diary ""who would care if i died"" and the list of people being happy over my death greatly outweighted the mourning ones. üôÉ oh yea, i was bullied too, in several of the schools I've went to. I kinda wish i was homeschooled cuz all this humiliation I've experienced throughout the years were hurtful and i would've been better off without it. 

I fucking hate social media too. All of my current classmates in uni follow each other (we are 25 in total), and often post about hanging out with each other. I can't force them to like me or be my friend, but geez, why do they have to be so exclusive??? I really had high hopes that people would mature as we enter college and be inclusive and welcoming of everyone, but NOPE. It makes me sick to my stomach seeing them having fun together, so I've decided to go on an unfollowing-spree. There's like 3 cliques in my class, and I'm not part of any of them haha. I miss having a friend squad and doing silly things with them. 

I feel a bit hopeless on the romantic front. All i ever am able to find is people who want to be friends with benefit. I'm honored that i can even be considered attractive but in an odd way it also stings how the most people are willing to invest in me is a quick fuck. Fuck sex, i just want hugs and feeling loved damnit. 

My best friend is my internet friend and we used to text daily but now work is keeping her busy and she also live overseas so timezones are a bitch. Sometimes there'll be long periods of silence. I fear one day she'll get tired of me. 
Most of my heartfelt friendships has been online friends. I hate how some people view online friends as someone who can easily be discarded. I hate how some of my past online friends thought the same.

I don't remember when is the last time i went to the beach with friends. It kinda triggers me, since the beach is a nice place to socialize for most people. I lie whenever people asked if I've went to the beach this year.

I don't like my parents. I can tolerate them. I call every now and then or send snapchat of my food to my mom (because she wants to hear updates from me every now and then). I don't like them, yet they're the ones i call the most. They are the ones consistently waiting for updates from me. How fucking sad is that? They were terrible during my childhood but now theyre kinda redeeming themselves, even just a bit. Visiting them makes me upset and i often want to go home as early as possible.. but yea, they are currently the ones who actively wait for updates from me, kinda making sure I'm somewhat ok. I don't want to tell them again how I'm slowly getting depressed again and might need to take antidepressants.

So here I wanted to start a conversation for share and tell. Do you like ASMR? Do you know any people/channels that are your favorite? What's your favorite ""trigger""?

92,Tumbleweed_Intrepid,1617138137,1," 

First off if you have anything to say at all please don't hesitate to make a comment I'd love to hear other people's responses. I feel like I am truly alone and this isn't a recent feeling with the pandemic I've felt this way for years. I just feel different from everyone. There are three main aspects of my life that make me feel this way.

The first aspect is my friendships. I've never been friendless but I've never had more than 5 or so friends at any given time. Right now I only have 3 real friends that I actually see on a somewhat regular basis. I was apart of a different friend group but I realized I was the least valued member in that group. So I did a little experiment since I noticed it was always me hitting them up and trying to get invited to their gatherings I texting them to see if they would text me first. They didn't and that was all the proof I needed so I just dropped them. Anyway that's happened a lot where I'm the least valued member of a friend group.

The second aspect is my family. Next thing is my family. I moved to Southern California when I was three and have been living here ever since. I'm 20 right now for reference. Anyway I was originally born in Northern California and that's where all my family lives besides my parents. While I am close to my cousins that do live up there I only see them one or maybe twice a year if I'm lucky. Also it is important to note that I don't have any siblings, I'm an only child. Other than my parents I have no family that lives around me so growing up it was never like ""let's go to grandma's house."" When it comes to my parents they were never mean or abusive. I can count the amount of times they beat me on one hand. But they never really went out pf their way to try and make sure I was ok. Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my feelings it never goes well. My mother immigrated from the Middle East so I am half Arab. In Middle Eastern culture people with mental disorders are seen as trash and they are never offered real help. Just one of the many reasons why I hate my culture but that's a whole different rant. So it never goes well when I talk to her as for my dad he just doesn't really understand either. He's better than my mom as he at least tries to help but often what he says hurts more than helps as he says things like ""get over yourself"" and ""quit complaining your not crippled and don't have cancer."" Comments like these don't help because he doesn't know what it's like for me and he doesn't try to step into my shoes.

The third aspect is the lack of romantic relationships in my life. I'm just gonna say it I'm 20 years old and I haven't had a girlfriend a single day in my life. The farthest I've gone is making out with a girl in 2016 at a party only because of a dare. She didn't even want to make out with me, she liked someone else at the time. I've never even held a girl's hand. I don't have problems making friends with girls in fact 2 out of the 3 friends I mentioned earlier are girls but I just don't know what's wrong. I've never had a girl come up to me to start a conversation, I've never had a girl compliment me, and there has never been a girl to show even any remote signs of interest in me. I'm not the best looking guy in the world but I'm not fat, I shower and clean myself, and I go for hikes almost every day to keep in shape. It just makes me think ""what's wrong with me"" and ""I'm not good enough and I'm worthless in the eyes of girls."" It just pains me to see other people whether they be my friends, family, or random people in relationships while I'm starving for attention. I just want that kind of connection with someone. I just want someone to come home to and listen to how my day was. I want someone who I could share anything with. I just want to experience what it's like to have that kind of deep connection with another. I'm still only 20 so I know I'm young but with how my mental state is now it's only going to get worse in the coming years if I can't find a girl. I predict if things don't change I'm probably going to hit my breaking point around age 25. At that point I really fear that I will do something brash and seriously hurt myself or others. In other words I am scared of myself cause there is only so much loneliness the human mind can take before it reaches a point of true insanity. Humans are social creatures after all nobody is truly independent we need each other.

However there is light at the end of the tunnel. I am transferring out of my community college and moving into a real university this fall. I did get accepted to my local university but I chose to go one that is about a 4 hour drive away from where I live now. Mainly because I feel like I have nothing left for me in this city and I want to view this as a fresh start. Once I go there I will forget everything that's happened in the past and only try to focus on the future. I hope I'm able to find some new people because if I don't and I stay alone then I don't know how long I'd be able to live like this.

Thank you to whoever read the whole thing and even more thanks if you left a comment.

TL:DR - I have felt lonely my entire life this boils down to three aspects of my life. The first is lack of friends. I only have three real friends right now and have never had more than around 5. Second is family. I don't have any siblings and other than my parents no family lives in my city. It has been this way my whole life. Third is lack of romantic relationships, I've never had a girlfriend and that brings me deep sadness and loneliness. I just want to experience that kind of connection you get when your in a relationship with another person.",lonely,I'm all alone and I need someone to talk to,2021-03-31 08:02:17

Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

I'm fat and ugly. I bet everyone hates me for it. 

I also have bad hygiene. I don't think it's caused by depression, I've always had it. I just smell bad 24/7.

I'm depressed and I have anxiety. Yay. I just have no motivation to do anything, and when I do for example complete a school assignment, I get extremely anxious over returning it and end up just sitting there crying my eyes our because I'll never do anything productive. Imagine having to care for a person that does something like that.

I just am not good at conversations. I can't start one, but when it starts, I can't end it. When I'm at a conversation with someone that isn't too familiar to me, it becomes awkward easily. Sometimes I even can't speak properly because of anxiety.

These are just a few of the reasons of why I hate myself. As you guessed, I'm not the best friend out there. And making friends... I'm not good at it either. And now into the inviting to my house part: I haven't done so in over five years, which is a lot considering my age (14). I haven't visited my friends for a long time either, except for once last year, but it lasted for just two hours.
 I'm too insecure to invite anyone near me, especially if I know they'll be looking at my face or any other part of my body.

He knows I am schizophrenic but has never seen me in psychosis before, only with me when I was delusional or mildly hallucinating a few times over the 10 years I've known him.

We stayed at his and I began hallucinating at 10pm first just auditory, scratching on the floor and walls and banging randomly on surfaces. I told my friend to ring my mum as I started to get scared and he locked the door to stop me from going out if my brain did slip like it did.

But under my paranoia from the hallucinations I became delusional and started to believe my friend was planning to harm me. He locked the door and kept looking at the sink where knives where, it was probably an accidental stare but I took it as if he was going to stab me.

I kept quiet knowing my head plays tricks on me for 10 minutes until I started visually hallucinating, his eyes would flicker red to the rhythm of the scratching, I truly believed he had lured me to his flat, was controlling my hallucinations and he was going to do something really bad.

So I ran to the sink and got a knife, waving it in front of him screaming gibberish at it. (I wasn't going to stab him at any point I just wanted the door unlocked) and he Rugby tackled me. Took the knife off me and we fought for 5 minutes until he overpowered me and waited for my mum.

He text me saying I cut his back and he needs some time away from me. He won't text me back or answer my calls now.

I know i have my girlfriend and i enjoy her company but i also need a friend aside from her, she tells me i‚Äôm her best friend as well but it‚Äôs just not the same. She has a best friend aside from me who she can be with when she‚Äôs not with me and i have no one. 

I cant help but feel even embarrassed that anyone would want to be my friend or stupid and ridiculous that i‚Äôm upset about this kind of thing. It‚Äôs just so hard to make even acquaintances. 

I enjoy my own company and appreciate having alone time but that‚Äôs not the fucking point of any of this, i‚Äôm still in pain and i‚Äôm still by myself and it‚Äôs still going to hurt whether i‚Äôm happy with myself or not 

Recently i cut off all of my friends because i just came to the realization that they weren‚Äôt right for my life anymore, none of them knew what was happening in my life and didn‚Äôt care to ask but i always knew what was happening in theirs, there was no time spent together, and it doesn‚Äôt even feel different than when they were here.",lonely,I hate the saying that you should learn to be happy with yourself,2021-03-31 03:43:07

If they were to ever leave, I would be nothing. I have a constant fear that they may leave or that I will disappoint them. Yesterday, I had gotten into a car crash and the only person who had spoken to me about it was my friend. I told my girlfriend, though she has not yet responded, though she‚Äôs read my message. My crash was not severe to the point of the car flipping or anything like that, but it most certainly shook me up and made we regret living to the point of experiencing it. I would love to be able so socialise with someone outside of those two people, though my social anxiety and low self esteem hinders that severely. Most people outside of my friend and girlfriend who I was ‚Äòfriends‚Äô with or in a relationship with have abused and manipulated me. I feel as though I am less than human and that I only exist to try to please people. Slightly unrelated, but that‚Äôs one of the reasons I kin Peko Pekoyama from the series ‚Äòdanganronpa‚Äô, hence the username.

I'm not ashamed for not getting into a relationship, no that's not what this is about. My problem is that I have never had a friend I can rely on and connect to.

So irl, I didn't have a friend group at all. And for the most part, I can live with that as I genuinely disliked the people around me. Online, however is a completely different story. Idk if I should feel ashamed or not for trying to make friends online since the age of 12. I've kept jumping from group to group as the people around me either left, got distant or we just stopped clicking. Currently, the group I'm in has people who've known each other for 5 years. My relationship with the people in it is extremely complicated and idk how to describe it, but I always feel like an outsider in it. I can never truly fit in, and besides, we don't have anything in common like we did back in 2020. If I can't find anyone I can connect with, maybe I'm the problem. I do wish people told me what exactly is wrong with me, though.

I'm almost 18 and I've come to realize that I simply cannot converse with people. I've tried using find a friend subs to connect with people and they've always been really nice! The problem is me, of course, as I simply cannot start a conversation without feeling awkward as hell. I had no problems like this when I was 13. I'd randomly DM people and join voice calls and not be bothered by it in the slightest. But now, I hesitate a lot.

142,BossBobRossnos,1617115053,1,"I (m24) have been an every day cannabis smoker for 11 years now, to be honest those 11 years have been pretty happy, I have very supportive friends and family and I feel so grateful for that. The current pandemic has led me to no longer have the funds to cover my habit, so I have decided to cut weed and tobacco out of my life. This is no doubt the hardest thing I have ever tried to do, but I can see the positives of leaving it. My real problem is that I feel totally disconnected from everyone around me, I have always felt this way but when I'm stoned I can easily overlook these feelings and they don't affect me. When I'm sober I cannot overlook this, it affects me terribly everyday knowing that I have no one to vent to, no one to talk to, no one who really cares. My friends have decided to continue smoking, so I have had to distance myself if I'm to have any chance of success. I can talk to my mum about it but she always becomes very insistent that leaving the house will help, meeting new people and all that, I live in a tiny village in cornwall in the south west of england. Going out does not allow me to meet new people as I already know 90% of everyone who lives here. Plus I don't drink. So going to the pub is in no way an option for me. I really struggle to connect with people because of this, in my local area most people socialise at the pub, being someone who likes to stay as far away from alcohol as possible I do not go to the pub. Socialising is far far easier for me when I'm stoned, and that feeling is making me think, what's the point in quitting when life felt so much better when I was stoned. I genuinely feel that if I could find a group (or just 1) new friendship that doesn't revolve around smoking my mental health would improve tenfold. But obviously that is far more easily said than done.

This happened to me a lot of times, first i will get to the reunion very excited but at the same time very nervous because what if my friends have not arrived yet? what if i fall at the entrance or do something stupid? a lot of questions and add to it a stomach and chest full of anxious butterflies. Well the majority of the times they were there so everything starts fine, i am happy, enjoying, talking and maybe dancing if the situation allows it. 

Everything is going smoothly but all of the sudden i feel like i shut down, suddenly i have to start forcing my smile because my mouth is dragging the corners of my lips down, i don¬¥t feel like talking or i dont know anymore what to say, i feel like if i couldn¬¥t react anymore and of course this gets me the feelings of getting left out by my friends even tho they are nice to me. You could say ""well maybe someone or something made you upset"" and sometimes that is the case but other times i don¬¥t know what the hell is wrong or sometimes i provoke it myself comparing to others or thinking too much about things. Also i¬¥d like to add that this had happened to me not only with friends, also with my family. 

I would love to read if anyone has experienced this or perceived someone feeling like this, if you do how do you cope with it? or what do you do when you feel this way?. And if someone has an idea or explanation about why do i feel like this please let me know the possible reason of me feeling like i have 0% of battery.

Although, I'm content. There are much more important things to focus on (including myself) and I shouldn't have to stress over whether or not I'll receive a text from one person and rely on them to make my day better, or make me feel better.

I feel like most of the time the only reason I'd want to be with someone is for sex. I haven't made a new friend in years, and thanks to the pandemic I lost all my old friends. I do have one friend I hang out with from time to time, but the thing is he's technically my brothers friend, so every time we do something my brother tags along. I guess I'm the one tagging along. The thing is though, while I have opened up to that friend when my brother wasn't there about how I feel depressed and stuff, I haven't been able to talk about it more in a while. We just hang out doing random stuff we end up forgetting the next day. Another is neither my brother or my friend are interested in what I'm interested in. I shouldn't expect them too, and I won't, but I feel like the one friend I have is just an escape from being stuck at home all day. I'm so used to talking to my self about things.

189,Bitter-Perspective-6,1617077902,1,"Hi everybody, I am gonna share a bit about my life.  
I am 26 years old ,male. I was born in a small town , had a casual childhood. I grew up with awesome parents , sometimes a bit too strict and controlling , but I was always a ""rebel"" and did things my way. So far every everything in my life is pretty much okay and I am almost happy...almost...no actually I'm not happy at all ,but I would never say that outloud to any of my friends , so thats why I'm posting here.You see there's this little thing that I've never had luck in the love department. I have been with several women , but it never worked out and every time it ended up badly. My longest relationship was about 4 years and it was a complete disaster , but more on that later. I remember my first big crush , I think I was about 11/12 at the time and she was 2 years older , never gathered the courage to tell her I like her , but that didn't stopped me from making myself a complete fool in front of her (I think she still thinks I'm an idiot). Year later I had my second big crush , this time I had the courage to tell her I like her...yeaaah I did it on the same day we met , useless to say that nothing happened. After that I stepped up my ""game"" a bit , boosted up my confidence , had some really short relationships (one of them actually ended up with the girl cheating on me...yeah...at the tender age of 14/15, that really left a scar), don't know if I should even call em like that , but mostly it was a friendzone after a friendzone. There was one particular girl , we matched so well , dated for about two months and then she had to leave the country and I was heartbroken once again. One day I was hanging out with friends and one of them brought up his sister to meet us , I fell for HER from the very first time I saw her and I said to myself ""I want to be with her"". Sadly, for me, she started dating one of my best friends and I remember being so angry and depressed about it , I wasn't unhappy because she was with him , I was unhappy that I became one her best friends. Anyway they broke up shortly after that and we kept contact , being ""besties"" , I graduated high-school, went living in a big city, I've had some opportunities to start relationships there , but all I had was meaningless sex , because I was still deeply in love with HER, I didn't gave none of the other girls a chance. After some time I came back living in my hometown , the first thing I did was calling HER out. We went out 2-3 times and then I told her about my feelings , she instantly rejected them but after a few weeks we both got a bit drunk and ended up making kissing , this is how our relationship started and oh boy , how awful it turned out to be. 4 years of misery and struggles that's how I describe it now. Imagine a simple on\\off light switch , but instead of controlling the lamp , it controls the relationship - we are together/ we are just friends, nothing more and she was handling the switch all the time , sure we had some good and happy moments , but was it worth it ? NO ! Anyway after 4 years of that I've had it and decided to talk to her. I told her that I can't go on like that anymore and we should make a decision what are we gonna do about us. You know what she told me ? ""I think I am gonna wait for my ex to get out of jail so we could try again"" . I just left and that was the last time I saw her...few moths ago a friend told me that she and the prisoner are parents now and that's great , I wish them all the best , happiness and health in the world. After that breakup I distanced myself from women for some time , the wound was still heavily bleeding and I just couldn't afford risking another heartbreak. My broken heart healed itself and I started looking for love once again and ever since then I am hitting on a stone every single time , friendzone after friendzone. I met this amazing girl last year around August , we matched so well , I fell for her , made my move , we spent an entire night kissing , and the next day she told me that she is not ready for a relationship and even more she won't have no time for one because of so much shit she has to do in the coming half a year or so , but she said she wants to keep talking to me , so me the idiot told her that I am ready to wait for her...and  then ofcourse after about a month or two she told me that she likes me only as a friend and really cares to keep our friendship...so we are still talking almost everyday with some occasional casual flirts , more like joking around with it ...I know that nothing's gonna happen with her ,but I really like our conversations and her personality it matches almost perfectly with mine and I still like her A LOT , might be even inlove with her... I just want somebody to be with , somebody to love and somebody to love me back , somebody to start a family with and have kids. Is that too much for a man to ask ?

I wrote that today because today is one of the hardest days , one of my best friends is leaving the country to be with his wife and I won't see him again for a really long time.  
I find it weird how I have so many things to be grateful about and yet I am not perfectly satisfied. I have the best parents ever, I have so many amazing friends , I am a kickass guitar player , I have a nice and good paid job that I like....and yet I don't have love. 90 % of my friends are getting deeper and deeper with their relationships , some of them are even parents now and I'm just sitting here trying not to collapse .Funny how I am trying to convince myself that I am happy ,playing a role of a rocksolid guy that has no problems and is perfectly fine ,but actually I am really lonely , sad and unhappy all in the same instant.",lonely,"The story of an owner of a lonely , lonely heart.

He was in and out of psychiatric hospitals and eventually moved away. His struggles turned him into a person that I didn't know anymore. Plus we just grew apart. 

I did have a kind of deep friendship in middle school. I tried to see if I could at least see what he was up to these days, but he's on the sex offender registry. Kinda broke my heart to see someone I thought I knew turn into such a monster. 

I've never had someone I could talk to. I don't even know how to describe it. To have someone to relate to on a real level, not just friends of convenience or because of circumstance, like all of my high school and the ones I made as an exchange student. I was always the funny friend that laughed to hide the pain. Being vulnerable is terrifying. Being the funny friend means that nobody wants to relate to you or be deep with you.

I have these fantasies where I am in a loving romantic relationship. I feel that I have so much to offer someone.

A severe complication to me meeting someone is a sexual fetish that I have (ABDL -- google it). I have had it forever and tried to rid myself of it my entire adult life but can't seem to do it. I read research that states that fetishes are like sexual orientations, and that they are hard wired in your brain and impossible to truly get rid of.

I feel hopeless and don't know what to do. Sometimes I think I should just give up and accept my fate. The recurrent feelings of loneliness are big triggers for depression.

I call her mother ‚Äúmom‚Äù

She‚Äôs even my landlord now 

I had a mental break and she was dumped, both at the beginning of the year. We are both getting better, but no recovery is linear 

I lived with her for 3 weeks during this time. We gave each other space during our hardships.

Things changed when I moved. It was a slow change. It got more obvious the last 2 weeks. 1 word responses, no longer inviting me to plans, rude snarky comments. I asked what was wrong.

Apparently I wasn‚Äôt being a good friend. From her explanation, I agree entirely. I talked too much about my problems and not hers. I wasn‚Äôt supporting her while she was holding me and herself up. I was selfish. 

But then came the lies. I became a scapegoat to problems she created herself. She lit the fire, not me. I‚Äôm fighting my own fires that I lit myself. I‚Äôm not a perfect person. 

Apparently I am the reason for no friendship with her ex 

That ex mentally abused her and she still can‚Äôt accept it, she‚Äôs wrapped around her ex‚Äôs finger still and it breaks my heart. I texted with the ex with my friend‚Äôs permission in January, her reading and helping word every message. She gave me permission and proofread every sentence. It didn‚Äôt go well. It‚Äôs my fault apparently. 

Apparently I stole her ideas for something I‚Äôd come up with last July 

Apparently so many of her problems are my fault 

She pitted all our shared friends against me. I know I messed up and need to work on being a better friend, but she spread these lies and I‚Äôve lost like 10 friends. How can a 14 year friendship go down the drain in 2-3 months? I have to go and fight for myself with other friends now to make sure they know the truth... I did not do everything she said... and yet here I am telling people to not have any hard feelings towards her. I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves this mess. I‚Äôm not pitting anyone against her. I just have to defend myself! 

I had to delete my entire discord server after spending hundreds of dollars on all these stupid Jackbox games that we‚Äôd play together on weekends 

This isn‚Äôt who my best friend used to be... she would just tell me if I was being cruel, stupid, or weird. Now I‚Äôve lost half my friends. I don‚Äôt think I deserve this treatment at all.

I will always care about you, but goddammit I am not your scapegoat. I‚Äôll work on me but you best be working on you, too. I‚Äôm working on me for myself, not you, and I hope you do the same. I love you and hope you come around, and I‚Äôll forgive you soon.

244,TrappedInTheShell,1617048564,1,"I don't have a single friend. I just feel empty most of the day. Anything I do feel, it's nothing nice. Depression, anger, or a mix of the two. I have a condition that keeps me from working, or having anything close to a normal life. I live with my Dad, and am scared shitless of the day he will pass. As he is the only person in my life that makes it worth sticking around. Not that I'd do anything to myself when he does mind you. I have had suicidal thoughts, but honestly I know I don't have the guts to ever do it.

I think a lot about what might help. Sometimes I think having just one friend might. But I have this thing, I always keep people at an arms length. Have done all my life. I don't know why. I'm not some macho guy, far from it. I'm not afraid of my feelings, or expressing them. I have just always struggled to ever keep a friend. Having not had one for many years now. I don't know, sometimes I feel it's for the best. Why try and make a friend if I will just fuck it up as I always have?

That's about it for now. My heart is starting to hurt writing this. Putting it into words is making it a little too real for me. But in a weird way, I feel like it's helping. Sorry for rambling on. I just needed to get a little off my chest.

246,2ndhandlove,1617047724,1,"I miss being in love with you. And I am possessed by the idea that I may return to that state of bliss only attainable by being with the one my heart chose in my youth. When we parted, you told me I could see others but not to fall in love with anybody else. I have loved and I have been loved. But I cannot fall in love. I have tried to deny it, but you have a monopoly on my heart. It beats for nobody else, not even me. And the only way I might have redemption in the face of its ceaseless palpitating yearning is to once again submit to its undying devotion to you and bring it within your radius. I have studied philosophy and law, been an academic, and travelled the world, but the only truth that I know to be absolute is two-fold. I only want to love you. And I want to love only you. Tell me, is this something that is so bad, or is there anything I can do to shorten my heart‚Äôs unremitting march back to you

Please. Talk to me. I would do anything just to talk with you again.

Fuck it. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm going to keep talking to you. Because, I need to. Because I‚Äôm like a god damn fucking duck. I imprinted on you. In my heart of hearts I chose you. I have tried to clear the space for a new tenant, but it is molded to you. The creases and folds of that interior space knows only you. And every occupant since has never stood a chance because they were not you. This is why I persist speaking to the seeming void. Because I must speak to my heart. I am lost and only it knows the way. But to speak to it, I must also speak to you. For that is all it desires. So, here I sit, speaking through that fractured opening in my heart, trying to glean its purpose. I came back, really, for love, for bliss, for that moment of repose with your arms around me, in your good graces and my head upon your chest. The law, it‚Äôs just a ploy to seem good enough for you, respectful enough, successful enough. If I cant have you then it‚Äôs fuck all. I‚Äôm really glad I said fuck it. I need to at least pretend that I‚Äôm talking with you. There‚Äôs so much that I want to share with you. So much I can only articulate in the warmth of your embrace. my mind is running through a million things it wants to say and none can match the conviction of the underlying desire to be near your breath. To feel you. But, as the chasm between you and I becomes more definite with each unanswered prayer for acknowledgment I guess I should give up my dreams of being with you. I really did come back for you. And you will always reign supreme in my heart. I suppose it was the most American thing I‚Äôve done, to believe in a dream, and to capitalize on my assets. The greatest treasure I have is the love I have for you and I have an infinite supply. I know that my hearts abundance lies in telling you that as often as possible. If the winds of fate deem this inventory undeliverable, i will have to carry on, albeit weighed down with unrequited love. I suppose it is a weight I have grown accustomed to. Woe is me. 

It occurred to me last night that maybe I had to apologize. God I hope that‚Äôs it. Are you waiting for me to apologize before you talk to me? I thought it was apparent from my confessions of undying love that I had a deep sense of sorrow, regret, guilt and despair from not being with you. I would do anything to undo the loss of you. You are the light of my life and I lost track of that. I have been living in the darkness since. I cannot overstate my sorrow. In my confusion, I abused your love for me and turned you against yourself. I am so sorry for that.

The greatest sin I ever committed was believing my love for you was a sin. It‚Äôs literally the oldest trick in the book and I took it hook line and sinker. and How could you be true to me if that meant being true to that love? I was turned against myself. And thus, you. Again, I‚Äôm so sorry. But, I know now, if you let me make it up to you, I would spend the rest of my life doing so. That blot of original sin has been removed and I can see my love for you is nothing short of the very fount of my life.

today, I think I will simply say that I love you. But rest assured you, that while I am sculpting, I will be pining for you. to be honest, if I knew it would get you to talk to me, I would severe my Johnson and send it to you in a little box. they would call me the Vincent Van Cock of sculptors. Or, I could just send you a dicpic. which I‚Äôm tempted to do should my words continue to be rendered impotent by the abyss of your unacknowledgment. Alas, I‚Äôm a gentlemen.

I have to tell you I love you. Otherwise I can‚Äôt focus on my work. I love you today. I‚Äôll love you tomorrow. And I will tell you that as long as I can.

I love you. And I remember. I remember your red face when I threw paper wads at you in math class. I remember the silence of your breath being taken away when we danced for the first time and I revealed my feelings for you. I remember sneaking a gift on your porch and calling you to retrieve it. I remember your pink and blue tank top and shorts the first time I saw you. And the cadence of your walk. The little head bob that seems to validate your surroundings with each step and judgement. I remember your lips. soft, supple, full, kind. I remember picnics on campus. And our heat warming our bedroom as we lay atop fresh linens basking in the afternoon sun. I remember the way you eat. The fruit brought into your mouth by your thumb and forefinger. And your mouth encasing your digits as if the food was just another extension of yourself. I remember your embrace. your soul encasing us as if I were just an extension of you. I want to be your food. If I must die,

let it be to illuminate your being and fill your soul with the breath of light.

I love you. I love you more than a cool breeze on a summer day. More than the morning light or amber sunset. More than one could possibly say. I love you. I love you as myself and as the only other. I love you as a father his daughter and a son his mother. I love you. My love is like rushing rapids cascading over mountain cliffs. My love is like serene pools ebbing in the land‚Äòs rifts. I love you.

I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my life. Because I know. I know my greatest purpose is to love you. And every breath I take that doesn‚Äôt fall on you, voicing my adoration is a breath wasted. And every plane my eyes canvas void of your form is a glance wasted. And every impulse beating my eardrums that doesn‚Äôt transmit your melodic tones is a sound wasted. And every sniff that doesn‚Äôt capture your seizing scent is a smell wasted. And every touch that doesn‚Äôt graze your graceful skin is an outreach of my soul wasted. My life is being wasted, for it is meant to be spent loving you. Falling. Upon you.

I wanted to go to the museum today because I thought I might run into you. I don‚Äôt know why. apparitions of fate I suppose. Then I thought I would go out to your first house and take a picture of roses on its porch. Tell you that I don‚Äôt know where you are but I know where I first fell in love with you. But, to be honest, as much as I like to think that my love is invincible, that it can withstand eternal unrequitment (I know, it‚Äôs not a word, ... yet). it gets difficult. Waves of despair hit me. I use to fantasize about setting myself on fire in the middle of a plaza when things seemed hopeless. And in retrospect, I suppose the problem lies in my imagined solution. I didn‚Äôt feel seen. And I wonder whether that was why you cut yourself. Because you were with somebody who couldn‚Äôt see you. Who couldn‚Äôt dim their own light to see. Somebody once pointed out to me that the stars are always shining in the sky, it‚Äôs just that we can‚Äôt see them because the sun is too bright. It‚Äôs such a good metaphor for the self. when we were together I thought I had to magnify myself to be loved by you. And I‚Äôll always remember one moment in bed together. I believed. I believed you loved me, even, no, especially, at my most vulnerable. When I was not attempting to illuminate but resting in you. And you sensed it. You said, ‚Äúyou see me.‚Äù God, I wish I had some higher form of sight so that I could see you in totality. To see every part and whole. Every movement of mind, body, spirit and soul. My god, I love you.

The sun is rising. And with it, my love for you

The sun sets and with it, my heart rests in the memory of your ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

It has been said that hell is being unable to love. That it is a state of existence. That it is a place. That it is real. And it‚Äôs true. I experienced it. An inescapable dark gallery surrounded by vortexes that fed back into it. The open plaza filled with lost and predatory souls. A predatory soul grasped me by the head and drilled into it through my nose. In a panic I proclaimed my inherent value as an intelligent being, as I feared my brain, and thus my mind and self would be scraped out of my skull, ‚ÄúI have advanced degrees!‚Äù It sounds silly in hindsight, because we are accustomed to dismiss such things as superfluous. But, I could feel the pull of my mother‚Äôs love bring me out of that place. It has been said that as the inner, so is the outer. When I came out of that place I awoke with my own finger on my forehead, pushing into it. The force of my own will painfully bruising my finger. And i should qualify that statement. ‚ÄúI awoke.‚Äù Because I had the undeniable conviction that that place, that hell, was more real than this world. then the lockdowns occurred. People isolated, swabbed, unable to come together freely, joyfully, in love. I don‚Äôt know if my ‚Äúdream‚Äù was a premonition of things to come, a succumbing to my own inner daemons, a possession of external demons, a projection of my own self, but I know with certitude what led me there. An inability to love. So I have to believe that love can lead me to a better state of existence. And I don‚Äôt know if there is one true self, angels or demons, whether this world is a projection of a collective unconscious or we‚Äôre all snakes in a pit. which prefaces a singular question. Do I have a soulmate? An other that I am meant to be with. If there is only one of us, as the esoterics would have us believe, then I know, I need the Good, the True, and the Beautiful to appease the despair of loneliness. And if we are all snakes in a pit, I need it all the more. all I know, all I choose, is to love. because I remember. I remember a better state of existence. One where my self and my beloved woke up together. you are at least my muse of beauty, and certainly my beloved. What I cannot know without you, is whether you are my soulmate. And what I can know without loving you, is that I‚Äôm lost. So, again, I love you.

Fucking balls. I‚Äôm giving you gold. And still, no response. You can‚Äôt be listening to these messages. Ugh. Oh well. I still got to love. To quote you, ‚ÄúI remember one time we were out at a friend‚Äôs on a blanket just lying there and you were talking about certain parts of the brain, the sky and how you wonder about it, I swear I could listen to you talk forever.‚Äù It‚Äôs from one of your notes I kept. Maybe it‚Äôs still true. Maybe you are listening. Quietly enganged, with your finger upon your lip. As if to hold back a response, still your mouth from saying, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Or, more likely, exclaiming, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to love you!‚Äù To which I would respond, ‚ÄúThe lady doth protest too much.‚Äù And you would want to laugh but it would be to revealing, so you would turn and look aside, effacing. But still with a contented smile. You said we don‚Äôt know each other anymore. But that will never be true. You are part of the intimate fabric of my soul for eternity. And so precious to me it will be the last threads that I allow to be unwoven and slip through the grasping clutches of my desperate desire as I slip into oblivion, or ascend to my maker. I suspect it would be the former, as I am beginning to believe my maker is my love for you. ‚ÄúOmg,‚Äù She says, as she does it again, looking aside with a ‚Äúthis is too much‚Äù smile.

I watched a beautiful sunset this evening. I longed for you to be there with me, hand. I would have brought it up to my lips and kissed it gently and we would smile while gazing at nature‚Äôs magnificence. I would say more, as I‚Äôm always thinking of you. But the words are slow to come as I had a long day. So I will simply say, I love you.

I have been dieting and exercising. And just now, I was looking at my hands, the clammy sweat from my coffee and liquor drink pushing itself out of my palms glistening cleanly on my hands filled with the light of my purification. And as I trace the valleys and edges and traces of my finger and the lifelines, I see a scar. A scar I got pulling the knife you would use to cut yourself from your hands. It is a scar I wear proudly. I would take a thousand cuts and a million assaults so that you would know that you are loved.

God, I love you. I really do. and I‚Äôve grown so much. Our problem was that we loved each other too much. Too much for our age. and even though the thought of you coupled with the lack of your immediate presence pains me, because I want you so badly, to contain you, to possess you, I can always breathe. Because I‚Äôve grown. I possess myself and sit in my hearts reflection of your beauty, and the stillness of our breath and contentment of our communion. A song of longing buried under the darkness transforms into a passionate and selfless chorus of praise. My inner life unfolds within into an opera from the sole contemplation of you. I have you to thank for this gift. I am now a vast ocean filled with currents of life and love. No longer a created being, I remake myself by my own breathe and voice. My ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù refraining through the ether of my veins, forming the vessels and pushing the muscles, dancing across the capillaries of my skin, raising my hair with the electricity of my love‚Äôs virility. I can love so much because of you. And when I think I can‚Äôt take it. I remember I can. And so I love more. And more.

I love you X13

Today marks a month I‚Äôve spent sending you messages. I think I‚Äôll stop after today lest I seem two loony. before I do, I want to recall one last memory. Lying in bed with you, recounting our other lovers. Once dispelled, we both came to the same conclusion. That we wished we had never been with anybody else. It was not a forced exchange, it was not monogamy founded on jealousy or possessiveness. But an equally shared revelation that our greatest good was each other. To give ourselves to each other And in that revelation we found bliss. I say this in all honesty, I cannot do that with another. And I say also, that I cannot do anything else. I can only love you. Because it is what makes me who I am. I am yours for the taking. And do not despair for me should you refuse my gift. I am strong, I can take it. I have learned that it is my love for you that sustains me, not your love for me. If you have no love for me, I can subsist. I can sell my love for you second hand to the highest bidder. Life is good that way. And you needn‚Äôt give me yourself in totality as I did you years ago. Maybe you‚Äôre curious, maybe you just want to remember what it‚Äôs like to feel our love once again. Maybe just one night, one date, one conversation. its up to you. You could see me, chew me up, and spit me out. I would still love you, adore you, worship you. Maybe you just want to taste and see. Judge for yourself whether my love for you is something you want.

All my life I have never been able to physically walk and meet up with a friend in the same town as me. The nearest friend I have lives about a 20-30mins drive away. All other friends don‚Äôt want to see me or have moved away to University, some of them wouldn‚Äôt meet up with me or didn‚Äôt want me to be around.

I struggle to talk to my family about it because I‚Äôm scared that being miserable around them will make things worse and it will make them sad as well. 

When lockdown started I was ok with it because it felt like a long summer I was ok being by myself and I was in the middle of a course which gave me something to do and I had a job but now I‚Äôm on furlough and my course has ended I‚Äôve never felt more alone than ever. I see people all the time outside being able to meet up with groups of friends and I‚Äôve just never had that. I miss company and it has led me to become  anxious going outside alone. 

I‚Äôve been suppressing my emotions to appear more positive in front of my family but inside it‚Äôs just a void of darkness and depression I really wish I could just open up about it but I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm too scared to do it, it has lead to suicidal thoughts and not being able to sleep for long periods of time.

It is now 2 years that I do night shifts all day in my work, monday to saturday, sometime even sunday, and damn, that give you a heavy blow after some time, especially when you have no one to talk, it does isolate you greatly.  


It's not like my life was uneventful, but it was rarely in a good way, I still managed to pull it through by trying to find things to do and going forward.  


I haven't talked to any of my family or to my friend ( yeah in singular ) since 2 weeks, sometimes it's even longer ( I think the longest is 2 months without talking to any of them) and I rarely talk to my co-workers because I don't really want to share my private life with them.  


I've been dealing with loneliness since my parents are divorced, it's been 20 years now, i've learned how to embrace the loneliness and even if I rarely talk, I was never bothered and kinda happy.  


Now since I've been working at night, I've noticed that loneliness have done a lot of harm on me, and I've severed a lot of ties because of what I have been through in life, but now... well I do feel like I'm living my life without any purpose, can't even talk to someone, I don't have much to talk beside my hellish life, I have a lot of difficulty to trust people and I have kinda lost how to properly talk to people.

I really feel cursed. I don‚Äôt have siblings so that‚Äôs a part of it. I had 1 best friend growing up with whom I had to end the friendship because she was not the same friend to me as I was to her. She betrayed my trust and sat in circles with people who talked about me. I have had a few almost friends since then but everyone always does something really hurtful to me and then abandons the friendship. I really never understood this and never will. I am very self aware to reflect on myself but it never makes sense. I‚Äôm an extremely devoted, open, reliable, and loving friend. I often feel like I‚Äôm too good for the world. I have never been in love nor have I been truly loved. I am an attractive person with a nice physique and every guy has only taken the opportunity to use me, lie to me, and never take the chance to get to know me sincerely. It‚Äôs like nobody cares to see me for me yet I always extend that grace to everyone I come in contact with. Sometimes I feel that I‚Äôm a bit naive for seeing the good in everyone and being so open but I also believe that my innocence is one of the most beautiful things about me. I just wish people wouldn‚Äôt try to take advantage. I am so desperate to be loved that I continue to give chances hoping that each time will be different, only it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like I am prey to everyone. The other day I met a guy at a juice bar and we really hit it off. I thought his personality was great, the conversation was effortless, and we laughed a lot. Later that night, he begins to compliment my body and says he wants to have s*x with me but in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù way as I had already explained that I‚Äôm a bit apprehensive with men because of my experiences. I said no and I laughed it off in the moment but when I got home and thought about it all I could do was shake my head. I hate that it is my deepest desire to be TRULY loved and to have a sisterhood, especially at this age and time of my life but still.. nothing. I am a bit more mature than most and many my age and my outlook on life seems to be a lot different so I feel isolated all the time because I feel like nobody understands me and I‚Äôm so different when in reality, I know that‚Äôs not the case but still I have no one. I‚Äôm tired of trying and I‚Äôm tired of giving chances. I‚Äôm tired of being hurt and broken but still smiling and loving. I continue because that‚Äôs who I am. I‚Äôm tired of crying every night and feeling like I‚Äôm missing out on life and experiences because I have no one to share them with.

270,throwawai77674,1617033756,1,"A few weeks ago I had come into contact with my ex again who owes me money because I might need to replace a laptop that I got 3 years ago and funds are pretty low. Talking to him was uncomfortable even through a friend but I really needed funds so I can buy a replacement. Anyway, talking to him again and interacting with him made me realize that being a virgin isn't going to be bad. He ruined literally everything for me and sex, and other things that come along with it have become mentally damaging. 

He threatened me with pregnancy before, a thing that I didn't like from the beginning because I felt so ugly that I wanted surgery to fix my looks. And that was scary, I have a phobia of pregnancy, which is why I'm still a virgin as well. My sister also didn't help after coming out with her sexual lifestyle and telling me and our mother about how she started panicking after her ex left her. 

He wasn't the best but she ended up taking cranberry pills and now hpv shots in fear from having sex with him years later. I already know that mentally, having sex with someone will not make me feel better. The thoughts of losing the only part of me that seemingly makes me worthy? I rather not. 

And so with that I plan on getting a hysterectomy and becoming more masculine because I'm tired of being viewed as a sexual person. I'm tired of being thirsted over because I look more feminine. I rather just not be appealing at all. 

All and all I'm ready to move on alone. It'll be hard but it is what it is. I really feel it weighing on me that I hate who I am and that I haven't had anyone love me without wanting more than I can offer. I gave what I could give.

So these last two years have been quite tough for me. I'm normally a very outgoing person but I guess I did an uno reverse on myself. Nowadays I just really want to be left alone. Today I got invited to Starbucks with some friends and I knew normal me would feel really happy and excited etc. but it felt like a chore. I don't know what's wrong with me and I'm not even that old. I tried protesting at first but they nagged me until I went along.

 At Starbucks when it was my turn to order I sorta froze up and kept on stuttering. Again another thing that's been happening for a while but I knew wasn't normal. That's the strangest thing since if someone were to ask me a question which required me to lie I could answer super smoothly but a simple question like ""what would you like to order?"" and I'm thrown off. I really hate this new me and I hope i can just feel normal again instead of constantly feeling so...off.",lonely,lonely but not lonely,2021-03-29 18:45:04

321,WhatDifference,1617000777,1,"I've been single ever since right before covid. Because you don't know me you will think this is extremely arrogant. But in actuality I have done a lot of work on myself in therapy and am on medication now that really works for me and and I am self aware.

I see my assets as glaring. I don't think I'm perfect, but I can't figure out why I keep getting ghosted, why the people I do date briefly don't want to commit to me. obviously everyone's going to say it's not you it's them. But I don't understand why I'm not attracting more people.

I don't know if having these seemingly arrogant thoughts is better or worse than all of the years, most of my life that I was not capable of being alone. I don't know if these thoughts that I am special and therefore worth being treated that way is better than all the times I thought I was trash, the ugliest, worst stupidest person in the world. literally I thought those things most of my life.

now I look in the mirror and although I wish I didn't judge, I would be lying if I didn't say I think I'm a solid 8 out of 10. I'm no longer overweight, but somewhere more in the middle. I'm girly, I wear dresses and fashionable clothes. I'm college educated.

I know my attachment style and my love languages.

And on top of those things, I am a really great girlfriend. All of my exes would most likely give a similar report, though they probably also say I'm crazy. crazy because they told me they would do things, and I held them accountable, and then had an outburst after so many times of being lied to. But I didn't take it personally because they had mental illness, and I struggle with that too. But I hold myself accountable. I apologize. I do not repeat mistakes.

I am a good girlfriend. I am a good person. I love love love love caring for people. I love giving gifts, and everyone who knows me says that I give the most thoughtful and generous gifts. I love to give massages. I love to get snacks randomly and Wawa for my partner. I like to make them feel special, compliment them every single day. celebrate the wins with as much enthusiasm as my partner.

I believe love is an action. I am dedicated. I would love to find another dedicated person, someone who could treat me as well as I could treat them. someone who knows that I am special, and they want to get to know me on every level.questions. I want someone to ask me questions.

this might be telling, and because you don't know me I'm sure you'll have judgments too. But in my teenage years I did a lot of medium self-harm. It is still visible with the lines everywhere, hasn't faded much, but it's certainly not the worst I've seen. My sister has worse in terms of the severity.

at the same time this is such a big part of my past. I have over 200 scars on my legs and my arms. The last five or six people I have dated in the last 8 years don't talk about it and don't ask. And I have expressed that I don't understand why they don't see me. And I know a lot of people will comment that oh they didn't know how to talk about it or they didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

except for I have literally said the words, I would like to talk about it. It is part of my past. I want my past to be what helps conceptualize me as who I am today. I think my scars are beautiful, partially because I like the macabre.

I am an artist who does surrealist paintings. I make videos of myself dancing sexy, and silly. I love adventures and roller coasters and going on mini vacations. I love movies, except for superheroes and kids movies. only because I cannot suspend disbelief, but I respect people who are light at heart that way.

If you've read this far, and I would be very very very shocked if you've read this far seeing as no one seems to respond. That's a horrible thing to say no one. I would get in trouble in therapy, and the logical part of my brain knows that this is just me venting at 3:00 in the morning because I can't sleep and I'm crying and lonely.

I want to be seen. I don't want to be a ghost. I want to have real conversations. I want to be hugged and kissed and loved and cherished.

I remember having a friend who I legit was always there for, only for her to stop talking to me once she made new friends. She'd occasionally text me just to vent about things. It's almost like I've never had a real friend. Every friendship I've had was shallow in some way.

Like, out of all my friends, I feel like I'm the only one who starts the meaningful conversations. I'm always the one asking people if they're ok, or how their day is going. It isn't until after I ask them, that they ask me. The only time I really feel like my friends reach out to me ia when they want to know if I can get on to play video games with them. Which that itself isn't a bad thing, but can't they ask me how my day is going without me having to ask them first? Or if I'm doing ok? And why is it that when they do ask those questions, I feel like I always say the opposite of what's wrong? Like, if they ask if I'm not doing ok, I'm always like ""Oh, I'm fine, don't worry about me""? I feel like I've increasingly gotten that strong bond that I once had with my friends grow smaller and smaller before and after COVID came around. One moved to Sacramento before COVID, one moved to Point Arena before COVID, one moved to Arizona during COVID, and the person who I thought was going to be my partner couldn't date me because I'm bisexual, and ""she had standards"". And why do I always do something that I know distracts me, even when I know I should be doing schoolwork, and I know that I won't pass my classes if I don't do my schoolwork? Like, it's not looking too well for my English class that I'm taking at the college. I feel like I might not pass, and if I don't pass that, I don't think I'll get enough credits to pass High School. And if I don't pass High School, my parents will be very angry with me, and yell at me, asking why I can't just do what I need to do, when I don't know why I can't focus and do what I need to do? I feel like I'll be a disappointment to them, and I feel like what I want isn't- actually, scratch that. I KNOW what I want isn't what they want for me. I want to be a content creator, but they don't view that as a ""real job."" It's just... I'm so lonely man, Ever since COVID began, I feel like my life has steadily gone downhill.

I never had real friends for all my life until now. We have a lovely group of 4 people and I love them all so incredibly much. They mean everything to me. Two of them i've known for about 4 years and the last one came about 5 months ago to us. She is the best friend of my friend. They have a lets say strong relationship. Meaning he fell in love with her once, but she rejectet him (he probably still has feelings for her).

I get along with her really fine especially since i'm afraid of women. We talked a lot about our problems in life and she tries really hard me make me feel comfortable around her.

Here is where the problems begin:  
She all of the sudden became really affectionate towards me. Like making me compilents and saying I deserve better things in life and wanting to spend time in voicecalls with me. I probably think to much about this. 

But since a few days she and my other friend (not the one who fell in love with her) started joking about a ""war"" between them about who gets to own me. We always joke around and talk shit, but I find this incredibly weird. He shares his ""plans"" about how he's going to kidnap me to save me from her. And she talks about how she wants me under her blanket and like i'm ""hers"".  
I don't know what to make of this. Do normal people joke about this kind of things?

That alone would no be a problem but I can tell that my other friend (the one who fell in love) hates this.

I don't think that I can talk with her about this. I'm so terrified about this. And its not like I don't like her but I did'nt even saw her in real life yet. She lives a few hundered kilometers away and with the whole virus situation meeting isn't really possible right now. 

I'm so scared that this whole thing could break our group apart. My whole life I was alone. I don't know how to deal with this. I don't know what to do. Even if between me and her could be more than friendship, i'm scared of this too.

I live with my family, my parents love me, I never had to worry about a place to stay or what to eat, a call to my father and it'll be solves. we're not rich but we do get by.  I have a friend that talk to everyday now, we're in similar situations, we went to the same university, We're struggling to find a good job. 

No one knows me. No one knows the real me. I used to feel so bad, crying myself to sleep, wanting to talk to someone or anyone. I went on anonymous chat apps to vent and left when I said what I wanted yo say, but it never solved the problem.

I always knew I am introvert. I always knew that I get anxious around people and that personal relationships require a lot of energy from me. I'm not shy, I'm not afraid to be around people.  I'm assertive and i took part in many clubs and activitie. I just find the process of maintaining a healthy relationship requires energy, time and effort that I never feel like giving. and I prefer relationships that are already established. I love the workspace because i already know what to expect from and what to give to my coworkers. 

When I was young, i forced myself to socialize. To talk more. To try the things other people liked , maybe I'm judging too soon, maybe I'm just being difficult. I never wanted to socialize, I never wanted to talk. I should've listened to my gut. 

I never did drugs, I never drank alcohol, i've never bee in a relationship F24 btw. 

Thinking that what I was feeling was wrong for so long made me believe it and I spent years fighting my own self, hating myself for being the is way. No matter how much I tried to find a way , a compromise  I couldn't. But a decision I made 4 years back is my biggest regret. 

I decided, against my better judgement, to act like I never had a problem with how other people acted. 
I thought that if I didn't want to try those things, i at least shouldn't push away the people who do. I stopped expressing to people that i don't like certain behaviour even though it bothered me. I let them smoke next to me, I hated the smell. I let them drink next to me, I felt filthy after that. I let them buy illegal drugs when I was with them, I never thought I would let myself go that way. I let them talk and boast about all the unethical/illegal stuff they did and I acted like it didn't disgust me. 

I hit a new low, i realized that. I pulled myself out if that situation. but the memories hunt le. The shame of putting myself in certain situations for the sake of being accepted ?! for the sake of having a friend?! for the sake of having someone in real life , someone i could look at, not someone on the internet! I was weak, i admit that. I was so lonely and I just let myself go thinking that I'll always hold on to my principals....but I did let go and  I made mistakes. I never did something out of order, I never Hurt anyone, but I feel disgusted with myself.  
I can't let go of those memories, they're so powerful and now months later, i can still remember them clearly. How stupid was I ! They used to treat me bad , they were inconsiderate towards me at times, their actions hurt me but i didn't want to let go i thought there isn't anyone else who's willing to listen to me talking about how my day went. I know i was stupid.

My friend is busy these days. My messages are delivered but not answer only after a long while or the next day. I have no friends. I thoroughly enjoy my time alone. I dream of moving into my own home and having my own brand new car. 

I used to cry thinking that maybe I'll end up alone (i believe I'm ace). I used to stay awake thinking who'll want to be with someone that hates to be touched. I'm not affectionate. I haven't been hugged in years (a loving hug) and never once,even in my darkest moments have I wanted yo be hugged. Everytime i used yo think about this i would get depressed. 

But not now. I'm free. If i end up alone, so be it. If i found love then Great. If i meet new friends that's fine. But i'll Neve go out of my way to pull someone when I haven't been shown the same feeling. I'm not crying any more. I'm me, and i'll always be me. I'll change when i'm ready. I'll go to therapy when I can and i'll work on myself. I'm no longer afraid of the future. I no longer worry. I'll slowly letting go of bad habits.

444,Phatso4life,1616912740,1,"Honestly i feel like im just begging for someone to relate or be sympathetic, even if i deserve none. Every issue is self inflicted, and a function of my inability to connect to people.

I (25m) have always felt totally alone. From day one ive always reached out to try to relate to others, but i feel like im either just too easy to ignore or so helpless that people feel no reason to show any warmth or sympathy.
If you asked me what love is or if i had ever felt love i probably couldnt answer. Im supposed to love my family. My mother and i havent spoken in 7 years,my father and i are so different that we cant relate. My grandfather has fallen down the path of old qanon facebook addict and i just cant hold a conversation with them without it devolving into me talking idly about something i find interesting. I dont love my family. I show gratitude towards my father for putting up with my nonsense for this long but i feel so bad for putting him through a quarter century of heartache, just to be the last member of a bloodline he has worked so hard to make a meaning for. 

Im both a college and highschool dropout with no prospect of work, a spotty work history with several failed drug tests on record, living in government subsidised apartments surrounded by neighbors who scream and hollar in fits of rage in the hallways. A motherfucker got shot in the parking lot 3 weeks ago. If i fuck up and lose my housing, ive been told the only option would be to put me in a nursing facility where i couldnt have my pc, couldnt leave or use my car or motorcycle, and wouldnt be able to prepare the food i want to. 

In the past decade My health has taken a serious downturn, ive always been a big kid amongst my peers but over the past seven years ive gained 300 lbs and developed several bad habits. Its hard for me to take care of myself because of issues in my legs and several serious issues with chemical imbalance. After having a dvt 3 years ago ive been scared nearly every day of having another. 

In the past three years i have found a small community of friends online, and i cherish every second of time spent with them. They all have jobs and healthy productive lives, and then theres me who overthinks everything, cant hold a conversation without talking about myself, lashes out at others when i get my feelings hurt and it only gets worse. Its gotten to the point that when i seek sympathy from them i just get ignored or mocked, and if i react negatively it only gets worse. Ive developed feelings for one of the people in that friend group. Confusing feelings that ive explained to them but only gotten chastised for. Feelings of what i can really only describe as love. As previously mentioned, i dont really understand love and my only comprehension is that which ive seen in movies, and other media. This person knows that i have feelings but its doubtful they know the extent of them, and it hurts knowing that they‚Äôll never feel the same way. 

Ive just accepted that im too mentally unstable and too physically unfit to ever find someone that can look at me with anything bordering on compassion. Even you reading this probably have concocted an image of some sad lonely fat neckbeard angry that nobody understands his internal struggle and you would not be far from the truth. Im just an unstable self obsessed waste of biomass that hoovers up money and resources that ive never had to work for and conscious enough to recognise my own plight so i just get angry and depressed, taking it out on those closest. Only continuing the cycle. 

I dont want to be coddled or be chastised, i want some kind of solution. Can i ever get out of this rut? Im almost to the point of being too unable to exercise.

I used to talk to any girl with no fears whatsoever.

Over the years, through many heart breaks that left me feeling abandon, I've turned shy.

I can still say hi to people and carry on a casual conversation, but when it comes to speaking up about how I truly feel, I fall short. 

I've become a non-risk taker.

I flirt and try to connect with people that are already in relationships or claim to be in relationships. 

It seems that most single women are never in my path for a possible connection.

I go out but always by myself. No friends to be wings.

I go home with feelings of depression every time I go out.

I got called names , got left out , pushed arround and so on . And so 1 day i snaped and every time i got pushed or called names i fighted back and this made all even worse . The teachers supported the kids who called me names and so on and me fighting back made it all worse . So then i was completly alone , deppression and suecidal thought started at about 2nd or 3rd year of school . I started gaining waight and this made me even more unpopular.

Side note : a event that sticks to me to this day is : in first grade or second had feelings for a girl and i gave her flovers . She throw them on the ground and destroyed them with her foot .
(Second grade started doing judo )

5th grade 2016 (mass war imigration) : ( in germany when u finish 4th grade u change school for 5th grade ) In 5th grade i met my best friend who also was left out and discriminated lets call him shadi . He comes from syria and has gone through alot and he teached me alot . But all this happines was short lived . (New school was still full of discrimination and racisim . People call me names ---&gt;i fight back ---&gt; i get in trouble till year 9 of school  )

6th grade : 6th grade just started and my friend just vanished . At that time he was my only friend . I couldent belive that he is gone . For 2 weeks i have been trying to contact him with no luck , i was scared , cried and missed him a lot . 1 day he send me a texst he cant tell me where he is . This made me even more anxious i was asking my self : is he kidnaped , is he going to be alright and so on . 
After a few mohnts we got back in contact and played  a lot on the ps4 online as kids do .
Side note :in 6th grade i got put in a diffrent class and i was again alone , i felt very disconected from the other kids. I even had thought of becoming a school shooter thank god this dident happen.

Aftermath : this led me to deppression and gave me anexity .So my grades droped extremly  . Most of my grades were 6 (in America F) .i dident care about school and live . I started cutting my self and got more overwaight. And there i was all alone again . Once i tryied running in to the forest to die but my mother catched me . I started bullying others and i got bullied to , i was at my lowest.

7th grade : i got down graded and there were other kids who i felt conected to . Things were going okay and i fell i love (lets call the girl eva ) that got me back to deppression and so on . This epesode lastet a litle over a year . It was the worst were i told her that i had feelings for her and she laught at me and so on , ot hurt me becouse i did everything for her . Than there was a nother girl ( lets call her daniela) she showed all of the signs that she liked me and i just wanned to be liked and loved and through all those years i have been lonely and cold . She and the other girl played with my feelings and just used me unintentionally. 

Side note : a friend from 4th grade was in my class till 9th grade .

8th grade : My father got me a set of dumbels and started homeworking out . And so all negativity got transformed into energy .i got self motivated to inpress daniela and other girls and started lifting more seriously , my father bought a bench press and some waight .i just wanned to be liked and loved and one day she told me she loved me and 1 week later i see her i see her kissing with a close friend of mine lets call him soren .  He alredy had a girlfriend and daniela knows that too . When i saw this i got crushed . BUT this time i was stronger mentaly . He started lieing to all of his friends . He was alone and i dident want him to be a lone . I tryed my best efords but he cept hurting me so i left him . So i was alone again deppressed but not giving up . Once we had a class camp trip . Thats when i was still friends with soren . He was with daniela in a relationship.  This calls trip made me sad and confussed. He totaly ignored me and behaved to me like i was nonhuman ,he kick me with a aggresive loock with out a reson . And even wores was that he was a friend and kissing infront of me with a girl i had a crush on . 
Few mohnts pass by and we had a class trip to london . There i was the whole week feeling sad , deppressed lonely and not enjoing the week . 
After that i met a guy lets call him raphael who later on afyer everything happend i discoverd he was a psycho and used me only for money . Let me explane .i randomly met him we bekomme close friends play ps4 and so on . He was / is racist against germans ( he is german ) and becouse finaly there was some one wo also feels discriminated i trusted him long strory short , i gave him 20 ‚Ç¨ and never got them back when i asked him for the money he startes insulting me . I had beef with a rich guy so raphael changed sides only becouse of his feraris mad becouse he was allowed to drive them . He and rich guy started bullying a new student from Egypt and saying hail hitler /nazi stuff . I told them to stop or problem with me . Raphael tricked me to hit rich guy so i am fould again . Got susprndet again but this time for 1 day . Thay dident get any trouble for bullying and nazi slurs and i got all the trouble for deffending the new students and making them stop doing nazis stuff.( thay still do it and dont get in trouble )

Side note : soren wasend a best friend for me he never was he just was a close friend . We never met outside school . So for the whole time i have been feeling  lonely and disconected . Same with raphael.

Summer vacation (8th grade) : every year in summer vacation in germany is 40 days. ME and my family ( father , mother ) go to bulgaria . Visit my sister and so on m
At this summer i went to work for free at a shooting range with air powerd rifels. There worker was the same age as me (14) and we had feeling for each other .  And this dident last long . The vacatiin endet and so i was feeling alone again . But i was stronger.

9th grade : here everything changed . In the past i had so many fight becouse of the racisim and i always was the ""bad guy "" but after all that pain and suffering i learned alot and got stronger . I kept fighting and never gave up . I got stromg physicaly and mentaly . I staryed helping everyone i could , started writing only 1s and 2s ( In America A and B grades ) . I still feel lonely and deppressed but i have learned to use the negagive energy for good and to trns form it to positive energy . Now i do have a friend only one that i have his full trust lets call him muhammed i know him since first grade but we had some fight there . At 5th grade he went to a diffrent school and we got back in contact in 8th grade . We go out  but still i feel lonely and disconected . Now have lost contact with shadi for 3 mohnts now usualy we play ps4 together but yeah .
If my father never bought those dumbels it would never turn out good for me. Now  strong , good grades bench 100kg 4 times .

Conclusion : Every bad thing is for good . Every thing has a meening . Never give up . Through every lonely , deppressed  situation u get stronger . Use ur energy wisely (example if sad use negative energy for workout) .  Every dark tunel has a bright ending . Pain and sufering bilds ur charakter . No excuses. MAKE A CHANGE , JUST DO IT .

A couple of days ago, a friend of mine from high school who I hadnt seen in like a year and a half texted me saying she had news to tell me. We went to get coffee together and I was very anxious, cause I dont have many friends. 

As we were speaking, she asked me if I wanted to join her and a group of her friends to go and talk to homeless people, who mainly lost their jobs and houses due to COVID. They all ""live"" in tents in a place 10 min away from my house and we brought them soup and food and just hang with them tonight. And it was so GOOD.

I met the most amazing group of men and women, who, even though have very little, are willing to give a whole lot. And I loved every second of it. We sat down and talked to them, about their lifes, about our lifes, about places we would like to go and books we would like to read. One of them borrowed me a book and next week I will bring him another one.

Im always so lonely and have like 2 friends I hang out with. Im always sad cause I think no one likes me and I think life is unfair. But today, I understood that giving just a little bit of my time means something to someone and that is just great. I loved it with everything I had and I cant wait to go there again.",lonely,Helping Others Helps You,2021-03-28 11:12:06

\-Videogames: I mainly like retro videogames specially from nintendo my favorite console is the SNES but i love videogames in general from all companies, specially RPG and indie games, some of my all time favorite games are earthbound, pokemon platinum, zelda majora's mask, metal gear solid 3, okami, gta san andreas, silent hill 1 through 4, all final fantasy games for the PS1 among others, chrono trigger being my all time favorite, i have a 3ds so we can play mario kart, RE mercenaries, animal crossing or something.

\-Movies and series: I like all kinds of movies and tv if it's good, i specially love weird, different and unique movies like, let the right one in, under the skin, borgman, enter the void, it follows, sympathy for mr, vengeance etc... but i also like more commercial movies, i love marvel movies and shows, i love comedy movies like, the other guys, the watch, lethal weapon 4, rush hour 1 and 2, true lies, pinneapple express, scott pilgrim vs the world etc... the same goes for series, my all time favorites are rescue me and the office, i can like all kinds of genres if they are good.

Thing i don't like: i don't like sports, medieval/pirates/vikings themed stuff (though i can tolerate it if it's really good like, lord of the rings or game of thrones) ignorant people, bullies, fanboys/fangirls of any kind (i mean people who think their likes are the best and they feel they need to defend them and make everybody like them, people who can't accept other opinions), i really hate animal cruelty, i hate cars (driving and just riding in one, maybe cos of some traumas) i used to hate school, i don't like having to socialize with people i don't like or care about specially at work, loud obnoxious people and just disrespectful people in general.

I also love japanese stuff in general (though i'm not an otaku, it's ok if you are one) taking walks (specially in the evenings), playing guitar, reading novels, playing with animals, talking, working out and just trying new things, i'm not closed to anything. If you are around my age, share some interests and want to meet people let me know, i'm usually free after 6 p.m. Mexico city time and sundays most of the day, it's ok if you speak english or spanish, i consider myself a good friend but i can be kind of awkward and shy so bear with me, thanks for reading this.",lonely,I need friends,2021-03-28 10:37:02

498,Iruv88,1616887119,1,"Hi

So this is my first post in reddit. Just need to vent a bit.

I have been suffering from severe depression since I was 16 (I am now 25). I never had real friends, only people that talked to me when they need something, and I am not close to my family. After a few years of therapy, when I was about 22, I decided that I should live the life I wanted and not care about the fact of being alone. I started doing everything alone like going to the movies or out for dinner. I also decided to improve myself and become the person I wanted to be. I fulfilled my dream of visiting Canada and solo travelled there. I actually went twice. I got 100% on my thesis presentation, which was the first time ever that happened in my master's degree and I also got a job in an amazing and huge company. I am proud of myself of everything I have achieved.

 Then the pandemic came. I have been working from home for a year now and since I dont have anyone, I dont talk to anyone. When good things happen I dont have anyone to share them with, when bad things happen I don't have anyone to talk about them with. I feel myself falling in depression and despair again. I barely have the energy to get out of bed and started to have suicidal thoughts again. I am so disappointed in myself for feeling like this again. I worked so much to better myself and now I am exactly where I was 10 years ago, friendless and feeling depressed. 

Thank you guys for giving me a space to vent. Stay safe.",lonely,Just needed to vent,2021-03-28 10:18:39

I didn't have a happy school life and by consequence I have no friends now. I didn't even realize I had been bullied for years until I talked to a therapist. Apart from my family I am completely alone now.

I've seen psychologists and took medicines but that didn't do much. I've been told that I'm highly alexithymic and I can only feel upset or uneasy because of what I feel. This is also why I am extremely shy and look cold hearted, completely shutting down around people, even online.

I keep being told ""just go outside"" and ""live life, you're young, these times won't come back"", but I can't do that, it's not that simple. My family even reached the point of suggesting me to sign up on Facebook to know people, but I don't want to because that would only make me feel worse.

So, after lurking in this subreddit for a while, here I am. I don't care who it is, I just need someone... I am your average online guy with very basic interests but I can try talking about anything, either deep or not.

If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It‚Äôs also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won‚Äôt even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON‚ÄôT be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‚Äò!‚Äô as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

Late october 2020 I found someone who was born 2021 years ago His name is Jesus Christ. I know you might think it‚Äôs religious stuff but it‚Äôs not! Thats the thing that is so great He‚Äôs the only one who brings you out of religion and the paths to destruction. Before I always thought Jesus was the one who gave you beautiful cars, houses, fame and riches but I was wrong. He brings peace out of this chaotic world a peace that no one who doesn‚Äôt know Him knows. You could be on your deathbed or about to be tortured you‚Äôll still be at peace even though you‚Äôll stress or maybe have a bit of fear you‚Äôll be at peace it‚Äôs something that words can‚Äôt explain. Jesus brought me out of co-dependancy I stopped feeling the need of worldly things He even said it we are in the world but we‚Äôre not of here our treasures are above. When you feed off this world you constantly need more, you think that if you buy this thing and have this girl and have that much money you‚Äôll feel great but you won‚Äôt! You‚Äôll just keep getting things and searching for things and pleasures over and over again until you die and it‚Äôs a never ending cycle. BUT! there is a better path and it‚Äôs only Jesus Christ. Through Him we become manifested Children of God and He will provide for us and we‚Äôll have eternal life which is way way way way way better than this world. Pray this helps. All you have to do is surrender all to Him. The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead you will be saved. If you confess your sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

534,codecrunchie,1615993658,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

How it works:

Step 1. Find compatible matches

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

Step 2. Friend requests

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

Why this is awesome:

\- Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.

\- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

What are the questions:

\- more about you

\- age (you have to be 16 or older!)

\- best part of your day

\- gender

\- sexuality

\- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)

\- geographical continent

\- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend

\- type of friendship

\- whether you'd be willing to share pictures

\- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls

\- religious

\- working

\- studying

\- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs

\- whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

Okay woohoo lets do this!

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

Final tips:

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.Extra info:

\- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.

\- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+

\- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.

\- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.

\- Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.

\- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

 \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

541,Dogtoe23,1615989821,1,"I recently tried dating for the first time since being diagnosed with PTSD. I met a girl in a depression/PTSD support group who seemed to be also heavily involved in recovery from addiction and headed in the same direction as far as life trajectory. 

I am graduating from college this week after being homeless from when I was a teenager to a year ago. I started going to college while I  was still homeless and completely broke. I chose to study computers and now have a 3.9GPA, even though I had never even had my own smart phone. My point is that I am extremely motivated and that I work very hard towards my goals...

At first our common background (and supposedly similar goals) brought us together and things were amazing. I was studying computers in college and she had some computer knowledge,  so we bonded by sharing computer code that we were working  on. We also had fun doing sime of the things  neither of us had the chance to enjoy before, including eating nice food, catching up on movies, and taking our dogs to parks.
 
Then I found out she was still involved in illegal activities with some very dangerousand sick people, so it triggered my PTSD to not trust her. I had worked very hard and lost a lot of friends in order to make a clean break from the world she was still very involved in.

She was very understanding and accepting of my symptoms at first ( probably becauseshe realized her complicated life began stressing me out), even saying that my ex girlfriend's shouldbe punished for not being understanding, and things were still not so bad because she promised she was trying to change her life. 

That was until I asked for a little space to work on my college finals right before graduation and I found out what her symptoms were. The minute she thought I was pulling back, she flipped completely, accusing me of being an evil man and all sorts of other things. Where she had been very kind, caring, and talking about forever, she just quit talking completely. When I do hear something from her, she has began using the excuse that my PTSD symptoms were the reason our relationship ended. She takes absolutely no responsibility at all.

Now that some time has passed, I can see that we were both just acting out of fears that still exists from our pasts. She is still not far enough into recovery to understand how her mind works, and even though I am very conscious of my illness and have been successful even with my symptoms, I still do not have 100% control.
 
Since I am starting at a new college soon to pursue my bachelor degree, I should have never been involved with someone who was still involved in drug trafficking, yet I still can't help but wonder what went wrong and I want to avoid making the same mistake. 

Is it even possible for two people with similar mental  illnesses to coexist? I had always thought it would be ideal because the number one thing I am looking for is understanding that sometimes my symptoms are not in my control. I have met some women who say they want to do this, but none that actually can.

Besides having PTSD, I am involved in Yoga, meditation, music, and animals, plus I will have a college degree in Information technology after Friday, and a decent savings account, so it is not like I do not have anything to offer. 

I guess it could be that what matters more is what the individual symptoms of each person are and how well they are managed...or it could just be a bad idea all around for two people with mental illness to date. Would the relationship have lasted longer if she hadn't been selling drugs or if I wasn't trying to go to college?

I avoided speaking in a monotone voice like I used to. I started raising my hand more in class, hoping to not seem like the ""quiet kid"". Yet, nobody seemed to notice me, or talk to me. The only interaction with another student I had was if it we were assigned a group assignment or if someone needed a charger for their computer, and I would volunteer to have them borrow mine.

The reason it is so hard to make friends im thinking now is because everyone had already formed their friend groups, and I was just the kid that never actually had formed a close friend. 

But recently I had a glimmer of hope. One of my classes, my teacher called me after class one day, and said I needed to bring up my grades, and also participate in class more; (raising my hand, and talking more). After that day, it was hard to start doing it, because I was so used to being the quiet kid in the back, but last Friday, I broke out of my comfort zone, and read an opinion I wrote for a specific assignment. And I know it sounds weird and creepy, but another girl said she agreed with me when she was talking about her opinion, and it kind of made me happy, to know that someone acknowledged me and didn't treat me as if I didn't exist. that same day, kids who sat next to me actually talked to me, and asked me for help in an assignment, and I asked them for help too. It was nice talking to kids my age, and having them acknowledge me as a normal person. I usually think that people think I'm ugly, and weird. Most of all, I used to think people thought I was boring.

another night where i just think about my relationships in my life. and turn to reddit because i don't feel like i have any friends to vent to. or without making them feel bad.

all my friends are online -- well, maybe i have 1 or 2 friends in person, but they're male friends that just wanna date me (and i'm not being vain. ive been flirted with by them, been told theyve had crushes on me in the past and/or are interested in going out with me) and it feels weird being around them. 

i have 0 like genuine, real good friends in person. last time i had a sleep over was more than a decade ago. never in my life have i had a friend that has watched me cry in person and ive gotten to hug it out with them or something. never in my life have i had a really close in person friend. 

all my friends are online. they've always been online. some of my best relationships have been online. sometimes it doesn't feel like it enough, though. we're all adults now, so most of them are busy with their significant others (which ive never dated anyone in person either. just online.) or they have real life friends to be with or jobs or responsibilities or whatever. so most of them are busy.

none of my relationships feel meaningful. i try so hard to make friends -- online or not -- but nothing sticks, nothing clicks, i don't know how to get close with people, i don't understand it, i never have. how do people get really close so fast? why do i have to be the one to message people first? when people message me first, it's usually men, and again -- they just want to date me. it gets so tiring when a man just talks to you because hes trying to flirt with you so you'll date him. no offense to the men out there reading this but i just want a real friend not someone that just flirts with me. idk. it just annoys me. girls never message me first.  

i think the shittiest part is, if i get attached to someone -- like if i actually make a good friend i get close to, i get jealous, mad jealous, i have bad jealousy issues, because i get so terrified of losing them to someone else because i never get friends and i self destruct, basically. happened with my last amazing friendship last year. i miss them sometimes. but they hate me now. probably think i was abusive or something. maybe i was. dunno. 

and then, because i get worried about letting my jealousy slip, or bad mental health slip, i dont know how to open up to people really, i get embarrassed when i do, because i don't want them to think im a freak or weird or turn them off from me or show them my bad sides. 

i have some people i GUESS i consider friends online that i've been making lately. I've been trying to put myself into more niches, more discord servers. people know my name. i'm a common face. but it doesn't really feel like im any of their friends. not REAL friends, not close friends. like, i'll play a game with them sometimes, maybe well watch a movie sometimes, but i dont really have conversations with them or anything. maybe my standards are too high? my expectations for what a friend should be? 

i dont really have the energy to cultivate friendships. i could if someone approached me and struck up a conversation but nobody does. i just really miss having that one person that's always available and we could talk for hours -- but finding people like this is like a needle in a haystack. 

fucking sucks. people with adhd tend to be loners like this. ive been a loner my whole life and it kind of sucks. i just want friends. i do have friends. but it doesn't satisfy me. 

i've been to therapy. my last therapist kind of sucked. just listened to me vent and didn't offer any solutions.

I wish I could say that things in my childhood home have gotten better, but my stepfather and mother are somehow still together, and have never really admitted to or apologized about the hell they put my siblings and myself through...

I have wrestled quite a bit with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember (20+ years).  I had my first suicidal thoughts during early adolescence and they have been with me ever since.  I remember reaching my breaking point a few times around age 14-15, being stuck in bed crying all day and feeling paralyzed by hopelessness.  

Shortly after those episodes I turned to heavy drinking, cigarettes, and drug use (mainly weed, mushrooms, acid, ecstasy).  I remember consciously telling myself that I wasn‚Äôt going to live past 20, so I might as well live it up.  I ended up getting a girlfriend during this time who I cared for quite a bit.  I was kicked out of the house at 18, and lived with my her family for about a year.  They forced me to enroll in community college, which I did.  However the relationship soured after about a year, as my girlfriend fell into alcoholism and I found out she cheated on me.  

After I split from my ex, I pretty much threw myself full force into work and school.  Got an advanced engineering degree with almost 4.0 GPA, good jobs, etc.  I have had some good periods, mostly centered around 2 long term relationships with women that I truly loved. My first long term ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationship lasted 5 years and I took it pretty bad when it ended - moved to a different city in attempt to atart fresh about 3 years ago.  The most recent relationship of 2 years ended about 6 months ago, and I‚Äôm just tired.  I feel like something is irreparably wrong with me emotionally and socially.  Sure, I have a job, nice apartment, nice things, etc., but I have zero friends.  Even most of my family seems to care very little how I am doing.  I work from home and get little to no social interaction for days/weeks on end.  I feel like I am descending into some kind of literal hell.  I iust want to go buy a good large chunk of heroin, drive out into the woods, find a quiet, sunny spot next to a stream and get so high that I float off into nothing, and never come back.

578,electr0_mel0n,1615951749,1,"Just a heads up, this isn‚Äôt even me being suicidal or anything. But I just have to ask myself, what is this point of continuing on in this often painful existence if I continue to live a lonely existence?

You see, I‚Äôm not one of those people who happen to be situationally lonely. You know, the ones who just went through a semi-recent breakup or have had trouble finding friends ever since they moved to a new city for work. And no, I‚Äôm not trying to minimize the loneliness these sorts of people are facing either...all I‚Äôm saying is that are loneliness is not the same. Chronic loneliness is qualitatively different than circumstantial loneliness. I‚Äôm not going to go into breaking down that and why I truly believe that, but I will say it seems fairly evident to me that the two are not on equal playing ground, so to speak. 

Anyways, I happen to be one of those chronically lonely people. I‚Äôm in my early 20s now, but I‚Äôve been lonely since childhood. I‚Äôve had friends here and there, yes, but the friendships never last more than a few years, and even in those friendships it almost always feels like something is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly what is lacking, but it just feels like others are able to emotionally mesh together and relate to each other in ways that I seem unable to recreate in my own life and my own relationships. Consequently, I feel chronically socially and emotionally unfulfilled when it comes to relationships, either because a.) I have few to none at that moment or b.) the relationships I do have aren‚Äôt even fulfilling me in the ways I yearn and crave for. 

So what hope is there for me, then? I know some of you will probably roll your eyes and say that I‚Äôm too young to be feeling this way, but I honestly feel at my wit‚Äôs end. I just graduated college and have barely any lasting friendships to show for it. I‚Äôm still majorly inexperienced when it comes to romantic relationships and I feel doomed to repeat my history, to continue this half-empty life devoid of truly meaningful relationships. 

When I really sit down and reflect on this all, I feel such a deep and raw sadness emanating from my being. Especially because when I really think for myself about what the meaning of life is, I do personally feel that having meaningful relationships is at the core of what it means to feel happy and fulfilled in life. It feels so hopeless, though, that I am ever going to achieve that and so I am left to wonder what is going to change? I know it has to be me, somehow, in some way, but how? What am I doing wrong, and how can I make things better while I am still young, before I am too far deep in the narrative that there must be something fundamentally wrong with me and thus is the reason behind why I just don‚Äôt ‚Äúmesh‚Äù with others? 

I just want so desperately for my life to be different. I don‚Äôt want to be told to go ‚Äúlove myself‚Äù first or pour my energy into a career or whatever...because I‚Äôve already been doing those very things, to no avail. Well, I won‚Äôt say completely to no avail, but the above advice is what one gives to a circumstantially lonely person and shouldn‚Äôt be given to a chronically lonely person, as the chronically lonely person has likely already focused months or years of life on themselves in this way, and yet they still find they are in the same social predicament that they always find themselves in. 

I don‚Äôt know where this all leaves me to stand, though. I just know that I despise being lonely and I am so goddamn sick of each agonizing second I spend as a lonely person. It is far too much to bear. We as humans are not meant to live such solitary, isolated existences...and yet there are so many of us that are doing just that. Ultimately, I want better for myself and for all of us who struggle in this kind of way. It is an excruciating way to live.",lonely,What is the point of living if I continue to live a lonely existence?,2021-03-17 14:29:09

The fact that you are even here‚Äîan extremely impossibly complex form, a flourishing of billions of tiny cellular worlds working in tandem‚Äìmanifesting a divinely integrated being of warmth, matter, and energy reflecting and absorbing photons of light from which I create a limited representation in my mind is amazing.

I love you as though you are a part of me, beyond the reduced and understandable projection that I have labeled ‚Äúyou‚Äù and tucked away somewhere coded in a network of neurons. 

You‚Äîthe real you‚Äìare not an image or information or a set of opinions and beliefs.  You transcend definitions, labels, and understanding.  You are fleeting but eternal, valuable, organic and full, shifting, fluid and true.  You are illuminated consciousness, integrated with all that is, and rooted into my being.  You burn in me.  You breathe, you sleep, you think, you love, you hurt, and you mourn; your heart thrusts with strength and integrity, of its own accord, oxygenated cells to every fiber of your being.  Your chest rises and falls with the sun, with the moon, with mine.

Why such trouble for a mass of tissue and bone only to return to the earth?  Why this inconvenience to survival if you are not valuable beyond all measures of worth, if you are not destined for more?  Why this aesthetic, this impact, this rhythm, this impulse we share if there is nothing else? If we are separate? If we are individual?

I grieve this perpetual narrowing of you to a concept or vision that I can comprehend.  I desperately seek your forgiveness for associating you with your opinion or a momentary ideology. You are not a political party or a religion or a color or a gender or an age.  You are more. You are more.

The spark that ignited you ignited me.  We were one from the start.  Both of us thrust into a terrifying and bright world, screaming and struggling to breathe, we were naked, vulnerable, and afraid and remain so til this day.

One of my friends moved in this week too as he's in a tough spot but he's so.... emotionally distant talking to him is a major disconnect.

I'm alone. I have no one to talk to everyday. I have no one to share my interests with out of fear they'll drop me or use me again. I am a 27yo small black man who's dropped out of college with no insurance and can't do anything anymore at the moment. I don't even know if this pain us possible to get rid of....idk. I have a dog and she's the only reason I'm still alive and can't solve this problem myself because she doesn't deserve to be left to suffer. 

I just....want some company. Friendship...but I'm lost. I'm unable to drive or function like a proper person. I don't want to be alive anymore. What do I? How can I just enjoy myself and learn by myself and just be happy by myself? I don't want to be but if it's the only way to be happy and alive, I want it... but how do I even get there?..and if this physical pain never leaves would it even be worth it?

the ""partial solution"" was dont give confidence to anyone, one grade was useful but my last year in high school literally was a hell, I hated go each day to the classroom, tried to miss every day, fortunately always was a smart guy and never lost a subject, but in these moment I felt worth less than 0, I only had a friend and he betrayed me in my back and talk about me with the bullys, all the things did me a lonely guy, I overcame phychologycal problems, dopamine adictions (not drugs, not alcohol) and a hard work increase my low self steem....

611,AgnolottiGuy,1615938277,1,"So I'll preface this with I live in a beach town that has a large influx of tourists in the summer, and an exodus of residents in the winter. There's maybe 30 people in my town at this time of year. Needless to say it gets very lonely. But for three months out of the year, the island is hopping with people; when I get off work, usually around 10, I immediately hit the streets just trying to meet people. Over the years I've developed a few clusters of friends from all over the surrounding states, some of whom return year after year so its always exciting to see familiar faces. 

I met a girl maybe three or four years ago who I developed a particular affection for; just a sweet, kind person who was always willing to come surf, sit on the beach, or go out on the boat with me. Unfortunately, she's had a boyfriend for as long as I've known her. Regardless, I always kept in touch with her casually--typically chatting once a day with the occasional facetime call--and I'm not one to keep in touch with many. I'm always happy to hear about her day, what's new in her life, or any problems she's experiencing.

She lives about two hours away. It's not an ocean but it's also not right next door. I'm good friends with some guys there too. Nonetheless, maybe three months ago, her and her boyfriend split up. And trust me when I say she told me about it; I got all the crying, the anger, the disappointment, the prolonged sadness. But I was happy to help her get through it, she's helped me through a few lows in my life as well.

No more than two weeks later, she's telling me about this guy she met at a party with whom she did not want a relationship but maybe a little something on the side. I'm just sitting there like ""here we go again."" But that didn't seem to play out as a few weeks elapsed.  

So we kept chatting causally, I let some time pass, and then asked her if she wanted to hangout with my friends and me. Despite offering to drive her both ways, the answer was always along the lines of ""its too far"" ""I can't come to Jersey."" Cool I get it. It's kind of far. 

This past Friday I asked her if she wanted to get dinner in her town. Her response: ""Well maybe not dinner, but there is a party tonight if you wanna come with me. And some of your other friends will be there."" So I made the drive and picked her up at her house; it was so exciting to see her, she even gave me one of those movie esc running hugs. So we get to the party where we chatted intermittently and occasionally she'd come up to me and put an arm around me or on my waist. It was shockingly comforting, it's been so long since anybody has done something like that for me. I had no expectations of anything happening but after dropping some of our friends off at their houses she asked me to pull into a parking lot. I was a little shocked. I had no expectations for that night other than just getting to see her, but they were far exceeded when she leaned over to kiss me. It wasn't awkward afterwards. Both of us were seemingly elated. I haven't felt that way in years, and she gave that back to me. 

Two days pass and I ask her if she wants to go out to lunch; I'd been happy to make the drive. Unfortunately the answer was ""no"" but I didn't think much of it. Sadly though, she's been fading me for the last few days and in all honesty it kind of hurts. No explanation. I tried to ask her how she was just to make sure nothing was going on in her life but didn't really get a descriptive answer back. And this is the girl who I used to tell me everything about her life on a daily basis.

Well here I am. Tomorrow is her birthday. I went to the chocolatier today and picked out some of her favorite stuff. I'm contemplating whether or not to drive up there tomorrow and just pop it in her mailbox to let her know I care. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on what you think I should do, or perhaps what she may be thinking. I can't afford to lose her as a friend :(",lonely,Is it just wishful thinking?,2021-03-17 10:44:37

We talk and have been getting on so much better than before. However that time to talk is so slim between work, kids etc. Also she's using this time to explore her submissive side. 
So I guess I'm lonely in living in a small room in my mum's place. I spend evenings staring at my phone or playing PS4. I just don't understand how people make friends. How you find someone with common interests and when you do how do you click.

613,331x,1615938022,1,"(23F) i couldnt finish college due to my mental health, i left behind so many cool people. i left behind so much potential. i have no friends here in my hometown. nothing. havent had a boyfriend since i was maybe 16 in high school, its to the point where i dont consider myself a person who has had any relationships whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

my best friend abruptly ended communication with me. she left me, no reasoning, just left. then months go by, and i see that she tweeted some shit about abandoning an old friend for a new one. i was so hurt. i felt heartbroken, but i masked it with anger. this is the best friend who would do everything with me. we did everything together. im so sad i lost her. she was my best friend. and the first person in my life i felt comfortable calling my best friend. i went through shit as a teenager, and had horrible people around me who would just treat me like shit.

now im at a point with her where im full of so much resentment, even if she did contact me again, i would be resistive. she was my only friend. she left me behind knowing that i literally have no one else. i was alone. she knew this. she fucking knew it. but i still got left behind like the worthless piece of shit i guess i am. 

&amp;#x200B;

another buddy of mine recently left me with a text. we have been cool since high school. one morning, i randomly checked my phone, and at that point in time he had texted me a few minutes ago, explaining that he can no longer be my friend because it wasnt good for his mental health. and i understand, from what i know, he had some kind of feelings for me that i didn't share. i understand that being friends with someone like that can hurt. im only bothered by this because he said something like ""i dont know why you bother talking to me."" i was confused. because he knows that, once again, i have no friends. and my best friend just up and left me prior to this. 

his decision didn't hit me until i saw something silly and i wanted someone to share it with. just that sudden, ""oh.. right.""

&amp;#x200B;

i remember when i first met my (former) best friend, and we got along instantly. i remember the first time i experienced her compassion while helping me get through a rough patch. i remember thinking, ""this is what it's like to have a good friend. a real friend."" because up to that point, everyone in my life treated me like shit and left me.

now here i am, the cycle repeats, and im alone again. 

i have no one. and i feel like my social development is so lackluster, i have such bad social anxiety about interacting with anyone. a few days ago i went to trader joe's, and after talking briefly with the cashier, i felt so exhausted and anxious. my social meter was empty. and that was the only real outside interaction i had all day. talking to a fucking cashier for 5 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

i hate social media, and the role it plays in my life. im not social. nobody talks to me, and i talk to no one. i have no one. i hate seeing people i know/used to know living their lives because it just reminds me how much im *not* doing. i often think about deleting everything. getting rid of my online presence, and starting a new instagram (its mostly instagram where i follow people i (used to) know). i want it to be mostly anonymous. i just want to post my shitty art and whatever i want and not have that dumbass anxiety about ""oh what if this (irrelevant) person i went to high school with who doesnt give a shit about me sees this."" i want a space where i wont be reminded of anything or anyone. i want to forget, just as everyone has forgotten me.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my only two friends just dropped me, why ? one without reason, the other because he had feelings i didnt reciprocate (understandable). social media is also fucking annoying and i want to start an anonymous page where i can post whatever i want without anxiety. ghfjsdhfjkd",lonely,my two only friends left me. im alone. i have no one.,2021-03-17 10:40:22

I met this vegan, hippy kinda guy in September (through tinder, how else lol?) and until December I had the time of my life. 
I am 23 and since I am a loner I never had much human contact, love literally just didnt exist in my life (even my mom said I am dead to her that crazy b***h). I kinda ""discovered/admitted"" that I am gay just a few years ago and I was slowly kinda getting into this sex thing everybody talks about. But this small, energetic vegan broke every record. For the first time in my Life i felt truly happy and I felt love inside of me. We had so much fun and I spend time with his roomates aswell, they even called me a friend and I just started crying telling them how much it meant to me. 
Unfourtunately, even though it couldnt habe been better, I kinda broke down. I started seeing the same pattern of emotions I had with other people that I used to care about. So I decided to see a shrink and turns out I got borderline (it was always so obvious, just needed a name). This was the at same time everything broke apart. The guy got somekind of attack himself when I ""started to talk just like his ex"" and for a week he was mentally done. We cuddled even though he didnt seem to like it and I even asked him if I should go which he didnt want. 
Then his best friend came to pick him up back to his home (for a time off and studying) and he lit up like a supernova. He almost fled from me and we havent talked since today.
Since none of them answered my texts I decided to just go up to them and have a real talk.
They didnt let me in.
They did not want to talk with me on the phone (only the girl but she was busy).
The guy I was crazy after didnt even come down to talk with me, just a phone call. Turns out that 3 months werent enough time to think about us but it wasnt even neccessary since I got my answer anyway. 
They didnt even say it was over, none of them. They simply started to ignore me in the hopes i would never come back.
I asked them if I did something wrong to which they replied with no but didnt give me a real answer either.

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

There are about 3 girls I speak to regularly but 1 of them has a boyfriend and I speak to literally just as a friend, never met them in real life. There‚Äôs a second girl who I really liked, we spoke about meeting up but she says she hasn‚Äôt had a phone for the last week so I haven‚Äôt spoken to her either for a while. 

Then... there‚Äôs this other girl. I met her on Reddit actually. I posted in MeetPeople and got a message from a girl who lives very local, she only messaged because I‚Äôm local but that didn‚Äôt bother me anyone is better than nobody. After 2 days of texting we agreed to go for a drive together as that‚Äôs all lockdown allows for at the moment. 

I picked her up, listened to music, driving around laughing, talking about everything and just having a really good time - I felt great! However, what she did just before I dropped her home was so unexpected and I genuinely never thought it would happen to me. She asked me if I wanted a blowjob...

I said yes, of course, and she was doing it for real! Like she wasn‚Äôt joking, I wasn‚Äôt daydreaming, it was really happening. After I asked where she wanted me to finish I remembered I had a condom in my bag from a previous relationship a fair few months ago. We had sex in my car. 

No fucking way man! I was just shocked that this could happen to me, not only did I find someone who is good looking, has a really nice personality but also she wants a sexual relationship with me. 

The reason I feel so lonely is because she wouldn‚Äôt hug me when we‚Äôd finished, she seems very distanced from me emotionally and when I‚Äôm not texting her I just feel like I have nothing to do.

In my 24 years of life by far the thing I've felt the most is rejection, rejection from my family, my friends, my ""love interests"", my peers, etc.  I've struggled with low self esteem for a long part of my life because I've never received validation from the outside, I've had to learn to validate and love my self because literally no one else will, normally I'd think that's a sign that I'm a shitty person and I need to change myself but I don't think that's it anymore, for years I've been working on improving myself, I've tried to be a better person, more empathic, more loving, more outgoing and more understanding but the result is still the same: I'm still lonely ALL. THE. TIME. 

What's the point of being surrounded by people if it ultimately makes me feel worse? The only person with whose support and love I can always count on is myself so why am I even bothering trying to connect to people? 

So I have a plan, this summer I'll finish college and im going away on a backpacking trip all by myself and I'll live off the land for at least a couple of months until I decide wether I'll go back or I'll keep going. I wont say where I live or where I'm going but simply put, im going south. I'll go as far south as I can. I might come back to my hometown or not, I'll make up my mind during the trip. 

I want to, for at least one time in my life, live completely independently from everyone else and be truly free, if I'm to be alone, I rather be alone doing what I love outside of the endless contradictions of living in the civilized world.

Instead of walk past and ignore.

The quiet becomes a friend.
I talk to it sometimes.
Ask it what it likes.
And why it's beside me.

I just sit and people do
Normal things, they don't even see.
They have at least some people who
Care about them.

I'm sitting alone still.
Wondering when I'll have someone.
Someone who sees my tears,
The sadness in me, quietly hurting.

Wondering why I'm alone.
Thinking about how quiet I am.
Looking at me closing my eyes.
Put my head right in my hands.

I'm sitting and I'm wishing.
I could die right then and there.
Wishing someone would see me.

700,Throwaway039453,1615874546,1,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but in my opinion this seems to fit the bill (also sorry for it being so long)

Everyday I sit around doing nothing waiting for my friends to get online just so I can have a human interaction but during such interactions I'm filled with anxiety and really feel out of it as if I'm just taking the backseat as I panic saying whatever is on the top of my head without much thought, as so I  can prove my value of being in the conversation and then later thinking: ""Hey, wait what I said there was pretty cringe"" or ""Man, I don't really agree with something I said and I dont really know why I said it...and if I actually thought about the question for 2 seconds I could have said something I agree with"" the second part happens often (so does the first part truthfully) which makes me think I'm a compulsive liar even though it's not like I'm actively formulating a lie I kinda just say something (ofc there are times I do actively lie, But it's mostly just things I deem personal and don't want to answer truthfully...which is most things asking about myself...so thats something) 

back to the waiting all day to talk to someone: pre-covid when we were in-school (and before I met my online friend group) I would tune out all day until lunch and then tune back in when I sat by people I was vaguely acquainted with just to talk to someone, but ofc me having social anxiety I didn't really say much and then lunch would end and I would tune back out until the next time I was at lunch.   
(I could get into the tuning days out and all that But thats a completely different topic and issue) and that would be the only actual interaction I would have with people in the real world and likewise once I got home I would just scroll the internet floating around doing nothing (until I found friends on the interwebz which then now I just do the same thing except I'm just doing nothing until they get online which isnt everyday and so I'm just kinda floating around as weeks go by)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: I feel as if I treat human interaction as a drug and I'm just itching until the next dose only for me to be to anxious and out of it for when it comes and then the loop continues, I also think I'm slowly growing scared of interacting with people in the real world, but since I never really do I'm unsure if those thoughts are valid since I don't really interact with people in the real world in the first place. 

I also think me just saying things out of panic and lying without meaning to leads me to be more weird of a person than if I were just to interact like a normal person 

and ofc there is always the thought that maybe I'm blowing everything out of proportion and that I don't actually lie about things as much as I think I do and that the whole backseat thing is all in my head. It's hard to validate thoughts and feelings when you don't record the problem happening and so I just have to rely on memory and how I feel about the subject which the brain is very unreliable + I can't draw from other peoples experiences to see If I'm just over-reacting, but hey atleast my biggest issue I have is valid which is me sitting around all day burning days and weeks just for the next human interaction, which is a issue I would like to know how to resolve, because it makes my days very unproductive, weeks just fly by, and overall just makes me feel pathetic.

and another thing that strikes me odd is for me to have such a problem when I have such terrible social anxiety, It feels as if these 2 things are contradictory. On one side of the coin I desire to have a conversation on the other side of the coin I desire to hide in a hole and never speak to anyone.",lonely,I feel like im chasing human interaction day after day,2021-03-16 17:02:26

Once again, a friend of mine just turned his back on me.


I've always been there for these people, and I've always tried to improve myself for them. Yet, I find myself alone again.

My ""friends"" have ghosted me. Or they have suddenly left my life with insulting and hurtful words. Sometimes they just find another person and ignore me almost overnight.

And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll even have friends after lockdown is over either. Life isn‚Äôt too different for me before the pandemic happened. I didn‚Äôt know if that was something to be sad about. Then when I heard people reporting loneliness during the pandemic and not seeing their loved ones as much, the realization kinda sunk in and I started feeling bad for myself. To me, being alone all the time was my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. But for many others it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. And that stung a lot.

It isn‚Äôt that I don‚Äôt like people - I do. Lots of people tell me I‚Äôm sociable, pretty easy to talk to and get along with. I just never had people who really were interested in being a friend. I‚Äôd usually find myself investing in 1-sided relationships where people expected acceptance, but were never accepting back. I started isolating myself several years ago because I‚Äôve had the worst luck with relationships. Those relationships basically pushed me off the edge and brought me to close people off entirely. And I think that has to do with the type of people I unconsciously attract/attracted to and relationship dynamics I live out/repeat thanks to my upbringing and childhood. I usually got taken advantage of, scapegoated/blamed, ran through the mud in smear campaigns, triangulated and manipulated by others, and of course devalued and disposed. 

Sometimes I wonder if something is really wrong with me that puts people off. Then I take a good look at some god-awful individuals I know who are happy and living it up with their close knit social circle. So then I remember, Nah. I can be an awful person and still be loved, remembered and cared for. Even assholes can have friends. I know that no one in my life wants to be associated with me, and I don‚Äôt know why. And sometimes when I meet new people, I feel like they‚Äôre judgmental because I don‚Äôt have friends. I don‚Äôt go pouring out my sob story and the fact that I don‚Äôt have friends to them (like the way I do anonymously on Reddit). They just see that I am alone and have no friends, and by default they avoid associating themselves with me. Being recognized as a loner feels like being outcasted by society for having leprosy.

Because of all this, I‚Äôve learned to stop trusting and investing in people/relationships and just stick through everything by myself. That‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôve done my whole life.

And then there is that. Deep in my mind, I am still that 14-year old. I never really grew out. But then again I feel like I have seen so much more than the happy people. I remember how I felt before the bullying started, so I know that those who have never been through it just can't see what I have seen.

I don't really celebrate my birthdays because there's nothing to ¬®celebrate¬® but it would be nice to talk to someone during the day. You know so I can be distracted from all my problems for once-

Anyway I'm typing this because I don't really know what to do. Abusive parents rejected me the day I was born so I guess that's why affection makes me uncomfortable. People think I'm cold and that's starting to bother me. I might not know how to comfort them but I will punch whoever hurt them and listen to them vent. But at some point I started smiling nonstop and sometimes I laugh for no reason- It's a coping mechanism. It either makes me seem less mean or like a crazy person lol. 

I honestly never really received any affection though. It only gets worse though. I was raped and sexually assaulted a few times. Never had any urges and what not. The rape and sexual assaults kinda made it \*disappear\* when I was starting to have them. Never wanted to hug anyone. Never wanted to have a boyfriend. Never wanted to talk to someone about my emotions and thoughts. Tried it a few times and I never liked it.. until now.

Lately I've been wanting to talk to people about my feelings. I've wanted to talk to people about me and my problems for once. I've been wanting hugs and I just really want to be comforted. Even if it makes me uncomfortable. I've started thinking about having a relationship and experiencing my ¬®first¬® kiss that isn't linked to any trauma. I've been having the strangest urge to try all those things that used to disgust me. My head is full of flashbacks of those incidents so this is making me feel quite a lot of different emotions.

I don't know. It frightens me. This year is.. weird. I feel weird and I'm not sure what to do. I feel so.. not normal. I get that this is normal for most people. But hey I haven't had any thoughts about it since I was 11 years old. My plan for the past few years was to live a comfortable life. Basically alone in a small apartment with a dog or two. No people.. so no forced hugs, emotional conversations and drama. No need to keep masking myself around other people and no more uneasy laughter etc.

Suddenly, I can't imagine being alone for so long. I really want something real this time. I'm not sure what that means because I haven't experienced it.

So, she stopped talking  after 2 weeks saying, 'she couldn't take it anymore.' I understood her and just didn't text her back.

We shared every interest, even our music choices were same(Music really means something to me). She also texted back, and that made me happy thinking that atleast someone is out there who is willing to talk to me, who is interested in talking to me. We were texting 24 hrs. And I even made her show me her goofy side. She told me her secrets she had not told anyone yet. I was casually talking to her, and don't know how I somehow insulted her, got rude. And she just left. She left saying, 'you're too unstable, and project too much negativity which is bad for my mental health.' I had apologized but it didn't work. She just left.

777,Atlas756,1615813535,1,"I (M/30) started using dating apps again after my last relationship ended in fall. She was a nice girl but in the end we had not enough in common and she moved to a different country. Due to covid and lockdown in my country I did not try to date anyone in fall/winter. This was already a though time as I'm sitting all day at home since I'm working remote from my home. It's also not possible to meet friends, do sports (gym, sports club etc.) or meet new people. So getting out of a relationship just before the lockdown started was not the best timing. On the other hand I did not worry about finding a new girlfriend as I had a good excuse not trying to find a date which was one less stress factor for that time. 

Now I started using dating apps again as winter is about to end and restrictions will probably get reduced in the next weeks/months. So far it's making me feel quite depressed though. I'm kind of an average looking guy with a slim figure (70kg at 181cm) but I'm doing some fitness at home so I'm not skinny. One issue I have with with dating is that I kind of have a specific taste. 

With that I don't mean that I'm just liking the most beautiful women. I like women with a slim figure (I have a slim figure myself) for example whom I have also dated in the past (not exclusively). So as an average looking guy you don't get too many likes and by limiting myself regarding potential dates this makes it more difficult. In the past it seemed that I had more success with Asians as my looks probably match the Asian beauty standards (slim body types, more feminine overall look) more as the western ones (where muscles and a manly face are more important). Due to covid the number of Expats and foreign students has probably reduced significantly which makes it more difficult overall. 

Currently I'm thinking I should not take it too serious. I'm not someone that is not able to live without a relationship. I did that for most of my life and to some extent I like the freedom of doing what I want and how I want it. Despite this fact thinking about dating and how to find a new partner makes me feel desperate and lonely. 

This feeling gets stronger by seeing how most dating apps don't really work in a way I like it. I used OkCupid in the past where I really liked the possibilities to describe yourself more in detail and not putting all focus on just the pictures. It was also possible to search for other people depending on specific characteristics and not just by swiping right or left. What seemed to help me quite a bit was also the possibility to write a message first to someone to get their attention. I did not get many likes from swiping but the reply rate on my messages was quite good. I met a few people, with some of them several times and with one girl I got into a relationship in the end. So overall my dating experience was not bad. 

But if I take a look at dating apps now and OkCupid it looks a lot worse. OkCupid itself had some changes last year. You can barely search for people by characteristics any more. The last online search information is no longer available so you don't really know if that person is still active or not. The number of likes you can give and write someone are very limited per day in the free version. Overall the site I used the most last time has lost a lot of its benefits for me. Other apps like Tinder, Badoo focus a lot more on just the picture and the possibility to message them first is limited or not available. So the way I managed to get dates is very limited in several apps. 

These factors make me feel quite unhappy and I can't really take it as easy as it should be. Overall I think I have enough self confidence. In my past dates I had no issues regarding small talk or being nervous. I did not take a first meeting too serious. Even after writing to someone you just don't know if you are on the same level or not until you meet. So having a date when I know they are interested in me and my looks is not an issue. I do lack self confidence though regarding flirting/initiating contact with someone in real life where I don't know if that person is interested in dating at all and in dating me. So just going outside after covid, meeting new people and try to find dates there is not something I'm comfortable with. That brings me back to online dating and the feeling of despair and loneliness due to the uncertainty. 

It's a long text and I don't have any specific questions. I just wanted to express my feelings here and maybe get some feedback from you and how you feel about this yourself and how you handle these issues.",lonely,Dating Apps make me feel desperate and lonely,2021-03-16 00:05:35

My friends and cousins always say that I'm ""lucky"" because I don't have an annoying sibling and I'm, basically, spoiled by my parents. Although it has its advantages, there is one down part of being an only child and that is being lonely. Loneliness is your companion, your best friend. From someone's point of view you are are considered ""lucky"" but in reality its a sad life. You don't have a sibling that can relate with you. If you have a problem, you turn to them for help. Or just knowing the fact that you have a sibling to bother. I look at my friends and although they complain about their siblings, I can see that if something happens they always rely on their siblings help. People say 'you have everything, why are you complaining?'. And I'm pretty sure you might be thinking about that too. But here's the difference; money can never replace the feeling of being loved. You might attract people with materialistic things and feel loved and call it a day, but in the back of your mind you will constantly  ask yourself 'is it truly love?'.

It might seem that I dont appreciate my parents love which I do, a lot actually. But I feel like your parent's company is different. I will always have them and I can trust them with anything but I believe/feel  its not the same as a sibling. I've seen my parents talk to their siblings. And when something happens to their parents, they can rely on their siblings to help them out. When I'm older and something happens to my parents. Who do I call and say 'hey have you seen mom?' or 'hey can you help me with mom's (something)?'"". No one.

Although my loneliness is inevitable. Its coming to terms with it,  which I have. Its just finding a way to make it less painful. So I brought I cat three years ago and she has been the best thing to happen to me. At first, I saw her as a regular animal like any animal we owned. just a regular cat who slept during the day and seem unbothered. Of course I loved her and care for her over the course of the year. She even moved in from the living room to my room. We started to get close and anywhere I was she was. If I was in the bathroom, she would be waiting for me outside the door. She would sleep with me, eat when I would eat, everything. Until now I am noticing the love I have for her and I can feel her love for me.

We all know this is not the place where fun things happen. We come here, because we can relate to the feelings people describe here.  


I read lots of posts here from people that are very depressed because they are in their early 20's and have never had someone. Well,  I am 38 and I never had someone. The first time in my life I knew what feeling of  ""being in love"" feels like was 2 years ago. Saying it changed my life is an understatement. The day I told her was the most important day in my life. To that day I was doing well in life, I never felt this kind of heartache that I now feel constantly for over 2 years.  
She was a colleague and we worked together a lot. I wanted to quit my job asap, working together became impossible, I was literally dying inside. She and some other colleagues also weren't showing respect. I left my job to become a web-developer, a thing that was a hobby in the past. Turns out it's not a hobby anymore, I lost all of my interests. 

So, 2,5 years later after falling in love for the first ever I still cry almost every day, have no job and no future.   
The 3 months I was in love - before finding out the feeling wasn't mutual - was without a doubt the best time of my life. People don't understand me when I say that I want to forget everything in life but her. She is the best thing that ever happened to me, and to this day I can't/won't let go.

I don't see a future for myself where I can be happy without her. I feel really lonely, I really do, but also even when this covid-thing is gone life won't be better for me. I do have friends, but I rarely see them, because I can't cope with the so called ""I understand you"", because they don't.   
When you fall in love for the first time at the age of 36, believe me that ""nothing else matters"" in life. My friends(who are all settled, with wife and kids) tell me I'm glorifying her, which is probably true, but also, off ""ALL"" the people I've met in life, she is the one that gave me a feeling nobody else did before. She was the one that took away the feeling of loneliness so, can you blame me, for it?  I'm quite sure anyone would do exactly the same thing as I do. 

I do have friends, but having friends and still being lonely is possible. When I see them ,  we are having fun, but when I go home my world collapses on me. When I'm home time just stops. Although I also feel bad at home, the coming home after being with friends feels worse.   


also, in the last 2 years I've seen 4 psychologists, so far with no success in finding a purpose in life or finding  a way to to deal with my heartache.",lonely,"help me, please",2021-03-15 20:34:28

804,anymous12345678,1615793871,1,"I think the last time I had a real, close friend was in grade school. Throughout grade school I had a few friends and one best friend, but that was the last and only time I felt a sense of belonging. I feel like I have been overlooked my whole life. I have always been the second choice or the backup to people. I feel like no one ever enjoys my company/likes me as much as I like them. Basically my life has just been filled with lots of unreciprocated love. I have always been a very socially awkward person, and it is really, really hard for me to open up to me and be myself around people. In high school, I had one really close friend but she transferred to a different school after sophomore year and we lost touch. For the last two years of high school, then, I joined this group of friends who were already really close, so I never really felt included or connected to anyone in the group and I was always the outsider/loner, only hanging out with these people at lunch and during school assemblies so I didn't have to go alone. In high school I would literally make sure to pack my lunches strategically so that I would have enough food to distract me from having to talk. If I ate to fast and finished my lunch before the lunch period was over, I would just sit in silence awkwardly at the table surrounded by these people who were alll talking to each other but not me. So basically high school was awful. In college, I was able to make two really good friends my freshman year, but I transferred to a different college seater my freshman year because I had really, really bad anxiety and couldn't handle being away from my family. I have no friends at my new school, because everyone already kind of had their groups by the time I got there. When I say that I literally don't have a single friend at this school, I mean that. 

I don't know what is wrong with me, but there are times where I am hanging out with people and I want so badly to contribute to the conversation and know exactly what I want to say, but there is this mental block that prevents me from saying anything. Like no matter how much I want to talk and open up, I just can't. I think the only people I have ever been truly comfortable around and have been able to be myself around are my family members. I have 3 siblings and we are all pretty close in age, so we are pretty close and hang out together a lot. I am also really close with my parents, so it is nice that I do have some people who I can't be myself around. However, I know that everyone else in my family will move on and find their people and eventually we won't be each others' priorities anymore, and I am worried about what that means for me because I have no one besides them. Literally no one. I have never had a boyfriend or even been in a talking stage. I've never even really talked to a guy before. I am just so ridiculously shy and awkward that It seems like it is impossible for me to open up and be myself around others. It always just feels so forced; it never feels naturally, no matter whether I am trying to form a friendship of a relationship. It just makes me sad because I really like myself and who I am by myself. I feel like I am a really cool person with a lot to offer, but I can't seem to overcome this block and form relationships/connections with anyone. I worry that I will be alone forever. I can't handle the thought of going through life with no friends and no significant other.

I feel absolutely pathetic. I‚Äôm so pathetic actually. I‚Äôm on my bathroom floor at 130 in the morning crying because of a man who used me.

820,TemporaryAdvanced,1615786408,1,"A few months ago, I started going to therapy after falling for a girl who didn't feel the same way about me and we weren't talking anymore. Without going into many details, after a couple of months of talking and building our ""friendship"", at some point she just stopped and I realized that, despite my pain, it's probably for the best. So things just kind of slowly fizzled out.

Of course, I went through a few weeks of mental pain before finally resorting to therapy. I just wanted to know if I can be ""fixed"". I knew therapy wasn't going to magically fix me in like a week or something, but after weeks of crying, suicidal thoughts, and so on... it was all I had. 

I went to a therapist who, after the first session, didn't really seem to work for me. After that, I went to another one who seemed better so I stuck with him. Week, after week, after week, going through my sessions, taking my medication, despite some minor side effects that stopped after a week or two. The sessions somewhat slowed as I started getting better and I didn't feel like I needed them as much as I used to. Of course, I still took my meds. I took them for around 6 months.

During one of the sessions, the therapist figured I started getting better so he started lowering my dosage. After the sessions and meds completely stopped about a week ago, I don't know if it's a placebo thing or what, but I started getting worse and feeling lonely again. For lack of both friendships and relationships.

I'll say this: I'm definitely not doing as bad as I used to before I went to therapy. But I can't shake the feeling that I'll slowly get worse and before I know it, I'm back to square one. I just can't help but feel like there isn't much I can do about my circumstances so I just kind of want to accept it. Especially at my age (20) when most people have relationships or at the very least some friends, or even one good friend, that they can count on.

i don't even think i'm depressed - i think i'm lacking in community and socializing. i don't feel part of anything. i feel like a ghost that lives vicariously through others that i see online. i have a million interests too which you think would help me, but it makes it harder to talk to people because i don't have a favorite hobby or interest. 

i'm getting older now and i'm starting to wonder if it'll ever get better for me. my only dream is to belong somewhere. maybe belonging to one person would be enough if i were their partner. idk if i could even manage to make one person happy.. cats make people happy and i am kind of like a cat - i'm chill and curious about everything and want cuddles every now and then. that's all i could offer.

this is going to sound silly, but my hope is that one day my mind can be uploaded to the cloud so i can live there forever with others who are similar to me and we won't have to worry about anything anymore - no food no money no fears. we'd be free and have eachother",lonely,anyone else lonely but can't get along with most people?,2021-03-15 15:51:47

I'm 24, Male, college graduate, entry level but stable job, good family, some friends, socially adept, but I constantly feel an aching loneliness when I'm awake.

I'm lonely in the sense that I've only had a handful of hookups in college and never been ""in love"" with someone, and its honestly really starting to affect me. I've struggled with this sort of feeling for nearly a decade and I'm not sure how to solve it. I've tried dating apps, (which are just horrible, seriously, just delete them) but otherwise I work a ton and don't really know how to meet potential partners IRL regardless. I really feel like my student debt is what's keeping me going as far as motivation and purpose right now and after I solve that I dont know what I'll do. I think about ""it"" but could never do that because of the religious consequences and the sadness it would bring to those who know me.

What's worse is that I've fallen for my best friend and I'm terrified to say anything in case I ruin one of my longest friendships. I don't have a bad life, I have a good life, but I want to love someone and start a family more than anything in the world.",lonely,Laying it out,2021-03-15 14:59:10

838,Fabulous-Advantage,1615778994,1,"In college, the day is a haze. Always on my computer since I always have an assignment and my brain is very foggy but I'm getting through my degree and I'm just forcing myself to keep on writing something down, to get something out before I start to spiral into hopelessness. 

The anxiety is getting worse and the insecurities are getting worse. My mind is so foggy, I draw my awareness to my surroundings and it is painful to focus for long. I'm very shaky and on edge, finding empty buildings to work in, hearing voices in the distance makes me feel painful emotions. Can't even speak with anyone, I'm about to cry, my voice sounds like I'm about to cry. I just stand there and stare in the distance. I haven't had a friend in college for maybe 2 years, a bunch of acquaintances here and there. I wandered the place alone, always avoiding. I'll be walking and I bump into someone around the corner and I'll be all shaky and I whisper a 'sorry' while the confident person says 'excuse me' in a loud normal voice. I still need to eat and those are the times I'm forced into a social environment, where I have to navigate around others and speak to get my food. I have to work up the courage and I have not shared a meal in a long time. 

If I'm not trying to study for an exam, then I'm applying for work, or I'm walking around, finding new locations, trying to reset my brain. I can socialize online every now and then but I find the right time otherwise I sit there in blankness. If I don't keep working, I'll fail, as I have experience with. 

I'm in therapy and I almost cancelled it, it would be at night and I would get some insight that therapy isn't going to work and want to cancel, but then I don't. But just watching all the people around me, with friends or in groups, I don't understand how I can enter something like that. Now I'm comfortable just being there staring into the distance. This doesn't help though. I don't really try to talk that much. I had my forced 'how are you's' etc and maybe they respond with aww since I'm about to cry. But yeah I had a quote 'at the end of your feelings is nothing, but at the end of every principle is a promise' so I just bottle up the throbbing emotions and keep doing. The next task, just do it, the next task. And it gets me through things. But then I hit these setbacks, questions about my future, my job which is rapidly coming up in weeks and months. The last half year was an empty blur, and more beyond that, spent in isolation. And I can't figure it out as I sit there, and it isn't something I can just do without thinking. Time keeps ticking while I sit and no one will reach a hand and no one will find me. So I get the next assignment, but the more important one I put aside weighs at me, in the back of my mind.",lonely,The whole day is a haze,2021-03-15 14:29:54

I've been lonely basically all my life. Even when in group situations and having a good time I still had that sense of loneliness. I'm completely alone recently, no friends, no family, no communication. But I don't feel anything. I'm not sad, in fact I'd say I'm happy most of the time. I enjoy myself and smile a lot, even though I'm alone. I'm completely content with this life. And I've felt like this for a few years now. But the thing is, I don't know if I'm depressed. If I told you I already have my suicide planned out once certain inevitable conditions are met, and I said this with a smile on my face, does that mean I'm depressed? I remember telling someone more about myself and they said I'm depressed. Really? I am completely ok with this plan and happy that I have this plan. I don't necessarily feel lonely anymore, but instead I feel alone. Big difference. And I'm happy to die alone. I'm not sure if you'll understand, I only found out this subreddit exists a few hours ago but surely this is where I'll find someone who feels similar to me? 

A lot of posts here are so negative.. so sad, but for me being alone is a positive. Yes, I do want love and everything a human normally wants but I dont feel like crying over it. It's like... Getting to choose a red or  green pen in a situation you need a pen to write something. My favourite colour is green and so I'd want the green pen. But then someone takes it before I could get it. Now I have to take the red one. Oh well. That's how I feel about love and affection. If I knew about this subreddit in the past I'd probably be part of this super negative wave talking about hating my life blah blah back in the day I'd hug my pillow and cry myself to sleep whilst imagining the pillow was my girlfriend everyday. And if you're wondering no I didn't fuck my pillow. That got old, so I created a mother who would hug me when I felt lonely (really it was just me hugging myself) honestly still works for me but I never need to do it anymore. I feel better alone. Connecting with someone is weird. 9/10 times I end up hating the person I get closer with. Oh man especially online ""friends"" god I seriously hate people online. Even people reading this, I don't want to be friends. Don't try be friends with.me.please.

889,chairman_meow123,1615748424,1,"Hi everyone just wanted to share my story with the community. 

Around sophomore year in college I really struggled with depression. I started closing myself up to people and not everyone around me could understand what was going on.. that led me to being really isolated and lonely. I tried to make myself feel better by telling myself I dont need other people in my life to be happy. I started focusing on my career, networked really hard and eventually landed a job on wall st post grad. Initially this achievement did make me feel better but after a while i realized the gaping hole in my life because i didnt have any close friends. No amount of money or career achievement could fill that hole. 

It is honestly quite surprising that at a city like NYC, it only makes you feel more alone. I've tried dating apps to meet people but those meet ups never turned into anything more than a one night stand. Those connections are almost like addictive fast food, you crave it you get it immediately and then it leaves you feeling worse the next day. So I started doing some research on the topic of loneliness and found out that 1 in 5 millennials claims to have no friends at all. We are NOT alone in feeling lonely! 

My story and stories of all of you guys prompted me to really dig deep into the problem. The current social infrastructure is so centered on meaningless connections (instagram, tinder, bumble...etc) and the social anxiety and stigma around loneliness have completely been ignored and unaddressed. Determined to solve this issue, I recently re-pivoted my life and started working on a social platform to really help people re-build a sense of community, find their niche and find people who want to connect because of who they are as people. My project helped me reach out to so many people and now I am determined to help others do the same. 

Anyways sorry for the rambling, I just wanted to share my little story and thanks for tuning in. I hope 2021 will be a new and better chapter for everyone here :)",lonely,My story,2021-03-15 06:00:24

The sound of silence engulfing my room 24/7. I'm so accustomed to the sound of my own heartbeat and the harrowing nothingness that seems to be the norm.

I didn't even realize how lonely I was until I realized I couldn't even recall the last time I spoke to anyone other than my parents. My life consists of watching YouTube and wondering what it would be like to have a friend group to share interests with.

Maybe this is just who I am. Maybe I am just a lone wolf and maybe that's okay. But I can't help but feel alone when nobody shares my interests. I'd love to just... Play a video game with a mate, share music with someone, start a band, do anything social. It sucks not being able to share your passion with anyone.

Will I always be lonely? Is there more to life then this or is everybody a little lonely on the inside? Every day feels the same, just me alone in my thoughts and no way to express them. I'm incompetent socially, it feels like theres no hope or point in trying, I'll just prove to the world how useless and hopeless I am.

894,codecrunchie,1615745802,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

My ex (LDR) used to tell me in detail about how she felt about things and stories. Whenever I tried to talk about something (to her), 2 things would happen:

1. She would try to provide a solution or something rather than just listen. I know its not a bad thing and I know she cared and all but sometimes I just wanted her to listen :/ I would not get to finish what I wanted to say and would end up listening to her again till the end of the conversation. I tried telling her this one time and we fought :(


2. I would start crying or forget what I wanted to say. I feel like this happens because I never spoke about my feelings/things going on in my head and when I do, I'm unable to. maybe because it's just overwhelming to say it out loud?


Now, whenever I do end up talking for a long time (relatively) to my siblings/mom, I feel so so so weird. I feel like no one is listening/cares (and it has happened before) and I feel dumb. 

I dont know. I can type out what I want to say (mostly) and all, but I want to be able to verbally communicate. And having no friends doesn't make it easier. 

Since our relationship was LDR, talking in person is something I want to do but it also scares me. I rarely talk to people (im awkward, shy, etc)

I'm turning 28 this year. I've never had a girlfriend. Everyone I ever trust enough to let myself get close to just uses me for attention as a convenience until they find someone they actually want to be with. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to keep living like this. 

I have days where I feel so physically alone and starved for touch that my body literally aches and I get the urge to hurt myself (Not that I do, but the urge is there). 

When I was 15 I had a girl tell me that she ""didn't want me. Nobody ever will."" and that I'd ""be better off dead."" When I tried to ask my mother about seeing a therapist a year later due to depression/suicidal thoughts she laughed in my face and told me that men don't get depressed. 

Almost 12 years after that girl said those things to me.. Every day it gets harder and harder not to believe it. 

I have to have hope because without hope and without determination, I've got nothing. But it's hard to want to keep fighting when it feels like everyone you ever trust just twists that knife deeper into a rotting, festering wound in your heart. 

My friends just all tell me that I need to get laid but I don't even care about sex like that. Like sure, sex is cool I guess, but my two experiences with sexual contact have taught me that unless I feel close to and safe with the person, nothing is gonna happen.

That's 5 years ago. And I Still feel damn lonely.
I had to change when I went in. From a calm rational thinking dude to well. The complete opposite.
""Normal life"" just seems so damn strange to me. Can't get it to work. 
My brain knows what to do and think, but the feelings/ brain chemistry just won't do what they are told to do. 
Working out is absolutely perfect. But can only do so much when you don't feel connected to people.
Humans are social creatures. 
But I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling lonely in group settings.
Even in prison. It was difficult. 
Was mandatory for a court psychologist to examin me. 
The report came out as I had ASPD( Anti social personal disorder.) Don't know how seriously I should take that.
I'm at the end of my robe where I'm thinking..Screw human kind..I'll just be me.
Of cause. That is not very logical.
I've been through hell. Now it just feels like I'm in an empty void. Been feeling like that for the last 5 years since I came out of prison.

Point being is. I feel better after writing all of this. 
But I will surely be back in my empty void in 5 min.

920,leviOsa_,1615725331,1,"I moved out of my parents place a month ago. And I love it. For the most part.

Recently, now that the novelty of it all has worn off, I've found myself struggling to sleep. Fitful six hour periods; moving about, kicking off blankets then piling them back on, changing playlists and types of lighting. The part of me that's in denial would like to think that it's simply changing from a double bed to a single that's messing up my sleep routine.

If that were true I wouldn't be on this subreddit.

Before moving out, my dog used to sleep on my bed. A small mutt of a thing, he liked to hog the bed and snore in my ear. On rough nights, I'd bury my face in his back and sleep like a rock. It's without him, without another living being to find comfort in - even if it's just a dog - that has had me understand how touch starved I've been.

922,LostInBooksS,1615721225,1,"And when I say I'm the loner I really am the loner. I'm the only one in my school who has no friends. There was this other girl but she left and now I'm the only one who doesn't have any kind of friends. I'm going to graduate next year, 6 months later than I should. I chose to take extra 6 months so my parents don't wonder where all my friends are when they come to my graduation. I have lied to them I have made up a few people I say I hang out with but I think they know they don't even exist.

I have cried in the school bathroom many many times. I cry myself to sleep at night just because I hate myself so much and I'm scared of going to school. I can barely eat anything because I know I have to speak in front of the class in two weeks. Tomorrow I'm going to have to do a group project with a few people. They probably hate me. 

In the classes I always hope that someone would sit next to me but no one ever does. I'm always the only person sitting alone. When we have to do group projects the teacher has to find me a group. If I know I'm going to have to talk to someone in class I don't go to school. When the teacher tells us to find a partner why heart starts beating very fast. I often get paired up with the teacher. 

I won't be able to make friends after high school. I have developed a bad social anxiety. I can't talk to people, not even online. I have tried to make online friends but I can't. And it's not like talking to people makes me a little uncomfortable. It makes me so anxious that I delete my account whenever someone messages me online. If someone comments my post I often delete it. I know it's just high school but because of my bad high school experience and being outcasted by other students, I'm not able to make friends anymore.

I hate it when people tell me to just talk to people. You have no idea how many times I tried and how many reddit accounts I have had just because anyone says hi to me makes me so anxious that I have to delete my account as fast as possible. I have an online friend who I don't even talk to much because I'm scared of him.

A few times someone has tried to talk to me but then they realized how bad I'm at talking to people and started avoiding me. But I'll always remember everyone that said hi to me or smiled to me or sat with me at lunch even though I barely said anything to them the whole time. I'll always remember the girl who held the door open for me and smiled and the exchange student who sat next to me in math class.

But I'll hate myself and other people the rest of my life. I hate others because they have friends. I hate to listen how they make plans with their friends.

925,Jessency,1615719944,1,"Apologies for the long post. I'm honestly a man of many words. Here's a TLDR however.

TLDR: I'm the kind who is open-minded and sincere with the way I live, but sadly the world isn't made for that.

With all modesty, I am a very sincere person in a cynical world. Nearly everyone's always out for something, in for something and would do anything for what they want and like.

I honestly tried understanding the world but I just can't keep up. I'm different from everyone else, I don't follow the rules of society and if I describe with a quote it would be ""I reject your reality and substitute my own."" - Adam Savage. 

When other people chase trends, I sit in my room enjoying what I already have. When other people try hard to get good at what they do, I just take things slow and improve over time. When others seek revenge, I seek forgiveness. When others hate, I love. When other people choose their friends based on interests, I open mindedly open up to anyone regardless of hobbies. You get the point by now.

I could honestly just not care about what others think but it's to keep doing that when the world isn't do encouraging. People always expect the worse out of others. To them, altruism is a fairytale and no one is like that. Well news flash, I am, and you would see that if you give the time to understand.

I've been in many hard spots and lost friendships simply because I don't follow the conventions of the world. 

One example would be a friend of mine (well, ex-gf actually) who in her pursuit to fit in with a certain game community and etc. started to become toxic and I suspect could be the general toxicity of the internet rubbing off on her. I tried what I could, I talked to mutual friends and ""enemies"" (who apparently are actually decent people who just got on her bad side). She took it the worng way and called me a manipulating traitor and believed I was trying to ruin her rather than fix her unbeknownst toxicity.

It's really hypocritical. Society loves to uphold inspirational messages like ""Be yourself"" or ""Do your best"" but when you actually do it the same society would reject you. Everyday I just wish that the world of was at least kinder but a guy can dream. Despite that, I'm still holding on, hoping that I can get my break. Hence my favorite word ""Wildheart"" which means ""someone who keeps hoping and loving desipte all the hardships""",lonely,It's hard for to connect with world when you don't follow the rules of society.,2021-03-14 22:05:44

People tell me it's my circumstances, and that I have been just extremely unlucky, which honestly doesn't make me feel better, it just shows how we are extremely cruel creatures who don't give a shit about eachother, letting the weak ones to rot away.

I try to blame it on myself, as I am extremely self-hateful, but most people I talk to (the good ones) have a completely different view of me, but honestly that's the only semi-satisfactory explanation, I don't want to accept people as cruel, and k want to have a good reason to explain this other than just my circumstances and luck, fuck, so many people who have almost as shitty lives as me have just fine social lives, or at least ones much better than mine, which actually isn't saying much haha...

Why haven't I met anyone I could talk about with various of subjects, philosophy about life. No one seems to have the same interests as I do. Maybe it's because I don't play games?

But life happens, and things change. Some of my friends got married and had kids. Some of them moved away to start jobs in new cities. (Myself included.) Some of them were of the opposite sex‚Äîguys who ended up having feelings for me that I didn‚Äôt reciprocate, and then there was a guy who I ended up having feelings for that he didn‚Äôt reciprocate. (We stayed really close friends for a couple years though until he got a girlfriend and almost immediately fell out of touch.)

So unfortunately a lot of the most fun, intense, and fulfilling friendships I‚Äôve had over the years have faded away almost entirely outside of a friendly check in every few months, or a passing comment on social media. 

What I‚Äôm left with are friends who I‚Äôm in frequent contact with‚Äîbut who don‚Äôt really bring out the best in me, or the truest part of me. I tend to get along best with warm, kind, fun-loving people. But most of my current friends are on the colder, snarky side.

I helped this girl get out of a really shitty situation, my parents even took her in as their own, but she never really cared. She used me and my family to provide her with stability before we gave her the boot. I felt so go damn used. Her situation before I got her out of it already put me through mental trauma thinking I could've prevented it. I never got closer or any help from her, it was always me to her. And after we broke off it got better for a short amount of time. After about half a year I tried going for a girl that I knew for a while and my ex knew her too. I building a relationship with her only for it to come crashing down by my ex. A few days before I was going to ask her my ex came a told me she hook her up with another guy already and they hit it off. My heart was crushed and even more so because my ex did it. I'm happy for the girl who I was trying to go for but it still hurt. My mental stability went even more downhill than it already was. Another chick kinda clicked with me and I helped her get out of a toxic relationship... for a bit anyway. She used me as a punching bag and just went right back to him.

He figured out that I was fat when I was prying a little into his life to try to know him a little at work when we ended up working closely when we usually don‚Äôt.  He was my eye candy.  You know the type.  Nice to look at and if you had the chance would get to know but you don‚Äôt really have a crush on them.  Mostly because a guy broke my heart previously so I wasn‚Äôt really able to feel much or have crushes the same way I used to when I was in high school.  This was in December.

Things happen and it seems like he is into me.  So we start eye fucking each other.  But he gets sad because he wants more but I am afraid to talk to the guy because I feel helpless when it comes to talking to guys.  They‚Äôve always felt out of reach.  Always straight. Never for me or something I could have.  Not to mention that with my ex I told him I loved him so I could stop crushing on the guy. Bad move.  It screwed me up.

So February comes around and I give him a Valentine‚Äôs Day card.  And we occasionally keep eye fucking.  Suddenly it‚Äôs too late.  He starts looking away.  He is probably bored.  He starts putting his jacket/sweater on a hook far from my stuff.  I knew it was over.  And I knew I didn‚Äôt get a chance to talk to him.  So I got up the nerve to ask him if I could get to know him.  He said no and I grieved.  I grieved all the fantasies of telling him my shit and the kiss, sex, etc.  

at home, I realized that when he lingered close that when he lingered close, despite knowing that he wanted nothing to do with me, that I felt hurt that he was there.  The wound was still fresh.  It hurt because he was close and yet we were never going to be anything to each other.  And it hurt to look at him because I felt happy when I did.  Briefly.  But I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last.  I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be anything.  I took something that I thought was guaranteed and screwed it up by waiting for too long.

But as I said.  I grieved even though every once in a while I think of doing something that would lead to even the slightest of connections.  I wish I could stop thinking about him.  and at the same time I feel rather empty.  Not to mention that I keep thinking that things don‚Äôt matter.  Before I was questioning whether or not things mattered but now I think nothing matters.  So I lay in the shower and I‚Äôm bed doing nothing.  Just thinking.

She keeps texting and talking on call to her boyfriend 24/7 now and only sends me one single message maybe every 2 days. I respect it fully of course but the reason why it makes me so down is, after my breakup with my own girlfriend, she was a good friend I was always able to talk to 24/7. I developed a really good friendship with her and I don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to, be it in real life (except family) or online. I already tried telling her how I feel but she got kinda angry at me and made me feel even worse.

Im not sure what I‚Äôm expecting writing this post, maybe someone to talk to or maybe someone can give me advice on what to do, I already suffer from depression and emotional problems and now my best and only friend not really wanting to talk to me anymore makes everything so much worse.

He enjoys video games and would love to have someone to discuss them with, his most commonly played game is League of Legends and pokemon. He is also a fan of anime, traveling, MTG.

996,nightwalkee,1615676883,0,"I used to be extraverted. I used to be able to talk to anyone, be they a celebrity or a homeless person, I treated everyone equally, with respect. I remember at a convention once. We had a party, security came and asked us to tone it down. I bribed them with a smile and a drink and did the same when the cheif of security came and we partied til dawn. 
Now, I spend most of my days in my apartment, hardly talking to anyone anymore. Hardly invite friends over. 

I've give up on most communities, gaming, roleplay, conventions in general. 

All because I'm afraid to open my mouth. I simply don't know what offends people any more. Just for not going along with the political narrative, wich I try to get away from by immersing myself in hobbies. 

If I play doom I'm a male chauvinist who hates women.
Likewise If I point out that I didn't like Cpt Marvel, but loved Sigoney Weaver in Alien.
If I like anime and Japaneese cuisine, it's cultural appropriation.

If I point out I'm bi, but don't attend pride, because of people wandering around in fetish gear infront of children I'm phobic. Or if I don't frantically cheer at Dezmond is amazing I'm a biggot. Likewize if I question people beeing attracted to minors or make up genders what have nothing to do with biology. I'm expected to simply know peoples made up genders, where ad before it was blatantly apparent. I refer to everyone as you, but still I get screamed at.

Mentioning that I've dated trans people does nothing to dissuade people.
If I reject the advances of females with male genetalia I'm a phobe yet again. I'm not even allowed to have sexual preferances. Ironically the same freedom the lgbt community used to stand for. Instead it's forced on me.

If I don't like a certain movie because gay/lesbian characters are just used as tokens and portrayed as near comical tragic stereotypes without any background or character development I'm seen as as a biggot. 

If I question the government selling off our country's natural recources to the point people are freezing to death because of high electricity prices, because we have to buy them back I'm called a nazi.
If I want our country to govern itself I'm called a nazi.

If I mention the waves of rape, murder and robbery in major cities. I'm called a nazi and that I should respect their culture. The fact that an 8 year old girl was brutally gangraped to death is irrelevant. I'm a nazi for even mentioning it and told the girl was probably a rascist.

When I try to talk to pople who engage in hobbies and try to keep politics out I'm doxed, banned and hated, hung out simply for not agreeing nor wanting to discuss politics withing a given hobby.

I'm called a nazi, despite opposing any totaliterian idiology, despite laying down flowers on the graves of the brave soldiers who died stopping the actual nazis.

I can't take this woke bullshit anymore.

I'm the most hated thing on the planet. 
I'm a white male.

If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It‚Äôs also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won‚Äôt even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON‚ÄôT be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‚Äò!‚Äô as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

However, my hobbies and the things I like to do don't really align with what the people of my age like to do, and I have never had a romantic relationship with a girl in my life. The only topics I have with girls are school and other general stuff. Looking at other guys with relationships that are going well makes me feel extremely empty inside. All I ever do is hang out with friends mindlessly and play games. When I see that someone's girlfriend cooked for him, and things along these lines, it eats away at my sanity bit by bit. I too would like to hug a girl everyday and hear the words ""I love you"". 

I know it's kind of my problem since I have no problems socializing and I am generally said to be attractive, and I can start to pick up other interests to have more to talk about with girls. However, changing is extremely difficult for me and I continue to live in a cycle of self-torment, fretting over the fact that I have no female affection in my life...

Welcome to the land of coincidence.

One minute you are breathing in your house making plans for Hawaii and the very next instant you are stuck in your house because of a man eating bat somewhere distant in Wuhan . 

We are already walking with a invisible thread attached to us. And every moment we pass we connect to someone we tie a knot in those threads sometimes knowingly sometimes unknowingly.

Sometimes I wonder is it just a thread or a set of dominoes that is set in motion while I meet you.

Right now as you breathe you are already setting things in motion you are unaware of.And maybe this reaching you is just a part of it.... 

I'm a 22M who's in Med school, going to start my career in a months, and is now trying to figure out the rest of my life. I've always been more relationship focused but haven't had something serious in a long time. It might be because of the pandemic but dating apps aren't working for me so I'm trying my luck here.

I tend to find people who are ""not ready"" for a relationship but will string me along for their shenanigans. I have been told I am a great person but never understood why I couldn't find anyone. Those people that hurt me, weren't meant for me. I figure I keep it straight forward to say I am looking for a relationship.

About Myself: 

¬∞ I am a Nerd exploring Multi-Verses and FanDoms.. 

¬∞ I am Still a Student... Studying Medicine and Surgery, Final Year....

¬∞ I love Reading Comics and Novels, Binging TV Series, Enjoying Movies, Playing Video Games, Researching and many more....

I'm hoping to make a connection with someone who enjoys going on adventures and nature, but is also happy staying in and having a quiet night. I'm not strict on age, all I want a serious relationship and for me race/looks don't matters... 

I know It will be Long Distance First but Soon I will Decrease our distance üòäüòä


# Things I'm looking for:
**Honesty**

Age: No matter, only want u to be Serious for Relationship 

**Distance doesn't matter** 

Affection/flirty 

**‚Ä¢Loyalty**

**‚Ä¢Support**

**Give me space sometimes and vice versa**

**Date nights (Netflix, Hulu)**

**Eating Together**

*_I am a chill/calm person. I don't ask for anything because I can get it myself so the things I named above is all I want from someone._*

If you read this far and you're interested please message me with something about yourself and your interests. Including where you're from. We can talk on reddit or elsewhere.

Hope to hear from someone soon ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

I know as well that there is hope and a good friendship somewhere for me but after constant failed attempts and let downs it just feels hopeless. I have tried online and I have tried in real life bug it just seems that most ways of connecting are hopeless.

I try to be understanding of people but at the same time there is only so much that I can bear before I just know that I am being stepped on emotionally. I love people and I want to form a connection but each time that I do I have to close my vulnerabilities because I know that putting in all my emotional energy will just most likely and has hurt me in the end. Even two weeks ago, I met someone online and talk to them for hours. We spent over 4 months talking to each other and having fun. I felt a genuine connection. She tells me throughout that time that she is uncomfortable with online relationships(platonic) and that over time she will warm up but that there are just some things that she is not comfortable with. That is fine. I have dealt with people like that a lot and I can totally and did to a large extent hold to their boundaries. Then around 5 weeks ago they were a little mean and it felt like they were troubled with something. So then I told them that it felt like they are not doing the best but I hope I am wrong, but that just in case they are not that I am here as a person to talk if they need someone to talk if they ever need someone to confide in. They tell me they ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù it but then they just go off an say that please never talk about anything regarding my emotional state but if you ever need someone to confide I am here for you. That hurt. I did not tell them that what they are feeling is wrong or that there is an issue with what they are feeling, I don‚Äôt push them and tell them to tell but just to remind them that there are people that are willing to listen. I saw all of that because I understand how they want to be with there boundaries but they reply in a crude way that treats me like a stranger. She has mental issues and it‚Äôs fine but she threw away but it just felt like she could have said it in a nicer way that didn‚Äôt feel like she threw away the five months of bonding that it seemed like we had. It didn‚Äôt feel the best so I push it off and don‚Äôt reply for around three days because I do not know how to reply to something like that. I then push myself to make a reply that is basically along the lines that it hurt and it was fine that they wanted boundaries but the way they said it was crude. I go on to say I want boundaries too because I felt that the dynamic has changed. I regret sending that. Then two weeks of talking to them less pass by, I feel confused about our ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù because she is talking to another person which to me there is no problem. I know him as well and we were also sort of friends. The issue is that day she unfriended me on discord which I totally understand because she said previously that she is uncomfortable with it. The problem is that she keeps him as a friend. It makes me question our relationship and if we ever had one because she starts contradicting what she tells me. So I ask her later that day if we can call because there is something important I want to ask. She says she is busy, but she says she will open up her dm‚Äôs. I told her that I wanted to talk in voice because I felt that texting did not do that justice but since she told me she was busy I told her that was fine but I said earlier that we don‚Äôt have to talk now but sometime when she is free in the next week. She replied by saying I don‚Äôt get why any of this is serious and that she only uses online relationships to relax. Basically undermining the importance of my feelings or whatever I wanted to say so I ask if she seriously meant that. We go into this back and forth where she says that what I am doing is drama, that our friendship pretty much wasn‚Äôt real to her, inferring heavily that online interactions including mine aren‚Äôt real to her, etc. I was going to ask if we were/are/ever really friends but after that I realized that we definitely weren‚Äôt and basically the months that we had fun together was just me being used and not any sort of connection. The one time I want to have a real conversation is pushed way. Just a lot of shit. I tell them how inconsiderate they are and how that they say they set clear boundaries but I rebuttal and say that they were never clear to that extent on friendships and what not and that they contradicted themselves saying that they never wanted to form a bond when they have someone else I knew added so that they could talk to them while their dm‚Äôs were closed. Just a lot of shit idk. I am sorry it‚Äôs a lot but I just felt that I need to vent. I know that I am not they best either and made a lot of mistakes in multiple relationships(friend or otherwise)that I have had with other, but that experience has just put me down a lot lately. It has just reminded me of high school and superficiality/fragility of my relationships. I really want to be able to put my real self forth and form relationships with other people but it just seems futile and I just feel as if I should just remove the concept of trying with other people and just keep to myself.

1065,Shy-Lonely,1615622402,1,"For my whole life I've been like a lonely ship without its wheel, or at least that's what I thought. I drifted to the sea to little places that I didn't want to go to, because it wasn't me taking me there. The only place I actually wanted to be at was my safe harbor which wasn't even real. 

But recently I've discovered to actually be a passenger  on that ship who just needed to find a way to fix the wheel to become a  captain, If I fix the wheel I can go where I want to. When I actually saw how easy it was to fix it, I became motivated and continued until it was fixed. Now I can go sail where I want to steer to, not where the sea is taking me, the sea can still put me in a storm but even then I'm confident that can steer to where I wanted to go from my experience of fixing the wheel. 

Now the only things I need on my ship are: me, food, water. Because the destination is the focus, not the distractions on the way there, it's what brings motivation and happiness while you are going there and also when you are there at the same time.

I'm still Shy and Lonely but not because of other people, instead only because I chose it to be this way for the journey ahead.

Recently something good happened in my life, and I felt happy that day. I shared it here and got some nice heartwarming comments from some of you. It made me happy that I was able to maybe bring some semblance of happiness to others out here. But in-spite of my efforts there are somedays where I feel quite down and depressed. I try not to get weighed down by guilt/depression, but sometimes I just fail. I can't get up from bed, or go out or focus on work. 

In those time I go through posts in this subreddit trying to look for other posts. I try to look for something positive or heartwarming. Just the fact that one of you had a better day or something positive, makes me smile and try to move forward in my day as well.

Hence, I request all of you to post whatever makes you happy or feel positive, not once, not now, but every now and then. I read through all of the daily posts, and although I know most of us are sad and struggling but the occasional positive posts make me happy. I hope to hear from you.

1075,FRogSaretheshit666,1615617441,1,"Well long story short, i meet this guy online, he is really nice, i have never had a friend like him, i don't have many friends in real life. He is older than me lives in another country and is deeply depressed bc he doesn't have any support in his country not even family and he hasn't had that in 10+ he is giving up and tbh mid quarantine i was too. We engaged the deepest and best friendship i have had in my whole life, it was hard, bc he needed me lots and i need it him, we watched movies at the same time, whole vikings, peaky blinders, all of that stuff, phone call till we fell sleep everyday. 

Then i went to a party and he saw my stories and thought he was replaced, he felt bad, but none of those people where really my friends he is. Any ways he is more depressed now and has been going down hill since November last year or even before that, i went through the worst year of my life and thought about suicide many times this year and last year. I'm going to the psychiatrist. 

But i send him messages every day, asking him if he is fine, he is not, we don't talk anymore bc he is working and tired and can't sleep, he has 6 hours more than I do. And i just don't know how to help, he doesn't want to go to therapy o meds bc he has tried that before, and the only way he seems to think he is going to recover is if he finds a friend irl which it's unlikely bc mental health. I just don't know what to do, he is my best friend, even if we don't talk like we used to ( or if he doesn't answer) i keep sending him messages almost everyday bc i think someday he may notice that someone really deeply cares about him. 

Sometimes I'm afraid when he stops answering for a day bc i think he gave up. It messes up with my mental health too, i think i lost the only person that was my friend and actually didn't had any other intention behind.

Well guess what? Still don't have a partner, like them. Still don't have friends, like them. Still don't leave my house, like them. Still don't get excited at spring break or go around town on the weekend, like them. Still don't have any accomplishments or hobbies, like them. Still can't even take a fucking picture of my face like they do, every day, without concern.

And it's just gonna get worse as it gets worse. I've gone a whole year not doing anything but waking up, consuming media, maybe do some shitty online courses from a CC that I have no motivation, reason, or ability to do, and going to sleep where I don't have to worry about this shit- and COVID didn't even play a part in it. Before that even, I still can't recall a single time anyone initiated an interaction with me in good faith, especially not girls, back to the exact specific hour 7 years ago.

 As withered as my ability to interact with people was, it's only gotten worse, which makes it harder, which means I'm alone for longer, which means I'm dead and no one is coming to my funeral.

All of these emotions are adding up to my own anguish. 

I don‚Äôt know why i came here in the first place, i knew it would only hurt me. 

But i also found support, so much of it really, more than i could have ever expected. I also found many like-minded people and so much kindness. For that i‚Äôm grateful.

Sadly though, i also realized that in the end i can‚Äôt really do anything. I can‚Äôt save anyone, i can‚Äôt even help myself. I know that it was obvious, i mean, i‚Äôm not god or some superhuman. I just thought that maybe my words could actually change someone‚Äôs day, maybe even their life, i still believe in it deep down. But i am tired, too tired.

So i‚Äôll say these last things, and tomorrow morning i‚Äôll delete my profile.

I hope you all make it, you deserve it. From what i‚Äôve seen many here are truly wonderful people, please don‚Äôt give up. The world is already too dark, don‚Äôt snuff out the few beautiful lights it tries so hard to destroy. You are all that‚Äôs keeping the world from falling apart, your little acts of kindness, your words of encouragement. You have made so many of my days better and honestly, i could even say that you saved my life. Thank you, so much.

Honestly ? I hope this loneliness stops one day, i‚Äôm so scared, it‚Äôs so painful, it‚Äôs so tiring. It‚Äôs destroying me from the inside. I just want to fade away most of the time, but i keep going. I keep going because if i don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll certainly never get to see if this will end, i‚Äôll simply remain lonely for eternity without even giving it a chance.

That‚Äôs it.

This is my third job in a time spam of 2 years. All of them remote with co-workers living in different cities. The team members are cool, but haven't met them in person, nor been able to organize a meet up. - besides, who really wants to mix work with personal life anyways (I mean at least me, I like drawing a line there) 
My closest friends from uni have faded away - either they moved out, we lost contact or in ""extreme"" cases we just had an argument and didn't continue our friendship. It's been 8 years that I'm out of my country so high-school buddies aren't even taken into account here. 
I think that the time I've spent alone has entered that vicious circle of feeling lonely, but unable to properly for in with others of the occasion raises (not that too many appear). And it feels difficult to create that true connection again from cero. 
(do you maybe sometimes think about how long that process would take and feel you can't be bother?) 
I really enjoy time on my own, but if it's too long without having a proper social life, I become lonely, like maybe most people.

1117,Nyamille,1615593472,1,"For the longest time I have been trying to be okay, trying to be happy on my own and by myself, telling myself I can do it if I only try hard enough. I have been taking a cold hard look at myself and my mental health for a while now and have to admit to myself, I'm far from okay, I might have hit rock bottom. I'm alone. I'm becoming more and more depressed. I feel so lonely. Desperately, achingly lonely, longing for a connection to another human being that I care about and that in turn cares about me. That I can truly be myself with and not some censored, empty shell. 

I get hospitalized a few times each month and have to leave the emergency contact blank, it's a feeling of loneliness I don't have words for. I have no one. Everyday I am surrounded by people at work, at the hospital, pretending to be just fine, smiling for them and helping others, while inside I feel like the loneliest soul on the entire planet. I comfort people with the words I wish to hear and try to be for them what I wish I could have myself, even if I don't admit it to myself. It makes me feel emptier day by day. 

I wish so badly for someone to just see me, to want to hear what I have to say, to not feel so insignificant. That they let me see them and their soul and want to share the small and not so small ups and downs of life with me because of who I am to them. The kind of connection that doesn't fizzle out if you don't talk for a few days because of circumstances, where it feels like coming home again once you find the time to talk. Someone that sometimes may feel like greeting me in the mornings and someone I can say good night to, someone that gets me and that I in turn hold just as close to my heart. A connection. A genuine friend. Love. Anything.

I read post upon post of lonely people like me, scrolling and scrolling through people's stories, wishing we could take a leap of faith and reach out, get to know each other. To maybe truly connect and enrich each other's lives just by being in them. At this age it is so hard, everyone is so jaded, burned by experience, afraid to keep trying, refuses to let anyone new in or has their circle of people to stick to. For the past few weeks I have tried to reach out so much, actively sent private messages both longer and shorter, but rarely even got a reply. I have been offering for people to reach out to me to not be overbearing, wishing so much that they would, but they never do. When I start to have hope I might have found a like minded soul, I get ghosted or receive one word replies, everything just dies if I don't keep on initiating conversations. I'm exhausted and hurt, burned out. Crushed by continually picking myself up to keep trying and never being good enough for anybody, for them to choose ME.

Is there anybody out there that can relate to this? I feel like I am slowly sinking and would really truly love for you to reach out to me, to see if maybe we could become friends or just two people that care about each other. No one should have to feel this lonely in a world with billions of people.

I have lived on several different continents. Love traveling. Photography. Anime and video games. Netflix marathons. Politics. Mental health. Animals. Hiking and nature. Competitive sports. Swimming. Languages and different cultures. Sending and receiving pictures of random moments. I like music and philosophy, to talk about the wonders of life and its intricacies. I love smiling and laughing but there hasn't been a reason to for a devastatingly long time. I have so much to talk about but no one to hear me, I have so much love to give but no one to give it to. 

Please, if any of this resonates with you, do reach out. Send me a DM. What is something that makes you happy? How are you feeling today? What are you looking for in life? Take a leap of faith, I will reply. 
Regardless of if you decide we could click or not, I wish whoever took the time to read this a wonderful day and thank you so much for hearing me out, keep your head up!",lonely,33/Human. Please reach out to me,2021-03-13 10:57:52

1146,cheekwrinkle,1615574620,1,"I feel like a hypocrite because I still feel empty and alone when I have talked to others. 

For example, I have two irl friends. They are sisters, and they live almost two hours away (If we lived closer we'd probably hangout more). However, when I'm with them I still feel lonely. We've known one another since middle school, and we're in our early twenties now. We have grown apart over the years. We hardly talk, but a lot of that is my fault. I don't reach out, because I still feel lonely when I'm with them. 

I'm ashamed about my situation for one. I've dropped out of college, and have no intention of going back because I just don't have it in me. I don't have a job either. Meanwhile they graduated with a bachelors this previous year, and are already working. We also don't have similar world views, and they don't like it when I talk about mine. Our relationship feels very surface level and unfulfilling. I just don't really understand why. I feel really bad about this. 

I've spent most of my time isolated for years now. I have major depression and I'm suicidal. I'm scared to leave the house. I've had 24/7 derealization for years. I also have BPD and AvPD. I guess all of those things contribute to me feeling alone in some way. I'm not really sure how it works. 

I'm not sure how to make new friends. I have a ""blank mind"" as a symptom of the derealization. I'm very awkward and not smart or knowledgeable. I don't really have many opinions. I usually just sit in silence when I'm around others. 

I think having a boyfriend would make me feel less lonely, but it's extremely dangerous to make one person the only thing that makes you happy and life worth living. For, one they could die at any moment. It's also a lot of pressure to put on the other person. I've always just kind of desired one close relationship though (with someone I can also be physically intimate with, ideally). Knowing that that's not healthy or substantial makes me feel even more lonely. 

I'm not sure how to fulfil my life in other ways though. There's nothing I really want in this world anymore besides a close relationship. Even then, I'll still feel suicidal and existentially alone. Really, there's nothing I desire or look forward to. Every second feels impossible to get through. It feels so hard to get out of the house. I'm scared just to go in my backyard. I don't feel like going out and meeting people because I believe I'll still feel lonely. I don't understand why I feel this way though.

I want to talk about how i wanted to die. 

My father is a retired colonel in the army. And I admire him for his many qualities and his ability to take care of our family so well and his sense of fairness and duty. So I wanted to be a soldier like him too. 

And I wanted to die while protecting someone. Anyone basically. To give my life defending an innocent and save them.. But things change. I changed and my desire to be a soldier eventually faded. 

But today I saw this video of a dog when his owner jumped into a pool and the dog swam to save him even though it was apparent that the dog was afraid of the water. It faced its fear to save his owner who it clearly loved enough to jump. A good boi if I've ever seen one. 

Seeing that video made me cry like a baby. Like an embodiment of how I want to die being brave and saving an innocent human and seeing it in an animal triggered something in me to make me cry. I didnt understand it. (The dog was fine btw) 

I realized that the way I want to die still hasn't changed. And that the person I was when I first wanted to be a soldier still is in my heart somewhere. That's a very humbling thought. 

And I still hope I get to die like that is what i discovered from my reaction to that video.

1157,honita_,1615571387,1,"Due to my social anxiety I tend to think I'm a lonely person, I tend to explain it like that when(ever) someone wonders why I don't do what's typical for someone of my age (22). I feel like I've convinced myself I'm not a people person but the more I think about past events the less I think that's true. I used to love people. I had so many friends when I was in primary school, I was always around people and loved every minute of it. Even if I'm so lonely now, I think deep down Im still the same, and I just came up with excuses to hide the pain it causes me not to have that anymore. 

In my teenage years all my friends left me behind and so many people started being mean towards me for no apparent reason (some of them even used to be friends of mine), I'm not a conflictive person and at that time I started being very low-profile. I didn't talk to anyone to be considered annoying - but people still seemed to dislike me for some reason. This might sound dumb now, I know people were young and were probably just trying to have fun, but thinking back I'm beginning to realise it's the reason I can't get back to who I was. 

I remember one time I just tried to sit on my usual spot in class, this kid who always poked fun out of me was sitting right next to that seat (he usually stayed at the other side of the classroom) and right when I tried to take my spot he threw all his stuff on the table, making very clear he did not want me to be there. I was so taken aback the teacher had to interviene, asking him to please let me take my seat next to him. I can't seem to forget the face of utter disgust he made - as if just sitting next to me during a class was the most disgusting thing he ever had to go through. I had never done anything to this kid. Things like this were usual, along with comments like ""oh my god she can actually speak?"" ""is she new?"" (those who asked this were people with whom I shared classes for five years), I was a very quiet student and my classmates would not talk to me, so apparently hearing my voice was that big of a deal to them, but for me, who had such a hard time recieving attention, was hell. 

So now I just stand back. And I assume I don't need friends, or people around me, or social interaction at all, when that's so far from the truth. I'm just scared people will look at me like that again. Or wonder why am I even trying to speak. Or wonder why am I even trying to have a conversation at all with them. I always wonder if those years in my life were some type of bad karma, because it harmed me so deep down and I feel its repercutions in so many aspects of my life, but these aren't things you can tell anyone to explain why you are the way you are, so people assume I hate people or I'm a bad friend when in fact I'm just scared.

And after my last attempt at getting in a relationship, which ended badly for me... I decided to give up finding love, and accepted that this would never happen.

Flashforward to the end of 2020, where I joined a Discord for writing. I ended up chattering with some peeps, and became close friends with two of them in particular. So that was pretty good.

Surprise, surprise, I... I think I fell in love with them. With both of them. At once. Holy shit. This has never happened before, and yesterday I got called ""pretty"" and I swear my heart melted. It was such a good feeling! I was ecstatic! Happy! Excited! So I began to daydream about... us. The three of us in a relationship. There were a few times where we playfully flirted with each other, although that's a bit of a problem because I don't know when people are being honest or just messing with me.

Think about it logically. *someone* has to be the one who initiate first or else no one would be talking. There would be no friendships in the world but that‚Äôs not the case. Friends exist. Which means *someone* is making the effort and initiating in those respective friendships. 

So why is it always me? Why am I the one who always has to make the effort? Now there are only 2 possibilities here that I can think of.

*Possibility #1*: My perception is inaccurate. What I mean is there is a possibility that I am not perceiving things accurately and my mind is ignoring all the times people did try to talk to me first.

I used to be able to share this with someone, and it was no surprise those were the times I never had to talk to myself, just her. If a younger me sees who I am today, I wonder if things would change.

I get jealous whenever I hear people talk about how they met the love of their lives. It always makes me feel incomplete, like something went wrong with me growing up.

Later on that night after i was getting ready for bed i saw that he was actually playing a game with my other friend. Then i took my headset off and could hear him talking to all my other friends about me.

I just broke up with somebody because they found out that they were asexual 3 weeks into the relationship. Then the things he said were 'I told you i was right that it wouldn't even last 3 weeks. This happens with all of his other relationships too. He jumps into them too quickly.' I felt like shit i am not going to lie. I was literally only seeing them. The fact that i can hear him bitch about me in the other room pretty much once a week to them is beginning to affect my mental health.

So he has done nice things for me too. But hearing him sound so two faced and bitchy when he talks about me as if i'm some kind of joke to him really pisses me off. Why is he kind and really supportive to me one time and a complete dick behind my back the next?

He didn‚Äôt even really know its overall importance besides the name. I then came up with an idea of how smart it would be to have a mental health day for all schools, not so much an original idea but got me inspired.

Taking a break from classes or assignments due for one day I don‚Äôt feel like is a stretch for the education system. Instead having activities for mental health awareness I think is extremely important, many people bottle that stress up and have no where to express it so I think this could be a great opportunity for growth within the world. Other examples to support this day could be medication classes, art activities, workout exercises, yoga, music, and more that could benefit students for a more relaxed environment. This is only the 2nd day that I have thought about this and I am already super passionate about it. Having a place for students to talk and share about how they have been feeling, even connecting on a deeper level like that could help them later in life. I think this would be a great opportunity for students to relieve their stress especially within this pandemic and most classes online. A mental health awareness day I personally think would help so many students, it only takes the effort and support from our education system.

1197,MillennialMontgomery,1615535062,1,"I keep typing and deleting and re-typing this first sentence over and over trying to articulate this desperation for connection that I have. I can't seem to find the words to depict this deep and dull ache in my chest that washes over me every time I think about how lonely I feel. So screw trying to sound coherent, I'm just gonna keep talking and hopefully some of it makes sense. 

I've felt lonely for a long time, but I think it's the worst it's ever been. The difference is that, this time, I don't have friends to rely on. It's been very difficult for me to accept that everything ends. Every relationship we ever have in our lives‚Äìbe it platonic or otherwise‚Äìends in a goodbye at one point or another. Recently, I've lost just about every friend I had for the last few years. It's alarming because I'm deathly afraid of being alone, even for a day. Terrified of the things that tiptoe into my train of thought if I spend even just a little bit too much time alone. 8 legged creatures and 800 foot heights are insignificant compared to the emptiness inside of me. I'm not sure how I got to be this way, but I have spent more than enough time trying and failing to fill that void with something real. No. I'm lying to you all and I'm lying to myself. Those relationships were never real, and deep down I think I knew it because I am far too scared of anything real. Paralyzed at the thought of being vulnerable. What if I'm not good enough? What if it's too late? I torture myself constantly with these questions and it accomplishes precisely nothing. Loneliness doesn't care about logic though, it doesn't care about objective truth. I don't know about too late, but I think the answer to the first question is that I know I'm not good enough, at least not the way I am now. The kind of person venting on Reddit at an ungodly hour sounding madder than the hatter is probably not the kind of person that would benefit and be of benefit in a relationship. 

It's quite a cruel irony really, that the only thing I've ever really wanted is the thing I can't have due to the consequences of never having had that kind of love and affection in the first place. How can I be expected to ""love yourself before you love anyone else"" when I don't really know what love is. The majority of people take this simple physiological need for warmth, touch, and affection for granted, but it's impacted almost every decision I have ever made. 

I would like to believe that one day I will be surrounded by people who value me the way I deserve to be valued, and that this need for affection no longer consumes me. As it stands, however, I am skeptical. Every fiber of my being resists the idea that I shouldn't rely on anyone else and that I should instead find happiness within myself. I suppose I'm just stuck in this cycle of constantly looking for something I can't find. My mother always told me that life isn't fair, and that if you want something, you should take it. It's too bad that the only thing I want is one of the few things that can't be taken. 

I could probably go on for a really really \*really\* long time about all this but I think I'll save the rest for another day. Thank you to whomever took the time to read this absurdly long vent.

I notice that people stop caring, and I try to rekindle that relationship. Alas it doesn't happen. It doesn't work. Nothing works. 

I'm the kind of person who doesn't allow friendship to fade because time passes or we don't talk anymore. If a friend comes back to talk to me, I'll talk to them as if I've been talking to them every day. Other people don't seem that way. 

When I try to talk to them, everything is so surface level.

""How are you?"" ""Nothing much, you?"" ""Nothing really just chilling.""

I hate that.

I can't seem to find people who aren't superficial like that. I don't know what they think of me. I question if they even like me. 

Probably not. I come in and out of peoples lives like seasons. Like I said, I am just too busy to hang out or talk. I work, and I am a full time student. If I talk or hang out it will set me back on my studies.

It's so unbelievably stupid, I know --- I'm not even an adult yet and I'm listening to music by people who have experienced real loss; real, tangible loss. I know it's feelings that I probably don't ever want to feel, and I know I'm too young to really have any idea of what the future holds for me. I know it all. But it still just feels bad. A part of me wants to feel that loss so I can actually have something I can sit down and listen to and go ""yes, that's me. That's what I'm feeling right now"". But I can't. I haven't experienced anything. 

I don't doubt there will arrive a day where I look back at the way I feel and laugh at how naive I was --- listening to sad music and lamenting about how I'm too lonely to even find comfort in music about breakups --- but I just wish I could feel like shit listening to music that speaks to me instead of feeling these weird feelings of envy.",lonely,Listening to music,2021-03-12 15:42:36

1227,Skip143091,1615521851,1,"I really feel like I'm close to the end. I'll be 23 soon, and I've been so alone for my entire adult life. I remember lurking these sorts of subs when I was 16 and not feeling alright. People would always tell others that it ""gets better with age"", but that just isn't true for me. I'm actually feeling worse and worse every year. At least I had a little band of friends when I was 16. Now, I have nobody to talk to. No friends. Certainly no girlfriend. I don't live with family anymore, and I rarely see/talk to them. I don't even have any work buddies. 

Speaking of work, it's very exhausting. I'm in healthcare, and help medicate/supervise severely mentally ill people. On an average day, these are the only people I socialize with, and it's not uncommon to go without seeing coworkers. I wake up alone, then I go to work and speak with the archetypical schizophrenic man, who you may literally see roaming the streets while shouting at cars. Then, I come home, where I sit alone, and do nothing but listen to music and browse the internet, until I can finally sleep as much of my life away as possible. That's my average day for the last year and a half. I have many hobbies, but I've become so severely depressed that I can't be bothered by them anymore.

I just wish I had someone that cared about me. I don't even know what that feels like. I'm on cycle #3 of trying dating apps, and every time, it just makes me feel worse about myself and my future. It's always a waste of time, no exceptions. At 23, I had the first date of my life this past saturday, and a second with her yesterday, where she did the whole ""not ready for a relationship, let's just be friends"" thing. I'm doubting if she even wants that, since she told me to call her tonight, but didn't answer. At the very least, I'm not surprised. Just trying to come to terms with a future that looks bleaker every week. I really don't see a point in living like this at all, when 99% of days are, at best, moderately bad.

1234,noumenonanon,1615518943,1,"I may have a good job and climbing up a ladder in a career I love and my future looks financially sound. 
But I'm not happy. At all.

Sometimes I think I am. Maybe I'm fooling myself thinking my fleeting moments of happiness aren't really that. 
I'm not suicidal and don't have plans like I used to. I don't self mutilate. I'm so different than the person I used to be. I'm on my boss shit. Externally. 


But... I'm so starved of intimacy. I'm starved of touch. I have no one I can confide in, or even feel comfortable confiding in. My closest friends sometimes feel like strangers and I feel like a piece of shit saying that... But it's just my manic fucked up brain that could never completely get out of its funk. Maybe I just got really good at hiding that and occupying my mind with goals and tasks. But when I sit here alone... After work... After everything is done and I'm waiting to drone on the next day... It hits full force. 

I don't trust anyone. I don't think anyone could ever love me like I could love them. I'm scared of intimacy. It's difficult to admit that. But... I am. The one thing I've yearned for since I was a child. The one thing I was never able to attain no matter how much I tried. 

I like being alone. But I also fear being alone with my thoughts. But this way... I don't have to hurden anyone with what I truly feel. I could never burden anyone with that. Why would I? 

No one gives a fuck about me like that. I'm not ugly. I'm not stupid. I'm not devoid of potential. I'm not useless. I'm the total opposite. The opposite of what I used to be...
 
But I'm unwanted. Completely unwanted. I was never and feel I will never be anyone's first choice. I value and love myself. But I don't think anyone ever will see that value. I doubt it. 
I feel I know what I want in life but no one I ever come across ever knows what they want. Or hide their true motives. Like the way I hide my yearning to not feel the way I do..

I'm fighting back tears. I'm over worked. I'm sleep deprived. I'm afraid to cry. I'm afraid to be vulnerable. I'm afraid of myself. Even though I've come so far. I know from where I've crawled out from. My anxiety is through the roof. I'm having panic attacks. I'm trying my hardest to maintain and I'm sure no one can tell as I smile and crack jokes non stop. My heart pounding out of my chest. Trying to control my breathing. I just don't want to be. But... I just want to be loved as much I've grown to love myself.

I'm getting older. Another year with not knowing what intimacy is. 
People younger than me have so much more experience socially. People have experienced love. 

I'm doing my best. But that's not enough. It will never be enough.

1247,Flaven03,1615513991,1,"A lot of the time, it's really hard. I've been really lonely for pretty much my entire life. I've never known how to properly interact with people until I recently started trying. And since it's essentially all I've ever known, I never felt bad about my loneliness.  I knew that I had depression, I knew that I was very sad, but I never felt the need to ever connect with people. Up until last year that is. Quarantine hit hard, harder than I expected. Now, I'm probably the loneliest I've ever been in my life. Last year was very difficult, being that I wasn't going to school, and had no friends to contact at all. On top of that, only two people in the house. I haven't spoken to my dad in 7 years now, and my sister moved away and doesn't like our side of the family much. I don't talk with her either. Only my mom, and brother. My mom is a major talker and wears me down constantly with it. We are extreme polar opposites in most respects and don't get along well most of the time even though I try. My brother is either always at work, helping my mom, or in his own room with his own space. And the time's that we do hang out, I don't think he truly understands just how alone I really feel. I feel like no one really does. Even though I've communicated it, I either get talked over by my mom, and she tells me ""It'll be ok you just need some friends"". Or my brother tells me that he's there for me, and putting myself out there more might help. I appreciate these nudges toward social activity. I think for anyone that's healthy to a certain degree. But I think I'm past the point where just ""making friends"" will help. I don't think that's what loneliness is. Just make friends and it's over. I don't want 'just friends'. I want people that I can really connect with, who understand me, and people who I understand on a deeper level. People who feel the same way, and people who are open to me. I feel as though most people fail to realize that. But over the past year, I have had a lot of empty time to reflect, and think. I've pretty much been forced to face myself given isolation, and I've tried really hard. Have you ever tried that? Just sitting by yourself, no music, no shows or movies, no background noise or distractions, no phone. Just sitting, and staring at nothing. Only your own thoughts. It can be a scary endeavor. But one thing I've realized is that I think I'm ok. I think I'm enough. I'm still sad a lot, I still feel alone a lot. But. Loneliness is kind of beautiful with retrospection. I've felt the most like me when I'm alone. After sitting, and staring with no noise for a long time, I finally feel comfortable in my own head most of the time. The feelings that I feel are very deep, and often complex. But the feeling of loneliness itself is often beautiful as of late. Because I think I've come to the realization that all loneliness does is push us toward one another. It pushes us into connection, and retrospection, and thought. It tries to push us toward love. And I think that, if you let it, it can push you toward yourself. Hope everyone is doing ok out there in this lonely world we live in. Open to talking if anyone need's it.

It can come in the form of never being heard to begin with.
Loneliness is a darkness that is warm and inviting. And you fall in and its so safe you don't want to leave. You feel trapped inside your own mind and your own body and you scream for help with your eyes and no one can see it. Or hear those muffled screams. And some people think it's them that drove you away. But in reality it was the darkness inside yourself that consumed you, pushing them away that your walls vibrate and scream anything they can to drive them away from you.

I haven't received a single message asking me if I'm okay or if I'm going literally fucking insane, which I really am. 

I try to be more friendly and want to help others to make myself feel useful but I have no one to help because no one asks for it and if I'd go to everyone and ask if they need help with something they'd either say ""No."" or ""I don't need your help."" because they don't need me, I'm not how I was back in 5th-6th grade where I could help people with school and stuff cuz now I'm helping next to no one.

There's no point in doing something if not even my friends care about me at all. I can't go alone especially when I have my 8th grade exam in 3 months which I will probably fail. I'm feeling almost like a dried up dead leaf, dead inside and falling apart.

A year ago when I was a junior 16 There was this girl(sophomore 15) who I thought could be the love of my life. Her and I got close really quick. We first started out as friends and then soon after we became very touchy feely but not sexual. Just cuddling, and staring into each other‚Äôs eyes with passion, and talking about our future together. Her and I would always be somewhere on school campus either walking or laid up with one another. When I was with her it felt like everything was ok, it was a constant feeling of Euphoria whenever I was in her presence. Fast forward a few months and we start talking about getting into a relationship. I‚Äôve never been in one, still to this day, but she said her last one with her ex didn‚Äôt go so well so she wasn‚Äôt sure. We put that idea on hold and just continued doing what we were doing. Fast forward again to the last day of school before winter break. She knew she was on my mind all day, she knew I was so excited to see her during the break, she said she felt the same way but I think she was lying. I stopped everything for her. I got out of the street life and started focusing more on school for her (I was an A B student but I turned myself into a straight A student with her help). I stopped all my bad habits, everything. I wanted to be the best I could for her and I even told her that. She knew how I felt, why I felt the way I did, and I was still waiting for her however long it took for us to be together. I met up with her after school that day and she pretty much completed ignored me. All she said was, ‚ÄúI think we should stop, I don‚Äôt want us to keep being like this‚Äù. She said it wasn‚Äôt because of her past relationship, but I don‚Äôt know. I just want to know what I did wrong for her to lose feelings for me so fast.

1269,_Dinosaurlaserfight,1615502475,1,"This is a vent but talks about self harm and suicide so please be careful. 


I was in a vague polyamorous relationship with my two friends in 2019. I even helped make their wedding dresses and they helped me through surgery. It was nice and we got along great. There was talk of us being together always, they had a photo of the three of us at their wedding with each of them kissing my cheeks in a frame that said something like ‚Äòtoday, tomorrow, forever.‚Äô I moved in with them or rather they took me in. I did my best to be a good person, a good friend. 

Then 2020 hit. Coronavirus hit. My partners became ‚Äòjust friends‚Äô out of the blue. Like all of a sudden it was taken away. They started to separate themselves. One of them got meaner and meaner with me. They once ignored me for a flat month. I was miserable the entire year and they got meaner, more passive aggressive and just not nice. At one point I heard one of them say they didn‚Äôt like me. I had done nothing wrong, I‚Äôd tried so hard to stay in their good books. It ended up with them both just hating me and feeding each other‚Äôs hate of me. The reasoning was that one friend who was in a stressful work environment couldn‚Äôt take it out on anyone at work, so she was taking it out on me. I documented over 70 different interactions where they were genuinely quite mean. 

It was, essentially, a year where I had to call a suicide helpline over six times and email them repeatedly. Because I didn‚Äôt know what to do and ending it was the only thing I could think of. I began self harming again as a way of coping. I stayed in my room almost constantly. Anything to not be insulted, belittled or made fun of. I felt so alone, I have no friends, I have no family I can turn to. No money. 

I ended up spending Christmas alone while one friend worked and the other went to her parents. I was alone all day and at first I thought I wouldn‚Äôt mind it, by in truth I spent most of the day lonely and crying. More so when I found out one friend finished work early and went to the other friend‚Äôs parent‚Äôs house and stayed there getting drunk. Then they came into my room like I must of had a wonderful time. That was my first Christmas alone, and it was awful. I was reminded that they no longer wanted me here anymore, that I needed my own place. But where would I go? I had no money and the little I got, half went into the household. And living alone isn‚Äôt viable, too expensive.

Then things seemed to get better. Friend left her awful job. Their moods got better and she was suddenly nicer. An entire year of being scared of them, of threats and mean comments and panicking that I was going to be kicked out. Suddenly it was as if it hadn‚Äôt happened. 

I got apologies, but mostly when one friend was drunk. I had to be emotionally available all the time when inside I just wanted to end it. 

Today, things are better, friendship wise but when walking home from the store, I told my friend I had a dream. In the dream I said that everyone turned against me, and that they all said they didn‚Äôt believe me about being abused as a kid. Weirdly, they took my shoes which I suppose is funny. But then they said, ‚ÄúHave fun trying to get home.‚Äù And I remember saying ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know where home is!‚Äù 

My friend responded that this was no doubt about me feeling I don‚Äôt belong. And then proceeded to tell me I DIDN‚ÄôT belong anywhere. That I have never really belonged. And that I had screwed myself financially when younger and now I‚Äôm stuck. They confirmed we would definitely never be a thing again. Which broke my heart to boot. Despite it all I still love them both but they must not love me. And I can‚Äôt just switch off my feelings. 

But that comment, about not belonging just destroyed me. They‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. No one wants me, no one needs me. I‚Äôm disposable. I‚Äôve always felt alone, but that comment, about not belonging, just hit me so hard. It hurt so much that right now I‚Äôm struggling to function. They said they didn‚Äôt mean it meanly but how else can I take it? 

I‚Äôm aware that my sheer existence is a burden on everyone. I‚Äôm aware I don‚Äôt belong. That no one wants me, but I didn‚Äôt need to hear that today.

And then later my friend asked me what was wrong. And jokingly said when I said my mother didn‚Äôt answer my call ‚ÄòOh do you think she doesn‚Äôt love you anymore?‚Äô 

I just can‚Äôt tonight. I feel so alone and so unwanted. If I left and disappeared no one would care.",lonely,My friend told me I don‚Äôt belong anywhere and I‚Äôve never felt more alone.,2021-03-12 09:41:15

/!\\ THIS IS GOING TO BE LONG /!\\

So, I'll start by giving some context, I don't feel good, I live in France and I go to University, most of my friends are bad people obsessed with sex, alcohol, partying and just being the most popular possible, I don't like them they just always tell me stuff that is not nice, for example, I make music and have for a while now and know some stuff about mixing music, and they make music to and their mix is not sounding good, so I offered my help, they just rejected me saying I wasn't that good and that anyway I wasn't going anywhere with my electronic music and their rock music is better, and I don't like saying that but they have posted one track in total that got like 1000 view, and I got 15k streams on Spotify (no flexing or any of that shit just saying their point was stupid) I just stay with them so I can do something during the day when I don't have my headphones and computer.

They have a lot of parties at their flat and am not invited to a single one of them, we do studies in video-making and often have to do stuff as a group, and sometimes we have to make music for the project, and edit it in Premiere, I have done a lot of youtube videos and know to make different music styles in my DAW so I always propose myself to do one of them, they always end up making the music AND the editing, which is stupid because they only know how to make rock music and for a 50's style movie with gangsters Sum 41 rock is rarely good especially when it's off beat, 

they just drive me crazy and I have been into alcohol lately which makes me feel better for a moment.

There's a girl at Uni that I really like, she is kind and sooo nice to me, I just like talking to her but I'm too shy to go talk to her, but that's okay just talking to her puts a smile on my face for the day even if it's just a ""Hi, ready for the exams ?"", she's an angel and I want the best for her in life, and these fucking ""friends"" of mine are always talking about how hard they want to fuck her, how they bet that she could choke on their cock, I just want to kick their knees to break them the other way it supposed to bend, she can do whatever she wants that's not what pisses me off, you just don't disrespect people like that especially somebody as cool as her, anyway.

So, with my family that have no trust in me because someone accused me of stealing money from them, a lot of pressure from people about my future, all I the stuff I said above, and other little stuff not worth mentioning, I don't feel like anyone has a small shit to give about me and that they'd be better without me, the ONLY person I truly love in this world and I know loves me as much as my best friend from always, but I also feel like he'd be better off without me as I'm only calling him to play a game or hanging out when he's busy, he's the only person I can talk to without a filter about anything, but not all the stuff I said here and after it's just too much to say.

I don't know what I'm going to do about it, for the moment smoking weed and drinking is working okay for the moment, but I don't see a point in life anymore, the only reasons why I'm still positive sometimes, is because I have music, listening to it, making it, and just dreaming about a career in this industry, I feel good when I close my eyes and meditate with music, but when I open my eyes, it goes away. 

I've been thinking about suicide, drinking myself to a state where I can't even remember how to drink, and just let my self fall off a bridge or something, but it wouldn't be fair to my friend I mentioned, I wouldn't want him to think he could have done something differently, or been there more even if he has been there more than anyone I know.

My name is Luca and .  
I got lately more and more down as I see my ex gf happy and all that, telling more all about her personal life, about her ""simps"" the guy she got interest in, everything. It feels so wrong, I always told her that I don't want to hear anything from that. She just always keeps on going, It just hurts always, I can't even remember a time when she did not do that. I feel everyday more empty, I don't know what to do, honestly. It feels just like an really bad late night movie. My dog gets put down(because he was in lot of pain and we didn't wanted to see him suffer anymore), She really rubs me everything under my nose. That she really understand with anyone/everyone. It just makes me shiver always. I want to be happy but I can't get happy, I can't turn away and walk away. I just feel weak all the time and yet so... restless? I don't know, I recently started to cough up a lot more as I just cough out bile  when I would eat, I would instantly cough it up... I just can't accept a lot what happend and what may will happen. She knows that everything hurts about what she talks all that stuff and she just told me not only once really dry ""I have no one to talk about it."" I am her ex. It feels just all so wrong. I want to escape this all and to start new, I might be young but since -8 I struggle with migraines and being accepted anywhere because I was super chubby when I was younger, 1,60 with 80-90 kg. I was just always different as it seems on how I can recall it, everyone liking german rap and all that and I come around there and say ""rock"". I got from everyone bullied. Even from the teachers because I didn't fit in. That proceeded even in middle school. I could not find anyone in my age to be friends with because they always liked everything what I kind of despices, don't get me wrong, I was always up to date with that music there so I might find something I like but I never liked anything there... I always tried to be a bit good with people but It never worked out sadly.

1287,badnerd44,1615495428,1,"I am a 22 yo male. Times really been flying. If it's possible to feel immature and too serious at the same time that's me. I often feel forgotten. I keep everything Inside. I don't even know when the last time I was happy was. I remember being miserable since the age of 10. I used to write horrible ""suicide "" notes that just expressed pure hatred to everybody. Even my mother. I would cry myself to sleep and wake up and throw them away. The only time I was ever going to ever do it, I feel like God Intervened. I been trying to find my purpose but it's a big scary world and I only have myself. 

Fast forward to about 2014. I got my first real gf. we hit it off super good and we were each other's first in most things. I was happy then. I actually would wake up in the morning excited to text or receive her calls and texts. Love notes and everything. This was my best friend. 

We did well. I started to lie. I started to talk to other girls and idk why. I guess I liked the attention. She was always a mind reader and always on my shit. I used to love/hate this. She did find out and she forgave me. I didn't even give a real apology. This woman made our relationship work. I took everything for granted. that's how I used to be. a taker but never give. I am stingy and super selfish. 

I am stingy and super selfish because since age 15 I been tossed out of my house about 3 times. classic kid shit, skipping school or whatever. it's always been me versus the world. This girl was what made it all okay. even when I had to sleep outside, her on the phone would make me feel like everything was all okay. 

We got a place together. she did this for me and I was hesitant to move in with her. Btw she was 2 years older so she was more driven to do these things. I moved in with her and it was great. one day I needed a ride to work and she was all sleepy. she said to take her car and I did. I went to work as a dishwasher on the weekends. I worked a lot to pay her rent. dropped out of school to make sure we were good. And I was an A-B student. my teachers were even sad but it was life. but ok I went to work. before I left they were handing out shots. One turned into idek how many. 1 Minute away from home and of course I crash her car. I called her and she only kept asking if I was ok. I said I was probably going to go to jail but luckily I wasn't breathalyzed. 

this moment was when I could really tell she had to put effort into loving me. slowly . slowly. it happened so slow over the next year we grew apart. I got grouchy and always slamming car doors. I helped her buy a new car but I never felt ok after that. deep down I felt like I let her down and I definitely did but she would have worked through it if I just treated her good.

I was heavily dependant on pot. always smoking and this made me sluggish and lazy. money went to it like crazy. I didn't even realize but I made shit dark. now that I think back I really have the power to brighten up a room or make it dark. it's always dark now. I try so hard but the harder I try the more I feel like I get stuck into a net. I'm stuck in a web and I can't just chill. 

this wasn't supposed to be a whole ass thing on my ex but she was literally around for a quarter of my life. late 2019 we broke up. she had another boyfriend within a week. I feel like garbage because this kid comes from a good family. from decent money. he was able to grow up the way he wanted. he's able to express his happiness better. he was able to go to college. take her to new york and shit.. fast forward to 2021 and I'm still single. I am not even in love with her still. I just drank and smoked my feelings away and I am trying to sober up and it's like my mind just loves to be my biggest hater. I am so sad. I am so mad. I can't forgive myself and I don't even think I should. 

it's hard not to do drugs. I started getting into cocaine and she told me she can't date her father. of course I was thinking what a wuss she was. just deal with it. I don't do it much anymore but she didn't know that. last time we talked I was drinking. smoking. smoking cigs. cocaine. pills. anything. I should've known she was serious about it because she threw out hundreds of dollars worth of my pills before. I ofc started hiding them and I really let her down. 

I don't know if I'm depressed because of this. I felt depressed all my life I feel like it was just time for my depression to kick in. I am at a crossroads right now. when I take a percy I feel good. I am giggly again and my friends say it's like the old me is back. I know how myself works. I keep thinking about heroin. the thoughts coming back more often and it'll keep coming until something is done with this thought. I would rather be addicted to drugs than make everyone around me miserable. I hate thatggirls think I am to intimidating to talk to. I have a miserable face. 

I know I been going crazy because I shaved my head. I had beautiful hair and I can't believe I actually buzzed it all off. it's like my ex couldnt look at me anymore. 

2020-2021 covid has helped in some ways. Im already a hermit and it's nice knowing there's not too much going on in the world that I'm missing out on. ofc it's horrible but I hope.skmeone knows what I mean. I am a workaholic and outside of work I really don't have anything. I been going to the gym because if I don't, I'll just end up in bed. it makes me feel like veil. muscles so tender and I lose my masculinity. 

I am tryin to fight. are mental battles really any easier than a physical one? to me they feel harder. because if I ever am happy it's like my brain will remind me all the reason I shouldn't. my smile just wipes away. 

life is a point of view I know this. I just can't help mydelf anymore. I'm really ready to consider 2 things. to just be a dope addict or to get some therapy. one of the last things my ex said to me was that I needed help. I should see someone. I was so mad. but after we broke up I try to never think bad about her. my heart just isn't in a good place . I feel so alone. I feel like I'll never be the light in the room again . Ive almost died a couple times and I feel like it's damaged parts of my brains. I feel like my intestines are against me. I am ways looking in the mirror and my eyes just look like the eyes of the devil. I can't explain it but I have a dark aura. I am trying to get better. 


this is such a random Wall of text but I had to vent this out today. I would appreciate any kind of advice. if anyone has experienced this stuff I would like to know how you got better. how did you find love again? what made you smile again? how did you choose happiness over money?

A was with her for 2 hours consoling and i walked in and she told me that she was HIV positive since birth due to a bad transfusion of blood while birth and she had to undergo very bad situations and very strong dosages of medicines for that.

1311,codecrunchie,1615480276,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

I live out in the country in Middle-of-Nowhere, Virginia. Everyone my age is a Bible-thumping conservative, or pot-smoking raver. I can't stand either. I get severe migraines from noise, so I can't go to parties or anything. That's forgetting about COVID. I just don't believe I'll find someone. Not in time, at least 

I hate myself. I feel so worthless. She was still in love with her ex and said she'd never been in love with me. I feel like I wasn't good enough to make her forget about him. I'm told I'm not fat, but I feel fat. I can't do high intensity workouts without migraines. I start getting depressed if I can't eat comfort foods like pizza.

I never write in social media, but I feel like I need to write this down for someone to see so I can get a grip of myself.

1375,Delnilas,1615428002,1,"Copy paste from an earlier post I made. Having an especially bad day. Hoping someone might have some magic words.

Feeling a little more suicidal today. I never would. I talk about that below. Just want it to be over. I don't want to work anymore.

""We dated for 7 months, after she broke up with her ex a few months before. She started seeing him again only two months after we got together, telling all of our friends we'd split up. We're young, I'm 21 and she's 20. I fell fast. I thought she did, too.

 I'm not like most other people my age and it's hard to find people I like. I don't smoke, I don't like to drink, I prefer to stay in than go out. I get chronic migraines caused by light and noise, so I can't go to parties or concerts, I even just have trouble being outside on a sunny day. I'm a nerd and love history, books, movies, cartoons, and gaming. The antithesis of everyone you find on apps like Tinder.

My body doesn't help. I'm about 180 at 5'11"", so I'm not overweight, especially since I'm just built broad. But, I've always had a stomach. I've been working for 2 years to get healthier and it's never moved. I hate how I look. Not to mention I'm not well-endowed.

After all of that, I thought I could never find someone. Especially out in the middle of nowhere, where I live. Then, I did. She gave me all this validation and confidence. Then, she started not being around, and my dumb ass ate her excuses right up. I just wanted to be considerate, you know? Understanding of how busy she was.

Then she ripped my heart out.

I've been drinking the last few days to help me relax. It isn't going well. The alcohol just makes me dizzy, and I don't like drinking it in the first place. I thought, maybe putting myself out there would help. Finding other people. So, I got on two dating apps - Hinge (where I met my ex) and Tinder (out of desperation). Got a match on Tinder. Feel like a shallow asshole that I'm leaning away because of her appearance. And I'm also realizing how not ready to move on I am.

She broke my heart. She made all these excuses about how mentally unwell she was to avoid answering my questions. I gave her my virginity. I wanted to know if I satisfied her, emotionally and physically - but she wouldn't tell me. She said she just hadn't moved on emotionally from her ex, and that she never loved me. No one who saw us together believes that, but I can't bear to think of it either way.

Both in the relationship and after, she treated me badly. She was unfaithful to me, then made excuses to avoid awkward questions that would give me closure. She is in the wrong and I deserve better. I know that. But, Jesus I just want her back.

I want her to hold me hold me and tell me everything is okay, that she's there and she has me, so I can just sob and get it all out. But, she isn't here. She won't ever be here again. She won't ever tell me 'everything will be okay' again. My family is trying really hard. My mom hasn't left me alone. Until now. She has a dentist appointment and I'm alone. So fucking alone.

I've thought about suicide - even before the breakup. I've never been very emotionally healthy, due to a lot of things. When she gave me another excuse and cancelled our plans, I'd go for a drive. Take corners too fast. Just hope I'd get hit. I just don't have the balls to do it myself. I've tried to cut myself, I just can't do it. And I feel too guilty. My mom would follow me if I did, then probably my sister, too. I can't be that selfish. But, I go to sleep every night and just pray I don't wake up. Or, at least, when I wake up I'll be free from this nightmare.

I know I need a therapist. I've been trying to find one since I've been alone. It's just freaking me out more. I've had bad experiences with therapists, and I'm terrified of having to explain all of my issues over again so they can try to fix me. I just want it to be over.

After highschool, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me saying she found better than me and had been with him for 1.5 years, abd waited for school to end so i wouldn't expose her as a cheater or get any compassion or anything. 

(Here men are required to go to army after filling 18 years)

 So I was pushed to army with my heart broken and nothing or no one to support me from outside the comcrete walls. 

(due to a certain car crash, the closest person to me is my dad, living 14,000km away from me, whom I last met before highschool)

as a quick summary of my year in army: It was like a possible turn point in my sad life, I gained some friends, childhood dream of becoming a tank commander was fulfilled, I lost 24kg of weight and actually gained a little confidence, Became calm, cold, decicive tank commander and was adored by some. I became the best version of me. I was hoping for them to offer me a job there, since it would've paid okayly kept my mind busy and doing a thing i liked. but no, so that era of life was over for me. 

For the past half year, I have been compeletely alone and eridicated from people ( not counting the 2 times in 3 weeks i go to buy food) My loneliness is crippling me hard since my anxiety is so bad i can't even go to a place to buy myself coffee because i'd have to talk to the xashier or the barista or whatever.. (i've tried going but i just had to turn around as i went full blank). I have no friends left from the highschool time, or the year of army, no girlfriend, or the courage to try and get any of those back or try to make new contacts. 

I used to get happiness from masturbation and playing videogames, but they don't help me anymore.  For the past 6 weeks I've been trying to revive some of my childhood hobbies that i remember i liked, but i cannot afford half of them, and the things i've really tried to put myself into have not brought any result.. 

I still positively believe it's because of my mindset and anxiety+theD(epression) that i think that i deserve to be alone and no one does nor would ever like or care about me. and i don't know how to get out there and find possible friends or to put myself out for a relationship since all this corona stuff started when i was in army and i didn't (and still don't) know how anything works in these times. 

Recently i've started to feel quite hopeless for my level of rationality (that atleast i myself think i have) and have been holding my unarmed empty hunting rifles against me and the idea of leaving doesn't sound so bad. 

If you read this through till here, i really appreciate that, and i want you to know that i value you, whoever you are. This is starting to be my last resorts of trying to reach out to society and try to get a catch of my sanity. 

If you feel like talking or playing gmaes or doing something.. you can dm me.. i am desperate for contact. 

sorry for wasting your time. 

i love you.

There was a time when I could've been your cheerleader. If we had meet IRL then I would definitely hide my problems so I can focus on yours. I'd hide behind a fake smile and an awkward laughter. I'd help you and follow you everywhere to make you happy. 

""Seeing other people happy made me feel a little less miserable..*

But that's why I don't meet people IRL anymore. It's draining. Many people will leave when they see between the cracks in my mask. I was taught to hide my thoughts and feelings at a young age. I quickly realized how simple it is to attract other people. Just smile, be positive and never ever talk about your thoughts and emotions. No one wants to be around a negative person, right? 

It worked for many years. I met my so called ""best friend"" this way. I was always around people but of course, I was never truly happy. I was struggling to cope with one terrible thing after another in my life. Sexual abuse. Physical abuse. Mental abuse. I'm always dealing with trauma. 

a while back I decided to stop hiding behind a smile and now it's just me, myself and I :) 

The loneliness is very bad at times but it is what it is I guess. But I don't want this life. I never wanted to die. I just never wanted this horrible life. I never asked for this. I've never asked for much. I've always wanted one thing- a normal life, surrounded by.. not so abusive people.

Now I don't have any friends and it's better that way.

I guess all the things people are afraid of happened to me. I experienced a lot of ignorance from people in high School.

My best friend (lol) did an work&amp;travel year and was not sure if she should do a farewell party before leaving. I convinced her to do it. Parallel my 18th birthday was coming up. I was just gonna have a big party with family... Not with my friends because I don't have many and those I had weren't good one's as you will see. My best friend Was basically family.
My birthday party was planned at least 4 months ago so everyone could make it. 
When I was suggesting to her making the party I of o course did not think she could be that stupid and celebrate it on the same day.
But believe me she did. She chose to do it on that day of my 18 th birthday party, not because there was not other day left, but because certain people could not come if she was doing it on another day except of me. She just planned it two weeks beforehand s√≥ not much time left.
She even asked me if it was okay via message and I told her it was not and she did not care. Why even bother to ask then? 
I mean how stupid and selfish can someone be? 

How am I supposed to believe I am not worthless if everyone is showing me that I am? Honestly.
I try to believe there is something meaningful in life  but if I can't share it with someone because all I get is feeling like shit from other people then there is nothing left but committing suice. I really don't want to be alone for even one more day but I can't trust anyone anymore. I have no expectations and I am not surprised if someone is treating me shitty.

I didnt think it was anything too out of the ordinary as we all have preferences or prejudices and some may even have had bad experiences with Indians. But as the years passed and more and more conversations dying out, I find it hard to believe that this is normal. It isnt even limited to reddit unfortunately. I‚Äôve experienced similar on whisper, discord servers, tinder etc. 

I‚Äôm well aware of the stereotypes that Indians have on the internet as being too creepy, bad english, ‚Äúsend bobs and vagene‚Äù stuff. But that cant possibly be the reason why this happens, right? You dont stop talking to Americans because they like freedom or guns or Italians because they like pizza or germans because of the world wars (excuse the stereotypes).

The thing that probably hurts the most is when you relate to someone you talk with, they do as well and everything is going great until I get asked where I‚Äôm from and the responses to my answer range anywhere from ‚Äúoh...‚Äù to ‚Äúnice‚Äù and then stop texting or ‚Äúi have to go now, nice talking to you‚Äù to getting absolutely frozen out, ghosted or even blocked. 

I really dont think it can all be because of boring conversations either. I do agree sometimes they are boring. We cant all relate to everyone. But when they stop suddenly after a barrage of texts back and forth, I dont think it can be something else. If it indeed is something else, please let me know because this is so frustrating and ruining my self esteem in real life as well even though I know I did nothing wrong other than apparently being born in the wrong country. 

Once again I completely understand if some people prefer not to talk to people from certain parts of the world or different walks of life. But this happens to me like 7/10 times. In a world where so many people struggle to make meaningful connections and try so hard to fit in, this is so discouraging when this happens repeatedly.

That‚Äôs when I meant my second serious relationship and boy, did we fall in love so hard and fast.

About four years ago I made up my mind to go through with it and that's when best friend at the time, who's currently my fianc√© got me back into believing in God, I guess that's probably why I haven't done it yet... but outside of him I probably have two friends who I'm not close with but I have the ever persisting feeling of being alone.

She said she was busy but I saw her active all the time. I was started feeling left out. I started messaging her a lot. This made me go crazy. I started feeling for the need of more attention from her. My jealousy took a turn. She had a boyfriend. Even tho we were friends, I started having feelings towards her. I started unfriending her again and again to see whether she really wants me as a friend or not. She did friend me back. But I didn't stopped there. I unfriended her and send her friend request again after 5 months. I was missing her a lot. That was a long time....Those 5 months were not good for me. She denied it. I made a lot of Facebook accounts and asked my friends to send her friend request. She denied all the requests and blocked me everywhere. I tried again after 2 months just to say her sorry. She deleted again.

Of course, he'd rather be at school, after all there were pretty people at school the boy would consider, but then there were mean people too. Like Tyler, the slim shady harry potter kid. He always picks on the young boy, calling him names like White (fat) Albert, and hits the boy, sneering and glaring. Maybe he was jealous, because the marshmallow of a boy he was made him cute, at least to a few girls in his class. But not everyone liked the kid either. He was picked on by half the class, and his friend who tried standing up for him got beaten half to death in front of him by the entire school bus. So the boy preferred the quiet life he lived at home. His mother was in the hospital a lot, as she was very ill and his sisters spent a lot of time partying with friends. So the house was his haven, and he had all the delicious food in the fridge to himself. He made sure to eat the half the fridge-full of food every day. It wasn't a happy life by any stretch, but the boy enjoyed his as best he could. At least until second grade comes around. More mean kids, no friends to defend him, the girls that liked him even stopped attending the school. So another year at home for him. But he was hounded by the school to come, so he did regrettably, eating the old food served from the cafe made him very sick every day, so he didn't eat there, and instead gorged upon the yummy contents of the fridge, becoming 60 pounds heavier by the end of the year. He only spent two months in school but the last day reminded him of how his life was never meant to be a peaceful one like he wanted, meeting mystery men and a woman in black suits with a briefcase waiting for him in the counselor's office. What a surprise! Maybe they are testing aliens and think he's a alien! The boy thought that to himself at first. Maybe he would get to make new friends with aliens. But not quite. Instead he was sent to a happy sounding place called Kids Peace, the boy was excited at first hearing those two words together, and followed them into the car, and into the facility. There the boy met many people like him, angry kids, sad kids, happy kids that cut their fingers off. What a weird place this is! The boy thought to himself. He was always asked so many questions from strange adults and one time in the night the boy needed to use the bathroom, so he asked the guard at the end of the hall to open the bathroom for him. He didn't mean any trouble, but the guard was very upset. He didn't like boys very much, he enjoyed spending time on the girls side, the boy heard stories about this guard, sneaking into their rooms, silly guard those are the girl's rooms! The boy told the guard this and to his surprise the guard grabbed his arms and threw him into the timeout room, the worst place of all. There was a old gym mat against the concrete floor and wall, and bars on the one blurry window near the ceiling. There was a camera in the corner and it was very cold. The boy really had to pee, so he laid on the mat counting the fuzz bunnies in the corner next to the centipedes wriggling around. Some time passes and the guard comes in. Mister I have to pee, the boy says politely as he can. The guard looks very angry. Shut the fuck up, he says to the boy, pulling the mat from under him. Piss in the corner he tells the little one before slamming the metal door on the boy's face. The boy didn't know what else to do, so he cried. He cried and cried and peed his pants. He had diarrhea running down his legs as he rocked back and forth on the floor counting the sheep in his head to fall asleep. But the floor was too hard and cold, and the boy was sad and scared and lonely, so he continued to cry till the sun came up. It was a very very long time but even as the sun went back down the boy still was in the timeout room. He spent another night there, and the same meanie guard had the entire weekend shift, through the door the boy heard him telling the other guards not to let him out that he was very dangerous, even though he only asked to pee. The boy that night, hungry, tired, lonely, dirty and scared cried in the dark room for a very long time, his eyes were all puffy and fuzzy and his head felt so light like it was floating, he could hear the happy kids laughing while being held down by the guards, the girls across the hall making funny sounds even though they should be sleeping. The boy asked his special friends to help him. Because once his big sis came down one day in the house saying upstairs was a floating head in the mirror and blood coming out the walls. The boy's mom and big sis spent the night downstairs, but the boy was very curious. He wanted to make friends with the head, and ask the walls to stop bleeding so his family wasn't so scared. He went upstairs that night to look in the mirror. He didn't see any blood or a head, but there was a funny looking girl sitting on the bed. She didn't have a face, it was blank, and her skin was so white it made snow look grey. She had long black hair that covered most of her body, with feathers poking out. She also had dark wings that were half feathery, half bone. The boy was a little scared, but when the girl turn her featureless head to him and patted the bed, the boy listened. He didn't want to lose his head in the mirror after all. She and the boy sat there in the dark for a while, and in that time more creepy things crawled closer, a smiling face without lips to cover his gums and teeth with a body of hands crawled out from under the bed. A hand slit at the knuckles and wrists dripping black sticky stuff filled with wiggly worms popped out from the closet, waving at the boy. A very skinny person with a funny looking rabbit head without eyes and 8 eye sockets appeared from the other room. A stitched up face with one open eye, empty like a void came out the mirror. They all looked at the boy and seemed happy, or at least the boy seemed to think so. He decided to call them all his friends, and saw them from then on, even though no one else did. His mom used to tell the boy when he was a baby shadows liked to dance around his crib, maybe the shadows wanted to be his friend, the boy thought. He didn't have any real friends, so they became his friends instead. And funny things would happen when he would ask his friends for help. So the boy asked for help from his only friends in the dark room he sat in. At first his cries for help did nothing. But, the boy started feeling funny, and the craziest thing happened to him that day. A person came out the wall! The white wall in front of the boy started bulging out, in the shape of a person, and a giant featureless body plopped on the ground. like an octopus, it's legs and arms slid it's body towards the boy. Scared, the boy crawled back against the wall. He was stuck there with something strange. It didn't seem as friendly as his other friends. Maybe it was a meanie like the guards. The boy started to cry again. The thing sprung up, arms and legs twisting into criss cross apple-sauce, although even more twisty, like a pretzel! It sent a noodle hand down on the boy's shoulder and held firmly. The boy was shocked, it was the first time he ever FELT one of his friends before. He expected it to feel like cold air but the heaviness of it's hand made the boy stop crying and look at the faceless head of the thing in front of him. It's face cracked like an egg, ready to hatch. Chips of the face dropped down, revealing lots of pointy teeth, like a shark. Many many rows of sharp teeth form a toothy grin and black sticky stuff oozed out it's newly hatched smile. It made a weird sound, like a person gargling and animal screaming at the same time. The boy then noticed the way the thing looked. It almost seemed like it was... Laughing? But not the laugh the happy kids here make or the laugh the bullies at school make. A laugh of pure joy, like today was the best day of it's life. It sounded more and more like a weird laugh, and the boy couldn't help but smile. He had a new friend, a real friend, one that spent time with him on his worst day and tried cheering him up. The boy began to laugh too. He laughed louder and louder till his sides hurt. The boy started tearing up from laughing, holding his hurting tummy and his new friend's hand. He laughed till the sun came up, and when it did, the thing in front of him started standing, laughing as it crept back into the wall, shadows dancing around it. The boy laughed until he could no longer see his friend. Thanks, Blank, the boy said aloud. He decided the name matched the thing's appearance, so it became his new friend's name. After some time, the door slowly creaked open...

So this is part one of the story of this young pudgy lad. If it interests anyone, I can share part two of his story, it's very long though so more parts would need to be written. Feel free to comment any thoughts on it so far, but know this is barely the beginning of the boy's story, a story of loneliness and friendship, hardships and the evolution of what might be considered insanity, personified.

By the end of 2020, I still loved talking to her and everything, but I felt unsure of whether or not I really liked her.

1491,bipolarpoetry,1615352067,1,"8 year‚Äôs ago today I attempted suicide by taking all my psych medication including 60 klonopins. I was tired of living, felt cornered and alone. With the meds I had been drinking whiskey and had drunk over a fifth. As I took klonopins I had one more giant swig of the bottle and the last thing I remember is darkness. My attempt caused me to develop compartment syndrome. There was definitely a period of time which I felt like I had died. I was alive and stuck in a strange place seeing shadows of figures in the darkness, and I had been asking for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere am I? ‚Äú

All I heard was laughter or comments, one was ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know where you are?‚Äù It was very strange to be in almost a purgatory like state. The shadow figures that people have seen on the internet or in paranormal videos are real; I truly believe that. The last thing I remember is hearing ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you‚Äôre time yet‚Äù and being thrown up into this realm again by 2 black shadow figures. When I came to I felt like I had to go to the bathroom and I went to walk, not realising my surroundings and immediately fell to the left. I realised I lost my left leg above the knee and I had just called out of bed; reopening my stitches, rings, and staples. I had smashed my head to and the last thing I remember was hitting the floor in the hospital. 


It felt like an eternity later that I was awake and been aware in a groggy state, in a lot of pain. They operated on me 24 times to try and save as much of my limb as possible and eventually I had it amputated above the knee. My family made that decision for me. 


I want people to know that suicide is not the answer and after the darkest night there‚Äôs a bright day after that. This is my true story that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing with people in reality, because of judgement. If you‚Äôre reading this and you feel like harming yourself; please reach out to someone. You‚Äôre not alone and suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. 


I really hope this makes sense, sometimes when I write my feelings or story out it feels discombobulated. I‚Äôd appreciate some feedback or anyone who can relate to this.

This is all very impromptu and off the cuff but im so happy rn and there's so much adrenaline that id love to share my experiences in hopes to help those trying to crawl out of the mental rut of being a virgin. First off you can do it!!! It took me 25 years and that whole time every year felt worse and worse as I grew closer and closer to aging without any experiences. Having now done the Deed, i can see its all Bullshit. The fact is when it happens it happens and in the grand scheme of life, nobody cares when it happens. You really cant compare yourself to others, it will just make you feel less accomplished. Just let your own story write itself. The other thing i can say is it takes time and dedication. Ive been overweight my whole life, (and still am for that matter) but i wasn't gonna be complacent with my dissatisfaction. It took me 2 years of working out and like a year of dieting to be where i am. The important thing is to do it for yourself and no one else. I promise that once you start seeing results you will gain confidence and thats really what helps drive your attractiveness to others. Finally id recommend getting on dating apps and get use to rejection. I think my problem mostly was I would get feelings for people to easily and not look at the other 1000s of options right infront of me.

It would be great if I had a genuine friend. Just someone who knows me with a fresh and unbiased view of the situation. But instead, I don't really have anyone to discuss this with.

I wasn't sure if the 'suicide talk' flair was necessary for this, since it's not exactly the same thing, and Reddit only lets you add one flair per-post, so I chose the venting flair. But here's your warning.)**

**^(\~)**

I haven't spoken to my only real-life friend in so long, and I tend to avoid talking to my online friends these days because I'm at a stage where I'm too worried that my negativity is toxic to them. And when that's not a concern, all it takes is for them to talk about how normal their own lives are, and things will become dramatically worse in my head because it makes me reflect on myself.

I already had problems making friends, and spending most of my life between the same four walls due to depression. Now, throw a pandemic in the mix, and it's magnitudes more hopeless. No change of reaching out to anyone in-person anymore when I'm feeling up to it.

Never once been in a relationship - and this is one thing that always follows me around in my head. I turned to self-harm recently to deal with everything on my mind. I've damaged myself so much just to try and comfort myself. It really is pathetic. Anxiety, depression and autism are a terrible cocktail of things to have when you crave some form of sociability.

I get called 'hot', 'cute', stuff like that all the time. Hell, one time, someone out of the blue just told me I looked like a model, so, it clearly isn't because of my appearance (though, I do view myself as hideous, to the point where I feel this affects my ability to play along...). I'm just so immensely envious of anyone who can just... jump in to a relationship without picking themselves apart to the point where they conclude that they're not physically adequate.

I want to deal with my mental state with professional intervention. Therapy. Medication. Something. But doctors are too busy dealing with this pandemic to have the time to deal with mental concerns. Life's terrible. Can't remember the last time I was truly happy with anything.

There's so much going through my head when I try to vent like this. I've tried to do this tons of times. I could go on for hours. So many variables to talk about. But in the end, I end up divulging way too much, and just don't even bother posting at all. So this time, I'll keep it short.

I'm not really looking for reassurance for myself. While it's much appreciated, I'm at a point where I don't think anything will make me feel better. Nevertheless, if you have any words of wisdom for other people feeling the same, I encourage you to say them. Maybe at least someone will find consolation.",lonely,Does it actually get better?

It‚Äôs also been the loneliest scariest time of my life and I still feel like there is a war and chaos of feelings raging inside of me. The loneliness has been the absolute worst. 

It feels like... this deep wound, burning, pulsing, aching, this big hole that I keep a secret and that I put a lid on. Put a lid on because I fear it could suck somebody in, and a lid on because of how deeply ashamed I am about it. Every time I interact with somebody now, I fear that it opens up, that this other person gets sucked in and realizes how lonely and pathetic I really am. It‚Äôs like this wounded growling animal inside of me I hide behind my back and keep on a leash, and when somebody gets close I fear it will attack them. There is also this constant massive shame around it. Shame that they‚Äòll find out how lonely I actually am, that it‚Äôs my own fault, that I‚Äôm uninteresting as a person and provide no value to other people. That they‚Äòll distance themselves from me after that and I won‚Äôt even have the superficial friendship I already had with them.

I need you to get me out of this misery.  I know it's hard for you too, and what you're going through, but believe me, only together can we be stronger.  I hope that you will start coming to me and that we will see each other more often, then I will be able to hug you more often.

So with how this past year turned out, and current one not much different, like many I‚Äôve been feeling very anxious and lonely and I finally feel like I‚Äôm at a stage where I can properly acknowledge it. A recent undergrad, and current working from home I‚Äôm fortunate to be able to live with my family at the moment which does help bit with not feeling lonely. As an introvert and generally not as social, I have a small group of close friends who live either in different city or state. And haven‚Äôt been able to see them in person over a year now.

Before pandemic there were days I would spend hours and sometimes days without any social interactions with friends and such but recently the feeling of loneliness has been really strong everyday. No matter how much distractions or hobbies I try to focus towards, it still feels extremely difficult. I don‚Äôt want to calling up on my few friends everyday and be codependent on them for my happiness because that seems unhealthy but it‚Äôs so hard right now to be alone and just not think about being lonely. I also tried looking into apps for finding friends but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really my cup of tea.

The reason I am sharing this is that, coming from a third world country to US and getting the opportunity to do research is a dream come true. I have suffered from depression during my undergrad and couldn't secure a decent job. My mental health issues coupled with the fact that I was an introvert, I never managed to make good connections or relationships. I was at the lowest point in my life a couple of years ago stuck at a dead end job, seeing myself as another lonely person wasting away life.

But maybe my mother was able to realize my situation, and she urged me to try to apply for higher education. Initially I thought what's the point of doing anything, if I was going to die as another lonely person anyways. But as she kept on pushing I gave in and to my surprise I did get an admission.

Well, funny that I am still lonely, didn't make any significant friends during my 2 years(thanks COVID and my introvert nature) but I feel content. I even got a job in a Tech organization in Bay area recently. This has made me realize, that maybe I am not meant to be in a relationship, but there are other aspects of life that I can probably succeed in.

I wanted to share this with people out there who may have this feeling that just be cause we are lonely we don't deserve to pursue our dreams or goals in life. I would request you out there to take the leap of faith, and pursue whatever you want to in life. Maybe it helps you reach a point of, maybe not happiness, but at least satisfaction.

It's difficult to make female friends. 

Even if you make female friends, they use you and discard you afterwards, because they have too many options. 

Sometimes you do make a good female friend, but you become too clingy and dependent on her that you scare her off. 

All this happens in an early stage of your adulthood. After that you give up on people. 
You are always quiet. There is no passion left to pursue people. The anxiety barrier is too high now. No more. 

You always try not talk to people and avoid conversations for you might get your feelings attached to that person and they might hurt you by their most miniscule actions. Like not calling back, not texting back immediately. You just don't want that hope in your life, for higher the hopes are, deeper you fall. 

You are tired of being used for favours. 
All your relationship are based on the favours you do. Someone only wants your for something you do, or could do for them.
So, you cut such people off entirely. 

Your parents dont care about you. They just want to be done with you. 

Society hates males. 

Life is just too competitive. Everything is a competition. 

Life just seems like an endless chore. You just want for it to finish, but it does not end.

In summary, as a male, you can't talk openly with your male friends, cannot be lucky to have female friends, don't have supportive parents. All you can do is sit in your room being on a rollercoaster of hopelessness and being just hopeful. All the time wondering when will this life just end. I don't want anything, all I want is, for this to end.

You wake up in the morning. You realise that you have restored some hope. You start working and then in the afternoon the hopelessness begins. Again the same journey. You alone with yourself. 

I guess, I just think that grass is greener on the other side. But I think that females do have it better in the 21st century. 

Also, there is always some guy, who wants a girl however un-goodlooking she is. Also girls have a lot of friends, who they can talk to about anything. They have so many options. Being a male in the 21st century is lonely.

I have a neighbor who has son that's around my age group. A super boring dude. A moma's boy. Unable to function without her. I found out from another person that he doesn't know how to ride a bike. I offered to teach him with a folding bike I have around. While I don't like folding bikes, he was short, and the folding bike was the only bike where his feet were able to comfortably touch the ground. 

It took him some convincing because he was saying he was lazy, but I managed to get him to meet me outside. I asked him to show me if he could at least balance. He couldn't. First, I told him I was going to hold on to him while he practiced peddling, so we were very slow because it was at my walking pace. Then I realized that there's a small stretch of slope, so I figured I could just ask him to focus on balance while he let gravity let him ride down. He had a hard time. I told him to ignore the pedals, and just use his feet to push the bike while he was sitting. It was hard for him. I got my other bike and did some examples on balance and pedaling. I offered to let him use mine because I know riding a folding bike throws people off, it threw me off when I first rode it, but the seat was too high for him even though I adjusted it to the lowest setting, so we stuck with the folding bike for him. 15 mins passed, and I'm pretty sure he was bullshitting it because he looked so much more lazy and sluggish than before. 30 mins passed and he said he hates bikes, he was tired, and the pedals hurt him. I told him okay, we're done for the day, and I parked the two bikes back home.

I initially thought to myself that I was trying to do good. Further examination suggest that I was actually looking for an excuse to talk to someone no matter what. I don't dislike the guy, like he's not an incel or anything. He's just boring. He's not very stimulating to talk to.

1643,nahaipe7,1615259882,1,"Hi guys. So a lot has changed in my life recently. So please don't mind the LONG backstory.

 From August to late January, I was in a new country where I barely spoke the language at university. Pretty soon I realized that Id chosen the wrong major/program. Because of how far north the city was and because it was winter, it got light outside after 10am and dark at 2pm, so from mid October till I left, I lived in a world of darkness. My sleep schedule also got messed up, so oftentimes Id wake up when it was almost dark outside already. I spent all my time studying for exams I knew I wouldn't pass and learning material I was not interested in, barely going outside and getting any sun. Because covid got really bad and the regulations really strict (Germany), I barely socialized and spent most of my time alone in my dorm room studying. I also felt generally isolated because of the cultural and language barrier. The teaching there was also horrid --  three hours of nonsensical droning via Microsoft Teams followed by way, way too much homework. Having realized I definitely wouldn't stay past the first year, during this time I applied to different unis and programs and right before Christmas I got accepted to an incredible one! 

&amp;#x200B;

I went home for Christmas break. I was overwhelmed with nostalgia, a feeling of comfort, as well as the fact that I actually woke up at a normal time, could spend time with my best friend, stores were open, it was lighter outside. I felt like a normal person, and that made me realized how fucked up id felt for two whole months in the darkness and isolation of my dorm room. I explained my uni situation to a few friends and all told me that there's no use in staying and I should stay the rest of the semester in my home city instead, working and saving up so I didnt have to take out loans next year to pay for college. I couldnt work in Germany because my german isnt good enough.

 Even so I went back to Germany after Christmas. There, I had to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival so I couldn't talk to anyone. I once again began to wake up after 2 or 3pm and stay awake most of the night. My uni was in a dangerous neighborhood so I would be anxious going out for food or taking walks especially in the dark. But I couldn't seem to help it.  I got so anxious and homesick that I cried for the entire time, avoiding everyone, esp the phonecalls of an obsessive guy ""friend"". I found out my exam grades -- I failed two exams abysmally even after having studied for two months straight. I would be on the phone with my parents for hours explaining that I thought it would be much, much better for me to come home and start at the new uni and program come September. They would try to convince me to stay, we would go back and forth, my mind became a jumble. This went on for nearly a month. When I found out that regulations would be tightened and entering my country would become very difficult soon, I said fuck it and packed up my stuff and left in a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was rosy when I got home for a few days/weeks, and I wondered why I had been so anxious to leave home a year ago. However, after a while it went downhill. I was having trouble finding a job, having gone to four interviews with no success. I was feeling defeated and didn't know what to do with myself so I spent a lot of time watching youtube/netflix, hanging out with my best friend who I hadn't hung out with in almost half a year, reading and sleeping, recovering from multiple months of chronic sleep deprivation and frankly, what was likely a nervous breakdown. I also decided to do a big cleaning of my room, go through everything and get rid of things and clothing I didn't need, reorganize, have been doing yoga for my bad back and finally worked up the courage to attend boxing lessons. Ive also been reaching out to new people, trying to make new friends, and dating a bit. 

Throughout the time Ive been back, my parents and brother follow me around calling me lazy and a failure, and criticizing me for anything and everything. If Im sitting someplace, watching a video or reading, my brother comes out of nowhere and comments something like ""I see your doing nothing with your life once again?""  Apparently Im too messy, the apartment was so much cleaner when I was away. I cause drama, everything was so peaceful when I was away. Im the selfish sister who is doing nothing with my life and distracting my brother from his online learning (hes in HS). Im a bum. If Im doing nothing in my life might as well be less messy.  

My dad throws my clothing on the floor if I leave it in the washer or dryer longer than a few hours. We got into an argument about it, and I threw some clothing in his face. He then proceeded to pin me against a wall and get up into my space. Hes 6ft 3 and 200 pounds and was in the army. Hes threatening. But he called \*me\* violent. Since then he hasn't talked to me, says that he has nothing to talk to me about and I could have another ""violent outburst"" at any moment and hes scared to talk to me. Yesterday I complained to my mother (once) about a concern about my appearance I had (big mistake!) -- and she began to lecture me about the ""fact"" that all I think about is my appearance, I am self obsessed, its all because I'm doing nothing with my life. In fact, it is her educated opinion that  I failed out of uni because all think about is how I look. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend went back  to college, also abroad, two weeks ago. I have two other friends here, but in general Im pretty alone. I feel like a hated in my house. Someone people ignore and avoid. One my new friends told me a few days ago that I seem like one of the nicest people shes ever met. And I dont put up a front. I consider myself pretty genuine in every interaction. However my family call me   violent, unstable, selfish, rude, spiteful, etc, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

1644,pixiefrogpancake,1615259435,1,"I () started college last fall in the midst of this pandemic, and honestly it's been incredibly hard on me. My parents praise me for being strong and doing the best I can in these circumstances, and while I appreciate that, I am the loneliest I have ever been. I'm doing great academically, but I haven't made a single friend here that I've really ""clicked"" with. I just have a couple of mediocre acquaintances. My parents tell me that I'll find my people soon enough; I just have to interact with as many people as I can and eventually I'll find some matches. I like that sentiment, and deep down I know that it's probably true, but I can't help feeling defeated and just sad about the situation. 

I have *never* had trouble making friends, *ever.* I have always been social and friendly, and people generally flock to me because I'm nice and have lots of energy. I like interacting with people, going on adventures, or just hanging out. I had good friends throughout high school, and as I went to small/medium sized school, I was at least acquaintances if not good friends with everyone in my grade and even in grades above and below me. (I don't keep in contact with my high school best friends because I'm realizing now that they aren't the kind of people I want to be around anymore. I met them when I was in a pretty low state mentally, and they were too. Now that I've gotten better, I've kind of left them behind. I just can't relate to them as much anymore.)  

As for outside of high school, I did a summer program in 2019 where I lived in the dorms on my current campus and took a class for a few weeks, and I felt like I fit in and connected with people then immediately. COVID is the only real difference between my experience then and mine now, so is it really just the pandemic that's causing this?? I don't know anymore :( 

My actual best friend (that I still want to keep in touch with) is a senior in high school right now, so she's back in my hometown. We write letters back and forth and text often, and that does make me feel better! But still, I want to have a good social life in college, and have friends that I can engage with in the flesh. 

I guess what is the most discouraging to me is that I am truly trying *really* hard to meet people, and I'm still not getting anywhere. I reach out to people in my classes, I've knocked on people's doors in my residence hall, I've joined a bunch of clubs and even some sports teams... and I have yet to find someone that I think ""hey, I'd really like to get to know this person better and spend more time with them"". All the interactions I've had have been lukewarm and honestly boring. When I do hang out with people, I have some fun, but it's just not clicking. I know that friendships take a lot of work, but with my best friend and some other friends, I at least felt that connection that lets you know that it's worth it to pursue the relationship early on in the relationship, and I'm not getting that at all here. I don't think I'm being too picky either, because if I'm going to spend time with someone, I want to enjoy it and have it be fulfilling for both of us. I just want someone to match my energy and have some similar interests as me. 

I also feel like most people have already formed their friend groups, and now I'm kind of left out. I even ended up quitting the volleyball team I joined because everyone else was already in one friend group, and since I was added on, they ended up ignoring me and leaving me out of everything. I'm worth more than that and I don't deserve to be treated like that, so I left.

I definitely think that COVID is obviously part of the issue that I'm having. It's so so so hard to interact with people and feel like I'm being safe at the same time. SO MANY of the people I've met seem nice at first and then end up being the kinds of people that refuse to wear masks or wear it under their noses,  and I just don't feel comfortable spending time with them in that case. Being safe with COVID and conscientious of others and generally kind is a dealbreaker for me (and I feel like its bizarrely difficult to find people like that when the bar is THAT low??).

I'm just so lonely that there's an actual ache in my chest. I miss feeling like I have good friends by my side and that I'm loved. I'm doing super well with every other aspect of college except for this, and its weighing on me so heavily. College was supposed to be the place where I can find and be myself, start fresh, and build the life and relationships that I want, and it's just not happening. 

Is anyone else in or has been in the same situation? What are you doing/have done to combat this? 

Tl;dr - I've actively tried making friends during my first year at college (during a pandemic) and just haven't clicked at all with anyone, and I'm lonelier than ever.

1655,Falkr__th,1615253522,1,"Met an girl online, she developed feelings for me , i developed feelings for her, and then i decided to open up about it.
We started talking more often because of it, and i was loving to discover her personality, stories, etc etc.
Problem is, i love talking about anything, especially with people im comfortable with, and i messaged her alot, thought it was okay, i asked her if it was annoying her, if i should stop.. But she said it was okay.

Then, it didn't work out, sadly, but thats not the reason im venting.
Im actually very okay about it, what can i do if it didn't work? Its okay, she still is an great person, and i genuinelly wish her the best knowing what she's been going through, but now its me myself and i again, no prob with that.

The real problem is.. Some days later, friends start sending me pictures of her twitter and jesus.. What did i do? 
Now im a stalker, an revengeful person and an loving trauma? God, that hurts me an fucking lot.. 
Stalker and revengeful part ain't even for stuff i've done, now i have a title on top of my head for something i didn't and would never do.. But Loving Trauma? SHIT, THAT fucking hurts me, and it hurts alot.

I have started to notice some changes in my behaviour, in my way of thinking and even on my attachment style.. 
I dont want to be an loving trauma again, i dont want to traumatize somebody, i dont want want to be an bad memory in someone's history.. 

And that is hitting me hard just on the moment covid has basically started all over again in my country.. I can't meet people from my city, and the friends i have from other cities basically dont give a fuck about me

I dont really know what to do, sounds like i am a really bad person to have around, even worse to have intimacy with.

Last time when they matched pfps, it was the 3 of them, Her, her bff, and her mom friend. It was friendly trios from animes. This time, it's just the two of them, matching as Yashiro and Hanako. I thought that they're just friends right before they started matching as it, and now, I'm starting to overthink she'll probably like her, because, you see, the problem with Filipinos is that they could lose interest within a sort matter of time and I'm dating one right now. I'm worried she could break up with me and get with her best friend just because we're not talking much. She talks to me every morning till 9 or 8 am, and gets back on by 5 - 7 pm in the morning. Our time zones are rough, but I dated a Filipino before, and it wasn't that hard. The only mistake I made was ever liking another guy not knowing he has a girlfriend and I just wish, I could probably get back together with her, but my current relationship with my gf is beginning to weaken. I overthink shit too much but this time of age even though, I'm a minor and I know that I know I don't know a lot of worse stuff people been through. Though, she only talks to me when she feels something is wrong and whenever I try to strike a conversation with her, she leaves me on seen and probably starts talking to her best friend, ignoring me. I tried to talk about it with my mom friend,  she says that since she hasn't heard my voice or and I haven't heard hers, she could see me and her as just an online relationship, but at the same time seeing how we both act together, she highly doubts that, and she doubts that she'd leave me so quickly.

I'm turning 19 in a few weeks and I feel as if I am in the worst spot I've ever been in mentally, I've been struggling with loneliness and depression ever since I found my dad dead when I was 9, ever since then I've never felt like I've ever had a genuine connection to anyone in my life, my mum and brothers have felt distant ever since my dad past, no genuine friends, no gf ever and I was kinda able to function normally with these problems up until about a year ago, since then it went from something I would maybe think about every now and then to all day everday and it's gotten unbearable the past few months.

btw these are not the only reasons i feel anxious when it comes to this group. the reason we stopped hanging out was something complicated; i was bffs with one of them and after a while we started dating. then we broke up and we all fell apart. now i'm friends with my ex but at the same time i'm not. we text but never hang out irl, and i caught his lies. also our relatioship has a history of him treating me like shit when i was being nice, however my stupid low-self esteem doesn't see a problem with being a part of a group with an ex like this. i know i'm an idiot and i'm sure you'll say 'bruh' when you read this but, despite my ex i really feel connected to this group.

I do have a partner and we have a little one together, but we have a terribly toxic relationship. I am on my own a lot. When we are actually together or when we speak he makes me feel like shit. I don‚Äôt have anybody to reach out to. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I take my son out to the park and see moms with other moms and I‚Äôm always the only one on my own. No one ever says hi. I only ever speak to my son (who isn‚Äôt even talking yet) or my partner and when he‚Äôs verbally abusive I feel so helpless and alone it‚Äôs physically painful. He tells me all the time he doesn‚Äôt care how I feel and will tell me to stop crying. He tells me to grow up and tells me to stop being pathetic. When this is the only social contact I get it makes me feel the lowest of lows. I am physically stuck in this relationship for the minute due to various reason and have nowhere else to go. Nobody to turn to. 

I used to be very social and work and had friends and I miss it so badly it hurts. I miss social contact and I miss having friends. I find myself physically pining for previous times in my life when I had friends and was happy and it makes me physically ache. 

I am desperately lonely.

1695,throwaway2662625,1615237463,1,"i have no friends and i freak out just by the thought of being around people. also i always feel like i don't fit in, so i rarely want to be friends with someone. but lately i've been wanting so bad to be a part of a friend group that i used to hang out with, and i deeply feel like they are my people. i feel connected to them on every level and i just want them in my life for such a long time. but every time i think about this i instantly get anxious, i start to think maybe i'm just being naive and they probably wouldn't even want to hang out with me. and every single time it ends with negative self-talk. i'm sick so sick of this. because of these stuff i get shy and extremely anxious when i want to approach them.

btw the reason we stopped hanging out was something complicated; i was bffs with one of them and after a while we started dating. then when we broke up we just fell apart. at those times neither of us wanted to hang out with each other again. but now we're kinda friends with my ex but at the same time we're not. we text but never hang out, and i caught his lies. also our relatioship has a history of him treating me like shit when i was being nice, however my stupid low-self esteem doesn't see a problem with being a part of a group with an ex like this. i'm sure you'll say 'bruh' when you read this but, despite my ex i really feel connected to this group. 

what should i do?",lonely,my social anxiety and depression is ruining the possibility of me making new friends,2021-03-09 08:04:23

1698,safiphy19,1615235152,1,"I just a few months old realized that I have a social anxiety and the fact that it has caused me really poor performance at school and building network for my future. I have a really cold relationship with my dormitory mates, and I'm sure they all think I'm weird. 

Since corona, I count I cry at least once every month out of loneliness. The first few months of 2020 were even worse, as I cried every week (but that also because I had depression). I talk everyday to myself, in front of the mirror, or in front of my stuffy animal. Many times I pretend to have a call with an imaginary someone to avoid talking to my dorm mates in the common room. When my loneliness peaks, often I feel physically cold that I shiver. Every night before I sleep, I always fantasize about having someone I can come home to, whom I can hug and talk with - and believe me, that's the best time of the day for me. I like to sit by my window every evening on my bean bag, watching anyone passing by the road and even listening to their conversation - just so that I feel some human exposure. I cried two or three times while eating my dinner on my desk because I never share a meal with anyone since I came to this town. I always feel self-conscious when I shop at the supermarket or when I walk around the park, because I feel people stare at me with pity because I look like a loner. I ate alone in the cafeteria three times, to which on the third time my classmates caught me and I was deeply embarrassed because they knew how lonely I was - so I stopped eating there ever since.",lonely,What's your worst experience being lonely?,2021-03-09 07:25:52

so i‚Äôll try to make this a long story short..
i got out of an extremely toxic relationship a month ago, i wasn‚Äôt happy for awhile. i cried more during the relationship than after the break up. i‚Äôve been emotionally detached since december but hoped he‚Äôd change...

he didn‚Äôt. so i left. i tried so hard but he didn‚Äôt. 

ever since i left him, it literally took a week to find the pieces of me that i lost. my social self, the extrovert who loves to meet new people. the girl who loves to go out, party and live life the way i should at 21. 

however about a week ago, someone caught my eye online. now i know long distance sucks, but hear me out... i already had plans to move to the SAME EXACT CITY as him in june! it was insane. we clicked instantly. he‚Äôs a dj and such a sweet person. i found out about him during a livestream of a set on tiktok. and now we talk non stop every single day.. 

we stay up together until 7am just talking. i‚Äôm so mesmerized. the connection is honestly unreal. we both feel the same way too. 

i‚Äôm flying out to the city he lives in right now for a rave in a month, apparently hes going back to his hometown and FLYING BACK TO SAID CITY THE SAME DAY AS ME. SAME AIRPORT. SAME FLIGHT. we had no idea. literally wasn‚Äôt planned. it feels meant to be, what are the fucking odds? we‚Äôre also going to the same rave too, now together.

call me crazy, i know it‚Äôs only been a week and i‚Äôm fresh out of a relationship, but wow. i just. i‚Äôm speechless. i don‚Äôt feel alone anymore. my ex made me feel ashamed of myself, but this guy has built me up more than a year and a half worth of a relationship.

1716,codecrunchie,1615221970,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

To make a long story short, I've got out of a long-term toxic relationship almost a year ago now but never received any proper closure or an understanding of why it happened or if I did something wrong. I tried to get in contact with him directly and through his family (we were close) but he shut me out completely. I just wanted that closure.

I like to think I've moved on and I'm past it but I can't help but kick myself everytime I think about it. I keep having dreams where I see him again and asking him why he left. Begging for an explanation. Just crying out for answers. It leaves me feeling so fucking exhausted every morning I wake up from those dreams and I hate it. I hate how real they felt, I hate how careless and ignorant he is in all my dreams. Sometimes I dream of him being kind and caring like I thought he was and everytime I wake up I have to forcefully remind myself it was a dream and he doesn't care.

Why I'm here is because I want to ask if anybody has tips on the best way to handle the lack of closure. How do I fully close that door in my life knowing I'll never receive that closure?

I‚Äôve done a lot so far in my life, and a lot of people would look at me and think I‚Äôm happy. Very simply, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve never been because nothing and no one truly affects me. I‚Äôve been a serial over-thinker and analyzer my entire life. When I was a child, as young as I can imagine, I would walk into a room and feel/know/consume the truth behind every word spoken to me, even when it was hidden. I always felt different or over-educated in conversations of any topic. Maybe I am or, more than likely, I‚Äôm not, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because no one truly cares; I see past the smoke and mirrors. When someone offers you help, it‚Äôs not to help you, it‚Äôs to help themselves. Your a pawn just as everyone else is a pawn in some way. The reason I know this is because in my own life I use people as if they are nothing. I create and end relationships with people who become very close to me; yet I still feel nothing. Romantic partners, best friends, or family, I push them all away in the end. I never mean to hurt anyone intentionally but what does one do when they try to fill voids with people or things, instead of self-care. I lack the empathy or emotion to care truly about someone else just because I ‚Äúlove‚Äù them. I‚Äôll say I love them, only to gain things I want. I don‚Äôt love anyone, not even myself. What does that mean? Honestly, I deserve to be lonely, and I am. I‚Äôd rather spend a night alone in my thoughts, ripping my own hair out over it, then listen to people who just don‚Äôt understand me or don‚Äôt care to. I hate but love being alone. I‚Äôm not doomed to be lonely, yet I want to be. I don‚Äôt hate anyone besides myself. I deserve to be lonely, and I‚Äôm sorry for those who thought they knew me, wanted to, or tried to because you didn‚Äôt fail me; I failed and continue to fail myself. I‚Äôm not a loser, just like you aren‚Äôt a loser, but I am not okay. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens to me in the future because while I have endless possibilities, the only one I look forward to is ultimate darkness.

I know that it‚Äôs kinda dumb being so emotionally invested in wanting to love someone when you already have plenty of good friends, a loving family, and a secure job, but it eats me up. And it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why I‚Äôm so fucking unlovable. I convinced myself it was bc I was ugly and came to terms with it, but when I posted on rating subs none genuinely described me as ugly, some even considered me attractive, yet I haven‚Äôt seen someone feel that way about me. So then I have to resort to my personality being vile, but then I realize that all my problems are hidden and not surface level, so it can‚Äôt possible be that women are turned away by my severe mental issues when they have no idea they even exist. I‚Äôve even begun to use dating apps and had like 20 matches but they suddenly lose interest, literally out of nowhere. Not like the convo got stale or ANYTHING, it just ends. Exactly mirrors how it was being with my ex, she liked me for about 2 seconds , then she broke up with me a month after we started dating. And how I always end up befriending a girl I‚Äôm interested in, asking her out, get rejected, which I can deal with itself, but what hits hard is that we suddenly grow apart. I can tell they don‚Äôt give a shit about me in the very least, even though days before they showed they atleast cared a tiny bit. That‚Äôs why with the latest girl that I was talking too, I realized I had feelings for her, so knowing the pattern of how it ends, and noticing how she was texting me infrequently anyway, I ghosted her. I could maybe deal with this loneliness if I knew why I was lonely, like if I was ugly, an asshole, or literally anything that‚Äôs a red flag, but there‚Äôs nothing. I feel like atleast on the outside I‚Äôm  a regular person yet everyone I know is having casual relationships with many people or in committed ones, and here I am, not even used as piece of meat, like people don‚Äôt even want me in sexual relationships!

People always say that your early 20s and college will be your best time. 
It‚Äôs basically the worst time of my life. 
I‚Äôm studying something like laws so even before the pandemic started I was already drained and had 0 energy. 
I think my problem is that I‚Äôm actually ambitious and want to be a good student. At my college it‚Äôs basically impossible to get really good grades bc they‚Äôre so strict (the average are like 4-6 from 18 points).
So I learn all day and invest my free time and in the end I don‚Äôt get a really good grade. It‚Äôs frustrating.

But when the pandemic started it even became worse. For one year I had online classes and was sitting from 8am till 5pm on my desk. 
After that I have watch TV or just lay in my bed.
I‚Äôm all the time tired and everyday feels the same.
I think my family and online friends don‚Äôt really know how bad I‚Äôm actually feeling (I‚Äôm not suicidal tho)
I mean I was never a really happy person but now my mood is worse than my usual indifference.
My negative feelings always affected me more than positive ones.

I keep hoping that I will be one day actually satisfied with my life but when I realize that I will be 20 next month I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being realistic.
I know people will say that I‚Äôm only 19 and my life just started but I know myself I like to stay in my comfort zone and rather complain than do something.
I kinda hate how ungrateful I am. I don‚Äôt have health issues, my family is okay, I have a place to sleep,..
I actually should be happy. But I‚Äôm not.

I have friends, but the anxiety of interacting with people turns me away. I'm attending school remotely and can't be bothered to get on Discord or anything. Why do I keep doing this to myself.

I took a photo of myself today and all I could see was the crooked smile that looks like I'm trying too hard, the hair that falls flat, the ears that stick out different amounts and the overall loser looking back from the screen.

I get anxious about my health. I workout daily, eat full meals with good ingredients, and have been on the protein grind for years, but I feel as if a random joint in my body clicks every time I move. I hate it. Thankfully, no serious issues are present with my health. That's something to be grateful for every day.

I wonder who'll see anything in me.

I have this old group chat with 3 friends from school. We used to all be idiots, but now all of them are happy with their girlfriends, and I'm the classic last man standing. I acknowledged this today and felt pity for myself. It quickly turned into a pang of frustration and inward anger.

Am I condemned to this cycle of feeling lonely, trying to change, not seeing results, feeling sorry for myself, and getting lonely again?

What am I even pursuing connection for? Is it to genuinely feel close to someone and grow with them? Or is it just a means of proving to myself that I'm not a complete waste of space that can't make anyone happy?

I've backspaced all this so many times feeling as if my concerns aren't real problems.

You are going to feel alone, a lot. You are going to feel bad about yourself, a lot. I‚Äôm so tired of people telling me life will get better. The whole point of this existential shit show is that it‚Äôs a grind.

But... a few weeks ago... I met the most amazing person. I never thought i connect with someone like this. Never thought I deserved it. Just look at my fucking post history, it‚Äôs literally me being a sad fuck most of the time. And you know what? Life still sucks. Quarantine still sucks. Family still sucks. Working still sucks. Finding someone to hold isn‚Äôt going to fix all your problems or solve your crippling loneliness, but it did make me realize something important. Just because life sucks, doesn‚Äôt mean I have to. Just because The world is fucked up doesn‚Äôt mean I have to be. Just because everyone‚Äôs putting me down doesn‚Äôt mean I have to as well. Because we all have the power to change. And it‚Äôs ok if takes some time. A day, a week, a month, a year, 5 years... it doesn‚Äôt matter if it takes your whole life... never forget: You are changing. You are capable of changing YOUR world. 

I know my loneliness is not behind me. I know my depression is not behind. But I‚Äôm finding a lot of hope in this weird newfound revelation that... maybe the world doesn‚Äôt actually owe me anything, and maybe that‚Äôs ok.

We would fall asleep every night together. Wake up to each other. Wish each other off to work and welcome each other back once we were off work. We didnt live together or anything. But we just always kept in contact. Nothing toxic. We still had our own social lives and respected each others personal time. But suddenly she ended it a few days ago. I have no idea why. Her reasons would keep changing when i would prompt her to just comminicate her feelings to me. I trust her so i fully believe her mental illness is just destroying her currently, as she has always suffered from issues but never followed through on getting help. That being said, we split up. She was my best friend for over a year. And now i just feel so sad without her there. I understand i will get over it. Im content. I just feel so lonely now that shes not there anymore.

I'm lonely. Like deeply fucking lonely. When I was younger (early 20's) I would sometimes go online and talk to women online and get to know them, then as we got to know each other things would turn sexual. I have lots of hangups about sex and it was empowering to be able to openly talk with someone about sex, to share porn , and chat while masturbating with them.

As time went on that got harder to find and understandably so. They were not healthy friendships in all likelyhood but we were both lonely and enjoyed it.

I feel empty inside. I miss having someone to talk to like that despite knowing it probably wasn't healthy. I miss hearing a womans voice talk to me and I miss getting to know someone.

1792,RatingsOutOfTen,1614916800,2,"Hey, everyone.  I posted here a few days ago.  I've texted some friends, but I always have this lingering sense if being alone, and the conversation being meaningless.  I think I'm a bit conceited, so I often go out of my way to try to reverse uno that feeling by asking about other people.  Sometimes its nice to hear, but life is so boring lately for both myself abd other people.


I'd like to have a friend to garden, or hunt mushrooms, or spar with, or search for treasure with a metal detector or bake with or something.  It seems like my women friends only want to eat and play on their phone. So thats boring to me, plus I don't really like buying myself food I could just make at home and dealing with driving and wearing a mask and all of that.  And my male friends just aren't as concerned being alone, so I often spend days alone exercising and drinking beer.  

It feels like I'm just existing.  I planted some onion and leek seeds that I'm excited to see sprout... But I can't just sit and wait for that to happen.  It takes too long.

I sort of want to talk to a neighbor.  Maybe trade some plants with them, but I never got to know them when I moved in.  So that makes things hard.

I never really was able to have close friends.  I even have a hard time being genuine and fun around people.  I feel the most complete when dating and its relatively stress free with me, but then conflicts often happen on intolerable arguments make me want to break up with her.  I even have an ex wife.  I just couldn't stand how she treated me so I had to lecture her about being a good Christian woman until she left.  It took weeks and a lot of Bible reading, but she left finally.  I've kind of just learned that love and a real relationship is unrealistic for me, which is okay.  

Nothing feels worth doing anymore, but I still do everything I need to do like cleaning, exercising, asserting myself if challenged, refreshing my crypto page, going to work, and doing hobbies.  I am kind of lazy though.  Its hard to do something when it feels like there is no reason to do it.  I don't have a real sense of direction.  Where does that start?  It gets tricky.  

I feel like I want some closeness like maybe a big dog or something to use as a pillow.  I'm too poor for a dog, though.


I worry a bit for fun about AI, politics, and future technology.  I wonder if that causes my loneliness.

If anyone wants to chat or recommend some ideas ti me, I'd be interested to read it.

Thanks guys.",lonely,"I find people to talk to, but never close friendships. No wrastling partner yet.",2021-03-05 15:00:00

No one would ever propose to me, I'm not lovable like that, I'm not enough as a person to be seen like that. Pointless dead-end flings and relationships over and over again, why am I not good enough to be wanted in that way? Not good enough for anyone to want to just try.

I‚Äôm totally alone.
But at least i met a special girl.

I don‚Äôt have friends at school: when lessons finish my classmates always go out to eat something. The situation is the same in my swimming team too... nobody talks with me.

This Sunday, a girl in my flat invited me to a picnic in a park with his friends ( i live in Italy in a region where covid isn‚Äôt as severe as other areas here ). I wanted to say no, but i decided to push myself out more, and see how it would have gone. She didn‚Äôt initially want to invite me with his friends... but her parents knew i am alone so they convinced this girl to invite me to the party.

We had a very good time, we played a lot and talked too.

( ofc, we tried to keep distance and to wear masks, apart from eating ).

When the day ended, i went back home with her, she told me she was happy that i was at the picnic, and then she hugged me. It made my heart melt... nobody ever treated me like that and i felt really special ( i‚Äôm very sensitive )

Now, I‚Äôm back to the normality. This girl rarely replies to my messages, but that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs very busy ( she‚Äôs plenty of friends and she‚Äôs never at home ).

I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts rn. I usually feel like i‚Äôm a weight for people, like i‚Äôm boring and not interesting in general ( i‚Äôm not handsome too ). Psychotherapy isn‚Äôt helping, and i‚Äôll probably have to take medicines later on.

I was sick and had to miss the first half, got a COVID test so don't worry I wasn't spreading anything. I wore my prettiest casual outfit, I didn't care about makeup cause I felt kinda shit and I didn't sleep well. But that's ok I was mainly there to learn maths shit.

I'm doing law and accounting and it's my second year. Last year I did my first year of law all online so it's different being back. First class though I just stood on the balcony staring up at some tall trees. It was really beautiful, a nice day.  I really enjoyed it and all the shit things that happened weren't really caused by things I did. I feel lonely but I liked just staring at the trees. 

Weird but I'm not sad or happy, depressed or anything just there. I'm ok, not great but not terrible. I'm content and you know that's enough for me. Sure I'm lonely but I have a few friends and my dog. I just got my license finally so been trying to get out more. Discussed with my uni to help assist me with my medical condition so that was a big relief. I miss my grandma, but I think I'm getting used to her not being around anymore. I got Diluc in genshin while trying to roll for Xiao and now my team is doing pretty good, almost got him maxed out. I felt like playing Valorant so did that for an hour, I think I'm a pretty good for someone who hasn't played shooting games since Halo 4 on xbox. I might buy myself a nice top but its like $50 and I had to buy a bunch of textbooks that hurt to buy. I was going to buy myself the LEGO bouquet set but it's like $80 and all my tests are open book so better to get hard copy. I got some good discounts though so little victory there. I got to use my new folders too, they're punchless ones so I just slip those bad boys in. So easy to use I love it. Really hate punching holes and all those plastics sleeves annoy me. I was a bit embarrassed about my pencil case, it's so stupid but it reminds me of my dog and I got it for like a $1. I had mash potato for breakfast, that was pretty cool. Dumplings I had today kinda sucked arse but I just watched Wandavision outside. Guy next to me kept looking at me though, maybe I did look pretty? Doesn't matter, I felt pretty and that's all that matters. I just hope he didn't notice I gave up when it came to my shoes, I have to walk a bit so wore my comfy shoes.

1878,tanktopped,1614867412,3,"Hello all! I just wanted to vent a little bit. Things have been a bit tough for me the past couple of months.

So, a couple months ago, I immigrated to another country for school and work purposes. (I was deemed essential, yay!) I was really looking forward to it, and I do still enjoy the change of pace, but it's really lonely.

With the pandemic and all, I had to quarantine in total isolation for a couple weeks, which was fine. I had people I could speak to, but I did go a little bit crazy. I don't think I ever really recovered from that. It's just this sort of desperate feeling to be around anyone. And because of the pandemic, people have been really closed off, so I really haven't been able to make friends yet. Even when I say something to someone at a grocery store they're just antsy to leave, which is fair. I guess I've tried dating apps too, but the scene here is a little lousy. (Not that there aren't plenty of fish, there's just a lot of dealbreakers.)

I think what's made me feel especially lonely lately though is quitting a lot of drugs I was taking. I stopped drinking first and foremost. It made me feel lousy so I decided that I didn't need that in my life. I quit the benzos I was taking next because of a traumatic experience where I was forcibly deprived of them. Then I quit the anti-depressants I was taking because they made me seriously ill in a multitude of ways. All three caused a lot of hallucinations. Visual, auditory, tactile, what have you. And while physically I've overcome withdrawal, I can't help but miss the feeling of hallucinating. It sort of made you feel like someone was there with you and it really did help me when I was living alone during the pandemic (the first time). Admittedly, I started taking edibles in the meantime, but that hasn't so much helped with the feeling of loneliness or letting me hallucinate so much as it just feels good to take.

A lot of people have been pretty supportive of me. I have a wide variety of online friends and family from the States who have been awesome about things. But at the same time, I feel so far away from everyone. Being in another country feels like being on another planet sometimes, especially with the pandemic. And I also wish I could make them realize just how isolating everything is, just so they'd understand and there could be a little bit of a deeper connection.",lonely,Been brewing up quite the cocktail of loneliness lately.,2021-03-05 01:16:52
1879,[deleted],1614867396,10,"Long time reader, just made an account to finally ask this question. (Please be kind) 

I‚Äôm in my mid-20s working on my PhD. I‚Äôve been published and received appointments/fellowships/positions from nationally acclaimed organizations. I‚Äôm bilingual, well-traveled, and proudly open-minded and accepting of all the world‚Äôs cultures and different kinds of people. I rescue animals and also work for a local initiative connected to racial justice. In other words, I don‚Äôt see myself as anyone special, but I do have a full life and a lot to offer to potential friendships/relationships.

The problem: I joke with my mom all the time that I‚Äôm basically a leper. People are disgusted by me, of all genders and races and ages. When I reach out, the hand gets slapped. It‚Äôs hard to even try to interact socially at all anymore, as I constantly expect cruelty. I‚Äôm close with my mom and her friends (my dad and many other family members passed years ago), but I don‚Äôt always come around because I don‚Äôt want to impose on her life, you know? I know she doesn‚Äôt feel that way, but I want to be respectful. 

If someone does give me a chance, it‚Äôs always a man (I‚Äôm a straight/cisgender woman). Of course I know why this is. It‚Äôs based on physical qualities and in expectation of sex. Like all of my women friends up to this point, they‚Äôll drop me as soon as they get/realize they won‚Äôt get what they‚Äôre after. Every woman friend I‚Äôve ever had (I try all the time at school and ask people to go for coffee or meet to talk about class ‚Äî ALWAYS NO, every single time) has left the friendship without explaining why. That‚Äôs obviously their right, but I feel like I deserve at least a short explanation and never receive one. Since many of my family members have passed or are estranged from me (lots of addicts, etc), I feel a need to connect with people outside of my family. I just keep failing miserably with both romantic and platonic connections. 

Based on this information, what do you all think I may do differently? I‚Äôm a researcher and problem-solver. I know this is largely on me and want to take steps to change. I have absolutely no friends, and my fellow graduate students and even most professors seem to sour to me immediately. Any man or potential friend who initially shows interest in me always disappears. There is no confrontation or event to spur this. It just happens.",lonely,Please help,2021-03-05 01:16:36
1880,art_forlingling,1614866365,3,"""There's this analogy I really like because it demonstrates helplessness well. It goes along the lines of this:  There is a huge fire, and you are trapped on the top floor. As the fire gets closer to you, your neighbors shout from below that help is on their way. 

 You try to move away from the fire, but you're already at the edge. You know that the firefighters are coming, but you start to doubt if they will arrive on time. A dreadful question pops in your mind, ""Am I going to die in this fire?"" 

 You don't want to die. More specifically, you don't want to be burned alive. As you look back towards the fire, you are convinced that jumping is a better alternative to being burned alive. However, while you are steadying yourself to jump, your neighbors are shouting, ""Don't jump! They will be here soon!""  

 You really don't want to die. You try to hold onto hope just like how your neighbors are hoping for your safety. You tell yourself you shouldn't think about jumping. But as you wait and wait, you start to feel pain on your back, and it feels like the only choices you have is to do nothing and be burned alive or choose to jump and escape from the fire.""",lonely,"From YogurtWithBerries, a comment on youtube.",2021-03-05 00:59:25

Or a group of friends you can just call up and hang out with anytime of the day. I have fun all by myself. I go solo-traveling and meet some really interesting people. We exchange numbers or email ids but we loose touch once we get back home &amp; get comfortable with our daily lives.

I never really asked any of my friends ""shall we go watch a movie"". I always thought they will be busy for such stuff and it feels weird to suddenly ask such a thing. I dont really call people and cut ties with everyone from my graduate studies because i just never enjoyed hanging out with them. Either they're outright mean or sarcastic in a hurtful way.

I eventually made some friends on internet but because of some incidents in 2019, i cut all of them again. Except for one person. She too leads a lonely sad life. She vents out in my messages. She reaches out to me so I can help her through her tough times. I always assure her that I'm going to be there for her. But it becomes so hard after a point.

I too have many things to share and I constantly feel frustrated. But I dont reach out to her. I just feel I'm going to get her more worried than she was before with her own problems. It gets all piled up.

I have a boyfriend with whom I share some of these things. But I know he is only a person like me and he too cannot handle too much of this venting stuff. He suggests some things to do but I fail to do them. He constantly suggests things to do instead of simply listening. Now I understand it's a boy thing. So i never really ask him to *only* listen.

Eventually i stopped sharing these stuff with him. Now I have no one to turn to. I recently had a fight with him. Although these fights seem silly when you study them individually, they're happening more frequently. The fight is still continuing. We didn't text each other for over 3 days now.

I jump from one social media app to another and nothing. I just feel so lonely.

1912,Ok-Measurement4169,1614839020,5,"I feel utterly alone in this world. Since Covid my husband became depressed and stopped working. I try to be the breadwinner of the house but with no college degree or no dick between my legs I am left with scraps for jobs. Uneployment wont pay my husband because he quit his job before they could fire him. I am part of the Army National Guard but honestly I only feel more alone from it than not since we had not had a single in person drill since 2020.
I am 27, he is 29. We have a mortgage thats deferred (thank god), dogs and no kids. With what is happening and how we are handling it I am sure kids will never be a reality even though I often times fantasize it which makes me feel worse.
I try to keep my mind busy like writing stories to keep me at peace but the things I write sometimes makes me hunger for more in my life. And it is not possible. I can go into that but it isnt a glaring issue for me right now. 
One day, my husband grew increasingly agitated after a job search. I tried to help him come up with solutions and I am a big fixer so sometimes I do get extreme in my suggestions. (Examples like sell the house) He only spiralled from this making comments like ""he should just give up or die"" etc.
He has used these words before and that day I felt like he was only saying this to try to control the situation. That day I was getting ready for my 1st shift of the day.  I felt cheated that he was so ready to give up on everything that we worked so hard for even more so because I am still trying really hard to keep us afloat so I said, ""Ok we sell the house and you can live with your mom. I will leave.""
This is the  first time witnessed my husband punched a hole in the wall because of my comment. I was alarmed but not scared from this, I stayed there to watch what I call a adult temper tantrum. 
Its okay to be angry, and I will agree that I was wrong to try to goad him the way I did. I am not scared of him but since he did that we have ultimately avoided talking about it without any mediators. We are actively seeking a marriage counselor/ therapist to try to understand each other better... even though we have been together for 8 years.
I have my doubts with some of the therapists around here. He has been struggling to land the right one since he started seeking help many months prior and some of them only made him worse. But we really need someone who can give a fuck just bit! You know not so much that they overreact but not too little that they are just parroting whatever you are saying.
I can't lie that I am deeply affected from this event, this ugly dot of our lives. So much so that I failed to notice a mandatory online meet and greet for my virtual leadership training or better known as BLC. Granted, it was outside my report date but now I am anxious that I ruined my chances to pass it. 
I couldn't even get in contact with anyone since it was so late. I mean, all my pre-requisites are completed but because I missed the online meeting I failed to know the hit times now.
My life feels so overwhelming I am up all night just thinking about all the fucks ups in a span of a few days. And the more I stress the more I fuck up.
I dont have friends in life since I have the worst trust issues and I my family live very far away. In laws are nice though I think they are aggitated with me since I don't share my inner most feelings to them either. They know what is going on with my husband my feelings don't matter. I am scared that I will reach a dead end eventually and I will be forced to make a very hard decision... or I might die from the stress.

I‚Äôve started to think that I‚Äôm just not capable of the same relationships everyone else is a part of, or that I‚Äôm missing some key lesson someone forgot to teach me.

I know everyone's got to live their own lives, but sometimes I wish old friends would make at least a bare minimum of effort to reach out to me, like, ever.

Not ""You can come around any time!"" which while appreciated, is just another way of passing the buck. It's a zero effort, zero commitment way to alleviate feeling bad over a friend's bad circumstances.

I've always made the best effort I could to keep emo bullshit away from friends and make the experience positive for everyone. I have never in my life wanted to be ""that guy"". So I generally stay away from people when I'm really down. That is sadly habit forming. Really, I would hope my good friends of many years would have enough emotional intelligence to clue in that my absence isn't a lack of regard or a personal insult but a genuine problem I'm trying to deal with and could really use some help with.

So I decided to do what everyone does to get over his ex
Drinking all night multiple sexes, eating junk food, crying while eating ice cream ( I used to close my eyes and imagine her so I can function) 
After this period I didn't forget about her yet however, I decided to move on and start a new chapter so I went back to college after 2 years 
I started to eat healthy, going to the gym losing a ton of weight gaining a lot of muscle, doing no fap, read a shit ton of books about loving your self , self steam ..etc 
However, I still miss her so fucking much , she blocked me on all social media accounts and I deleted all her picture from my phone and I cried because I deleted all of her pictures from my phone 
With that being said I decided I have to get bigger, be stronger and forget about her 
So I'm using all my anger, pain, depression in the gym, and I'm getting bigger week by week I felt unstoppable, strong as fuck, huge 
Here is the bad part now  I meet a new girl she is funny and cute however she has the same bad attitude as my ex but I started to fail in love 
Because she remains me of my ex then I took the advantage to start doing the same shit so I can regain the same fucking existence as I'm with my ex 
However, the way I tret the new girl was very over like I was afraid of losing her so I will do whatever she asked for, bring her gifts, do anything even if it affects my life or my school or the gym she is sabotaging me mentally as fuck 
I feel a shit ton of rocks hits me every second 
And she started to take advantage of me and make me feel like dog shit all the time 
And I don't want to lose her even if she doesn't love me, or want me 
I don't want to be alone again

But I decided to make one to get something off my chest. To put it simply, I feel pretty lonely ~~at the moment~~ for the most part of my life.

Never had a relationship, never experienced real intimacy with anyone. I even have trouble maintaining friendships growing up, I'll eventually distance myself from them because I thought they'd probably be better off without me. I also had some bad experiences with my friends back in high school, I accidentally found out that the people I considered close friends talk behind my back so that's great. 

Even my current group of friends (they're my old roommate's friends) is lowkey toxic, I would rather talk to them in a vc just so I don't have to spend time alone by myself even though I know I would have a bad time anyway.

I recently found someone to talk to and I thought it was going well until that person just ghosted me. I even @ them in case they prob didn't see my messages but still no response and I stopped messaging them because I don't want to bother them. I probably messed up accidentally, can't blame them really I would ghost me too if I were them. I'm not good at maintaining convo but I swear I'm trying my best.  I've also been told that I'm a good listener but that prob because I just don't know what to say most of the time.

I have the tendency of opening up about my mental health once I get comfortable with someone and I've been hurt before, like people would distance themselves from me. So I promised to never make the same mistakes again, now I'm feeling even lonelier than before and I crave that intimacy that most people seems to have.

1982,chrissyks_17,1614804084,3,"I'm currently in nursing school &amp; just started my first semester in January. One of the reasons was  I excited to get accepted was to make friends because everyone always says that you make strong and lasting friendships in nursing school because you see each other every day for 2 years.  I've always had trouble keeping lasting friendships because a majority of people that I became friends with in high school and early college ended up becoming acquaintances after our classes that we had together were over. I would always try to keep in touch, but it was never the same the other way around. So I've always felt like a forgettable, nonimportant person.

Anyways, I  became friends with these two girls (let's call them Leah &amp; Racheal)  really fast whom I really like and we formed a little friend group. When we first started talking I was worried because even then Leah talked more to Racheal than me. Leah was nice to me and still is, but you know, I felt like I wasn't necessarily as important to Leah as Racheal was I guess. Anywho, I ended becoming closer with Racheal than Leah because we have SO much in common and even acted the same. I was just happy to finally have a good friend. Eventually, though, that changed.  Leah became closer to Racheal. Now I'm the ""background"" friend. I feel so left out and when the three of us are together I feel like an outsider like I shouldn't be there, especially when they'll talk to each other as if I'm not there. They'll even leave me behind and go somewhere else.  I'm thinking it's maybe because they are in the same study group, Study groups are my thing, so I study at home), so they spend some time outside of class together and with the other members of their study group. They're still really nice to me and everything, but I don't know, this just brings me back to every other friend group situation that I've had in my life. I'm always the least important or the background friend and that's how I'm feeling about this situation now. It's SO frustrating and is really taking a toll on my mental health. I'm friends with many other people in my nursing cohort, but these two people are the ones that I talk to the most, and everyone already has their friend group too. Even though I'm surrounded by so many people, I still feel so alone. But anyway, I honestly don't like friend groups of threes because stuff like this happens. :( 

Sorry for this long paragraph. I've been holding this in for WEEKS and have no one else to talk to...needed to get this off my chest. And nursing school is already SUCH a pain as it is...this is adding to it. :( Maybe I'm overthinking, idk.

1994,Delnilas,1614798362,10,"We dated for 7 months, after she broke up with her ex a few months before. She started seeing him again only two months after we got together, telling all of our friends we'd split up. We're young, I'm 21 and she's 20. I fell fast. I thought she did, too.

 I'm not like most other people my age and it's hard to find people I like. I don't smoke, I don't like to drink, I prefer to stay in than go out. I get chronic migraines caused by light and noise, so I can't go to parties or concerts, I even just have trouble being outside on a sunny day. I'm a nerd and love history, books, movies, cartoons, and gaming. The antithesis of everyone you find on apps like Tinder.

My body doesn't help. I'm about 180 at 5'11"", so I'm not overweight, especially since I'm just built broad. But, I've always had a stomach. I've been working for 2 years to get healthier and it's never moved. I hate how I look. Not to mention I'm not well-endowed.

After all of that, I thought I could never find someone. Especially out in the middle of nowhere, where I live. Then, I did. She gave me all this validation and confidence. Then, she started not being around, and my dumb ass ate her excuses right up. I just wanted to be considerate, you know? Understanding of how busy she was.

Then she ripped my heart out.

I've been drinking the last few days to help me relax. It isn't going well. The alcohol just makes me dizzy, and I don't like drinking it in the first place. I thought, maybe putting myself out there would help. Finding other people. So, I got on two dating apps - Hinge (where I met my ex) and Tinder (out of desperation). Got a match on Tinder. Feel like a shallow asshole that I'm leaning away because of her appearance. And I'm also realizing how not ready to move on I am.

She broke my heart. She made all these excuses about how mentally unwell she was to avoid answering my questions. I gave her my virginity. I wanted to know if I satisfied her, emotionally and physically - but she wouldn't tell me. She said she just hadn't moved on emotionally from her ex, and that she never loved me. No one who saw us together believes that, but I can't bear to think of it either way.

Both in the relationship and after, she treated me badly. She was unfaithful to me, then made excuses to avoid awkward questions that would give me closure. She is in the wrong and I deserve better. I know that. But, Jesus I just want her back.

I want her to hold me hold me and tell me everything is okay, that she's there and she has me, so I can just sob and get it all out. But, she isn't here. She won't ever be here again.

I've thought about suicide - even before the breakup. I've never been very emotionally healthy, due to a lot of things. When she gave me another excuse and cancelled our plans, I'd go for a drive. Take corners too fast. Just hope I'd get hit. I just don't have the balls to do it myself. I've tried to cut myself, I just can't do it. And I feel too guilty. My mom would follow me if I did, then probably my sister, too. I can't be that selfish. But, I go to sleep every night and just pray I don't wake up. Or, at least, when I wake up I'll be free from this nightmare.

I know I need a therapist. I've been trying to find one since I've been alone. It's just freaking me out more.

Sounds great, right? I made this to tackle a lesser-known psychological condition called skin hunger. Yes, it's called skin hunger. In fact, I have it.

2047,Gundivar,1614757976,1,"Hello,

I am a 37 year old Nurse from Belgium and I have a problem.

I recently got out of a very bad relationship and divorce is till going strong, Wife wants to take the kids, the whole nine yards. But the problem isn't mine.

At work I got to know a new friend. She is here from another country for a fellowship for about 2 years. She arrived just before Corona hit and she knew noone in this country, noone wanted to meet with her due to Corona so she has been here in the country completely on her own with nothing but work to keep her busy.

We started talking over messenger after we met on the work floor and we hit it off straight away. In about 48 hours we had a total of 1000 messages exchanged. I took her for some walks to get her out of the house and get her some social interaction besides just work and we even had a dinner at her place.

Last week she had a complete breakdown, she called me at 22u00 whilst crying about several things. I jumped in my car and I drove overthere (we live 10 minutes apart). I comforted her a while while she just cried and talked about all the things that happened. ( Mostly stuff relating to her country, harrasement by colleagues, threats and stalking). She felt a bit better after that when I went back home.

The next day she was very quiet, she hardly messaged me and when she did respond it was just one or two word sentences. This kept on till Thursday. On Friday she returned to her country for the weekend to take care of somethings like  insurance, her car and other stuff. Friday afternoon she sent me a message that I had to delete her phone number, delete all messages, delete all photo's. Eventually she told me she wanted to keep on talking to me but I couldn't keep anything that could be found by my ex (which is not possible as I changed all accounts) because she was tired of people calling her a ""whore"" (She apparently got threats of that sort earlier in the week from ex- coworkers).

I hardly heard anything from her during the weekend and on monday(she still had a vacation day).

Then tuesday (yesterday) rolled around and she called in sick for work. I heard nothing. She responded to one of my messages with ""I HAVE to do this alone. Because I am ALONE. Noone wants to or has time to spend with a stranger"".

I sent her several text messages that she does not need to do this alone, I am willing to help her through this. I have told her I'm willing to talk to her, willing to just sit there and listen to her or even to just sit there in complete silence. I tried calling her several times and she just refuses to pick up. She feels alone but doesn't want to see anyone so she doesn't have to feel alone. I couldn't go overthere yesterday as I had my kids and I can't leave them alone at the house. TodayI don't have the kids and I'm thinking of just showing up. If she refuses to let me in at least I tried,...

I really want to help her because I can't stand to see her suffer like that. But it's not all selfless. She has helped me get over the last 3 years of my marriage. Talking, walking and just spending time with her is the first time I felt happy again in 3 years. So I don't want to see her suffer and I don't want to lose the friendship. Because as much as she seems to need me (Or just anyone really) I need her too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss.

Does anyone have any idea or tips on how to try and get her to invite people in her life again? It doesn't have to be me but it has to be someone!",lonely,What can I do to help my friend,2021-03-03 18:52:56

One of my friends has been going through a brutal divorce since September 2020 and I've been his main man when dealing with it.  Ride or die so to speak, too many long nights at too many bars but hey, it's what you do for friends.  

Another friend lost his antidepressants for insurance reasons.  That's been difficult for him and I've spent many nights with him too, sitting on his couch drinking beer and watching some tv show.  It may not be much but he appreciates the company. 

Yet another friend has a history of sexual abuse and reached out to me regarding what type of therapy I found good (I saw a therapist regarding PTSD). And so her and I have talked a good bit about that and what I found helped (EMDR), and she's been able to connect with someone for that.  

And then there's me.  And I have no one to talk to. It's seeming more and more likely that I'll have to move away for a job after graduation while they've all got jobs here.  And that realization kinda broke me.  I feel so fucking alone despite being surrounded by friends. I'll move to some town I don't want to go to because I need a job, I won't know anyone, I'll just be even more alone.

2065,IntuitiveDorito,1614748216,2,"22M here, just wanted to say some things that‚Äôs been bothering me lately. Sorry, it‚Äôs going to be a long read so feel free to scroll all the way to the bottom. 

So the past few months I‚Äôve hadn‚Äôt had any contact with anyone for obvious reasons. At first it was nice because I had such a huge influx on time and what I can do and what I wanted to do but never got around to doing so. I mean I‚Äôve kept in contact with some ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and I say it that way because I feel like I can only talk to them only on levels that‚Äôs relatively close to just basic levels. Whenever we discuss opinions on trivial things like music, movies, food, we actually share a lot in common so you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚ÄòWhat gives?‚Äô. Well there‚Äôs been times when I try to explain my perspective on something  that we might disagree on and they take it as a queue to get miffed and start arguing and like whenever I try to dig to the baseline and really clarify what I mean they shut me out and they know it‚Äôs something that irritates me so I kinda learned when to voice my opinions around them but at times it feels like I have to sugar coat what I say but also not make it too obvious because then in the past they showed signs of being annoyed when they see I‚Äôm trying to sugar coat my opinion and beat around the bush without making it sound like I‚Äôm trying to argue but instead; and it‚Äôs not like they argue almost right away but it also starts off with them clearly getting tense from the delivery of his words, posture and also the fact that I know when they‚Äôre trying to hide being annoyed when he laughs and chuckles during his sentences and I also have to hide that I see that because then it starts to escalate and I feel like when he see‚Äôs that I see, he starts to think I‚Äôm trying to provoke him or prove he‚Äôs wrong. 

But anyways that‚Äôs only the intro and not the main reason why I‚Äôm making this post. So with what I just said, I‚Äôve been keeping touch every now and then so they don‚Äôt suspect that I feel this way and it‚Äôs the main incentive as to why I‚Äôve been looking for new people to talk to. But obviously it‚Äôs hard when you can‚Äôt communicate the old conventional ways which what led me to the thought; from the very moment when everyone was stuck at home, I haven‚Äôt had anyone check up on me and I mean the people I DO want to be around, yeah they did try to get ahold of me but I feel like it was because it was one of my other friends birthday and she invites me every year but I mean her bday and mine is only a month apart and even then I don‚Äôt get a lot of people who I hoped and would expect for them to remember. 

Even the start of this year alone I haven‚Äôt had anyone check up on me to talk and looking at the grander scheme of things, it‚Äôs always been me that starts every conversation and rarely ever have someone message me but when someone does it only happens once or twice, depending on the person I‚Äôm talking to and then after that they usually wait for me to talk to eventually not talking at all, and it‚Äôs a bit of a crushing and devastating feeling for me because well I went to HS (Highschool)with these people and I felt like at the time I was a lot more charismatic and happy but I can actually FEEL them drifting away and it really fucks me up to think that the only people who knew me when I was at my best may never see or hear from me again which scares me to think that everyone that I somehow meet in the future is gonna see a distorted version of myself where I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own mind and body. 

It‚Äôs happened with other people before to where every time we talk or hang, it‚Äôd become less frequent and it becomes harder to catch up each time and Idk if I‚Äôm ready to see them go but I also get crushed at the thought that the chance for me to return to who I once was is a fleeting chance and the people I meet in the future won‚Äôt ever know who I really am and they‚Äôll only see a apathetic, selfish asshole.

2072,Current_Deer4593,1614742922,1,"I hope some of you can relate to what I have to say.  I know a lot of you experience intense sadness but to be honest most of the time I struggle to feel anything other than anger or apathy.  I often feel an aching loneliness that masturbation doesn‚Äôt alleviate.  I know plenty of people have said it before but all I really want is someone to hold me or tell me everything will be okay even if I wouldn‚Äôt believe it.  Or maybe just a nice long, warm hug.  Something to distract myself from my thoughts.  I listen to music a lot but it only does so much.  I‚Äôm so tired of being alone and having no one to share my miserable life with.  And yet at the same time I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself not to the hurt the mystery person that gives me a chance.  I‚Äôd probably just push them away and tell myself I‚Äôm better off alone, isolated.  I‚Äôm lonely and always want a connection and when it‚Äôs in front of me I run away like a fucking coward.  I honestly wish I could give my life to someone who actually wants to live.

2082,saltybapp0,1614738566,29,"All those late nights playing with friends until dawn. All those times where we thought the day wouldn't end, where our minds flew above the clouds away from all the problems that are on the ground. All those smiles and laughter we couldn't contain, tears falling from our faces not because of the sadness inside but the happiness around us. Where we thought we could be our heroes every moment we wanted, we wanted to fly, we wanted to see how far we could go without stopping. Where learning something new was the greatest decision we could make, being fearless and running out in the open like no one was watching. Singing like the stage was ours, any song would play and we would sing the night out, songs that didn't mean anything but fun and party. Screaming like there was no tomorrow, laughing like every day was a different comedy, and crying beside the people who meant the world to you. Thinking that these moments would never end, moments that would last until we grow old together crying, laughing, and screaming like we owned the world. 

What happened? What went wrong? Did we go too far? How far? I want to go back, give me one more chance to hit undo. What happened to the late nights until dawn when we thought 8 hours wasn't enough for our game night, all I see left is late nights of school works that won't matter when we get old, all I see left are tears but not because of laughter these tears are silent in a dark room that it'll never leave. What happened to the days of happiness that we thought would never end? instead, we want the day to end just to sleep and hide away from this world we never expected. There is no mind above the clouds just problems on the ground, what happened to our wings? did we ever see this coming? Smiling isn't even normal why does smiling hurt? I thought it was supposed to be about happiness and joy but why does it hurt? There are no more heroes we imagine just problems that aren't even present but remain within our minds. I thought trying something new was fun? I can't even get up every day willing to make the day productive I feel tired even after two days of rest or were those days even rest? What happened to be fearless? what happened to run out open like no one cared why are all these eyes suddenly staring at me and me alone? How did every song turn into a poem of sadness? Why did screaming like there was no tomorrow turn into screaming like there were multiple assignments and projects to be passed tomorrow? How did every day become the same painful process? What happened to the people who let me cry by their side? why did they suddenly pull the trigger, why is it terrifying to talk to someone and open up to them? These moments ended with tears and messages that we never saw coming, we were never going to grow old together, we never owned the world in the first place. The world fought us and we couldn't stand together so it became a free for all and I was too dumb to see that.

But it's ok, I understand that eventually, everything comes to an end. But if I can I would like to go back, even just for a moment. Everyone comes and goes I understand that and I don't blame you for pulling the trigger, because even if you told me I would've let you. But thank you for everything, the moments, the memories, and the lessons you thought me. I'll find a way to fix myself and one day maybe one day I'll meet these moments once again. But for now, I'll fix the broken glass you shot, I hope you find your happiness too.

I really badly want to move on.. but it's not easy to move on from a girl you've crushed on and cherished your whole life. I read through things online on how to move on from someone, and one of the things was to cut all ties. So I figured, maybe if I blocked her and deleted our chats, it might loosen my mind's grip on her. But at the same time, I like having her nearby because she's always been my got to if life was bringing me down. But now, the best medicine is only making it worse, but everytime I convince myself I should it just ends up coming back full circle. I was hoping you guys could give your most honest opinion to whether or not I should try to block and delete her messages, then maybe, I could get over her a little easier, but I still want to be there for her incase she needs me, it just hurts too much talking or texting her at all, I want her to be happy, but seeing her with someone else is too painful for me to even imagine. 
Please be honest and direct, the last thing I need is for someone to spare my feelings at the moment

Well that's great and all, but after a fairly recent breakup, \~6months or so, things have been on a steep decline. What used to be my tight knit group of medical school friends have slowly drifted apart as new chapters in our lives are beginning. Now, I'd usually be spending these last couple of weeks with them and enjoying their company, but I am the ONLY single person out of all of us. So I'm pretty much always the odd one out. Secondly, I've dated many girls in this area of the past 4 years, and it seems as though there's no single fish left in the see. So here I am, spending about 98% of my time completely and utterly alone. I don't share intimacy with anyone. I'm not able to give the love which I so desperately want to give to anyone. And..I just feel so completely and utterly alone, especially now with this huge step in my life coming up. I don't look forward to waking up, or coming home, or going here or there, cause at the end of the day it all comes back to my coming home to my empty apartment and sleeping alone in my empty bed only to wake up and do it all again. It's taking a heavy toll on me.

I'm planning on doing my intern year here to save money, but it seems like I'm going to be the only one out of my friends that is planning on doing that. So then I'll really be completely and entirely alone out here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I feel so alone and empty during this time of great change in my life, and knowing what I know about residency I don't see it getting any better. I really just want to love and be loved.",lonely,Anticipating worsening loneliness,2021-03-03 08:05:07

I had found the most perfect woman for me, with instant chemistry and we saw eye to eye on many things. It had been the first real time that I had experienced what real happiness was.

We moved in together, and unfortunately her family came with that. At first it was supposed to be temporary,  but then it became clear that it wasn't. Always all up in our business, taking up space (one family member in particular is a legitimate hoarder who literally made it difficult to even walk inside because of having so much random, useless shit) and having their own internal conflicts that I didn't care or want to see. We were all cramped up in a small space and it drove me nuts. Random members coming in at random times, since they had keys and didn't feel the need to explain anything. And when I brought this up to my ex, she would get super defensive. She would make excuses (some legit, but most weren't) for them, and say she would do something. She would do something, but not solve the problem. At best, it was a temporary stop gap. And soon enough, things would go right back to how they were before. We would argue about things like any couple, but the majority of the fights were related to her family. 

I didn't feel like an equal any more. I began to feel as if I was confined to one space, no privacy or a way to be undisturbed if I wanted to be alone with my thoughts.

I started to not want to be at home as much or as often. I started to work late and spend nights at friends houses. I couldn't handle being there at times. There would be periods when we would have space to ourselves, but they were few and far between, and never guaranteed because they always had a presence there, or would invite themselves in without us being there. Our closeness and relationship just started to fall apart. We both tried several times to save it. We hardly were intimate any more, and I did somethings that I later regretted. 

I wish that I could have been a better, less selfish person, and maybe it could have worked out. She was a wonderful woman that I doubt I'll meet anyone that will love me like she did. I know I only mentioned the problems but there was plenty of good with her. I genuinely feel that I'm going to be lonely forever, while my friends are all about to start families and be happy.",lonely,"Had a wonderful girlfriend, then my whole life went down hill.

2126,Kratos_Hashtag_0373,1614713421,1,"This is my story .

My GF broke up with me last year's may and that too on my birthday and she absolutely did not give me any hints about that earlier. ( Guess, she wanted to take revenge).

I was in relationship with her for 2 years in college. I invested a lot in her emotionally and financially and she left in the moment I needed her the most. Last year's Summer break, She was back home thousands of kms away and I was stuck in my campus for an internship during coronavirus outbreak. Didn't have any friends in the campus, family was back and she was the only one with whom I felt vulnerable enough to talk about anything. She left and shattered me. It took a shit load of time for me to get back to my normal self during the quarantine. 

Summer break got over, I returned to home cause our next semester was completely online. I knew my elder brother had a relationship going on for around 4 years but I didn't know anything about it until I started settling at home. 

Ever since the relationship, my elder brother has improved a lot in terms of happiness, mental health and career. He got into a good Uni for Master's degree at the same my next semester was starting. 
His relationship is really great and it seems like he and his partner are meant for each other. They do a lot of stuff for each other show how much they mean to each other and they talk to each other at the end of the day for like 1-2 hours. I am happy for him, that he's finally found someone good for him and is progressing with his career. I know he and his partner have a great life going ahead. 

Contrast to my EX, it was my first relationship and I was only in 2nd year of my bachelors. She didn't actually knew how to express emotions and feelings via words. The relationship was kind of ok for the first year but after that it started going on toxic. I didn't see the red signs at all and only until I waa deep down in that toxic pool did I realize I am fucked. She used to play with my emotions, manipulate me into doing favors for her constantly, used to gaslight me a lot, grew so much passive aggressive and sarcastic in her conversations and behaviour. I was constantly walking on eggshells with around her. Was always anxious about saying the wrong thing around her. And when I would talk about breaking up she would become ""good"" and ""caring"". She would do this and that for me, and would tell me that she has no one except me. She didn't have good relationship with her family and lost touch with her friends. Also had some mental health issues and depression. I would instantly feel guilty and changed my mind about breaking up. This happened a couple of times. I could go on and on but it would take me hours and hours of writing to summarize those 2 years.

I feel like I have got PTSD from that relationship. It's damaged me to the point where I don't even feel comfortable sharing my emotions and being vulner5 with anyone because of the slightest possibility of getting hurt. I felt regretful of wasting those 2 yearrs. I could have used them to excel at my career, explore life, travel, learn music, start a youtube channel. All those things that I actually wanted to do but didn't do because of her.

I have kind of set my mind that I would just try to improve myself at life, find better friends, give back to the community via social service and live life to the fullest.

But still, my brother's apparently ""perfect"" relationship makes me feel bad about myself. Not because having a girlfriend is so cool and you can brag about it.

But because, I don't have anyone in my life with whom I can find the maximum warmth and comfort. I don't have anyone in my life with whom I can freely talk about anything not feel judged. I don't have anyone with whom I can share my progress and achievements. I don't have anyone with whom I can be vulnerable and emotional. I don't have anyone with whom I can share what I did at the end of the day. 

I plan to get into Academia and life is going to get tough ahead. If you have someone with you, it becomes easier to get through life. I have always kind of needed someone to pull me out of the rock bottom.

Friends, familty, relatives, etc. You can only get emotional support from them to an extent.

I have already lost a best friend of mine because at some point he got tired from my shit and he got burned out emotionally when I was going through my breakup . Our friendship has never been the same after that. I don't want to do that with my other friends. I have and still learning on how to manage my emotions on my own but sometimes it's just hard.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for hearing me out.",lonely,How do I stop being envious of my elder brother's relationship?,2021-03-03 06:30:21

I dont really know how to start off so ill just start of with the question im asking myself frequently: Am I depressed?
As stereotypical as it gets i am, and always have been ""the funny guy"". (shortly something about me: 18y.o., from germany, currently in 13th grade in the middle of doing my A levels, at least i think thats what it is)
My typical day right now is to get up just on time get ready, not having time for breakfast, heading to school. Having a reasonable good time there, making jokes with classmates etc. then heading back home. Then i either turn on my pc, with the intention of dping homework and then succumbing to chilling on discord and getting distracted and i end up playing games with my mates. Or i instantly go to bed cause im exhausted. Then i eat with my parentsa and afterwards i go to bed contemplating about whaly i havent been productive again.
It has only been getting worse with the on-off lockdown.
I mean when you normally think about Depression, its like this always say mood, and thats not the case. I have fun with gaming, and yea thats part of the problem, i invent my time in that instead of productive things, but its my hobby and i dont wanna stop doing it. 
My close friend circle is always busy with school stuff at the moment,...they say. but i mean i see one of them always planing games with other dudes on discord. And when i ask if anyone is up do do something: ""have a test tomorrow, dont have time"". I fell left out...
I just worry that if i go to university ill flat out fail everything because it gets more advanced. Since recently i've never had problems in school. (already signed up to a combo model with training and got that place safe, and its what ive ALWAYS wanted to do)

2140,Tree__Frog,1614709301,1,"   Last summer was so fun for me. I went out with my friends almost every day. It helped my depression so much since I wasn‚Äôt trapped inside the house all day alone. When Winter came my best friend and I made so many plans for that coming summer. It‚Äôs all we talked about. We both suffered from severe depression so we really relied on talking about our summer plans to keep us happy. I felt so happy for once in my life that summer. I wish I could experience it one more time. 

   Recently my friend‚Äôs mental illness and addiction drove us apart. They convinced themselves that I didn‚Äôt care and wasn‚Äôt a real friend since I was trying to pull them out of their addiction because I was scared they would run out of luck one day. They blocked me on everything out of nowhere one day and claim that the person that encourages their addiction and gives them pills is their true friend, not me. Which definitely hurt me a lot. Being alone again brought back my depression and it just destroyed me. 

    I‚Äôm still close to my other friends. By close I mean that we still talk over social media every day, but that‚Äôs it. One moved over 5 hours away and the other one is in a new relationship and expecting, and also is planning on moving away soon. I‚Äôm very happy for both of them for starting their lives and getting out of this stupid small town. I wish I could too. Getting out of this town could change my life, but money is definitely a problem. I feel so stuck here. 

     I‚Äôve been so lonely and depressed lately. I have no one to go out and do things with. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt make friends. It‚Äôs really easy for him so he doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt do it like he does. He doesn‚Äôt understand depression or anxiety. So when I try to talk to him he just tells me that people have it worse than I do and I need to just get over it. Which makes me feel so low and like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I don‚Äôt want to stay in this house anymore. I‚Äôve told him I would love to go out hiking and camping this summer with him, but he doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to. He‚Äôs really close with his best friend and they do everything together. I‚Äôm just kind of left out. 

   I can‚Äôt keep feeling this way every day. I want to go out and enjoy life. I just have an issue with being alone. I just want a friend I guess to have fun with or at least have my boyfriend actually want to go out and do stuff with me. I wish I was a person that could be alone and be okay with it. I‚Äôm just not strong enough I guess. I hate to admit that I need someone, but I really do. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore but I can‚Äôt hurt my mom like that. So I have to keep going until she‚Äôs gone then I don‚Äôt care anymore about not being here because I‚Äôll lose the only person that loves me in this world. 

  I know everything I said was really rambled and probably didn‚Äôt flow together at all. I just needed to get this feeling out. Typing it out made me feel a bit better. Venting helped a bit. I hope one day I can be strong enough to do this on my own and beat my depression.

2145,codecrunchie,1614706320,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

2146,preferablyanonymity,1614706073,1,"I used to think this was BS, that of course, everyone deserves love regardless of how they look at themselves. And of course, absolutely, it still is the case.

But a realization about myself has also made me understand this quote from a different perspective.

I've been single for all 22 years of my life. Never even held hands with anyone, let alone experience my first kiss. But I think the reason for this is because I always thought that nobody would ever be interested in me anyway, so why should I go out of my way trying to initiate and maintain romantic relationships?

I don't like the way I look, I don't like my personality, so I think I subconsciously avoided any attachments because I kept projecting my views of myself on how I perceived other to view me.

So there you have it. I'm still struggling to say ""Everyone deserves love!"" without a muttered ""...except me."" at the end. But what I've really learned is that if you don't love yourself, you likely also won't let anyone love you too.",lonely,"""Nobody will love you if you don't love yourself.""",2021-03-03 04:27:53

I hope this is okay to dump here. I just feel like at the end of the day it won't matter how hard I try and be friendly/good/someone people want around? They never want to keep me around.. Whether it's been friendships or relationships it's like something about me is just Too Much. Maybe I get too excited when I hear the little ding or maybe I overshare the funny things I stumble on, I don't really know. My best friend is too busy now and I'm lucky to get a handful of messages from her in a month. The guy whose company I really enjoyed hasn't shown any interest in having a conversation with me for what feels like weeks, and I feel like such an idiot for falling for his sweet messages now.  My ex is the only one who has messaged and checked on me recently, and I know it's only because he's lost the girl he cheated on me with. I hate myself for missing him because there's no way I could ever go back. My only worth to people seems to be as a therapist or for sexual gratification. It makes me hate myself even more when I'm trying so hard not too be that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I deal with a few mental illnesses and I try really hard to not let myself become nasty.. I've suffered from agoraphobia for years but try and compliment at least one person every time I go out in public. I make myself go out at least once a day or I'll shut myself away again. I try to be upbeat and happy, plenty of fun jokes and nifty memes, but I still seem to be left alone every chance there is. When I try and tell someone I'm not feeling like me, I'm not okay, I can't get anyone to care. No one even asks what's wrong.. I check in on everyone else and make sure they have their funnies and love, but nobody even can spare a pat on the shoulder for me.. it's not even that often i need help man. I wish any conversation I've had lately lasted more than just two or three messages. I always tell myself that I know I'm alone, I've been alone since I was little, and it's okay if it's for a little longer yknow? But I can't make it feel okay and I'm really tired of struggling just to exist alone

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just so tired that it's hard to force my fake bubbly self to the surface for anyone right now. Everything feels like such a struggle. I'm tired and I want to bond with someone. I don't want to be yelled at anymore, cheated on, hit, or made to feel smaller than a mite. I'm tired of sleeping alone and having night terrors. I'm tired of only playing games I use to love because it distracts the suicidal thoughts for a few moments. I've never been one for hooking up it's always made me feel kinda hollow after its said and done, but if we weren't in pandemic times? I think I'd of given up by now and just taken physical attention because at least it's something. When I slept with my ex at least I could sleep.. I just want to curl up with someone, play animal crossing together, and maybe ignore how bad things are outside of the blankets for a little while. I want to love someone and be loved. I just want someone to see me and be happy that I'm still here, still trying. What's the point of trying to form bonds when you get pushed aside at the soonest chance? What's the point of busting your butt working when you don't have anyone who cares about your good news? For all the negative mumbo above I know I'll still try and be hopeful. Eventually maybe I'll make some friends who think I'm a hoot or a sweet guy might actually pick me for his dynamic duo, who knows. All I know I'll want to delete this later but for right now I needed to vent somewhere. Thanks for hearing me out if you did &lt;3

We started dating when we were 16, I met her at a local library and she became my friend. She was bullied a lot, I remember and I was always a loner so we started hanging out almost every day for months till I asked her out. To my surprise, she said yes and we dated for almost 5 years up until our final year in uni because I found out she cheated on me multiple times. She begged me to take her back but the fools around me convinced me to ""hAvE SelF ResPect"" and the usual ""U dEseRve So MuCh bEttEr broo"".

After we broke up, I tried dating again and failed horribly. Got ghosted on apps, barely got any matches, some months got none because I'm quite frankly simply too ugly for romance. Keep in mind, dating apps and sites were kind of still okay for ugly men some 5 years ago, you could get matches and whatnot but even *then*, I couldn't meet a single person willing to even go on a date with me. 

Now, all the people I knew before are all dating, have wives, haves gfs/bfs, family but all have is myself and nothing else. I go to work, and I have a decent career but live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, come back home, argue with strangers on Twitter about politics, play video games and wish I wasn't so fking ugly.

I have been single for more than four years. This pandemic has made it worse for everyone to try and build relationships and even intimacy with someone.

I sincerely miss having someone that wants me and needs me. I remember I used to have late night chats with my ex girlfriend about weird things, it always amazed me how we manage to talk nonsense for hours. 

I miss saying the words I miss you and I love you and of course receiving it back as well. I don't know how it feels to be vulnerable and safe at the same time anymore but I do remember being fine with being myself for I have someone who loves me for who I am.

I miss intimacy, it's such an important thing to have. This feeling reminds me of how bad I grew up as a person and that I invested in the wrong things and ideas and so now I just feel like a complete weirdo while everyone else seems to be doing fine building their lives and potential families.

I want to feel loved romantically again, be with someone that believes in me and someone I can believe in as well, someone I can joke around with freely without the fear of offending them, someone who cares and tries to understand me as much as I try to understand them. 

I want to feel that love high again, to kiss like there's no tomorrow as if we're rabid animals that wants nothing more than to fullfil each others desires. I want to feel our skin rubbing against each other with sweat being our only lubricant. We'd let out noises we only want each other to hear and rest on the same bed we just passionately made love on and wake up the next day making fun of each other's morning breath.

We fought sometimes so it was no perfect relationship but we always talked about it. No she is always really busy with her new school, even weekends. And it's been a while, months. I always tell her my problems and what I think but I feel she does not share anything anymore. I tried telling her that I feel like she treats me different on various occasions but she always says it's because she is busy, but I feel is only an excuse. Sometimes it's like I am an annoying coworker, so she quickly says oh hello, I'm fine, what can I do for you? And that saddens me because I just want to talk to her about stupid things or serious stuff but sometimes I'm in front of the wall she is putting between us and I just don't know what to say. With other friends she is her usual self so I don't know what's going on... Am I doing something wrong. 

Today I felt really sad and lonely, my other friends are also kind of ignoring me. Sometimes I feel like I ask for a lot but I think friendship is about sharing and I don't want to feel like a task in a to do list. 

So I decided to talk to her but I'm a little scared of what will come out. I'm really sad and I don't want to ruin this friendship or I don't know... I feel really lonely, I don't have a lot of friends so this is important to me. I'm not really mad anymore just sad.
