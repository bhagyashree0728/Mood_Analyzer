Over a month we just naturally kept spending time with each other and just dumped our souls on the table. Could not go an hour with messaging each other. It was mutual and nothing felt forced. Things progressed and the conversations got more and more vulnerable. I told her I love these conversations but I’m a bit worried about “being over attached”. I was trying to stop this before it became a problem for both of us. This led to us admitting we were genuinely obsessed with each other and missed each other the moment we weren’t together and how we both have never had someone who made them feel this comfortable and safe. We said openly how deeply we feel for each other.

But we never even bumped hands or hugged or were in a foot of each other. We came to the conclusion that since cheating wasn’t an option that the only thing we could do would be to pull back and be friends. I told her I can’t do this halfway and that my only option was to limit contact or I’d drive myself crazy. We cried and were devastated. I left the car without even hugging this person and now have to pretend every day like we didn’t just admit things we’ve never told anyone else as I walk by her. 

I had a serious relationship in the past and this was the first person I cared this deeply about in half a decade. Back to being alone in my head again, I guess.",lonely,Met the “perfect” person and it won’t work,2021-09-30 19:14:32

31,Treeston_Lie,1632980364,1,"All throughout my life I haven't been able to make friends very well, and on the rare occasion I do I fail to be able to keep them around for long. This trend has continued in college (I'm a 2nd year now) and I've made multiple attempts to try to message people, banter with them IRL, etc. but in the end it ends up amounting to nothing. Most of the time, whether it's the people from before college or during it that I'm meeting, my messages end up ignored, and no one ever tries to talk to me first about anything; I'm always messaging first and bothering them. Even if people are kind enough to respond initially it usually falls off after a short period of time.

At first when I really became aware of this, it was during early COVID and I thought maybe the restrictions coming with that were the cause, so I kept trying. However, I've now been through a significant portion of real school, and nothing has changed; everyone around me has been able to make connections and maintain their old ones, while mine are continuing the deteriorate. 

I now realize that I'm the X factor here - I just don't have anything about me that's interesting or that I'm good at to make people want to talk to me. Or I'm just not pleasant to speak to in general. Probably both.

I'd like to clarify that I'm not mad at these people or mad at the world or anything - if they don't want to speak to me that's perfectly okay for them and I'm happy for them if they are instead investing their time on things or people that they enjoy. I just wish that I could accept that I'm not someone people want to talk to. I understand it logically, but not emotionally. I'm not surprised when someone I thought I might finally be able to make friends with ignores me when I either wave at them or message them, but it still hurts a little. I wish it didn't have to, but it does.

I'm not sure how to fix this. Maybe if I keep digging into it I'll become more desensitized to it until it just becomes another fact of life.

57,BananaGoy,1632969787,1,"College.. Drive home.. Game.. Lay down.. Feel rough about how I miss talking to people. 

Not much of a social person or enjoy parties. I try when I can to be sociable and talkative to others but it's hard being motivated to pursue friends. Life changed and now I don't have many to talk to. My family is there for me when I need it but it's different. 

It's so different from everything.

I started talking to this girl I thought was cute.. We hung out a bit, we're friends now who sort of share similar interests and classes. But it isn't anything deep. She also has a boyfriend which makes me want to step back from her out of fear of getting strong feelings for her.

But I also don't want to for the fact that I'd lose someone to talk to. (She isn't someone I rely on to talk to since it's not the right type of friendship)(It's newer and still getting familiar)

In general I don't have anyone to rely on talking to. I have a therapist I sometimes can talk with but its still different from a peer.

Most late nights recently I lie in bed and start feeling bad since I can't talk to anyone about anything. 

Earlier this year I got tinder looking for anything. I met someone who was pretty cool In my opinion. We shared a lot of interests. We talked, started dating, and never got beyond that before stopping. We both wanted different things.

She's still considered a friend but I'm lost on how I feel about her and our brief time together.

A lot of strong emotions came from that. I remember one night I had the strongest urge to take my knife and you know what. It was the most saddening emotion I'd felt in a long time. I felt really strong emotions towards her but she didn't want a relationship and it took me a while to cope with that.

After everything I still get thoughts of her. My feelings faded since time sort of passed. I still care for her. 

But now, I'm looking for someone to talk to. I don't know why its now that it seems like such a hard time without someone.

I've lived most of my life quiet and reserved. Didn't really feel any need for friends or people to talk to. I'd usually distract myself with the internet or my pc. 

But now its just so overwhelming realizing how lonely I feel.

This was pretty much the idea, but taking care of yourself feels pointless when there is no one to appreciate it, just the idea that someone, somewhere, sometime when your work is done will finally ""pop up"" and say that they appreciate you. I've been trying for so long now, multiple times now I've felt proud and maybe even good enough just to be pushed back down and get back at it at becoming ""better"", ""more attractive"", ""more optimistic"" and not let the bad thoughts get under my skin. Friends are out there, people who I don't need to try so hard around, people I don't need to live under constant fear of losing, don't need to live under fear of being tossed aside as another escape goat, know that I am good enough.

66,SadCoast2880,1632964625,1,"So last week, I was sitting around after a class, and unexpectedly, this really fashionable and pretty gal comes up to me. She strikes up a conversation *about something that actually interests me* and we REALLY hit it off. She seemed like she genuinely liked me, and I got a good feeling about her. We just seemed to have a lot in common. I ended up asking her for her phone number and she gave it to me, and we texted a little bit later on that day. 

Then, after that---- nothing. She never texted again. I went to class again and I didn't see her afterwards, so assumed that she just wasn't there that day and went about my business, but then when I walked out to my car, I saw her outside the building on her phone. I considered going up to her, but she didn't seem interested in talking at that moment, and the last thing I wanted to be was a nuisance. Besides, I think she must have seen me, but she didn't even bother to catch my attention or say ""hello."" That really hurt, because she had seemed *so* interested in getting to know me just last week.  I was over the moon about it then because the last time I even had hopes of a new friend was before the pandemic (it didn't work out eventually in case you're wondering...) So the fact that she seemed so disinterested today just made me feel so let down. 

Idk why this hits me so hard. I know it's stupid to get upset over someone I literally just had one (in person) conversation with, but it's just that this *NEVER* happens to me. I so rarely am able to make friends, and I was really hopeful that something might work out with her. Even if we didn't end up besties, I was just hopeful that I could at least have one casual friend that I hung out with sometimes. JUST. ONE. FRIEND. 

I know how pathetic this is going to sound, but I have literally no friends. I'm fortunate enough to be close with my immediate family, and there are some friends of family members that I see because they're around said family members, but those are way out of my age range, we have very little in common, and they're not really *my* friends.  So I was just overjoyed that I finally had a chance at making a friend of my own, and now I just feel so fucking sad. 

Why the fuck would she *do* something like that?? Why even approach me if she doesn't really want to be friends? Does she even get how cruel it is to get my hopes up like that and then just not follow through?  Moreover, was this my fault? Am I really SO horrible that people run away from me after just one conversation and a few texts? I DID MY VERY BEST TO BE FRIENDLY AND OPEN!! MY. VERY. FUCKING. BEST. Was that *still* not good enough? The worst part is, it seemed like it was going so well. I must have done something wrong without even realizing it because I'm Autistic and I'm just THAT socially inept. 

I guess along with the fact that it shows up my own ineptitude, which I've been able to ignore for the most part during the pandemic and when I wasn't even attempting to make friends, the reason it makes me so upset is because I could also ignore the depth of my loneliness (for the most part) before. Now, after how desperately I desired to be this person's friend after just talking to them once, I've really shed light on exactly how *STARVED* for social interaction and connection I am. I guess that isolation just became my normal, and she came and shook that up just enough for me to realize that I actually *need* people to relate to. 

Also, she's just one more person I can add to an overarching pattern in my life: I *can't* keep friends for very long. Literally everyone I've tried to make friends with in the past has lost interest and ghosted me. EVERYONE. At first, I was desperate. I was the one who always extended friendly gestures, texted first (only to be left on read half the time) and tried to make plans to hang out, which they often stood me up for. Then, I realized the bitter truth-- ***they don't really want to be friends with me and they're just too polite to tell me outright.*** So I stopped always being the one to reach out first and never heard from them again. 

What the fuck am I doing wrong? Am I *THAT* disgusting--- that undesirable--- that there isn't a *single person* who's wanted to be my friend after somewhat getting to know me? Can anyone give me any insight as to what goes wrong literally every single time I try to make a friend? As to why people don't like me? Because I'm literally so clueless at this point. It's like being blind socially, and I need someone smarter than me to be my glasses right now, I guess.",lonely,WHY does this fucking happen every time I try to make a friend???,2021-09-30 11:17:05

-	Listen to some music or a entertainment based podcast 
-	Take a 30 min walk and listen to an educational/personal development podcast &amp; take notes (just added this to my routine this week)
-	Give family member a ride back home from their work OR some more Reddit/YouTube if they don’t need a ride
-	Play some PS5 or watch a movie

80,starsspace,1632960350,1,"Hi everyone. I've been struggling with loneliness for about 6 years now and I can just say that some nights were just so much worse than others. But today is one of the good ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined a student society and then went on a night out with them. I had no friends there, didn't know anyone and was scared that I would be really out of place. I've never been to a party before, I don't drink and am generally very shy. For some reason I thought that these factors meant that I must not go to events like these. But I was wrong in my assumptions. We were told to bring our own drinks to the party so I felt compelled to buy an alcoholic drink which i didn't want in the first place. But when i came in i was surprised to see that actually quite a few people only came with water bottles and were also non-drinkers like me. I was able to chat with almost everyone and even might have made a potential friend. And yes i was very shy at first but once i got to speak to different people i was finally able to relax and enjoy the night with them. Everyone was very friendly and it felt good to feel as a part of a group. They even wanted to make sure that everyone got home safe in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I had many incorrect assumptions about student parties and lifestyle. I thought people just get drunk at those and do crazy things. But my experience was different to that. Now i feel angry with my past self for letting erroneous assumptions prevent me from enjoying life to the fullest.

&amp;#x200B;

Doing this was a massive step out of my comfort zone, i actually didn't want to go and was trying to find excuses to remain home. But i pushed myself and for that i am extremely happy. Of course this night alone is nowhere near enough to cure my loneliness that has built up over the years, but it is nonetheless an important step in the right direction.

#personal anecdotes

I have a long term bf who calls himself my husband, he makes a lot of money, has a secure job, and my (abusive but i moved out) mom pays my bills and even gifts me jewelry (bought me a platinum bracelet with emeralds and small diamonds). I can afford to do a lot. I have my art hobbies including digital art, and gaming. I just upgraded my rig with a new monitor and keyboard. Before covid I'd travel once or twice a year including international travel.




I have friends who care about me a LOT. I eat good food, eat out a lot, buy whatever i want, was loved and pretty popular in HS (only 180 students - private school)



#but the loneliness 



But im so lonely. Im so empty. I self harm and have attempted suicide in the past. Life SHOULD be good, i SHOULD be happy. I keep feeling like everyone hates me. That im not important, and then i try to address WHY that matters to me.





I guess i dont even know what i want. I feel broken. Ive been this way since i was 9. Is it just mental illness? Am i a lost cause? Am i really better off dead? I feel like i wouldnt be missed but it has to be a lie. My friends keep saying if they didnt like me they wouldnt be around me. It has to be a lie, my bf is terrified hes going to come home to a corpse.





I feel like i fucked up, allowing myself to keep on existing and meeting new people, friends, and getting a boyfriend all to just throw it away and die.




Then I feel more guilty because there shouldnt be a reason to care or suffer like this. That maybe i should be on medication but im so scared. I have trust issues that i dont know how to address. Im in therapy but my therapist is booked solid, i see him only once every month and a half.

Because, at this age, girls apparently believe that looks and conventional attractiveness are the most important thing. I hope that this is just a phase and after age 30 girls put more stock in personality and connection. Maybe Japan is on to something when they have cuddle cafes, renting girl/boyfriends, etc and other services for those of us who want to experience intimacy.

That fact that he aint having sex is destroying him mentally and constantly pissing him off.

Something as simple as having a conversation feels impossible. Even if someone would want to speak to me my mind goes blank, I freeze and struggle to spit out a single sentence past being a stuttering joke. Anxiety being my shackles which keep me bound away from others, my low self esteem the key which locks them shut.

I have so much I'd love to share with someone, so many things I want to talk about but can't. Making memories together, sharing a bond and trust that I'll probably never know. No one could love me in anyway, no one even wants to know me. I seek friendship and fail to even speak, I seek love yet am unworthy of it.

Who would ever want me? The joke of an excuse for a man. The anxious little weak stuttering clown, the sad little virgin who can't even make friends let alone a girlfriend. I remember every compliment I had, preserving each like a treasure. Yet even they can grow a bitter taste.

I've been told I'm cute, adorable, sweet, kind, smart and gentle. Three of these played on my mind as if I'm cute and adorable in what way? I've been told I look too young and like a boy before (by a girl had had quite deep feelings for and grew close to, she also said I made her feel like I was something to protect) which makes me worry that I don't even look good in an attractive way, I'm not handsome like a man but ""adorable"" like a child. Gentle though? I mean this isn't necessarily insulting of course, but I feel that I'm always gonna be viewed as weak to anyone and everyone. That ""gentle"" is a nicer way to put it.

I hate me, I hate myself, I hate being me! How could I ever expect anyone else to have the least bit of care and interest when I can't even? I'm just so tired and it hurts all the time, my heart is broken as am I. I've always been broken, and no one wants broken goods.

I work full-time while my wife watches our kids (an agreed set up), and despite our good relationship with each other, our mental issues keep up worlds apart. 

I'm Bipolar 2, and she has major depression and PTSD stemming from an assault when she was younger. We do our best to continue to talk and support each other through our own episodes. 

The problem I'm having is I like constant conversation because it makes me feel needed. I always want to text with my wife when I'm away, and talk with her when I'm at home. For her, she's exhausted at the end of the day, and just wants time to be alone and recharge her mental batteries. She's told me in the past sometimes I ask too much from here, when all I want is her attention and to hold a conversation. 

When I reach out through text during the day, often I don't hear anything from her for hours, I start to get lonely. The loneliness eventually turns into sadness, which triggers thoughts of self-harm and suicide, and what the best way to paint the walls with my brain would be. 

With everything going on between us, I try my best to be understanding, but most of the time I feel along while surrounded by people. I have friends and family I can talk with, but they don't seem to fulfil that need I'm looking for.

The things that boil me up, most of all, is that I'm lonely af, I have no one to refer as a real friend, but other people are full of it and don't deserve it

I talk for personal experience, during my teenage years I ended up being alone not for my will, but because of others. So during the years I started losing social life and similar because of others actions. 

For example: In middle school, some guys that don't even know me we'll (the classic ""friends of a friend"" sort of relationship, with whom I had just small talks and nothing more) started spreading the voice that I was gay (thing not true, but back in 2010-2014, as a child, was something ""big"", ""strange"". They started watching you upside down) 

I never tell this nobody, voices keep spreading and now, everybody have their happy life, with gf/bf, plenty of friends, moving on when I'm stuck in this limbo

Another episode, in high school, I take distances from what I thinked was a good friend until to realize he was using me. I rant over him, directly (and I still think I was on the right side) just to be left apart over the years. Social life was already at zero, but this things didn't helped. 

(moreover there is another episode with this subject that involved also the gf I had at the time. He tried to put himself between us, just to force the breakup) 

He and his close group of friends that backup him still hang out, having parties, enjoying companies and etc, and I'm all alone thinking to leave soon than I could from this city.

Trust in anybody. No social life since 14-15 (only in the last years I'm recovering it), no gf, no real friends but only acquitances.

As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

I Don't really know why I'm writing down that but if you feel the same way I feel, you're not alone.

I'm young, I have a boyfriend, a stable job but I feel so lonely...
If it wasn't my parents or my boyfriend, nobody would talk to me at all (except at work of course). 
I know some people don't even have a partner but it's really frustrating when you can't share a memory with someone else. It's so depressing to say out loud ""I don't have any friend""... I don't even have any brother,  sister or cousin to talk to. If my relationship with my boyfriend ends It means that I would have absolutely nobody except my parents.

If you have friends, one advice : don't take these relationships for granted. Cherish them or you'll end up like me and I can assure you it's really hard sometimes ^^"". 

Anyway, have a Nice day !",lonely,"25 years old, no friends, feeling empty",2021-09-30 05:15:09

I also hate how immediate it is. There's no way to put off a text conversation without coming off as a dick, while you can relatively easily dodge or postpone the whole ""let's hang out/call!"" Half the time, texting can feel like a minefield of ""how do I make this message sound engaging while also hard enough to respond that they want to end the conversation?"" I feel like an asswipe for it, but I feel like there's no other way to avoid it

But why is this relevant to being lonely? Well, statistically, most of the world is now unreachable to me in some sense. Others can get online relationships to fill the void, or can use messaging to keep in touch with irl friends (especially in the cases of long distance), but I can't. People will laugh with me when I ""joke"" about hating technology and messaging/talking on the phone with people, calling me relatable, but then it feels like our relationship starts to deteriorate once they give me their number (or Snapchat or whatever) and I barely text them or our conversations are dry. Like, what did you expect? I basically told you straight up I'm not good at this nor like it. 

But yeah, basically, the internet and everything is supposed to connect people, but not only does it not fulfill that intended purpose (for me at least), but it also messes up my irl relationships. I'm lonely beyond belief because somehow talking in person is seen as outdated. Thanks internet, very cool. 

PS — I don't mean for this to sound boomer-y, nor am I trying to put down online relationships. I wish I could do it.

***TL;DR at the bottom of the post.***

Earlier today an online friend who I'd lost touch with sent me a friend request out of the blue. This is a person I met through an online game and have only talked to via text chat, but we got along really well. After we met we would hang out in-game fairly frequently and occasionally chat via discord, but over a period of maybe 2-3 months we talked less and less until they finally removed me from their friends list. This was maybe ~6 months ago.

**Here's the important part**: I have always been really bad at keeping in touch with people. I am rarely, if ever, initiating conversations with my friends. I love talking to and spending time with friends, but I still have this feeling in my stomach whenever I'm thinking about messaging a friend that I'll just be a bother. *""If they really want to talk to me, they'd message me first""* is what I'd say to myself, which is not only complete nonsense but also **very** hypocritical, I know. But I can't seem to shake that feeling. This is also, presumably, why said friend deleted me off their friends list, because I never initiate a conversation which makes me seem disinterested in talking to them, and I don't blame them one bit.

Right now, I have one online friend that I talk to fairly regularly. We can go a few weeks to a couple months without speaking, and then they'll message me and we'll talk like no time has passed. But they are my ***only*** friend. I am working a temporary(?) job, where I have a bunch of coworkers I can talk to, but I have less than a month left at that place. After that, my one online friend will be the only person I talk to.

*Shoud I accept the friend request and try to reconnect with my old friend?* I know that after my time at my current job ends I will be really lonely and I'm desperate to have other people to talk to, but I'm fairly sure we both know that we'll go through the same song and dance again: I'll be a shitty friend that never messages first and over the span of a few weeks they'll grow tired of me and delete me off their friends list.

I am well aware that this could all be avoided if I'd just message my friends more often and put in some effort to staying in touch with them, but I've frankly lost all faith in myself. I've been this way for so many years already that I can't even remember if I was any different back in the day.

This post ended up way longer than anticipated, sorry about that. If any of you have been in a similar situation, maybe you'd like to share how you went about handling it?

149,throwawaysad444,1632924908,1," 

When I was about 8 years old, my teacher at my old school suspected I have Asperger's, due to my 'inappropriate reactions to certain situations'. I got tested, and the test came back as negative. I did lie to the psychologist/psychiatrist/whoever it was, in response to certain questions, because I thought I'd get myself, or my family, in trouble if I answered truthfully (eg. do you feel your parents love a sibling more than you ? I answered no, even though they do love my brother more. A lot more)

I have always had trouble maintaining friendships, and I don't really have any proper female friendships. I always think everything is okay, until the friend suddenly disappears, and cuts all contact, with no explanation. I don't ever recall saying anything unusual/rude, but the change in attitude is palpable.

I can make friends, but I have a huge trouble maintaining them, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Am I missing certain cues or whatever. Because if I am, I literally have no clue when. I have always been a bit 'off' I guess; I never felt like I belonged. I've been bullied/ostracised everywhere I go, from a young age.

I don't know if this is because I've been through heavy childhood abuse growing up, and then sexual abuse as a teen. I think this may have contributed, because people sense I am hiding trauma. Don't tell me to get a therapist; if I could, I would, believe me. I don't know what's wrong with me.

When I start a conversation with someone, initially, they're eager to talk, and are friendly and all the rest. But as time goes on, they become increasingly withdrawn and quiet, to the point where they drop me and never speak to me again. This contributed to my drug use- when I was partying and getting high, everyone was my friend. But guess what, when I got sober, they all dropped me too.

I will never find a true connection. I have given up on love. The only time I've been asked out was as a joke. I'm cursed to be a loner, and it sucks, because I geniuenly crave human interaction.",lonely,maybe I have Asperger's,2021-09-30 00:15:08

We do have an age limit, we're looking for people similar in age so 18-26 only please! The majority of the members are towards the younger side with only a handful of members above 23.

The grey clouds with a touch of purple slowly lit up the morning sky. A moist wind slowly brushed past me while I opened the large windows with my cup of coffee, for a breath of fresh air. The leaves in the garden were wet with dews and the smell of grass was all around. 

I picked myself up and then slowly walked past the wave of people rushing through the bridge. Who knew where they were rushing to, to their jobs or maybe to their schools even? I slowly walked past the tsunami reading my book and ignoring the people around. I saw my bus, about to leave the stop, while I was in no rush, I kept on reading and walking slowly, and then I found the rare bus that would take me to the university, uncrowded and peaceful, slowly moving towards me. 

Looking out the window, the darkness of the early morning started to vanish slowly, and moment by moment the sky became much more blue than usual. 

The moment I got off the bus, at the university, the moment was mesmerizing; the sun shone brightly on the horizon, the blue sky in the back, the grass and the trees with their greenness highlighted brought an energy that I so dearly missed in these recent mornings. 

The moist cool wind added to the amazing feeling and once again, it made me realize that these are the small things in life that make it beautiful.",lonely,"Hello, dear morning!",2021-09-29 17:31:21

I was recently blamed for incorrect information in an email at work that I did not send. My manager knows I did not send this email but said that it was my fault because I had told the person that sent the email what to say. The thing is, I didn’t even write what was put in that email. Whatever was incorrect I never saw and I never told that person to type out but I was blamed for the misinformation. I also need to add that the contents of the email were told to me by my manager so whatever she told me is what was put in that email. She told me that I was embarrassing to her and that I need to take the blame because I started the email. I kind of went off on a tangent but the point is situations like this are not uncommon for me. From being called lazy for using acronyms in my personal notes instead of writing full sentences to be accused of disrupting the class when I was asked a question, for some reason people just seemed to find it easy to blame me or get unreasonably upset at me for something that did not warrant that reaction. I’ve thought about these events for years and because there are too many of them for it to be coincidence, I know that there has to be a reason for them. As stupid as it sounds I think that people see me as less than because of my personality and physical appearance. I think I am an easy target and they know I won’t question or make a scene so they can get as upset as they want to make themselves feel better. I’m something of an outlet for them. My link to this is other traumatic experiences for me that have also occurred more times than I want to admit. I’m embarrassed to say that several people have called me ugly, lazy, and annoying to my face (including family and crushes). Again it’s embarrassing but an event like this has happened as recently as last year. I’m 20 years old btw and I thought that calling someone ugly to their face was something that kids would do but I guess adults feel the need to do so as well (yes they were older than me). The reason why this makes me feel lonely is the fact that I don’t share these experiences with anyone close to me. They are too humiliating and the people around me are more attractive than I am and I know that they have never experienced something similar. Also, like I said earlier, some of my family is guilty of treating me this way as well. I just feel like these are humiliating events that have damaged my self confidence and the idea of actually sharing the details with people would make them even worse. It’s one thing to be called ugly or annoying, it’s another thing to have to tell someone that you were called that.",lonely,Feeling Worthless,2021-09-29 16:53:41

Basic info: I'm 19F, I have an amazing job with great pay, I have a loving family, pets, friends, no relationship yet- but hopeful, hobbies... I'm working with a psychotherapist, psychiatrist and support team for some pre-existing mental health issues. 

My love language is touch. Since COVID-19, I feel like I've just been ever so slowly deteriorating. My unit right now are my parents and my little sister. I work from home all day, and when I'm done with work and school I'm cleaning/cooking for them. When they come home all I want are hugs and to talk, but they get tired of me quick. My parents allow maybe five minutes of hugging and chatting before they're tired of me. And I get it... they work all day, the last thing they want to do is have their too-old daughter hanging off their shoulders. I'm just sick of all my hugs being cut short because a phone is ringing, or because my mom doesn't want to see me. And my sister? Completely touch averse. She HATES being touched. I ask why, if there's something I did to make her angry. She just plain isn't interested. And again I understand. She's 15, we get on better through text than we do whenever I come into her room to talk. We're close and thick as thieves over the phone, but the second I open her bedroom door she's growling at me to get out- 'go away, go away, go away'.

I've talked to my parents about it before, about my feelings. My mom doesn't even try to soothe my worry. I raise concerns about not making friends- or even excitement to go to a school event, and she shuts me down. Saying people won't like me because I'm clingy. I reach out to my best friend- and all she can say is 'lmao' 'sorry' 'epic' 'k'.  

They just have no idea how much it hurts to feel them pull away from me. The way my whole body almost... crushes like a soda can. 

I feel hollow all the time. The same way I felt when I was at the worst of my depression. My chest aches, my stomach always feels like someone just kicked it. I feel like I do everything everyone tells me to do. I go out; I talk to the people I work with; I call my grandparents once a week if not more; I garden and get outside; I do crafts- I work with my hands; I do yoga- nine hours of sleep- adequate nutrition- water- blahblahbalhahrgbajdsbfds.

To start off I’m an 18 year old guy about to turn 19 in a month or so and as you all might’ve guessed it already I’m a complete loner with no one to get guidance from in regard to becoming an independent individual. I basically cut off a lot of toxic friends and the only toxic ones left are my family. Now I’m not in the position to say a big eff you to them and leave my home and go live off alone. I have been looking for jobs for the past few months and am really unsuccessful at finding one. I have no work experience as I’ve always been insecure about myself whether it’s my height, voice, or the way I look which is why I never went out as much because I lacked a lot of confidence. I haven’t been able to do half the stuff that kids my age have been able to do. My family is really dysfunctional in the sense that everyone just keeps arguing and being resentful towards each other. I feel stuck and hate myself for not being able to put the effort towards getting a job and working my ass off just so that I can one day find a place for myself away from all of this. P.S. I don’t just sit around at home doing nothing. I go to college but I’ve taken a semester off due because during the summer, as I mentioned earlier my father passed away and I was taking classes but decided to take fall semester off, to focus on myself and my mental health. I just want some guidance on what’s best for me to do and what I can do other than getting a job to distract myself or to keep myself busy. Thank you.

Primary school staff praised me for being 'gifted' and so my mother forced me to focus on my academic life (and maths challenges) - that which I will never even top to begin with, ruling out everything else in the process. It turns out that 99% of people I met in high school were interested to know more about me just for laughs.

Nowadays I force myself too. Everything seems like it requires more effort than it needs to. I put on a brave face to go to work. To attend class. To even eat breakfast and watch crap with my family. It all feels scripted. I don't bother telling anyone in real life because they'll either dismiss or make fun of me, so I just keep smiling.

He was emotionally abusive so we didn't last (2 yrs). Quite foolish how I just jumped into a marriage because I didn't know what real love was. After the divorce, i fooled and dated around.. nothing serious on the mens part but I was always looking for something serious... even though the love was never reciprocated. I don't know what's wrong with me and why am I so unloveable?, all I want is someone to talk to and reciprocate back to me what i give to them. I want kids badly but I don't want kids past 30, my parents are unfortunately older and sickly so i'm worried they wont ever see grandkids, which I desperately want.

I know what's good for me and that's currently nobody. I have the smallest crush on a friend and the guy I used to crush on just isn't someone I want to pursue a relationship with.

On one hand, that's great, no one occupies my mind and distracts me. I can focus on myself and that should be enough. Though, I can't help the longing I feel in my heart. I want to tell someone they are so precious, that I adore them, tell all the things I love about them while I run my fingers through their hair and give them gentle kisses. And I would melt if someone constantly gave me hugs or wrapped their arms around me. I've discovered that I enjoy the kind of hugs where one arm is used to hold my body and the other cradles my head in their hand. It makes me think I'm something precious, something to hold with so much care. After how much I was told I was a burden by my ex's, if someone were to embrace me like that and tell me ""you're not the cruel words they said you were,"" I think I would find it in me to be vulnerable again.

I’ve posted a few times here and just like everyone else it’s when I was at my worst and darkest moments. I’m posting today bc I wanna vent and bc I think I’m finally getting past it all and maybe just maybe this post can help remind you that in your darkest moments the one thing that remains even if you don’t believe it yourself yet is… hope. Hope that you’ll find the answers to your problems. 

Some context for you. I always thought I was a terrible person and this year really pushed me to my limits bc I always tried making every one around me happy and never took the time to do it for myself but always managed to do terrible thing’s and when I screamed and cried for help online and to whom ever took a second to listen I received no answer or loving embrace. I was told from my closest friends that it’s a part of growing up that we separated especially when I became extremely suicidal, it felt like that they didn’t care anymore and that broke my heart and mind especially after the mental and physical abuse by my family. I’ve spent my last three birthdays alone crying, tried committing suicide at least a dozen times by trying to hang myself, shooting myself, jumping off my balcony, and OD on pills. I got into some terrible situations with drug dealers loosing 20 grand bc of it and getting kicked out of every place I was staying. I couldn’t hold a job down and on top of loosing friends bc of my selfish actions I ran away from all my problems with no real plan but I had a bit of an adventure that opened up my mind to the possibility that I can be better if tried a little bc of the ppl who took me in and talked to me like a human being. The words and time I shared with these strangers really opened up my mind, I still had a long way to go though. Just in this last week everything changed and I’m feeling a lot better about myself bc again I saved three more peoples lives from terrible situations. A trans girl jumped in front of a train and I tackled her out of the way and just missing getting hit myself, a women on my block from being raped and beaten, and an old man from getting attacked by a crazy person in the subway (nyc problems) years ago I saved four other ppls lives but i never really talk about it and I still don’t. Now to the point of this post. You’re not alone someone out there is waiting for you! A lover, a new friend, and maybe someone who needs to be saved just like you and bc you feel depressed and you know their pain you can connect with them on a deeper level. Maybe not today or tomorrow but soon just don’t give up. Go and celebrate your bday by treating yourself I’ve notice ppl posting about celebrating by themselves a lot or talk with strangers they may tell you something you need to hear, whatever it is just know one moment will change your life and if you still feel like your trap just remember that you’ve gotta love yourself even the mistakes bc when you’ve hit rock bottom you’re open to the greatest change possible!

I feel so weird and lost and just idk I really can't describe this feeling. Hollow? We reconciled by me approaching her to apologise for shouting at her. She spoke to me normally from then on. But I'm not able to be completely myself. I used to regard her as one of my best friends and shared a whole lot of things with her. I was always talking to her about everything. But now I just can't seem to bring myself to do that anymore. I can't even look her in the eyes and speak to her like I used to. I'm even avoiding her. I really don't know what to do.

Another decided to end our friendship over a difference in opinion over politics- that’s ok I suppose.  Happens a lot these days I guess.

At one party I attended sober where they were bumping cocaine and ketamine, one of them I truly believed I was closest to greeted me with “what are you doing here?” and then a few minutes later, with a cocaine bumper to his nose asks me in this really flippant way, “is this ok?!” (meaning will it bother me, which of course it would not and did not until he said it so mean).

I finally moved away to a different town where I can’t seem to meet anyone who isn’t threatened by me for some reason.  I’m a bodybuilder and a lot of guys find that off putting I guess.  I do my best to be really humble and kind.

In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship friendship causes pains
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

I don't know and no matter how many friends I have and how I'm really not so lonely I am, I still can't feel that same feeling of everything being fixed when I was a mess. She turned my life around and I let her go. I'm missing someone that gives me a different type of attention. My therapist says I don't act like I want attention but I'm relationship hungry because I had someone who turned my life around and put light in my heart. Then I blew it 4 months ago and now I'm all alone. People don't understand why I can't let go but I already let her go and she's found somebody new. 

I just need that comfort again and it doesn't help that most people that I know have girlfriends and boyfriends. 

I'm so alone and no one irl who really cares for me, understands. I just want her again, I just want my life to turn around again, I'm not doing as good as I can say or show. I don't know what to do anymore, I tried to move on with someone new but I fed him too much at once and now he's gone. The only thing that's going good is how I'm going really smooth with this one girl. 

I've learned from my mistakes and I know what to do now but I'm afraid to try again.

So I’m in a weird position socially, and always have been for years. I‘ve always had friends in school. Every class I’m in and have been in, I’ve had friends to chat with. I’m definitely not popular but I’m not exactly an ""outcast"". I’ve also always been socially anxious yet I find it easy to strike up conversations with most people?

My problem is that I’ve never been able to develop strong and personal friendships with these people. Because of my anxiety (and depression) I’m always self-conscious of how I act, talk, text with people. So in turn, I would avoid contact with people after school hours. There were times where I’d start to get close with people and we’d eat at lunch together, hang out, and text. But then we’d start to drift because either 1) I’d get self-conscious and convince myself they don’t like me or 2) not put in any effort into the friendship because I was lazy or just too depressed.

So for the last 2 years or so, I’ve had a hard time making friends. Everyone already has their established friend groups, and even though I might know some people in that group, I still feel awkward and out of place when talking with the group.

Honestly, this never really bothered me much up until this year. I’m now a senior in high school and this is the year you want to have friends. Homecoming dances, prom, going to football games, senior costume week, etc etc… Unfortunately I don’t have anyone to enjoy this year with.

I know I probably won’t care about this in a couple years but I’m still so bummed out. I really wished I would be able to look back on this time with fond memories, but unfortunately, it looks like that won’t be the case. I wish I could be having so much fun like everyone else I know, but instead I’m venting online about how I have no friends.. 🥲🥲

About 12 days ago I turned 30, my health hasn't been the best. I got VSG surgery in Tijuana, I lost over 100lbs and I haven't had a followup. I ended up getting shingles due to stress of starting a new job in a new career field. Yesterday my mom told me she has breast cancer and I need to be checked. I don't want to go to the doctor. I don't see any point in prolonging my life, I'm 30 I don't have close friends and I don't have a romantic partner. I've only had one bf in my early 20s, I slept around coping with the rapes I experienced as a child. I got extensive therapy last year resolving my trauma, but there is a lingering negative notion. 

I chose not to let people close to me, I'm a notorious at pushing people away. I haven't met anyone I felt worth taking a risk on and I tend to size people up and second guess if they're worth the energy. Going through hell leaves a mark, and most of the people I tried to have in my life wanted me to give everything and be okay with them giving bare minimum. I don't want to disrespect myself anymore, I know I take accountability for the folks I chose to be involved with, its not all their fault.  

I've considered going to therapy again, but I am tired of the self-help, I accept myself as I am, and I don't think its healthy to constantly be searching for things that are wrong with me. On the same coin it troubles me my deep stubbornness not wanting to go to the doctor and thinking I'll be alone so why bother preventing my demise? I can understand if I had close friends, or a husband or kids, they'd rely on me, there'd be some expectation. But all I have is my parents and relatives they are supportive but they will all pass before me and when they're gone what's the point of going on? I turned 30 being more emotionally stable than I was a few years ago, but I don't see my relationship life going anywhere. When I talk to people, its surface level, I don't see it going deeper, I don't feel anything. I can take praise and praise others and try to motivate others. I don't know, I'm not upset I don't have friends, I am upset that my mom may past in the coming year, and that leaves my dad, those are the only two people I am close to, its tough.

Anyway, my story is simple.
Met my girl in May 2018.
It was a LDR for its entire duration because I am from India, she was from Philippines. Plus we were both broke and didn't have the time to get to meet to each other. Ironically, she got a job and was starting to save for us to meet next year lmao.
We were the perfect couple. Best friends before anything. Clung to each other like leeches.
It was the best shit ever. You know how you JUST know, that she was definitely THE ONE. Yeah, so I knew she was the one. 
The first two years were beautiful man. Yes, we did fought but which couple doesn't? Everyone does. But the first two years were perfect.
Comes lockdown, new job for her, everything changes. 
She starts being a .. little different. We start fighting more often. Fights starts getting more and more about serious topics.
Come, August 2021. For the first time ever in my life. I tell her that she is very different from the person I know and I am done with her. I tell her that I am breaking up with her. She tells me to wait, practically begs. We talk about it. I tell her what she has been doing wrong, she agrees, we decide to make it work.
Still, things don't change. 

You know how you just know that your significant other has stopped loving you?
Here are the hints I caught on -
She literally stopped saying ILYs to me, she stopped replying to me, she'd leave me on seen, she had a night shift so she'd sleep in the day on weekdays so she could stay up at night, so the only time we had together was on the weekends and apparently she had started hanging out with this friend from school who she spent nights playing with? When she couldn't even watch a proper movie with me .. anyway the list is too long. 

I just know that she has ditched me for this other guy. I don't give a fuck about that anymore. I mean I do. I am trying to act like I don't care. But man, I am in so much pain. I finally went to the therapist that I have been avoiding for years. My anti-anxiety and anti-depressants have been started but they don't work for shit.

""It's not about the fact that she left me, but she left me for a man who isn't even half of me""

I am so fucking lonely guys. I constantly feel like I need a vice to distract myself from all this hurt. I wish these drugs worked but they don't. I have all the friends that I need but I can't keep my chest from hurting constantly. All I ever wanted was love. My parents didn't give it to me. My ex didn't give it to me. And I just keep spiralling more and more into depression everyday. Why can't I find someone who'll hold me and tell me that everything will be alright?

289,Strict-Doughnut-8137,1632828214,1,"     Basically just a big rant here, but lately I’ve just noticed that I’ve sabotaged everything for myself. I lived most of my life under the safety of religion, and now that I realize that I don’t fit into its confines I am so alone. Everyone in my social life is homophobic, and against everything that I now realize I am a part of. My parents don’t know anything about how I feel, my siblings would rat me out if I ever told them anything, and my friends would just belittle me (more than they already do). My town is small and bigoted, and I have no one to connect with.

     I’ve never had the chance to be in a romantic relationship with anyone, and because I’m gay and live in a republican town I may never have the chance. Any potential LGBT friends I could have made I have already avoided due to my previous homophobia. Online friends can be even worse, and always leave me in a toxic mindset.

     The worst part is that I am the one responsible for this. I have alienated myself from the outside world in an attempt to stay “pure” and now I have no escape. I just want  someone to love me, but romantically no one has and ever will. I sit through church every Sunday, knowing that everyone there would disown me if they ever found out about my secret. They have a facade of kindness, but as soon as their beliefs are challenged they become the worst people I have ever met.

     I shouldn’t even feel like this. I have been privileged all of my life, and I don’t have the right to be upset. I haven’t struggled enough for my feelings to be valid. I shouldn’t even be able to feel this way.

     I don’t really have anything here right now to live for, and I would be a liar if I said I never thought of ending it all. Everyone says that things will get better soon, but I have seen no example of this positive change. I am trapped, with no escape, and I have to either accept my fate and live life in the shackles I built or be a coward and die before I ever got to live.",lonely,I’ve self-sabotaged my life,2021-09-28 21:23:34

my online friends have conditioned me to speak less as well by making fun of me everytime it happens. i know its a stupid psychological thing but i find it so hard to actually talk to people effectively now. i used to be outgoing but ive inadvertently made myself socially inept.

that, combined with the covid lockdown has made it so hard to actually talk to people now, i feel like an idiot but i just cant work up the courage to do it anymore. everyday i can feel potential friendships/opportunities for socializing slipping between my fingers and its agonizing, knowing just how much ive already missed out on/will miss out on in the future.

So I've seen a lot of horrible shit in my life. Just a little background on me there. I'm also heavily addicted to (TW/TRIGGER WARNING: DRUG USE) opiates, benzodiazepines and i rely heavily on weed, too. Am currently tapering off of all of these at the same time but dunno if i can do that anymore.

Anyways, I've been mind-numbingly lonely my whole life. I've had one person I'd consider a real ""girlfriend"" ever and it lasted a month. But this other girl (we'll call her H)...  Oh man. She's the most gorgeous person I've ever laid eyes upon. I have crippling depression and anxiety and she's saved my life MULTIPLE times. There's nothing I'd rather be doing right now than be laying on this couch, snuggled up with her smoking a blunt and watching a movie. She's the most amazing woman I've ever met. Words fail me.

The other day, for the first time in YEARS i relapsed HARD on an extremely potent drug i was trying to use to taper and i blacked out, remembering *very* slight bits and pieces. During this period, I messaged her and i confessed my love to her. I told her i loved her and i had loved her since i first met her, all the way back in elementary school. A lot of it came out stupid, but I thought it turned out okay for the most part.

But of course, the universe has cursed me again. Apparently she has a boyfriend now (or claims to). I asked her if we could please at least just stay friends... No response. She was the last person i would have considered a friend, and now she's gone too, along with my entire family (long story, they stole everything from us and we were homeless)

Ah man. Last light i overdosed and almost died. I'm sorry guys. I don't have the strength to do it anymore. I've spent my entire life having people tell me what a piece of dirty brown water trash i am. I've tried to ""opt out"" of life many times and surprise surprise, it never works either... NOTHING good EVER happens to me anymore. I have nothing and nobody.

I commuted to college so I missed out on the dorm life and making new friends. I still have a core group of friends that I’m in touch with even though I live in a different city now but I pretty much spend all my time outside of work by myself.

At first it wasn’t too bad since I really enjoy my job and I felt a sense of accomplishment that I have such a good job at a young age (I treated my loneliness in college by studying and developing a true interest in my field). Now I’m at a point where I don’t feel anything.

I feel the weight of being alone but also have no energy to make the changes I know I need to make. I’ve wanted to start dating and I think if I made the effort i could really have some success (I’m nowhere near perfect but comfortable with what I bring to the table).

It was like they almost said ""Why?"" after asking me that I was with them.

I am just a boring person ig, that no one even bother to notice me, that does explain a lot why I never had any friends but common atleast my family shouldn't do that.

I have been feeling lonely since a long time, no one to talk to and at this point just f*** off, I don't want anyone, I will just carry my stupid emotions and die some day, and no one would even be at my funeral ig, but those same family members may be thanking that I won't be there with them in the car anymore and that makes me happy if they will be happy after that, atleast I made someone happy after my death.

I have no idea why and if this even makes any sense but I try to choke myself every night with hell lot of chocolate in my mouth, so that may be it really gets stuck in throat, I want to feel death everyday but damn it the chocolate melts after some time and I am saved, I just hope that it really gets me one day so that I can be free by accidental death or something, until then I will be venting more.

371,ResidentThen6824,1632778163,1,"I’m 18(m) dealing with mental and physical abuse. And I’m running away. I’ve ran away before but I got caught. I’ll give u my story.

So I ran away about 3 months ago. I met a girl on Reddit and she lived a state away from me and we decided to run away together. So after two weeks of planning I was ready to leave. I had about 400 dollars on me. I packed my bag with clothes. I filled it and it was about 20 pounds. I also took my laptop with me and that was the most important thing to me. That’s how I would contact my friend. The plan was simple, I go over to her state and stay at a teenage homeless shelter. And wait for her until she got ready which was about 2 weeks. So I packed my bags and left in the morning when my parents thought I was in school. I live in NYC and I had to get to NJ. I took a bunch of trains and busses and finally got to Trenton, NJ.When I got there I went to the nearest dunkin so I can use there WiFi and found a homeless teenager shelter. It was basically for kids who ran away or they are homeless. I thought it would be a perfect place to stay but I was wrong. I found a shelter home and went there. When I got there they asked a bunch of questions and I had to tell them my plan and what I was going to do. I told them about my friend and where she lived. I literally told them everything from our plan to my situation at home.?At the end of it they said they needed to call the police or whatever and set up a conference with my parents. For me this was a big no. When I left I wanted to never see my parents again but this girl in front of said that she was gonna contact them. I didn’t know what to do so i just gave her all the information. Then we were in a phone call with child protective services I had to tell them all the abuse I was going through. They said that they were gonna run an investigation on my family. After the phone call the women took me to a room, she gave me the internet password and told me that she needed to do something. She said to stay in that room until she comes back. And she left. That’s when I decided to hit up my partner and I told her the situation and she told me to leave right away and I listened. My heart was beating so fast as I left the place hoping that nobody would see me and bring me back. Then I decided to go to the city where my friend lived. So I opened my laptop and got the directions to Atlantic City NJ. It took about a 3 hour bus ride but I finally got there. When I got there I had no idea what to do. It was around 7 o’clock and I needed to find a place to sleep. I saw a Dunkin’ Donuts and used there free WiFi. (Dunkin was my best friend through this hard trip) I found a homeless shelter for all people. So I decided to go there. I was lost for about 2 hours until I finally found the place. Once I got there they said they had no room and I needed a COVID test. This broke my heart I could never go to a hospital cuz if I went there I would get caught. So shelters were out and I could never go there. So at this point I’m just walking around not knowing where I’m sleeping until I thought of the bus terminal. I thought I could just stay there over night. There where a bunch of police officers there so all the other homeless people wouldn’t bother me and it was a perfect place for me to stay. So I slept there. And that was my new home. The police officers wouldn’t bother you to much. They will just wake you up once in a while. But it was impossible to sleep there. The chairs where solid steel which meant they got cold quick and there would be a bunch of crackheads making so much noise. But it was good it was shelter for me. The next day would be a busy day for me. I was gonna look for a job. I woke up around 8 and left to the library. I stayed there until 1 and left looking for a job. Atlantic City was known for there famous board walk. Which was basically a bird walk across there beach. There was a lot of stores in that area, about 200 all in the same place. So this is where I was gonna look I searched all day and only found one person that was interested. The reason it was so less is because no one wanted to hire an underage guy. The guy told me that he had to talk to his partner and said to come back tomorrow at 11. And I listened. I came back the next. And he had bad news. He said his partner said no but he knew a guy that was hiring he said that guy was going to open a pizza shop in two weeks and I couldn’t take that job. So I started looking again I spent my whole day there looking for jobs and I finally found one. Some nice Indian man gave Me a job. I told him about my situation and he gave me the job. The man had a clothing store, two of them to be exact. His wife ran one and he ran the other. And the stores were close to each other, they were a few stores away from each other. I usually worked in his wife’s store. I would work from 11- 11. It was tough but I needed the job. The first day passed. The next day I came back at 11 and I was working hard. Around 4 o’clock his wife called me over and told that her husband wants to talk to me through the phone and I got the phone expecting him to say to bring something to him but he told that there were 2 men outside of his store looking for me. Hearing this my heart dropped. He told me that they had a picture of me and looking around for me. I told him to tell them I was not there and he said ok. After I gave the phone back to his wife I saw my uncle and my cousin come through the door. And at that moment I knew everything was over. They got to me and took me home. My father was also there. I asked later how they found me and they told me that we looked here because the women I met at the teenage shelter that I would be going there. The shelter was the death of me. Now I’m back home back in sweet sweet NYC but I’m looking to run away again in a year. I already have 1 person with me but I’m looking to get a bigger group so it could be easier to live. I’m from the NYC. Thank you for reading this long ass post and feel free to dm me if your interested.",lonely,Running Away (long read),2021-09-28 07:29:23

So all day I've been really lonely and craving companionship, sex, cuddles, etc. Hell, I'd settle just to be on the phone talking with a woman I love. But I'm single, tinder isn't doing anything, no one wants me, and I haven't had even a kiss in a year and a half.

I have a broken back and except for 1 day, I've been in nonstop pain for 2 yrs now. (Also told I'm getting a fusion soon, so yay another surgery)

I lost most of my friends, who I thought were my ""real"" friends, and I lost my best friend/love of my life 4 yrs ago when she just abandoned me and blocked me out of nowhere one day.   It's destroyed my mind and heart.    

I can't have her cause she acts like I don't exist and never have. And won't talk to me.

 The other woman I actually care about and also have a huge sexual crush on is married with kids and is like 20 yrs older than me. Also she's kinda a Doctor, so for so many reasons it'll never work... And it honestly makes me sad.

So them my friend calls, he lost his V this past week, with an absolutely beautiful woman. Like someone who's totally my type and like my dream girl. Pale, great body, I'm told she's super sweet and nice which is huge for me... Dark hair, has really good hygiene...etc.   so he tells me how great it was and that she's like a pornstar in the bedroom. Like she's loud and vocal/dirty talk (which is also something I want and have never had)  and super passionate. She was clean and they didn't use condoms (I've only ever used condoms and have only cum from sex like 3x out of the 18x in my life I've had sex) like everything about his experience was perfect. They were together 3 days and nights, they cuddled, they had lots of sex and sensual experiences... She was super kind and nice to him... 

I'm happy for him. I really am. He's one of like 3 friends I have left. (The other 2 are online friends)

But he got literally everything I've always wanted.

And now I feel like shit. And worthless. Physically I'm in pain from my back, mentally I'm lonely af, and my heart hurts cause I seriously don't think I'll ever have something like he got to experience.

I’ve not had a social life for a few years now. I do have ‘friends’ but I’ve become distant with them. In the last few years I’ve been trying to use friendship making apps to make new friends. I knew it would be hard to make friendships as an adult, but didn’t know how hard it would be. 
I live with a chronic illness and now I have mobility issues and I’ve not been able to leave the house, which has added to me me with a decreased social. I’m soon going to be buying a wheelchair and I’ll hopefully be able to meet people, but I have social anxiety and whenever I’ve met someone from the apps I’m using I’ve always thought there’s potential friendship but they disappear. 
I’m in a (happy) relationship, but a close friendship is what I’m craving now. 
I’ve never really had a close friend and the friends I thought were close where really close. It would be nice to have someone who I feel comfortable with as my current friends I’m not comfortable with them now. I know sometimes we grow out of friendships so I’m not really sad about it.

I don't know if this is the right sub to post this but since I'm very much active here and comment on people's posts, I felt more comfortable posting it in here. 

I'm someone who is a bit too anti-social and don't have many friends. But things I like are not really my friends' favorites, so I was wondering if I could find some people who share the same interests with me, and maybe, recommend some stuff.

* I love futuristic stuff, things like cyberpunk aesthetics, robots, aliens, rockets, etc. 
* I like learning new things and talking about them but my main interests are philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Not that I know much about them, though... :) 
* I love art.

390,PointSight,1632769832,1,"Hey, all.

Though I'm new to this subreddit, I'm kind of sharing my story in as many places as I can since I really need the helping hand. I've never really detailed the perils of my life that much, be it not really fitting in at high school or having a dad that verbally abuses me and disregards my worries all the time, but this week - no, this *month* \- has been particularly unkind to me. It's probably the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of living in.

I have 26 hours of class every week in college (when factoring in my biweekly twin 2-hour study group sessions), and the attention siphoning, homework and studying that results from that just drains my mind to an extent that is almost indescribable. It's almost like getting hydrochloric acid poured into your skull via a cavity of some sort. I seldom get much fulfilling time to myself, and even then, I don't really have a clue on what I enjoy doing as a pastime, so I never have fun with myself. I just worry that I'm going to be this way for the remainder of my life.

On top of that, in the gaming Discord I host, some guy decided to post NSFW in general (cliche, I know), which I let him do as a 'training exercise', not knowing he was doing it to agitate my other friend, a moderator. They wouldn't stop, and they both left me, never to come back, finding that I was the root cause. Then I had another friend disappear on me for almost three weeks - she's back now, but residual stress and worry is a bitch, and I've also been feeling severely inadequate about my levels of intelligence, since in spite of every member of my family **telling me** that I'm smart, I'm worried that all my work is just going to get smashed down anyway (although I have proof to the contrary, I still worry about it day and night).

It all culminated into a very spur-of-the-moment outburst that I had, and happened to push onto my girlfriend, idiotically enough. I told her that I thought long and hard about breaking into the medicine cabinet, but the only thing stopping me was my dad being on the same floor when I walked downstairs from my room. Thinking that she'd treat it as 'just another incident', she ended up entering a state of extreme panic, and told me in a text message that my behaviour was unacceptable, and until I get help of some kind, that we were done.

Fucking *great*. The one person I could lean on for anything and everything no longer wants anything to do with me (or so it feels) aside from the occasional meme or anime art post. And my dad will 100% stop me from getting therapy since he views 'modern' mental health, barring his own, as a hoax.

I currently live in a small town of 13.000 with absolutely no kinds of clubs or social activities besides meeting up with friends. All my friends have now currently moved away, and ate busy with their education at the moment, and I broke up with my ex about half-a-year ago, because of compatibility issues. 
This has led to me feeling very lonely and touch-starved, as 99% of my day is spent all alone or talking on the phone, which just does not cut it, in the long run.

I dropped out of my service-education a couple of months ago due to extreme amounts of stress and too little motivation due to online-education with no face-to face interactions for half-a-year. I'm currently in the process of looking for a job or an internship at s local store.
This has then led to me not really having anything to do most days, and daily people to cooperate with.

So I was wondering, is this just the result of me waiting for something to happen, or do I just need a drastic change in my life? 

Will it get better when I get a job, and thus some colleagues and a possible partner, or do I just have to move into the city, get in touch with my friends and join a club?

I was somewhat OK with my life up until 2 years ago, not even anything to do with Covid, it's just the eternal loneliness and the fact that I push everyone away from me, mostly those who really wanna love me.

I can't put my feelings down and my mind feels like a gas giant where nothing makes sense, all I want is someone to be real with, but nobody likes sad people I guess, so I just go ahead and be me. Everyone else thinks I'm doing pretty good, so even when I try to vent I don't get the actual support I need, leaving me socially exhausted and I just stumbled upon this reddit because it feels like the best place to vent on, no idea if anyone is reading up to this point,

So anyway, I eat alone, I sleep alone, I don't even feel like talking to anybody - I just listen to Kanye and hit the gym frequently - the only thing I really feel like doing.

The fact that scares me the most is that I'm OK with most of it, I just feel like I don't care not having a good job, or living in my current state, like I'm OK with being mediocre, and god damn that sends chills down my spines just the thought of being so average,

I don't know what to do - Really, no \*\*\*\*ing idea how to get through this, at first I told myself it's just a phase and it'll pass, it doesn't.

408,AqualusioInFaciem,1632759781,1,"Do any of you have experience with eliminating lonelyness without being anymore social?

**Why I am asking:** For the last few years I've felt increasingly socially isolated  from my peers (not that I ever was very social) and developed the belief that most people I meet soon grow tired/annoyed by my presence. I often sense that when I speak people cringe, look away, and desire for me to be gone. I am convinced that others judge me as incompetent and weird.

I have since become hesitant in spontaneously starting conversation with anyone. The few times others attempt to start social conversation with me, I have sabotaged the conversation by answering briefly and vaguely such that the conversation fizzles out leaving the other party with a slightly disappointed look on their face.

This description may sound like social anxiety, but I do not think that is the case. I study medicine and talk with lots of people (staff and patients) during my clinical rotations, without much nervousness. It is only when conversation turn from professional to personal that I start to feel anxious, vulnerable and distrusting of the other party. I don't want to reveal anything about myself, because I do not think that there is anything good to say; and that anything I say will be used against me later on.

In private, I only have a few friends and I am really bad at keeping in regular contact with most of them. I've started to think it better not to bother them, since they seem to be doing great without me.

It is this combination of feeling like a pariah and the lack of validation that weighs on me as soon as I am alone to reflect on my life. I see this too as a character flaw and I would prefer to be able to just accept my empty social life. God is dead and society owes me nothing, so there is no use in sounding like a crybaby.

I ask for advice in the event that my already chronic situation is permanent.

Video games are typically my ""out"" meaning the way I spend my down time to sort of zone out.  These days even that doesn't help much.  I like them bc it helps turn my brain off to other thoughts but currently can't even stop the feelings from dominating my every waking moment, and dreams too actually.  The feeling of needing something but not knowing what it is and feeling helpless in identifying and obtaining it..

I read about a condition (maybe that's the wrong word for it) called escapism.  It's where someone longs for travel to somewhere, anywhere really, other than where they are at.  Even after taking an amazing trip someone with escapism wants to repack and head out again on another trip.  

Sometimes wonder if that's part of what I'm seeking, although maybe a step further where I long for escaping the life I have and escape to a new one.

I've never been alone really much of my life, the few times I have been I never know what to do with myself.  It's exciting to fantasize about that escape but I fear if that escape comes and I don't feel any better what do I do then?  Would I even take the plunge to go out and experience stuff or would I sit at home alone and sad....

Not sure if this makes sense to anyone else, sometimes feels like I'm being selfish not appreciating what I have enough.  I do appreciate it I suppose but don't experience the joy I think one should with the life I'm living.

424,thewarkitten,1632748389,1,"It seems my whole life has been filled with one painful experience after another. Born into a family who didn't want me, blamed by my mother for being born the wrong sex. Abused in every way possible by my father and called a liar when I eventually spoke up. Isolated and hated by everyone I was supposed to be able to trust. Bullied at school and completely invisible to most people, always pushed aside for everyone bigger than me.

Somewhere in amongst the pain there was joy, I have 3 beautiful children, 2 of which were with a man I thought I was going to call my husband. My forever... However, 2 weeks before christmas last year, while our youngest child was in the hospital (born 17weeks premature and very sick), he ended things. He could no longer mentally cope with our relationship. We were stressed and arguing a lot. I was expressing milk every 2 hours for our premmie, and caring for an 8 year old and a 1 year old, taking care of cleaning, school runs and food shopping, and paying the bills. He was trying to cope with mental issues and his way to cope was to sleep. A lot. There was another woman in the picture towards the end, though he maintains they never did anything, despite my eldest witnessing some things between him and said other woman while i was in hospital, very sick.

After the break up the Department of Child Protection stepped in due to an explosive and abusive argument we had a few weeks post break up, and since my youngest is incredibly high needs they decided to give my 2 older kids to their fathers, so I had no choice but to focus on the needs of my youngest. I now only get to see my middle child once per month as both myself and his father don't drive and his father lives in a remote town with no public transport. I get to see my eldest on weekends and after school on days I have time to pick her up.

I am handling all the needs of an infant with chronic lung disease and an inability to gain weight, sit, crawl or walk. I do it on my own EVERY day and it is so hard. There is hospital appointments, medications, formula/wipes/nappies/food, daily physiotherapy sessions with no helpers.

I took time to work on myself, I fixed a lot of things about my life and got a good job, but nobody to share it with.

Hey ! 
Ladies and Gentlemen . 
This is your boy Oblivion. Not my real name ofcourse. 
What’s life without having some fun. That’s what i ask myself on my lonely nights. 
Being a chronic starver for love &amp; friends I have come to a conclusion people use me and my kindness. Not that am complaining but am tired af. Any way enough of ranting for now before the mods delete my post. 
Let’s talk what I want and need. I have met some cool people here and but as everyone I am greedy I want more. I want to connect and vibe with someone deeply like I am their soulmates, Doesn’t matter if it’s boy or girl. And nah I am not looking for relationship here. Too much to expect from life ? Nah I don’t think so. I got one life and I want to make it memorable. I have been ditched abused used, name it all yet still I rise. I have a roller coaster life Highs and Lows.  That’s the beauty of it. I have picked myself from bottom of life and will rise to touch the sky. The thing is “Never Quit”.
Sounds too much toxic positivity ? Nah trust me I have seen low days where I just wanna sleep for eternity . As I said it’s roller coaster life. 
still reading this ? You are my guy or girl .
Are you looking for same thing ? Are you looking for someone whom you can watch shows and laugh about how unreal it is ? Are you looking for someone you can listen to music together? Are you looking for someone you can make plans and turn that into reality ? 
Are you looking for someone you can do Workout (virtually of course)? Are you looking for someone who has your back ? I gotcha ya . 
In short . Are you looking for partner in crime ? 
See no further and hmu. 
Well to get you started something about me. I am a boy in my twenties obsessed on many things in life . Let’s see what all I like - Good Food for sure, and yes am vegetarian and I agree veg biriyani isn’t nothing more than veg pulao. Indian Sweet’s especially made from Pure Ghee (my apologies to my vegan buddy). What more, I watch many shows and some of favourites are Breaking Bad, Two and Half men , Hannibal , House , Sherlock and many more can’t count.

My partner has been talking to me less and less; I’ve always been a burden to my family; I have no real friends; I don’t even like myself anymore. I want to feel important to everyone around me and have a great support group that hypes me up for every accomplishment I achieve and dream I desire… but it never feels genuine… just half-assed “wow, good job. I’m proud of you” comments. 

I feel so sad watching all my FB friends from all different stages of life moving on with all the things that I WANT for myself: getting married, having kids, being happy with people in their lives… my partner/fiancé (the one that’s been talking to me less and less lately) keeps pushing our wedding plans and doesn’t want kids. I feel so alone in my life, my family, my relationship… so I’ve decided to start distancing myself from everyone near and dear to me so that I can’t expect any kind of support from them.

I go to school, sit alone, do classwork, eat alone, do more classwork, and go home …repeating for another 4 days. In the beginning, I had no issues, I honestly kinda liked it because I was able to have some privacy to do my own things, but as the weeks go by, it hit me a lot harder than I expected. My old friends all made new friend groups and are in different classes so we never see each other except maybe casual bump ins in the hallway. Online school saved me from this very disaster the previous year since I didn’t really need to make any friends, but now I’m really suffering. 

The issue is that I’m terrible at socializing. I can never open up to others and always stay in my own space. If somebody tries to talk to me, I never know how to respond, so I just nervously laugh it off. I often think about talking to somebody, but I never know what to talk about so I give up. I really wish I was more extroverted, so that having to break out of my shell wouldn’t be so scary.

Especially in classes like PE where it isn’t about doing classwork but more so about having to engage with others. In my class, there are people who group off in their little circles, but I’m the only one who’s left alone. In the beginning, I tried convincing myself that being alone isn’t so bad, but the more I go through it, the more I felt like a piece of shit.

Let’s start with upbringing. My mom had me when she was 16 and I was left to live with my grandma at 4 years old. I never knew my dad. 

I’ve always been bullied since early elementary school. I was picked on in a private school until about 8th grade. 
8th grade was the worst. I was bullied pretty bad for being small. I had my first crush in 8th as well, and I remember being ridiculed about that as well. 

Went back to live with mom at 14, she came out of a bad drug habit and my grandpa was in rehab for alcoholism. High school I simply didn’t find anyone interested…at least not the girls I was interested in. 

College I felt practically invisible. I remember being at a soccer game with a group of girls, and them talking about this one player about being able to go up to any chick in high school and get the result he wanted just based on his looks and body. For some reason I felt so small in that moment. That’s how it felt for several years. 

I was rejected by nearly every girl or friend-zoned on the first date. I sit there and watch every girl hookup or date people I knew or other people. I question if it’s my looks, I question if God created me for the sole purpose to suffer. I’m not sure how to find happiness during times like these.",lonely,Today was tough,2021-09-27 14:27:40

I've never experienced a simple tag along most people in a relationship never think twice about. I've never had a Christmas, Birthday, New Year, or Thanksgiving with a spouse. I've never been invited to a spouse's family's member wedding, birthday, baby shower. I've never gotten a real gift from a spouse. I've never gone on vacation with a spouse. I've never even gone shopping for an outfit or got to get ready with a spouse before a night out. Sure I've had pointless dates that amounted to nothing but it's not the same. I honestly get embarrassed on some dates when guys talk about their previous ex's and they ask about mine and I have nothing to say. I honestly get jealous because I never had those experiences and I never will. 

I'm also starting to notice that a lot of these people who were in committed relationships in their late teens and early twenties are starting to break up and they want to be single so they can enjoy the rest of their early and mid-twenties. They want to party and drink, well I already did all that because I was single the entire time. I just want someone that is just as committed as me. I would be happier staying at home instead of going out but I have no one.

The only time I could ever **be** in one regardless is online, when she doesn't have to see my ugly mug on the daily.

Regardless of that happening, some other crap took place too in conjunction with the breakup and now I don't have anyone left. Nobody to text good morning to every day, nobody to send memes to... Nobody to ask how their day is and vice-versa. Nobody that cares.

These past few days have been a real eye-opening experience for me. I uh... have a lot of self reflection to do and I'm purposefully being vague to keep me from looking like an asshole based on actions I did three and a half years ago. Apparently I can still lose people from things my stupid ass past self did... I just wish I could've done some introspection sooner and saved me the trouble of losing one particular person that I would've *gladly* traded anything to keep. She was real important to me.

485,Unlucky_Ad7732,1632706062,1,"I am reasonably financially well off (for an 18 yo anyway), my family isn’t struggling, and yet… I just see no point in life anymore.

I told my father I was depressed, and although he seemed receptive, it won’t mean anything until I recieve actual help.

I live in one of the biggest cities in the US. And yet, despite this, this city feels so utterly vacent.

It’s just miles and miles of suburbs, Fry’s, and McDonalds. That’s fucking it. For as large as this city is, there is pratically nothing to do if you aren’t interested in spending money.

The most interesting thing to do in this city is mall walk. And guess what? You’re constantly being advertised to.

Everywhere is just big chain stores and restaurants, tempting you to buy. Buy buy buy, and you’ll be happy is the biggest lie ever told.

And yet why else would you step outside? All there is to do is either drive, walk, or buy. You can’t do much in a city without money.

It’s suburban hell. There is little sense of culture or community.

Maybe seeking stimuli in the vacuous outside world is my fault, but escapism is just as meaningless.

What’s the point in watching TV, reading, or playing video games? Maybe you learn something about your taste in media, but you didn’t actually do anything. You accomplished nothing in the real world.

What’s the point in trying to accumulate knowledge if there is no one to share it with?

See my point? When you’re alone, the world looses all meaning.

Do I just seek validation from others to affirm my self-worth? Can I not function independent of others?

What’s the point in trying to grow, to discover more about yourself, when you have nobody to talk to? To exchange ideas with?

So much of this world is meaningless on its own. I need friends to make life worth living.

Even if I did have company, I would still fail to find meaning in the world.

Someone give me a reason to even try when so much of our world revolves around consumption and escapism. We try so much to recapture our childhood happiness through buying things and escaping, it’s diminishing returns. It’s just a cope. We are always trying to escape, never content with ourselves. A constant state of unease, of inadequacy.

So what else is there?

496,bradenfrompa,1632699470,1,"TLDR; A sad guy dumping all of his life’s problems on the internet.

I grew up in a rural part of Pennsylvania in the Appalachian mountains, with 2 older brothers and a younger brother. I was raised by my mother and step-father. I had a really nice childhood with them. I played army in the woods in the fall with my little brother, and caught American Bull frogs from the pond behind my house. When I was about 13 my mom and step-father separated. My little brother moved 2 hours away with him, and I began to see him every two weeks. It was around a year later that my mom met her boyfriend I’ll call “J”. My mom and J didn’t get along very well, and there was a lot of alcohol involved which forced my older brothers out of the house earlier on. Things weren’t always bad, and I really liked J. When things did get bad, they got really bad. I remember lots of yelling, and physical altercations. Things went on for awhile, and then in 2015 we lost J to suicide. Things turned for the worst for my mother. She began drinking way more and slowly pushed me out of the house too. I love my mother to death and nothing will ever change that. In the midst of all that I met a girl who I was with for over 4 years. We split up for a year and recently got back together. We’ve been on our own for a year now. I’ve always struggled with what I would call mild depression, and a fair amount of social anxiety. I managed to overcome both of those when I took up programming. I had finally found something that I really enjoyed and I think it was a fantastic way to escape reality. Recently things have gotten pretty bad for me mentally. My mom is losing her house, so I’ve been trying to pay for it and my apartment. I work over an hour and a half away from my house, and I work 12 hour shifts so I’m always exhausted. My girlfriend has recently began to break up with me and wants me out. So I’m sitting here at this job that I hate, just wondering what is the point. I feel more alone than ever, and I’m just tired. I feel like I’m stuck in this repeating cycle. I’ve thought about suicide a lot, but I know what it would do to her and my brothers. I can’t stay in this cycle though, I’m so tired. I just want to rest, but I can’t. This world is a beautiful place, but I am ready to rest.

This is not a call to action, please do not add me and try to help me. I come to the internet for my problems because there’s no commitment. I don’t like talking to people about my problems, but it often helps to vent.",lonely,Life is very lonely,2021-09-27 09:37:50
497,OUOni,1632699412,1,"I’ve realized lately that I’m the background friend. I’m nobody’s first choice to make plans with, nobody calls or texts me first unless they want something from me, nobody comes when I need help, I’m totally and completely an afterthought. I deactivated my social media and turned off the notifications on my phone this weekend to see if anyone noticed I wasn’t there. Nobody did. 

I feel utterly and infinitely alone. 

I gave up on dating. Deleted all my apps and profiles. I just got ghosted over and over, so what’s the point? My last relationship ended this past January when he cheated on me, and right now dating just feels like one gigantic romantic failure after the next. I’m still not anyones first choice. I’m the backup plan. I’ve always been the backup plan. 

It’s not that I’m shy, or quiet, or anything like that. I’m a natural extrovert. I thrive when I’m with people. But they all seem to fade away after a while. Then it’s just me and my deep seeded abandonment issues again. 

I have never done well when I’m alone for long periods of time. The empty feeling inside is starting to feel all encompassing. I’m starting to hate myself again, after I worked so hard for so long to learn to love myself. The self-loathing is back. It’s hard not to be hateful when no one wants you around.

I (29m) was in an amazing relationship was an amazing woman (26). I was head over heels in love with her. I’ve always had girlfriends on and off since like age 14, and she was truly the first girl I fell in love with. 

Long story short, she broke my heart because her friends and family wanted her to be with a European, not an American and wanted her to eventually go back to Europe and they thought that with me could never do that so they essentially bullied her into leaving me. She still tries to talk to me, but whatever, that’s besides the point here. 

Ever since she left me, I’ve become completely depressed due to what I believe is loneliness. I hate being alone. I don’t know how to do it and be happy. I have friends to hang out with and distract myself, but it’s not the same as holding someone that you love, holding their hand when walking down the road, cooking a nice meal together and watching a moving, etc. 

It’s put me in the worst spot I’ve ever been in in my life. I walk around NYC and see all of these couples enjoying life together, sharing a meal, and here I am walking alone through Central Park on a Saturday night. 

I’m on the dating apps, have about 50 girls that have liked my pictures but I don’t find any of them attractive. All of the girls that I do find attractive are probably inundated with messages from other dudes so not having much luck there. 

I’ve already talked to a therapist and she basically was like “welp, breaks up suck young man”

509,tenmaou6,1632695106,1,"My name is M.

I'm a half-filipino/italian man of 29yo. 

I'm 1.70cm tall, of average build with broad shoulders and waist. I wouldn't say I'm overweight but I'm not tight either, anymore, I can still fit into anything S sized and look very much the part.

I'm your average anime and manga fan, things that never left me as I was growing up. Among my favorite series ever are Fist of the North Star, Black Clover, Death Note and Kamen Rider Gaim and Fate/Zero which I believe were written by the same person.

My hobbies are jogging, work out at home, motorcycle touring (former), videogames especially RPGs/JRPGs and fighting games and reading and writing. I wrote short fantasy/sci-fi/drama and romance novels that were never published because I wanted to turn them all into game ideas and scenarios for VNs.

At first I wanted about my whole life but then I was like ""really? people reading here are not payed"" let's just say I think I've hit rock bottom, for like I don't know how many times now, but there are a major three I think. 

One was when my first job fresh outta school didn't work out and then I became secluded in my room for two years. After that before going crazy I told my parents ""I'm getting out of here"" got like 800€ from them then moved into the same city as my girlfriend of the time and started looking for a job, on foot, eating only rice and potatoes and onion that were provided by the landlord.

Second time was when the same girlfriend of 9 years cheated on me, but then again I got back up, motivated by hate and anger and started working hard on myself, improved my position with 2 jobs a full time one and a part time one which netted a lot every month, left with little time to pity on myself, had me maintain my physique and social interactions, that's when I bought a motorcycle, not paid in full but in installments because I just couldn't wait anymore, the bank gladly gave the money to me (of course) and 6 months later I crashed hard and wrecked it after hearing from a ""friend"" that my ex was gonna come to the restaurant where I was working to show off her new boyfriend/life whatever to me and everyone else, furious I took the bike and started running into traffic and overconfidently cut in front of a car. I was perfectly fine but my motorcycle was ruined. I managed to repair it with money from the insurance but then decided to sell it when COVID came.

Third time is now. Shortly before the lockdown, I veery smartly decided to change jobs,  (no one had any idea what would happen around january 2020) and took me like 5 months to find a new one. 

Truth be told, I always held myself to a high standard of justice and morals, valuing honor, hard work and conviction. Always during my life. 

When I moved out of my parent's place I thought of myself as a hero, I rode outta home with a friend with the ending of FF7 Advent Children on the car stereo (not the lame one, the rock n' roll one). I always wore a red scarf whenever I had the occasion (and whenever I wouldn't embarass myself too much) but with a black leather motorcycle jacket, a white long sleeved shirt, black jeans and a red muffler most say I looked really good.

That's why I couldn't tolerate it. I couldn't tolerate a workplace where I could keep my eyes closed, working at whatever speed at whatever level of attention I wanted and still get payed. Heck, we could even put music using our phones and portable speakers during work. If I took a piss under the desk no one would've batted an eye. That's how comfortable my job really was. As long as I worked alone as I always did that would've been fine. But then work really thinned in early 2020 and if that wasn't enough we stopped taking shifts and instead went to a standard 8 to 5, of course, working like that it meant having ALL of the workers coming in and working together (3 or more on 1 machine that would require only 1 person). Things soon began to crack. I couldn't tolerate ANYONE anymore, I wanted to be alone working like I always was, and furthermore the 21yo I taught the work to he... I think I taught him wrong, at first he was humble and everything, rarely speaking his mind, but then I guess I rubbed off on him a little too hard. He started acting overconfident and cocky, in other words, just like me, but then again I had every right to be, I earned that position and recognition by my own merit. 

This is the same game that went on as far and wrecking a coworker car just because this one said something nasty about his newly bought one. Guess who, after being assaulted under his house and having his car broken with a steel pipe while he was busy cowering in fear got LAID OFF by the same company after they heard of it? Yes, not the violent guy that wrecked, but the victim.

That don't make sense now, does it? Yes it does. Because the violent guy played soccer once a week and was very close with the higher ups so they didn't touch him at all, instead they did him a ""favor"". He was my apprentice at work, I naively taught him everything I knew, which pretty much all revolved around working efficiently but leisurely. He was grateful to me and treated me like a friend, sharing Everything with me. Of course also pictures and texts, premeditations and crimes.

The situation was what it was, and thinking it might get him laid off (for obvious reasons) I urged him and provoked him to do it. 

""Yea, wreck his car, the fucker won't know what hit him, that'll teach him"".

Worse that could happen I'd get rid of both nuisances and go back to enjoy working alone at my leisure.

When the opposite happened, I just... I quit. Then the lockdown came, I was without a job and money started to dwindle. I didn't find a job untile late june, which I left as well just after 1 month because there was so little to do and worked all weekends to boot.

I sold my motorcycle to survive, my one pride. Alongside my apartment (which is a pretty cozy and spacious one) was one of the things I got completely on my own without ANY outside help, no bank no nothing, only MY work and money.

A bit of money came rolling in and that made me once again weak, I didn't find a job until September which I also left for the same reasons. Without enough to do to occupy it, my brain would just never stop bugging me. Asking why and how I ended up in such a situation.

Money ran out again, and in december I had to go back to work of course and this time, I really thought I'd be out. This new job was very very very taxing both physically and mentally, but it came with great satisfactions at the end of the end. The suffering was so great that everyone was friend of each other because if you needed a hand you really needed all the help possible there. The pay in fact was great, very much so but... Then... When I started getting comfortable there too and thinking I could do more I... There were genuine friends and honourable people there, friends that even helped and protected me as I raised in position even tho just in name and ""prestige"".

""Is that how a man should live? In comfort, protected by his peers?""

I left it.

""What does it mean to be a guy? What does it mean to be... manly?""

I did all this alone with VERY VERY little help from my old parents.

""Why do you think your girlfriend cheated on you? Because even tho good looking you had nothing else good going on for yourself.""

The proof is that when the money finished my (simp) relationship that was a hanging on a thread finished as well.

""What would we call peace if conflict didn't exist?""

I stopped working out, what's the point if I don't have a girlfriend nor anyone to impress? 

Besides, with so little money and so many debts, If I also work out I'll burn myself out, or at least really lose the energy to... To live.

So far, ever since 2015, since coming here, I've changed 8 jobs, the first 2 lasted me 2 years each, but in the last 2 years I couldn't maintain a job for more than 6 months. 

If I've had a strong drive and will to succeed after breaking up 3 years ago, a desire for revenge and redemption for my mistakes... That all left after I had to abandon motorcycle riding because of financial reasons. That's not all tho. The reason i really bought a motorcycle to begin with was to show off, both to my ex and to reconcile with the girl I left for her by surprising her after a 1k km trip to her home (which didn't turn out to be very logical and affordable so I gave up). I have various tattoos on my body depicting flames and kanji about courage and justice. But now. I...

For some reason I started to enjoy betraying others expectations and trust! Just as she did to me I want to ruin others and myself in the process!

I want to demonstrate that no matter, NO MATTER, how much depraved and twisted I become I can still succeed!

I found a new job, and even tho It's a dead end one and requires the brain cells of a grain of dust It will earn me money with little to no effort.

I'll reestabilish myself as a functioning member of society then quit this place as soon as I have enough money. Change city and start anew, and no one will ever see through me. 

""Then, if you have it all figured out why are you writing this?""

Because... 

""If a man has the respect of others, even with no food he can keep on living.

If a man has food, even if he has no dignity he can keep on living.

If a man has no food and no dignity, he will lose himself to despair at weakly hold onto anything.""

That's the plan, but I dunno I have the fire in me to do it anymore, I wasted 9 years of my life, all of my savings and time, the most precious thing a human has, to simp after one girl.

The same one that uses her networking of little goblins that called themselves ""my friends"" to know everything about me and my plans, trying to show off any accomplishment she had on social media or through our mutual ""friendship"" I abandoned and destroyed them all. I had to.

I HAD TO. 

Why did I stay, why didn't I left when I had the chance?!

What have I done? What am I doing? Why do I hold on to these sick and distorted ideals and can't be a hero anymore? A loyal and trusted companion...

""And become someone you could easily backstab at any moment with anyone batting an eye because 'he had it coming the gullible fool' ""

That's weakness! Being a good person... Being good without being reliable or efficient is just being a worthless weakling.

Any and all that think helped me... I was just using them, feigning ignorance and regret I squeezed everything I could out of them, and I'd... do it again, because... those who get swindled deserve it....

I'll show them I... Why do I feel so bad... Even tho I always did everything on my own and endured hunger, pain and loneliness for so long... after everyone and everything abandoned me in the darkest of times...

Why do people that have everything granted to them and live a leisure life get credit even for the smallest of things?

Why is it all my effort never got any recognition?!

I'm not wrong, I'm not wrong, I'm not wrong, I NEVER WAS! I always, always, ALWAYS went against the current, I ALWAYS fought a lonely battle with very little hope of winning. I made more sacrifices than any of the people I've ever met, so WHY, WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE FEELING LIKE DYING",lonely,29y too old,2021-09-27 08:25:06

There are actually 19 of us, but 17 people had already gone a day earlier due to their visa arriving early. Me and one other people went the next day. On transit, I feel so frustrated because it's a 12 hour transit, and really there is nothing I can do except creating small talks with her. During those 12 hour transit, she got visited by a bunch of her friends. And that's where reality strucks me and I got sad. I want to be visited by my friends, but the fact is, I don't have a friend that is close enough to me to actually want to go visit me at the airport and said farewell. When she got visited by a bunch of her friends, deep down I was saddened. When she exchange conversation with her friends, I was on my phone and my headphones listening to Spotify and watching Netflix. I can't even move my body and got up away from my seat. She was sitting two seats besides me, and her friends was sitting in a chairs in front of us. I really. really want to move to a quieter place to be more relaxed and not entrenched in self-embarassment, but I don't really have the strength to either say it or just straight up do it without saying anything. During the whole convo, I can't even look at her friends' face, because I just feel embarassed, feeling like I don't have any real friends', and just straight up jealous of her. My eyes even felt sappy and just tired because I'm constantly looking at my phone for close to one and a half hour. I don't know if she noticed, but my general attitude (like the way I talk to her, my facial reaction) slightly changed after that. The previous day, me and her actually got along very well because it's basically the two of us travelling alone and had to prepare for everything. I don't know. Maybe I'm mad because she chose to abandon me and talks to her beloved friend, and makes me realize how I don't have a solid support system that is always there for you.

I'm the marmite of people, most people just dont like me and I'm not sure why and my friends can't figure it out either. Like I know am not perfect (far from it) but I'm decent.

So since things havent been working here, I've been planning on emigrating to kickstart my life BUT I'm just really worried that I wont make any friends in that country.

552,mimicranberries,1632673532,1,"it’s me back again. i’ll just vent here, use it as a diary. 
so, i work in a store.. i barely get paid the minimum wage which is let’s just say around 500€. i have my one room apartment and the rent is already 200€ not to mention all other extra costs like water and electricity etc. i work short week, long week so that’s 14 days a month, my shifts are 12h long but they pay for only 11h each day. right now i’m getting help from government too so i can still kind of afford living but the government thing ends at the end of this year for me and if i can’t pass the renewal i will be hardcore struggling living off of my salary only. the work itself isn’t TOO hard but the new manager is awful and demands so much without knowing anything. two days in her job and asked me to move faster to go to the job that technically isn’t even my problem. it’s a physical job at the store, each day i have about 6 full containers at least and hundreds of products to put out. i hate it, i hate how the salary is so low that i won’t be able to afford anything. 

i also dislike the fact that i have no friends. i mean, it’s ok but it’s not? i had one. but then she betrayed me over a boy i met first online and now they’re a thing and she left years of friendship behind just for that dude, it’s a longer story to be fair but you get the point. choosing a boy over your so called best friend. best friend who you used and copied for years. she started dressing like me, acting like me, got tattoos the way i did, did her makeup the way i did.. so don’t get me wrong, it was good riddance but still a bit sad since it came out of the blue and in such a ridiculous way. 

so as you can tell, i have no friends, no lover, nobody really and i mean it. i’m currently sick, staying home by myself and the only people who checked up on me were my parents. 
so really, what is the purpose of me? to work an awful underpaid under appreciated job? to go to work stay home go work stay home cycle for the rest of my life? is it really worth living like this? because i don’t believe it is and i don’t see any light anywhere. can’t afford living, can’t afford to buy the albums that bring me joy, can’t share my worries with anybody, nobody to even go on a walk with to simply have company. is it really worth going on? it’s a good question",lonely,it is what it is and i’m tired lmao,2021-09-27 02:25:32

558,Stunning-Customer-46,1632670455,1,"I just hate having weekends like this. I'm 20F and a junior in college and spent my entire weekend alone while everyone else in college get to go to frat parties, daygers and rave festivals. 

I used to be very shy and have bad social anxiety. I remember freshman year, I would be too afraid to ask someone to hangout with me out of fear of rejection and I would go to parties alone. Then COVID-19 hit and my 2020 was a disaster. 2021 has been a life-changing year for me, I'm more confident in myself and I'm no longer a shy or socially anxious person and I'm a lot more outgoing without caring about what others think. Therefore, I have been to more parties and social events with friends.

Ever since my semester started, I was hanging out with people or doing something fun every weekend and I feel like that's been good for me because I'm an ambivert. Until this weekend. Yesterday, one of my friends in college said she was going to pick me in the afternoon to go to a dayger for a few hours and she knows where I live. She never picked me up yesterday and I waited for over 2 hours and called and texted her but no response. I sent her a confrontation message but she hasn't replied. Then I tried to create a Plan B where I can go to a rave festival with friends but all the friends I asked to go said they already had plans. It just sucks. Yesterday felt like freshman year again where I was too afraid to ask people to hangout so I was always alone. I'm not trying to sound selfish or ungrateful but I require in person companionship at least everyday and I just felt so lonely last night and I feel like no one really cared.

What also gets me down are the lack of romantic relationships too. I'm bi and I want to have plenty of relationships with both sexes and have the best of both worlds before I settle down and I haven't even had one relationship yet. I was hoping to have a relationship with a guy first and when guys have asked me out, I just didn't feel attracted to them back even though I tried to like them back and I feel like it's not fair for them. And then every guy that I have liked and wanted something serious with never liked me back, ghosted me, or tell me they're already seeing someone or have a gf. I'm a decent girl, I'm very pretty and people tell me that all the time, I'm the most confident I've ever been, I have a great personality and I'm socially active so I'm just really frustrated for that not being successful yet. And all my bi friends have at least one bf or gf already and people younger than me even had at least 3 relationships already and it makes me so jealous. I just feel like I'm running out of time with romantic relationships.

I may be overreacting but I'm fearing that I will go through life alone because of this weekend and no serious relationships. I really don't want to go through life alone and I just always want that companionship with both friendships and romantic relationships. I just really need support and kind words because I just hate feeling so lonely. Does anyone have any advice please???

It's an erie night in September, and the protagonist results back to old habbits in order keep her perpetual fear of loneliness at bay. Not yet possesed by the engulfing howls of winter, she searched for a source of warmth. She participates in what she now knows is an unhealthy habbit of ghost hunting. On that night she reaches out to a soul whom she believes mirror hers. A message is sent and, to her surprise, he responds. There's a bit of a delay, but thats to be expected. He's from another world and has the accent to prove it. She thought she summoned *the one*. You know, the one that would enter her world and make her real. It's been forever since her skins been touched. Her heart? An unpenetratable, depsite the gaping hole. What she hoped to accomplish with this new link was simple. Never has she ever fallin so deep to the sound of someones voice. When he spoke it was clear, audible, vocal. She wished for him to voice her name, for it to echo through her tunnels (rendered deeper with each failed attempt to make contact with the other side), summoning her. For a momment she believed she had nailed the ritual. She began the exchange by trading sight for sound. Enlighted by the flash from her camera she highlighed her body, all her flaws on display. ""Your perfect"" he insisted. So she persisted. Hed drop an octive or two untill his voice reached a growl. Shed almost forgotten his true nature. You see before climax could be reached the connection was dropped. The piercing silence that followed hollowed her. Her lover boy was not a lover or a boy. In fact, he was never really there. What she experience was not a dream, but a fantasy. She wished for love the way a kid wishes for candy or a dog fo a bone. Though they never touched, he was quite handsy, came, became person unkonwn. Where he went or why hed gone shed never know. All I can tell you is he dried up like the desert, she blowed up, went bezzerk. Ghost hunting took up the rest of the night. She raked through the graveyard in search for a bone. She attempted to read every tomestone  too, but her dyslexia got in the way. She still wanted him to say her name. She didnt know her destiny untill he spelled it out for her. No matter how she twisted and turned her body for him (and the other hims) she could not escape her destiny. All she could do now is hope someone would search for her, after they bury her in the dark of night.",lonely,Ghost Hunting,2021-09-27 00:57:26

I was somewhat OK with my life up until 2 years ago, not even anything to do with Covid, it's just the eternal loneliness and the fact that I push everyone away from me, mostly those who really wanna love me.

I can't put my feelings down and my mind feels like a gas giant where nothing makes sense, all I want is someone to be real with, but nobody likes sad people I guess, so I just go ahead and be me. Everyone else thinks I'm doing pretty good, so even when I try to vent I don't get the actual support I need, leaving me socially exhausted and I just stumbled upon this reddit because it feels like the best place to vent on, no idea if anyone is reading up to this point,

So anyway, I eat alone, I sleep alone, I don't even feel like talking to anybody - I just listen to Kanye and hit the gym frequently - the only thing I really feel like doing.

I don't even know why all this is happening, I'm studying, I tried to run my own startup and right now I feel like I'm in a point in my life where I did a lot of good beginnings but I actually have 0.00% energy left to do anything, this is chaos, I don't wanna keep being like this, 

The fact that scares me the most is that I'm OK with most of it, I just feel like I don't care not having a good job, or living in my current state, like I'm OK with being mediocre, and god damn that sends chills down my spines just the thought of being so average,

I don't know what to do - Really, no \*\*\*\*ing idea how to get through this, at first I told myself it's just a phase and it'll pass, it doesn't.

I think me and her really get along we talk all the time weve hung out twice just us, which is pretty uncommon for me, we have alot of common interests, hell we both have an over average sex drive and occasionally she's been rather open to me bout that stuff to me (and anything in general she wouldn't tell most people), and to my knowledge I'm the exception to the rule. Except the dude she's dating, I hear from her the most and vice versa I think. We are each others confidants and over the years I've slowly fallen in love with her.

What do I mean by this well he's hurt her multiple times and she seems infatuated with him. He off the bat broke up with her twice which sends her into paranoia fits, from how she said he barely tries to see her and be around her, and deadass for her bday was like nah she can plan her own hangout event even though she seems to have mad social anxiety issues bout event planning around herself. Also the dickhead slept and dated my ex behind my back if that indicates his character at all. And yet she still seems to really love him(however lately she has seemed to be rather fed up with him not trying). As you can imagine this makes me unfathomablely jealous to the point I want to puke. Another example of how I'm pretty certain is that once when she was single like year and half ago maybe 2 another friend she was close to wanted to be fwb with her and she was like nahh we to close on a brother level and how'd it be mad wierd.

568,codecrunchie,1632660089,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

569,dramaticercuban,1632658463,1,"
I recently got into university and as someone who has severe social anxiety I’ve always found it hard to make new friends, especially groups of friends.  I feel like every second I fail to interact with others their social circle starts to close up.

And don't go messaging people from the past either—there are reasons why you don't talk anymore.

It's hard though. When I'm lonely like this, I gotta fight my urges. But I know I should listen to myself. I've seen how this goes. It never works out.

I feel so tired of everything. My bf has been acting weirdly since we had sex for the first time, my muslim parents are fucking trash, i have to go to school the seven days of the week ( 5 days in normal school and then i have two days of Quran and Arab school); i have no  friends, genuinely, no one to talk with and im so done with school. 

I miss when my boyfriend was in love with me. We used to walk in the streets at 8pm while my mom thought i was in theater class. It was so romantic. We held our hand and just looked at eachother. Now he acts just like im whatever. He takes 6 hours to respond, and when he does he says some real dry shit like ""no"" or ""whatever"". I feel heartbroken and im already trying to get ready for when he breaks up with me. He is literally the reason i was so happy and now i feel like my heart is tearing down.

Im 16 so i still have to live under my Muslim parents norms. You cant dress the way you want, you have to read Quran for 3 hours each day, You have to memorize it, you have to be a housewife, you will not leave the house until you get married, You have to pray 5 times a day and if u dont do that u get hit. Its exhausting. I Have marks from when i was 8. I feel so sick of this family. I plan on moving out for college and if they try to search for me I'll fine them. For all the things they have donr this 16 years. 

The other day, i posted a post critizining Islam. The only friend i had is Muslim so she started arguing with me and calling me sinner. I said okay. So this friend, lets call her Hanna, she talked with my other friend and they both decided to stop talking to me. They were even going to fine me for being ""Islamophobic"".

The thing is, I've since learned to talk to people and can have normal social interactions. I'm on good terms with everyone, but I still can't form close interpersonal relationships of any sort. 

In a year I'm leaving the country (hopefully forever) so any friendship I start will soon have to end. Whenever I talk to someone, I assume they want nothing to do with me, and only do it to get some favour from me. This leads to me always keeping distance and never forming deeper connections. People my age are falling in love (If you can call it love at this age), while for me the very idea of a romantic relationship is repulsive. It seems miserable, fully transactional and driven by savage animalistic desires. We are just glorified animals after all. As much as I'd like to, I just can't feel attraction because of this.

I don't even like thinking about those years, going the whole day without speaking, and then my voice was tight and cracked when I would talk to my family at home because it hadn't been used all day.

My 4th year of college I had a new coworker at my college job, and we started talking. It was that simple. Of course, it was awkward talking about meeting outside of work. He would express the desire to do things outside of school, but that there was nobody to go with. He was essentially begging me to ""ask him out"", in a way. When I did finally offer something we could do together, I felt the same anxiety I did when I asked a woman out. The fear of rejection, putting your heart on the line. Even though it is obvious he would be interested, it still terrified me to expose myself like that. I haven't had a friend since elementary school, so it would mean a lot to be rejected.

But it all worked out, I had a friend. We no longer live near each other, and now I don't have a friend as close as I was with him, but now I feel less shit than I did the first 3 years of college. I never had a true friend since elementary school, and I always thought it was my fault. Now I know it is down to pure luck. You don't connect with everyone, and that is just the way it is.

582,amberroseofficial,1632646112,1,"I have no one to tell this to but first and foremost I wanna make it clear that I’m not gonna hurt myself or something like that. I just need to vent to people that don’t know me. So thank you in advance for listening. 

My parents would manipulate me in coming home from spending a day or two at my grandparents’ house by saying they were “going to the movies” and “going without me” in an antagonistic voice. What does a 4 or 5 or 6yr old do? Go with my parents because I think they’re genuinely gonna go. They never once took me. Instead, they would force me to work in our house like laundry and cleaning as a small child. We didn’t live on a farm, I live in the suburbs. My grandpa died when I was 6. He was the only person who truly adored me. As an adult, it angers me deep down. They stole so many days and hours I could’ve spent with him. I always have had a distinct memory of him being sad when I would leave and I realize that he knew what they were doing. I lost any extra time I could’ve had with him because my parents are manipulative. The worst part is I can never get it back. He’s gone. I can’t ever get that time back with him. 

When I was 13, I was raped. It caused an onslaught of horrible, unhealthy relationship habits. I suffer from something called genophobia. Many, many years later, I’m an adult and I’ve never had sex. I’ve gotten to that point a few times with a few different guys but I have a panic attack. I start shaking and crying and I have flashbacks of that day. I haven’t told my parents because they believe women are always the fault of every rape and assault. I’ve lived with this mental torture for a long time. I’ve had to deal with it alone. The flashbacks, the panic attacks. All of it alone. 

My dad used to yell at me and tell me that no man will ever love me and tell me I’m not worthy of a husband one day. He would say he’s going to laugh that I’m old and alone. I’m not old I’m only in my 20s but I’m alone. He would insult me and say horrible things. I don’t want to type them out they make me short of breath and it’ll give me nightmares tonight. 

I had one boyfriend and it ended terribly. He ended up harassing me. He would call me 50 times per day, with different numbers. He would text me, he would send messages through email. Horrible things he would say horrible things. I couldn’t report it to police because then I’d have to file a report or a restraining order and every detail of our lives is on the table. I couldn’t handle that so I chose to ignore him. He stopped eventually.

I was diagnosed with something called hyperandrogenism. It’s hard because as a woman, it makes you feel gross. It makes me feel unfeminine. All I’ve ever wanted is to be like girls like Emily Ratajowski and Iskra Lawrence who are so pretty and feminine. But i biologically can’t be. I’m 100% straight no question about that. This just fucks me up mentally.  

I’m so lonely. This past year and a half has been horrible. I have dating apps and I have messages and matches but I just get so tired every time I open them. Every guy has the same thing to say. I don’t trust anyone so I don’t trust when someone compliments me I think they’re lying. I’m so lonely. I’ve self sabotaged so many potential relationships. I don’t know how to fix it. It seems like when I start to trust someone, they do something to break my trust. I’m constantly second guessing myself and my feelings for someone. I’m so lonely. I pray for a boyfriend.  All I want is a companion. 

My two cats are my babies but they’re getting old. It makes me sad to think that one day they won’t be here. I’ve always been able to squeeze them and kiss them and tell them how much I love them. I wish they could live forever.

I don’t let things get to me but guys at some point, everything gets to you. I’m so lonely. All I want is a hug I just want a hug and for someone to tell me that it wasn’t my fault and that everything is going to be okay. I just want a hug I wanna be able to collapse in someone and cry and not worry that they’re going to take advantage of my vulnerability. 

I’m so lonely guys. Thank you for listening and reading my vent. I know it is long but I just needed to get it out. I’m not gonna hurt myself or anything, I’m just sad. I just want a companion I want a hug. I want to be able to be vulnerable and not be worried about the negative consequences. I just want a hug. Thank you for listening.

He had girlfriends but they left him, and through those years I stuck around...Even after finishing Highschool, hoping to be the one. He told me he loved me and only wants to be with me. That was a lie, sometimes  he would say he was confused about his feelings, then the next minute he only wants me. I don't get it though because I love him so much, when we are together it's amazing. we have so many memories growing up and know each other so well .. people would think we were perfect together.

But I realized that if he doesn't see me that way then there's nothing I can do. I could have been nothing but the best person for him, yet that wouldn't matter because he doesn't feel the same.

Two days ago my manager (whom I was friends with before starting here) had a barbecue where several of our coworkers were invited even though they were working, but he didn’t text me or mention it and he had actually made a comment about me being off but didn’t tell me about it.

The guy I’ve been talking to has left me on a two-week “read” status and while he warned me he was going to be distant because he’s got something he’s working on, I feel like I’m constantly waiting for people who don’t really have plans to come back.

I know all of this is combining at once in my head and it’s not only irrational but unfair of me to take any or all of this personally… but that doesn’t help the feeling that a lot of people I care about are leaving me behind.

I honestly believe i am meant to be alone. I am not sure why, but i am. I am supposed to conquer loneliness and touch starvation so even the smallest things seem massive to me. Maybe its because of some sin ive committed at some point, which made me irredeemable. Either way im in a lot of pain due to my human desires. I dont even want sex anymore, i just want to be hugged and have been for years. But of course, i have to learn to move passed it.

well, except for a few relatives I don't even talk to. and it's not that they care. they do it just to do it.

my ex girlfriend texted me. we were together for 8 years and we broke up a few months ago. she would always call me at exactly 12 AM to wish me a  happy birthday, and now she sent me a very short text at like 6 pm. 

all day I kept checking my phone. no notifications. nothing. my ""bestfriend"" who's my childhood friend -and also my only friend- didn't even wish me a happy birthday. he's probably too busy hanging out with his other friends.

I went to a cafe and ate a cake. I wished myself a happy birthday under my breath. so many people around me, chatting, laughing. being normal. they are normal. I don't feel normal. I felt like an alien. I always try to convince myself It's normal but It's not. who the fuck eats a cake alone?

and you know it's actually very funny. i'm a youtuber, i have over 100k subs on youtube and i have quite a lot of fans, I guess. i make good money. but see, none of this means shit. yea i appreciate the people who watch my videos and support me. yea I'm grateful to be where I'm at. but at the end of the day, when you're lonely, you're lonely. you're going through all that shit alone. i haven't told people my birthday on instagram or anything. because I know it doesn't matter. i know, at the end of the day nobody will ACTUALLY be there for me. i guess i am the ""popular loner"". i hate that term but...

No more social media, no more dating apps, I'm going to expose myself to actual social situations.

So, today I decided to go to a bar with a friend. It didn't go that well, haha. I felt a little uncomfortable and couldn't actually enjoy the time with my friend.
The good thing is that the bar was in the beach so I got out and sat in the sand while listening to the sea, which is something that makes me feel very well.

I try and be a good man, It's the only thing I can do, to be kind, to be helpful. I don't consider myself a perfect man, nor the most handsome, nor the smartest. But I believe I am a good man, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I have never been in fights, Yet all people ever see about me is my lack of hair.

The dating game is going awfully, who would have thought that hair was so important. People aren't exactly lining up to talk to the 20 year old eyebrowless bald headed shy guy. And people keep telling me that it doesnt matter, But it does. I understand men go bald, but I look almost sickly even though I am perfectly healthy!, I have faint eyebrows, faint eyelashes, and thats all anyone ever notices. I feel like I have so much love to give, but people just cant seem to give me a chance.

You can imagine how Tinder is going, An app where people judge you on your looks alone, and keep in mind, I have the good fortune of having a good face, but if you're even just a LITTLE bit imperfect, you are out. I don't know what I'm suppose to do, I refuse to give up, She HAS to be out there somewhere, she MUST be, and I hope I can make her happy, I HAVE to find her, I have no other choice. Perhaps she will find me.

I’m also a foster child who was never officially adopted, a survivor of horrible childhood abuse, of sexual abuse both as a young child by birth family, a stranger and a ex partner. 

I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up. In elementary school, middle or high school. And every friend I had just left like I was nothing even though to me, they were my world. 

My foster situation wasn’t a normal one. It wasn’t one where my parents gave me up at birth or passed away. They had me until I was five and saw me until I was twelve. Came back into my life just recently for a few months, said awful things and left again. With the situation being as it is, it’s caused a lack of connection with my foster family. To the point that, like today, I just stayed home instead of going to my nieces birthday party. 

I can’t handle big groups. I have a single true friend who is in a different state, I have no connection to my birth family or foster family. My life consists of work, and sleeping. 

My days are on autopilot, and breaking down when I’m home alone. My chest feeling empty, I’m cold, I’m hungry no matter how much I eat. I get lost in fantasies whether it’s a game or a anime, a book or a song. I talk to myself and I make up fantasy’s in my head. The same head that’s a revolving door for the idea of taking my own life. 

I’m constantly thinking about how I don’t remember what it was like to be held by past lovers. I don’t remember the way my mom smelled or the sound of my dads voice as a child. I don’t know why everyone leaves. They never tell me. Just one day they love me and the next they don’t. I think about the point of life, why the stars are so far away and how many muscle relaxers can finally give me enough rest when I feel endlessly tired. 

I crave family, companionship. I crave flesh and blood. I crave someone who will come and drag me out of bed and kiss my forehead and tell me they are here to stay and that I have to get up now. I crave someone who will cup my cheeks in their hands and finally look me in the eye when I speak and I want them to smile and take me seriously. I crave warmth and love. Drugs, alcohol, chocolate, money, I don’t want it. I just want stability and someone to stay.

We all have to be, to some extent.  I get it.  You can't feed someone else if you starve to death so doing.  But we're self-absorbed to our own detriment, as well as to the obvious detriment of others.  If I shout at completely harmless strangers and curse them and attack them for wanting me to wear a mask or because they got my order wrong, it's because I think I'm more important than they are, no question.  Ignore traffic laws and drive dangerously?  Of course!  I'm the most important person on the road; those rules aren't for me.

No one remembered my birthday.  Me Me Me.  Why doesn't anybody like me?  Me, me, me.  Everyone else has it easy.  Everyone is happy except for me, me, me.

If we'd all stop obsessing over ourselves for one damned minute, maybe we'd be able to do some good for once.  Maybe I'd be able to recognize the truth: there are a lot more people out there than just me.  I'm insignificant compared to all those people.  My problems don't matter.  I'm worried about this presentation I have to give, or what people will think of me when I do something stupid in public.  Well, who the fuck am I?  Maybe I should be more concerned with lifting people up, and I wouldn't have to agonize about my own ego so much.  Maybe one day we can have actual concern for each other.  Perhaps in trying to heal others we will find our own problems insignificant, shriveling, disappearing.  Perhaps we may.

Since the day she got out there we've barely been able to talk at all since she says she's busy almost every second of the day we only got to talk/ text briefly twice a day if even that and only for more than a quick minute at 3 am IF she didn't forget and fall asleep before then. Then when I became sad and tried to talk about it she got mad at me saying that things won't change over night and she doesn't have the time or energy to deal with this as school is her #1 priority ( which I agree it should be) but then one day when she's not responding at 11 something at night and I've had a reallllly rough day needing someone to talk to I check her location (which she willingly shared with me) ad i see that she's out at a club so i text her saying ""out partying and can't answer my call or text babe that really hurts 🥺 im sorry I guess it's just my anxiety I don't want to keep doing this I know you're tired of me complaining 😔"" and after leaving my other messages on delivered for 30 minutes she instantly responds to that one saying ""how did you know i was out partying?"" ""Why are you tracking my location? I know you aren't deadass"" and stops sharing her location that second.

But I still feel empty and lonely and allot of the times I feel like I don't actually have any friends at all or that my friends aren't real ""friends"" which feels messed up when I feel that way about the friends I am close with.

One of my friends was going through some legal trouble and she was crying on my shoulder were she made It clear to me that she needed me and was grateful I was there, I genuinely felt it as well and for the first time I actually felt like I meant something to someone.. But then a week or 2 passed and I was back to feeling like a worthless, lonely needy burden. Thing is this friend I speak to daily, we make plans with each other. I am also close friends with her boyfriend who I also make plans with... There is an old college friend I still talk to on discord and play games with, another friend I met through him and became really close with and then another friend I went to college with who I have catch ups with as well.

And yet I still somehow manage to feel like I am alone.. I can spend all day with any of them, have a really good day and then the SECOND they're gone I feel instant loneliness. I suppose it could be depression more than loneliness(Im actually diagnosed but mental health teams wont work with me... lol) . 

I feel like another factor is I am gay(and out) as well but I am the only gay guy I know. I've never had a relationship or even been on a date. I don't feel good enough for anyone to want so I've just never tried... I'd love to have a boyfriend however I feel like I only like the idea of one... I'm constantly wishing I had someone I can go out, visit places, explore go to theme parks with but I feel like I don't have people who would want to do that with me, even if they did I know I'd lack the confidence to enjoy it and I'd probably be really boring and depressing to be around... I just feel like a walking contradiction, I know what I want but at the same time I don't want it or I can't be bothered for it... down days I genuinely feel suicidal, i think of suicide on the daily.. There have been many times I've gone to end my life then I'd either get irritated trying to get the right situation or I just couldn't be bothered and end up sitting or laying there thinking how I'd rather just be homeless rapped in a quilt daydreaming my life away only to hyper a week or so later want to go on journeys, join the gym and learn how to drive all over again.

I feel like a massive mess of confused emotions to the point I don't even know what I want... and it's because of this my mental health team(that I am under) doesn't even want to work with me because they say ""how can we help someone who doesn't even know what that looks like""(literally there words)...

664,SnuggleBunnixoxo,1632610177,1,"A little background, just turned 30, just moved into a nice family neighborhood by myself in a large duplex in a city I've never been in before. 

I just got back from the gym today after an excellent workout, I've got a great pump, my errands are all done, still slowly unpacking, it's been a very productive week that I'm happy about. Couldn't be much happier. Oops! Left my water bottle in the car! So I go out through the back door, and I suddenly hear laughing and chattering from over the fence. I see a whole family, kids, teens, young adults, a couple old folks sipping their beer. I stop in my tracks and look behind into my house. 

It's quiet, the kitchen is well stocked, living room with all the gaming consoles and surround sound system, I even have a man-cave from which I am typing this post from right now. This past decade I worked my butt off to get where I am without having to look back. I'm glad, but I'm also lonely. So awfully lonely. In that moment I realized I'm probably the only person or one of the few people in that neighborhood that truly lives alone. 

Am I happy? Yes. To get away from that foreveralone mindset that brings you down that slippery slope of hopelessness I threw myself into work and the gym, what else could I do? Nearly a decade ago my journey started and I was very alone in the world. Over time I made precious friends, dated sparsely, and began lifting weights for the first time. Fast forward today, I've had to relocate several times for work. Because of work I had to say goodbye to friends, things got more intense and I had fewer opportunities to meet woman.  Thus here I am in this nice neighborhood that's so safe there are kids literally running everywhere. I'm all alone, no family to provide for.

A decade ago I was all alone. A decade later I'm alone today. But I think that's okay. I don't intend to stop working on myself. Keep working, keep lifting, keep eating, keep playing- keep chugging along this long game of life. I have achieved happiness in some areas of my life doing this, but life doesn't always have happy endings. Maybe this could be it for me. Maybe there'll be surprises in the next decade.

674,jwakajoma,1632604673,1,"I recently submitted my papers for divorce between me and my wife, something that's been in the works for a month or two now. Everything went smoothly. We met late high school, dated early college, got married mid-college and now we're divorcing because it was too soon for us. Things just didn't work out. Luckily divorcing so early was relatively easy, so it hasn't been too messy.

Telling her I wanted a divorce was refreshing at the time. I felt good about it pretty much immediately after. Then this morning, just out of the blue, and I mean out of the blue, I woke up with what can only be described as the feeling of having a massive hole in your chest. She'd been telling me she was on Tinder and had a date, and I think I woke up this morning thinking that her date was last night (it's not, it's tonight). When she told me about her date, I was happy for her. Made me feel good knowing she was becoming more independent - a sticking point in our relationship - and meeting new people. But I think this morning the combination of the papers finally being submitted and thinking she'd gone on a date really punched a hole through my chest. Everything became so real.

I'll be starting a new life in a new city with a new job next week. The divorce was well timed in that way, I can start out with a clean slate. That feels good. But waking up this morning feeling this way made me realize the scariest part of all this: no one to talk to. I wanted to reach out to my ex about it, to tell her how I was feeling, but I can't. She deserves her happiness. She doesn't need me to make her feel bad for going out with other guys. And yet my emotions of isolation feel so real. I have so much responsibility coming up soon, and no one to get through it with. I've never been on my own like this, so maybe it'll be good for me, but I'm starting to realize why I avoided it at all costs up until now.

I only have one more friend that lives kind of far away from me and today I noticed, that that friendship is not working out anymore anyways, so meeting up with her would probably also be no fun. In university I have no friends, I just struggle to interact and talk with people in general. So I am a loner once again, just like in middle and highschool. In the past, I usually had quiet the big friend-group online at least, up to 10 people, but somehow everyone just got on with their lifes and we dont hang out via discord or play video games anymore. So I am once again only playing video games on my own again, hanging out with my girlfriend when my university schedule allows it and watching youtube all day. Weirdly enough I need people around me, even though I am an introvert in regards of starting conversations. But when I get them going, I am very vocal. And I really enjoy going out and doing stuff with people, talking to people, I need that to keep on going in my life. But I basically have no social interaction anymore, so I really struggle with being positive and getting things done. I just feel so lonely",lonely,"My girlfriend being my only friend and person I hang out with, is just sad",2021-09-26 06:53:22

681,yolkofficial,1632602422,1,"I'm just going to keep writing until I don't want to anymore. I don't want to bother anyone but I'm trying to ask for help from my irl friends but they've never been there for me in my entire life. I hate them. I hate them for every time they say they care and they'll hang out with me. I just want them to stop lying. But

First off I want to to ignore that I'm a teenager. Why? Because I just want to walk around with a sewing needle so people won't tell me ""ohh hahahahaha nobody has friends in school but it's going to be better you're just young"". Sew their damn mouth shut. My depression is not normal. I have clinical depression. I have sucidal ideation. This isn't normal. I have to go into an oxygen machine at some point because my brain isn't right. Okay? So please don't tell me that being lonely as a teen is normal. Please, it makes my feelings even worse and makes me feel like I don't matter. Saying that being lonely as a teen is normal is extremely invalidating and it will send me absolutely spiraling.

Here's the thing: it's been like this since I was born. Okay? This isn't just something that's happened all of a sudden once I became a teenager. I only became aware of how lonely I am. The only place I could get socialization was school, but after having breakdown after breakdown and losing 80% motivation for school, I left and got a GED. I'm 16. I guess it was a dumb idea because I just ended up losing all those chances to socialize. 

I don't know. People don't visit me outside of school. When I say this, I do not want to invalidate anyone who has had less socialization than me, I wish I could be there for you. I might be petty but I don't count family as friends. That means nothing to me. The lines have blurred so hard that I can't stand being around my close family. My cousins have stopped hanging out with me. My first sleepover was in 5th grade. The first time a friend has taken me out anywhere to shop was freshmen year. The first time someone took me out for lunch was sophomore year. I'm always the one to make plans and only 20% do people actually show up and commit to plans. 

I hate them. I hate them so much. I just want to run far away from this town and just start over because I can't- I don't know. It just all hurts so much. It's too much for me to bear. And this dumb Snapchat and Instagram. I just don't understand. I don't understand what's happening at all. It doesn't feel like any of these teens near me are my friend. It doesn't feel right. They just don't treat me like a friend. 

Isn't a friend someone who will text you unprompted? Someone who will call you at absurd times? Someone who gets reminded of you when they see things that pertain to you? Someone who you just go and watch the sky with? Someone who will talk to you about anything and everything? Someone who takes you out on the town?

Maybe I'm wrong to have that expectation. Maybe I'm being overly dramatic, I don't know anymore. My life's a goddamn mess. Because the friends I have don't do any of that. None of it at all. It's so frustrating feeling lonely all the time. A lot of times I'll just remember I'm lonely and I want to make plans but over and over again they either don't respond, send me a stupid streak, or they are just so busy. Yes you are busy hanging out with your friend. You're friend is more important than me. I just wish they wouldn't talk to me. My fingers start moving on their own and I start making snaps yelling at them. doesn't achieve much but more lying and being ignored. It's so hard to tell who's being truthful and who's just saying junk. 

The line is so severely blurred with these teens. There's one who will assure me that she cares and that she wants to hang out for me and she says that she's lost friends because she doesn't like them talking crap about me. Her making such statements that she cares about me makes me feel like she does, but then she'll post on her story that she wants to hang out with someone. Alright, an opportunity to hang out with a friend, I should take this opportunity.


**I always get to her post an hour late and by that time she's already found someone.**

Even if I'm just 10 or 20 minutes off she suddenly has already found someone. She doesn't message me saying ""hey do you want to hang out?"" No. Not- I can't take this it's getting to frustrating. I don't know what to do anymore. They aren't true to me. They don't recognize my emotions or ask of I'm okay. They just don't feel right. I can't stand how they treat me.

I dont know why I'm posting this, I don't have a question or a request. Guess I'm just venting. I'm 22, and not once has anyone shown reciprocated interest in me. I've been used by manipulative women. They knew that I was interested in them because I asked them out and got rejected. They started asking me to do things for them so I did, because it's what I'd do for any friend that asks for help. But only recently did I realize everything I did for them was them using me, because the ""friendship"" was not a two way street. 

I feel like a loser and a clown. I don't know what to do to fix myself. I crave good company so much that I was blind to the fact that I was getting used for years. I feel worthless, not good enough for anyone, ugly, etc. You name a negative thought and I guarantee it's been applied to me.

It's pretty depressing to think about how I haven't experienced a girl walking up to me and talking to me in a fun way, touching my arm or hands, etc just because she thinks I'm cute. I have been flirted with verbally, but never really by someone I liked. And to be fair, I don't have high standards or anything. 

But it's really weird to think that for most people, they know what it's like to go to a bar or party, make eye contact with someone, start talking with them, and eventually escalate to the point where they're making out or more later in the night. Whereas I haven't even experienced the eye contact and talking part, nor would I have any idea on how to do that.

So... I am a  living in the UK which means I am in Year 11 (equivalent to 2nd year high school in the US I believe) - this also means that after June, I would have left UK High school and go on to ""College"" or ""Sixth form"" which is equivalent to 3rd and 4th year high school in the US.

Essentially, in the past 12 months, I have lost a fuck ton of friends, feel distant from many more and also trying to get over a friend. The biggest blow was one friend who I have known for 6 years, but just suddenly started hating me (I confirmed through other friends). Since he was in my main friendship group, I have kind of had to be distant from the group to avoid awkwardness, which means I feel a fuck ton more distant from my main friendship group. Additionally, it seems that he is trying to force me to avoid more friends since he keeps on randomly coming to my other friends who are somewhat distant from the main group. Like what the fuck?!

Additionally, I also can't get over my good friend (15 F) who I have been friends with for 4 years now.

She said no as expected (although did say it is because of her parents, we both are Indian so understandable, and has complimented me both ironically and unironically) - I STILL can't get over her, or well I think I am but still don't feel as platonically connected as before (and do ""crave"" things like hugs and physical touch from friends especially her)- even I have no clue.",lonely,How the #### can I fix my life,2021-09-26 01:54:40

For anyone like me who feels incapable of having a heart or struggles with any kind of reIationship, I have recently found that listening to music helps me understand what I'm feeling, or what I want to say to that one person. I write down a few songs that I listen to whenever I feel lonely, I jot down what other emotions those songs bring up. And I write paragraphs about how/why I feel that why. I did this the other day and I feel like I haven given myself closure. I'm only 19F, and I have always struggled with my emotions.

Now I feel more alone than ever, and it’s not like I’m a shy person either, it’s just that I have no one that I know in any of my classes and everyone else is either already friends or has a completely different personality to me.

My friends that I’ve had for nearly 5 years now have all drifted so far away from me that I doubt they even notice when I’m not with them. Pretty much they just play there PC all day long and I’m really not into that so therefore I lose all communication with them and now since there all speaking to each other 24/7 they’ve became closer and are always telling these stories of them going out drinking and doing all these things people my age should be doing, and I’m never told or invited, no one wants me there. So I really don’t know what to do since I’m stuck in this college for 2 years with no one and they’re just getting closer and closer as the days go on without me :(

734,HelpfulIsland6792,1632564386,1,"In middle school near Christmas, I was told that we had a limited budget. I had no idea why and my parents didn't tell me until a few days after Christmas day. My mother told me that my dad was cheating on her and he spent money on the girls kids for Christmas instead of us. My mom was telling me how horribly he treats her and she started crying, and I felt awful. They ended up splitting up and my dad stayed at an apartment. At the time, I didn't have any friends and was known as the quiet emo kid, but I did have a girlfriend. She was my only comfort during this time, so I decided to get her this big stuffed bear, chocolates, and flowers for Valentine's Day. I found out that same day that she was cheating on me with an older guy. I started cutting myself and broke into my dad's gun cabinet, but I couldn't find any bullets. I ended up texting a friend about what happened and he helped me stop. My parents ended up finding out, and I had to take therapy for a while. Eventually, my parents got back together. Fast forward to high school, I get into another relationship. I LOVED this girl, and we ended up dating for a few months. Homecoming was coming up, and for some reason, she started ignoring me. I would try to go up to her and ask her what's wrong, but she'd just walk away. I tried asking her friends as well but they didn't tell me anything. I ended up telling my friend about what was going on and I was thinking about breaking up with her, but she told me to ask her to homecoming before trying that, and I did. She said yes. I wasn't planning on going at first, so I didn't have any nice clothes other than some oversized hand-me-downs. I ended up sucking it up and going for her, and 5 minutes in, she slaps me. My friend told her that I was planning on breaking up with her, and I sat outside of homecoming for the rest of the night. We had a mutual friend who had stopped being friends with her and she sent me a picture of her kissing another guy. This was the nail in the coffin for me. Junior year of high school, I'm diagnosed with severe social anxiety and I have to see a therapist. Fast forward to now, I downloaded tinder two weeks ago. It was really stressful, but I knew it would be good for me to communicate with new people. I ended up getting 4 matches and 3 ghosted me. Me and this one girl had a lot in common. We shared the same music taste and she was a shut-in, just like me. She was really bad at texting back, but I really enjoyed talking to her and she said the same. She ended up going to a music festival for a few days and I didn't hear from her the entire time. I decided to ask her if we were still talking, and she told me that she met a guy at the festival and promised him a date. Today, I haven't talked to any of my friends in months. I spend most of my time on my laptop because of classes, and without classes, I don't think I’d be able to deal with this. Knowing that I'm doing something productive is the only reason I haven't completely broken down. It's hard for me to talk to people, but even when I try, it just seems to screw me over. I really just want to love someone and feel loved. My social anxiety has gotten worse, especially due to COVID, but I'm not giving up. It hurts being alone for so long, and I know that eventually, I'll be happy with someone. If you read all this, thank you, and I hope you're doing well.

747,CYB3R_ANG31,1632554082,1,"I have noticed from my admittedly short time existing on this planet (), that most people are incapable of effectively speaking to lonely people in a way that isn't just outright destructive.

Lonely people should not be judged, put down and told everything is their fault, society and personal circumstances often do play a role in someones loneliness. Should we just tell people that they are completely blameless for their own circumstances? No. But acknowledging that mental illness and various socioeconomic reasons often play a role in someones loneliness is something that people need to understand and admit, not doing so hurts the people they are talking to and will probably just make them feel worse.

Just to reiterate, lonely individuals are not blameless. What I'm saying is be honest with these people in a non judgemental and non aggressive manner.

Lookism is not some made up jargon, attractive people are treated better than unattractive people and do have a social advantage.
But being unattractive by no means CONDEMNS that person to a life of loneliness.

People with mental illnesses such as social anxiety, being on the spectrum, depressive disorders and in my case attachment disorders(RAD) are at a SIGNIFICANT disadvantage socially.

But like with the last point, having these disorders doesn't condemn you to this life, you are not a slave to your mental illnesses.

Am I telling you to magically change and just pull yourself up from your bootstraps? Absolutely not.

Do not invalidate or disregard how mental illness effects a person's life, listen to them, try to learn more about the disorders, suggest they seek help IF NEEDED and again, LISTEN TO THEM.
 
While there is definitely a very fine line between genuinely just needing somebody to listen and sympathy begging, give the person the benefit of the doubt and wait for them to show their true colors.

As somebody who was extremely lonely for many years, struggles with mental problems and has many friends who struggle from mental illnesses ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia and PTSD, I felt somewhat inclined to write what has helped me and others I have known in the past.

Before the pandemic, I had a moderately sociable daily life. Because of the sort of work I do, my pool of new people to hangout with was constantly renewed every few months even if some of it was just for work. But, now it seems that virtuous cycle has been broken. I haven't been around anyone except close family and a few colleagues, even with things getting back to some semblance of normalcy. However, I'm still feeling starved for connection that is more than just the superficialities. It has actually began to affect me in many ways. I have a nagging, incessant restlessness in the last few months that I can't seem to shake; sometimes I drive aimlessly for hours in my city almost wishfully, hoping that someone would call or text to meet-up like earlier days. But of course, wishful thinking never makes things materialize.

I can't seen to muster the motivation to do the usual things I enjoy either, like writing music and recording (I'm a guitarist), reading ( I'm pretty voracious), writing, and other projects that keep me busy. I just pine for that kind of connection with somebody that has casual depth; that is to say, being able to fluidly shift between the banal, hum-drum things to even deeper topics, ideas, and feelings-- and back again. Well, without getting too neurotic, message me if you think this might be what you're seeking too! 

I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :)

All this thinking truly revolves around my career and how it's absolutely horrible for a home life as I travel weekly for work and only get to be home 8 days out of the month. My job has taken me to so many interesting places and allowed me to meet and be exposed to so many people from all different walks of life. It's allowed me to discover the hole-in-the-wall eateries, the off-the-beaten-path views, and provides a comfortable enough life style the stress of bills rarely is a factor. When I reach retirement age (33M), I'll have a pension and the Healthcare to live out my days to the fullest. But to what cost?

I live in hotels and visit my home. Being gone takes its toll on relationships at home. It's almost a gaurantee that every major event in loved ones lives will be missed, and oh the loneliness. Spending over 80% of your nights alone, in a hotel room. Watching all the couples, and families checking in, enjoying their time together, excited to be somewhere new and exciting...together. How much of my life have I let pass by unknown, and in the end, is the comfortability and stability worth spending the majority of life by yourself?

I feel the want to change my situation growing stronger. To find a job that will allow me a life of living in my home, and visiting hotels. But I wonder if I've worked myself into a corner where I can't easily find a job that doesn't sacrifice the stability of everything else?

I started college about a month ago and have yet to make any friends. I have social anxiety so I decided to room with a friend from high school to at least feel relaxed and safe in my dorm.

This is a friend that used to be very close to me. I would be able to talk about everything to him and we hung out like every day during the summer. Now he seems to not care about me and recently started making fun of me for not leaving my room a lot. I got mad at him the other day about it and told him to not talk to me. We haven't said a single word to each other for the past two days and it just feels a lot more tense now. I thought that's what I wanted. It hurts me to hear him talking to friends on the phone about going out to drink and study while I'm just alone. I know I shouldn't care because he is a shitty person, but I still care. Just his existence makes me angry now. Seeing him so happy after being a dick to me just makes me mad.

I really feel lonely. And it stinks at times.

I had a sad breakup with someone I thought I am going to spend my life with. Yea, that didn't happen. That was almost 6 years ago.
Since, I have been single and I got over it just couple of years ago. Talk about unhealthy coping mechanism 😕

I am now 37 years old, my dreams of family and children are slowly becoming the thing of the past.
I have a good job, I work excessively,  I love it. But then I come home and I am alone.I admit there are days I turn to couple of drinks.

I do have have two dogs and a cat, who keep me sane, but I would really like that special someone to share my day with.

My family is on another continent,  my one and only closest friend is in an amazing relationship, and I am so happy for him! He deserves the happiness so much!
But, our weekly meets are the thing of the past as well. I miss it. I haven't seen him for over a year.

I lost my father year ago, as well as my paternal grandparents, and noone to share it with, other than few Cardinals in my backyard.

I work in Healthcare and see so much sadness, its breaking me apart. I see families come together,  which is beautiful....But, at the same time, I feel bit jealous of the families and support my patients get. The one I simply do not have.

It becomes a self-fulfilling loop where you have  nothing to talk about cuz you have no friends and people think your  weird if you have no friends, so then you struggle to make friends. At  least in college too, a lot of friends are made from other friends for  example in parties and stuff (somehow people even introverts just made  their friend group in like the first week I'll never understand it). I  also go through phases where I actually try and am in several clubs so  idk. There are definitely perks to living like this such as not having  to give a fuck about anyones problems, (I'm at the stage where I kinda  wanna care about other peoples problems lol), and actually trying in  school cuz you have nothing better to do. But it kinda also makes me a  shell of a person with no motivation to do anything. If I'm busy its ok  but Fridays get kinda tough which is why I'm posting lol.

I've been feeling worse than usual lately and if anything I just need to feel wanted. 

You see, I'm a 28yr old male, I live in the UK and have rented by myself and lived alone for the last two years. I lost my dad at 24 to cancer (runs in the family so that's something to look forward to...) and the last 4 years have been turmoil and as much as I want to put it down to grief I can no longer do so. 

I have a loving family but they have children, wives, husbands, kids, a life...
Every relationship has ended in failure, I hate my career, I have no money, no savings, maybe 2 friends and I'm wondering if this is all worth it. 

You want to know the only reason I'm still here?... My mother. 

I am so scared and ashamed to admit to anyone that I feel im done. My best friend of 16 years got with a girl I was seeing and how having a child. On the surface I am happy for them, of course I am but I am hurting. My recent ex was the most manipulative girl I've ever been with, she told me I didnt compare to her exs, she told me I would never amount to anything, I never believed her. I'm starting to. 

I spend my days working a corporate bullshit job, underplayed and overworked to come home to no one, nothingness. 

Guys, I am done. 

Please help. A word of advice, tell me I'm being a prick or agree wholeheartedly and just be there for me, I wanna hear others problems, I want out of.my head, I want out of this.

I was pretty depressed prior to college, and COVID made it so I became pretty lonely which didn’t help. But now at college, away from my friends and family, I’m struggling. Today is Friday, I don’t have any class, but I have quite a bit of homework to do. Yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to do any of it. I haven’t even left my room yet except to eat, and not even video games or anime is even mildly interesting right now. I don’t want to do anything, I don’t feel anything. My roommate is gone today as well so I don’t even have him to talk to.(Though I wouldn’t tell him any of this).I feel like I’m on the edge of exploding, yet I also feel numb all over. Even thinking about my future and stuff I want to do, none of it even gets me excited in the slightest. I don’t even want a future. I don’t know what to do. Am I not ready for college? Should I drop out and try again later? I don’t know, I feel aimless. I’ve felt like this somewhat for years now, but I’ve always been able to have sports, family, or friends distract me from it, but now I have none of those things. Last night in a particularly bad moment I decided to lift to distract myself from it, yet I could barely move weight that even last week I warmed up with, I felt shaky and week. I don’t want money, or to get shredded, or to get a girlfriend because I know none of that would change how I feel now. I’ve never felt so alone. Guys what do I do? I need something, anything, and even though I know I could go to my friends or family, I don’t want them to see me like this. I’m the smart kid who’s going to be an engineer, I’m the rock my friends can rely on, the brother always there for his siblings. But that’s just to them. In reality I’m a loser who doesn’t even want to get up, a failure who can’t even pass his first chemistry test. I’m just alone. This summer I was getting suicidal thoughts probably weekly, but I could handle that, cause if it got bad I would just go talk to my little brother about football or lacrosse or anime, and I’d have a reason to keep going, but I can’t go a day without a suicidal thought now. And I’m a hundred miles from my bro, or any of my siblings. I feel like I’m on the verge of tears, but I can’t cry. What do I do guys? I feel like if I drop out and try to get help I’ll only be seen as disappointment to my family and friends. I need guidance guys. Do I stick out the semester?

I'm gay and it is how it is, so I accept the fact that love isn't for me, so every time I see someone that I like(man) I just smile to myself and moving on with with my life cause I know I'll never gonna get that person. So its been always like this untill this early year.

I got a new job, working there and then I saw this guy (remembering him put smile on my face) is he as handsome as Hollywood actors? No he's average like just a normal tall guy with tanned complexion. And again I thought he's just like any other guy I like, so I didn't really think anything about him and carry on with my life but after a couple of months the feeling got more developed.   It's like my eyes keep searching for him when I work.

Me and him working at the same place but have a different roles he's pretty much guy a wrench type of guy lol. I like seeing him when he doing his job(not in a weird way).  Suprisingly he noticed that and guess what? He's checking me out too lol and he acting different when he near me you know? Like definitely not a straight will behave with another straigh guy, he kinda flirting lol. We talked like very little, very very little. So its been like that for while. 

Trust me im not fallen easily and I never chase anybody,  I have many weakness but chasing people is not one of them. So I'm confident and reckon he's flirting, so that's makes him gay right? Yea things basically going like this and then my country got a 3rd lock down because of covid 19, its like 3month

And for 3months I didn't go to work and my social anxiety got worst, so does my depression. I cut myself again, and everything seems so dark and blue. Insomniac as fuck. From 55kg to 49kg in a month. 

So after three month, my working place open again. I have social anxiety and its getting worse but thing that makes me want to continue my work because of him. 

At the very first day I saw him doing his thumbprint attendance.  My heart like blooming and like so happy to see him again. But yeah, he's not like just  what he used to be, he avoiding me, don't even want to see my face, like trying to get out of there as quick as possible. I was thinking ""why?"". Why he's doing all that? Am I did something wrong? Usually when he's at my working station, he will take extra time, you know like idk lol doing his things and stuff but now he's avoiding me like I'm a ghost. At that time my mental wasn't stable tho as I said I cut my arm. So when he doing all that like avoiding me, rather walking another route, sending different people and not him to my working station just messed up my brain. ""Why you flirting me at the first place? Why u throw hints and all stuff but now u refused to see me?"" That's what I was thinking. ""is he straight man but just curious?""
""maybe he's not flirting at all and I think he's flirting with me"" ""why he turned out this way?"" 


So many things going on my brain at that time. It's like a toture when he didn't give me an answer. Why he's acting that way. Just give me a respond or answer just give me anything! I'm scare to ask him, because of social anxiety and I just can't see him and say ""hey u like me or not?"" Not its not that simple. I don't wanna fall in love to someone who don't want to try. So I decided to quit my job. Because its hurt so bad seeing his face. 

My depression and anxiety remain the same so took my med(etizolam) I never take any kind of med before but this time its like emergency,  because suicidal thought(because of my family)  comes and goes. So I took that medicine. 


Under the medicine influence, idk what kind of spirit possessed me, I message him, asking about all of that, asking him why he did that stuff in the first place, asking him like anything I wanted to know and ended it with ""I'm so sorry if you don't feel the same, I'm truly sorry if I offended you""

Yeah, he left me on read and then blocked me. So its been a couple of weeks now and here I am. I've been living my whole denying my heart about love and this is the first time I'm falling in love so bad. Now I know what people mean when they say ""I can't get him out of my mind"". Too bad a gay like me will live my whole my without love.

I'm going to buy tickets for when they next tour but God... I really want to go with someone I love (romantically).

892,Ben3922,1632466672,1,"Has anyone ever thought of how cool it would be to be able to create technology that allows you to never wake up from a dream, and essentially live out the rest of your life in said dream? Instead of meeting and falling in love with a girl/guy, kissing them, and waking up, you get to continue that dream forever? I feel like this really wouldn’t be that hard to create. All that would be necessary is a way to make REM sleep go on forever. An issue that might arise however is when a dream would end and another dream would start, potentially a dream you wouldn’t want to experience, with something negative happening to you. Perhaps temporarily awakening the patient from REM sleep in order to end the dream would fix this issue. There was a study that showed that scientists can figure out the content of dreams with like 60% accuracy. An even more interesting study: https://in.mashable.com/science/16056/mit-researchers-develop-a-way-to-record-and-even-alter-dreams

“Scientists have developed a method that can be used to record a person's dreams and even guide the dreams towards particular themes. According to MIT News, researchers have come up with a new wearable device, Dormio and a method called Targeted Dream Incubation (TDI) to help them study dreams.“ so scientists can essentially see a person’s dream. The interesting thing is that judging by this information it seems what we are able to do is even more advanced than my original idea. So what’s stopping us from simulating dreams? Has no one been interested in putting this into practice? If anyone has any further information on this topic it would be interesting to hear. I can’t be the only one who has thought of this right?

I wish I had a reason for being alone. I want someone to tell me exactly why I can’t find someone. Just tell me what I’m doing wrong, or what I can do better! I hate when people tell me that they can’t believe I’m single, or that I’m good looking so I’ll find someone, because that makes me feel that it’s not my fault that I’m so alone. I just wish I had some control, you know? 

And when I tried to control it, I tried improving my life in every way. I got a better job, explored new hobbies I still do, work out, improve my style, got a new car.. but it did nothing. Yes, I took some time to improve myself, but now what? Now I’m still alone. 

It’s nights like these that are the worst. The nights where your stomach feels like it’s knotting itself, you’re thinking such awful thoughts, and nothing can save you from the feeling of loneliness. Nobody you can call, no swipe on dating sites, and no posts on Reddit can help you.

905,AzulaAnon,1632457043,1,"I’m assuming this will be long. anyways,

you ever meet someone that prides themselves on being the “advice giver”? There’s nothing I hate more than hearing that. I swear, you make anyone feel wise - just for a second - and it becomes their entire personality. What’s even worse is when someone says that and then everyone around them enables it.

“Yes, you’re such a good friend!”
“You’re so smart!”

Ugh. As if anyone with actual wisdom would go about flaunting it to everyone. 

I know it’s strange to say something like that, and I’m sure it’s obvious that I take this very personally. I just say that because I feel like I know what that title truly entails.

I’m a people pleaser that will do anything to make someone feel safe and comfortable with me. I’ll never put myself before another person - and I don’t say that to sound “nice”. I don’t do it for them, I do it for me. I’ve convinced myself that it’s the only way to get people to care about me. Maybe if they see how much I care for them, they’ll reciprocate it, right? Not the case. For my entire life, I’ve centered my world around everyone else, hopelessly waiting for the day that I become the center of someone else’s world.

I can’t remember the last time someone asked me how I am. I can’t remember the last time I talked to someone about something I enjoyed. I can’t remember the last time someone asked for my thoughts when it wasn’t related to their situation. After all, I am the “advice giver” - my one and only purpose to these people.

Don’t worry, I’m not being a hypocrite. I don’t think I’m wise. The truth is, being invisible makes you a bystander. I see and hear everything, I’m never involved, and people like hearing advice from that kind of perspective. So, they come to me over and over and over again and I tell them all the same things every time.

If you’re reading this and you have a friend whos always there for you or always gives you advice, would it hurt to ask them how they are? Would it hurt to actually care about their response? 

There are dozens of people around me, but I’ve never felt this alone. Just about everyone could call me their friend, but I couldn’t say that a single one of them are mine.",lonely,a different kinda lonely,2021-09-24 14:17:23

(for context, I am 21 year old)

2 weeks ago, my life was going super well, I was living with my long time girlfriend (8 years) and we were both healthy, had good jobs and were always doing something that made us happy. Out of nowhere, my girlfriend caught a super rare disease called Lemierre syndrome and she had to be placed in emergency care at the hospital. She is doing a bit better now but it doesn't seem to be healing very fast and the doctors said she is gonna be staying at least 45 days in the hospital. I have never lived alone in my life and we both work from home so we were always with each other at least 95% of the time. I am devastated, lost all my motivation to work and do every day tasks that I used to share with my gf. Also, I don't really have any close friend or family but I really feel like i have to let it out to someone or something to make myself feel better.

I've been like this since middle school, and I didn't have a lot of friends, maybe someone from elementary school. I like videogames a lot, and this since when I was a child. Guess this is one of the reasons I prefer a quiet lifestyle, with no parties and confusion. At some point I thought ""I don't need friends, I'm fine by myself"". But the more I grew up, the more I realized people around me were going out, meeting people, falling in love etc. And I was just there staying home every day and night, reading and playing videogames. My parents were worried for me, but I never listened to them, because I thought it was just a phase, that in some way a friend would appear and make my life easier. It never happened. When I went to college the situation was exactly the same, but I found a friend who had my same interests, and even a girlfriend (a old classmates of mine from elementary, she is one of the best person in this world) and I thought that from now on, life would be better. Nope. After I finished college, my gf and me broke up for various reasons. This was heartbreaking for me because years and years of friendship ended in an instant. Furthermore, she was the centre, the key to my social life. When we broke up, my social life completely disappeared in an instant, and I was left alone again. I keep in contact with the friend that has my same interests, but we chose different universities. He already found new friends, a girlfriend, he is doing fine. Now I'm starting the second year of university, and there is one thing I want. Friendship. I want to live, go out, have friends, laugh like every other person. I just want to have a normal life. And this is why I'm trying my best. I don't know people here because the first year was done completely online, but I hope I will become good friends with someone. I have to. This is a new start, and I don't want to return to my old self. I wouldn't stand it.

It isn’t making friends or being social that is hard, it’s a different thing.

I’m currently feeling crushed by the weight of the world and just need to release. As most people I struggle with highs and lows. I’m generally a very happy, optimistic and out going person. I appear that at all times. I am the outgoing and silly spunky girl that is the life of the party and loves to make other people laugh and feel great! I thrive on other’s happiness. That is my fuel. However, these past few weeks the weight of trauma, chronic feelings of emptiness and stress have been completely draining me. I have no support. My mother was a very abusive tormented woman who took her own life when I was 18. My dad is a dead beat whom i have nothing to do with. My friends are just that, friends. I have no family or unconditional love outside of my child. I got married at 19 to an older man desperately wanting to create my own family. Unfortunately that man was very abusive and controlling towards me. Once I had our child, I finally decided I was worth actual love and romance. I’m in the process of rebuilding my life and becoming my own woman and living a life without abuse. However, sometimes I just feel… well, lonely. I guess thats why I’m posting here. I come from a large Irish family on my mothers side and I feel so abandoned by all of them. I wonder why I wasn’t worthy of the love and nurture that my cousins are given. And i wonder why i was given such a heavy burden to bare. The loss of my mother and the abuse I was subjected to as a child has left such an ache in my soul that I typically fill with the joy and company of others. However, due to my obligations as a mama and employee I’m very isolated right now. I journal to keep my thoughts organized and as a creative outlet. However, I’m new to Reddit and thought sharing some of my vulnerability and reaching out for some love and validation would be good for me even though its very out of my comfort zone.

There was a girl at a clinic I worked at once a week who would always talk to me and was really nice to me. We were close like at work, but I didn't want to come on too strong and was fighting off obsessive feelings I was getting because I've been trying to take things slow lately. The last week we talked, we were joking around before we left and flirting and on the way out she said ""aww I gotta wait till next week to see ya again?"" After we parted ways that day I swore I was gonna ask her out the next week when I was there... But she wasn't there. I went to message her, my company uses Google messaging and her name/email was removed from the system. So she either quit or got fired in between these weeks. And i have no idea what happened or where that relationship could have went. I was a mess for a week or 2.

I decided to hop back on the dating apps because i don't want to get hung up on thinking about her. But I just get ghosted or messages for hook ups and I don't want that right now. Should I just take the hook up so I can get that interaction I'm craving? But I also feel like a hook up would just make me feel worse than I already do.

I believe a lot had to do with her husband, it was like she wanted to blame every little thing we had done wrong as teenagers, together, on me. 9 years later and I still haven’t stopped thinking of her or been able to make such a connection with any other girl. 

Does anyone have any insight why she is popping into my dreams so frequently now? I usually wake up feeling a little sad and I’m curious what my subconscious is trying to tell me.

I’ve been thinking about this for weeks. I originally wanted to throw a birthday party where we could play games and go to the pool or the beach or something but then I like realized 

A) the person who could’ve made this possible isn’t talking to me

B) I didn’t really have anyone to invite.

My parents invited me out for my birthday and my mom said to invite anyone I want. I’ve invited around 7 people and all of them have said they can’t make it or that they’ll tell me later. Nobody has actually confirmed anything. It wouldn’t be so bad if my parents weren’t inviting their friends who will show up and then proceed to ask where my friends are. Just the mere thought of it makes me cry. 

The problem also is that since I’ve been here (I’ve been in the country for a month) they haven’t really come visit me. So I’ve just been alone all this time. 

Sometimes I kind of wish the person I mentioned threw a party that day and didn’t invite me. Just purely trying to hurt me for no reason. 

I got stood up for a date today and I messaged my online friend and said something about how it was going to be the same thing tomorrow. They said it wasn’t my fault if no one shows up but it is. I just keep saying stupid stuff about it.

It's not so much an issue of finding people who find me interesting enough to talk to. This happens often enough, I suppose. It's just that I rarely meet someone (IRL or online) who shares core values with me, and who I can feel open and at ease with.

It's probably too much to ask at this point, but I'd really like it if I could just make ONE good friend.

A person who isn't any flavor of political fanatic and who won't bash me for my religion, even if they're an atheist. Someone I just click with, who I can be happy for when they succeed, and supportive of even when they don't quite hit the mark.

It only lasted for four months, but it started out wonderfully. I was really envisioning spending the rest of my life with this person. Unfortunately, it kind of tapered out, and I ended it because I could sense they were losing interest in me and it was really damaging and hurtful to deal with, especially because I have BPD. My ex probably doesn't think about me anymore, but I still think about them sometimes, when I'm feeling low. I really, really miss being in love. I miss having someone who loved me. I miss that feeling of comfort and warmth and stability, and not fearing for my future because I know there'll be companionship in it.

1065,Disastrous-Ad-3461,1632365925,1,"That sensation that something is missing or gone but possibly it was never there. From time to time I get ejected from life as I know it in search of something I can't describe. One of those things where you know after you've found it but you need it to feel like a person again. Your hobbies bore you and that search begins to discover whats actually bothering you. I've been like that for a few years off and on and shoot into short periods of depression where I don't want anything at all. Everything bores me today there is no sense of purpose. I've often had thoughts of suicide that I'll never act on but that turns into a lack of fear which has gotten me in trouble before. I'm incapable of ""letting it slide"" sometimes and i'm more then smart enough to work out it's detrimental to my current lifestyle and while it feels absolutely amazing to level a guy who had it coming it's rarely worth it in the end. Although in school it was profoundly worth it because I legit wanted to be left alone and they couldn't really put up a punishment to convince me otherwise. Bullying me was like a right of passage or something. I was never small or weak by any means and I never took it for long either. I was always quiet, always suspended. Perfect grades though, teachers were pretty cool about the giving my sister my homework thing. I remember turning 19 ran into a chick i went to school with and she didnt recognise me and when we got to the whole that was me etc chicks were legit scared of me which was reasonbly shocking. They couldn't know most of my problems with the law extend from this strange sense of pride that pretty much came at birth. I've never purposefully hit a woman before, or a child. They are just off limits basically. I prolly have a wierd dark issue thats just normal back then but i recognize it now. The bigger the dude trying to get in my face the more excited I get for idk primal reasons i supose. I can't back down either which is sort of unfortunate. Never hit anyone as hard as I can. Kind of just rambling I supose, invokes a contemplative state, builds or allows focus so that it might come to me what i'm currently missing. I don't have IRL friends and online ones come and go. I lack the desire most of the time, like it's not that I wouldn't talk to anyone or everyone, I certainly would. IRL it's just easier, simpler to be myself by myself, my gf of 12 years is very much a social person, meanwhile i'm more closely related to sociopathic tendancies then what we may consider normal. I most definitely feel stronger feelings for animals then I ever had with people. Oddly enough i'm not lonely in the traditional sense but more like I feel unrelatable. I've never met anyone like me and I've always been quietly observing people. I have a talent for reading people, I tend to be correct almost all the time when I reveal it to them, i've done that many times, not in a creepy way but more like you could learn how as well. Downside of that is i'm almost never myself and nobody can ever tell. I should have been a psychologist probably. I share pretty much everything with my gf, her as a topic is also a strange story, she has kidney disease, along with a few other things and theres a good chance she's near the end. Can't have kids etc so it's complicated and she's probably worse off mentally then I am currently. I'm leaving out a lot of things I think i'd like to talk about, like my childhood friend died of cancer, his brother did some coke and crashed a motorcycle some time later as well. That was a long time ago though. As I get older I feel like everything i've learned about well everything was worthless and I can't stop collecting this information, things like human psychology, anything related to astrophisics, period tables and their various properties, biology so on point i'm pretty sure my gf is still alive because I know everything about her conditions possible, on occasion new information is made available but since covid its really impressive how little comes out compared to 2018. I've been a lot of things over the course of my life, i'm at my happiest when i'm stoned as it has a way of changing the way I problem solve and that makes routine things seem brand new and i'm a fan of that. I'm probably a sex addict aside from the few minutes after when I lose interest as a chemical response there really is no such thing as enough. Not sure how I feel about that though aside from being extremely dominate nothing is hotter then watching her get off and i'm not sure if thats healthy or not. My gf seems to think i'm some kind of prodigy and my argument for her is and always has been, if i'm so smart why do I sit beside myself and solve all of my own problems for once. I've never voiced that opinion but it's always there. I don't and can not understand myself so i'm keen to find someone like me but i also think thats impossible the circumstances to which I was created while somewhat mundane its my inner monologue that created what and who I am. People all around me I was alone in my head, I've traveled thousands of worlds, learned their stories, identifying the writers opinions on who these individuals are, what they are about and why they exist, as I got older I did the same to the people around me, X will behave this way if Y does this because Z. I've abused levels of control on people for my own entertainment and it was a conscious decision made by my feelings of void. My heart is like a black hole being destroyed by hawking radiation and I've gone to great lengths to just try to be normal. Most recently in my life this manatee at work, I really despise her and imma get to that quick, she basically had it in her head that she was going to have my kids and we'd move to ____ and the whole thing disgusts me because i'm a shining example of thats not his actual personality, she knows less then nothing about how I think or feel, what I actually do in my free time etc. She went to great lengths to destroy my gf's image in the eyes of my coworkers which inevitably got her fired. She still tries to talk to me like idk she texts the other girls I work with basically all day everyday. It's an unhealthy obsession and i've been silent about pretty much everything. Like i'm glad my gf got fired, legit she's in no condition for this factory bs. But yeah i've just been adding to this while at work the past 4 hours, possibly longer. I feel like i beling in this subreddit as I feel lonely and lost, searching, waiting, I feel like a leader with no minnions, i'm capable and yet helpless, the opportunity is not there so I wait and watch, hoping, denied, frozen in a loop of discontent, disconnected from the real worlds problems, trying to disconnect from myself.",lonely,Looking for something but don't know what it is.,2021-09-23 12:58:45

I am a 21 year old male thats never really experienced being depressed or sad, but this feeling has gone on too long. About a year ago I started a decline in my mental and physical health and I don't know why. I live in a small town and had a few friends that I don't speak too anymore because of stuff they were saying behind my back constantly. I had a girlfriend of almost 3 years that just recently left and moved out and is already moving on. Now I'm all alone with no one too talk to or hangout with. I sometimes go full days without saying a single word, and started despising everyone and everything around me about 8 or so months ago. I used to never act like this before and im starting to feel like I'm trapped in my own mind. I've really been trying my best to make new friends, but its hard when no one wants anything to do with you. I've realized that no one truly cares about another person unless they bring some sort of value to a relationship. I deleted all of my social media's thinking it would help with my mental health without telling anyone about it (except you now) and have been continuing to do Hobbies and activities I enjoy. I feel like I'm trying to fill a void that will never go away. I've closed myself off from everyone and everything since they did it too me.

Today, on the bus on the way back to my residence from uni, I was listening to some songs and just really missed my family and everything about home. Luckily I was wearing a mask so it might not have been as obvious but I just couldn't stop. There's a bit of a walk from the bus stop to where I live and a beautiful view of the sunset, so I just sat there crying while everyone around me was going for a nice evening stroll. I cried again on the walk back and inside my room. I couldn't even call my family because it was way too early in the morning back home, and I don't want them to feel worried. I think they already know that I don't like it here as much as I thought I would and I'm sure they feel bad about that. 

I've always wanted to move out and live far away from home, and I knew it would be lonely but I didn't think I would mind since I'm used to being alone all the time. I always felt like I didn't really belong back in my home country, or my parents' home country (I'm a daughter of immigrants and now I'm one too). I didn't think I would feel that way here too, especially since this country is known for being so diverse and accepting. 

I'm not really sure what I should do. I can't go back home after everything I did to get here. I guess I just wanted someone to know. If anyone saw me crying today, they didn't know me so they couldn't comfort me. I can't tell my roommates because we're not that close and I'm sure they're missing their families too.

1095,esteban0009,1632351376,1,"I've been dealing with loneliness for a long time. But today something happened that made me feel specially sad, I think I just need to vent.

I met someone who was having problems with loneliness too.
I don't know why but I felt like I wanted to support that person. I swear I didn't have hidden intentions.
So, during the days I asked them about their dreams, their life goals, what make them feel happy, and all that. Just wanted to give them some company.

But, suddenly they said they were angry and needed some space.
And then sent me a message saying that I was making them feel bad because I was reminding them about their past (But I never asked about it).

""I don't want to talk to someone who makes me feel down. You're kind but it's time for me to find a new friend who won't make me remember my past. Bye""
Then, of course, I got blocked.

I didn't expect this. And I don't know why but I feel really hurt. I can't stop thinking about it because I genuinely don't know what I did.
What did I do wrong? Why did they say that out of nowhere?
I didn't want anything from this person. I didn't have romantic interest or wanted a favor. I swear I just tried to give them some company. But for the first time in my life I feel like I wasn't good enough.",lonely,I tried to genuinely be nice to someone and they left,2021-09-23 08:56:16

I have very few friends, only one close one, but I keep feeling lonely everyday. I have trouble making new friends, and some already cut ties with me, so I stay with my old friends, but they really dont feel like friends.

I always see couples and people cuddling and doing lovey-dovey stuff during my school, and I keep getting mad at myself because I don't have a girlfriend. 

Whenever I try to talk to a girl to be their friend, my anxiety kicks in and any conversation I start becomes awkward. I feel like no one would go out of their way to talk to me, like I would to others. It's mostly because of my appearance, I bet. 

The thing is, I keep forgetting this is happening. I feel sad, go home, go to sleep, and then im fine again, and then feel sad. It's like Groundhog's Day. Living the same day over and over, normal, sad, normal, sad.

1110,doomgeneration99,1632342326,2,"Hi, I’m writing this because me and this internet friend of mine (I don’t even know if we’re even called internet friends anymore) had a fight. The reason why is because I had posted something on my profile (on a different Reddit account) and I did forget a little on what I wrote since I deleted it but I said something along the lines of how some things in his message he just sent to me hurt me because he said that whenever he tries to get in contact with past friends again the spark isn’t just there anymore while the other party agrees so they go their separate ways. I told him (this is the second time I told him that) I wanted to take a break with being friends because my mental health is being horseshit so he oblige and I also said I wanted to get back in contact with him once I’m a little sobered up and if something in my life does change a little but when he said those things about dropping friendships because it just wasn’t the same anymore, I voiced my own feelings on that and he said, “yeah so if that happens it’ll be sad but thats just life.”

And then I went ahead and posted that post and within like (maybe) 20 mins of posting it he commented and I re-read what I wrote and I immediately regret it and so I deleted it and didn’t want to reply because I felt ashamed. I said something in the post about how some things this person said hurt me and I’m just tired of caring for people who doesn’t care about me back yada yada yada. And then and hour goes by and he posted on his profile (addressed to me) to not message him anymore and that if I think I knew him or not or if I wanted to know him for some reason then I should just fuck off like he told me in the reply since he thinks he’s bothering and if he is then he told me to just tell him to fuck off but that’s far from the truth. I do like talking to him. He understands me. And then when I saw his profile and saw that post I immediately felt more like shit and decided to message him and tell him about the post.

1115,SpicyPeach14,1632336400,1,"Hi folks, I (25F) found this subReddit today and really needed to vent &amp; hear from others who understand what it’s like to feel like an outsider. I moved to a foreign country for graduate school in August and I am feeling terribly lonely. My whole life, it’s always been very difficult for me to make friends. I moved frequently to different countries as a child with my family and I chalk some of my loneliness/lack of friends up to my “strange” background and neurodivergence (diagnosed ADHD). I chose this graduate program because it’s geared toward international students and I thought I’d find people who grew up like me and maybe had more in common. I was looking forward to meeting new friends, but so far I’ve faced a lot of rejection. People in my cohort (class) have grouped up and I’ve been left on the outside. People have even made plans in front of me and don’t include me. I went on a group hike last week and was the only one who walked alone. It’s not for lack of trying, I’m an extrovert and I love to make conversation. But I have sensed before that I might come off as cold or abrasive? Or maybe my personality is just not that likeable? At this point, I think I also try too hard. I can sense my own insecurities and self-doubt rearing their ugly heads again, and it only heightens my rejection sensitivity. I want to be confident in myself, but it’s hard when I see this pattern unfolding again. Does anyone struggle with this? How do you handle rejection or gain confidence in social situations? Any advice would be great, or just commiseration.

Then pandemic happened and I was confined to home and I graduated with zero friends. 

It didn't matter at first to me but now I can see the effects of being lonely compounding. I plunged myself deep in social media which is utter time waste put the dopamine makes me feel good. But that wasn't enough, I started watching porn (even though I feel terrible I can't help it). I am constantly eating and if not then I'm thinking about food. I am unable to talk to anyone and constantly feel that whatever I say makes no sense. 

I am unable to focus on anything anymore - even if it is something very important for me my thoughts quickly wander to something stupid and then to next. I end up interpreting people in the wrong manner and hold grudges and think that it would be better if I end my life.

I don't mind having male friends, but I'm anxious that I'm doing something that causes guys to see me as ""friend material"" rather than ""significant other material."" When a few of my female friends complain about how guys are constantly making advances on them on campus or how many of their male friends have attempted to make moves on them in the past, I know there is a problem with me. None of my male friends have flirted with me, therefore I don't think any of them are taking advantage of this opportunity to become friends in order to grow closer to me and perhaps become more than friends. 

I can't think of the last time a guy publicly exhibited interest in me. Do you suppose the guys around me think I'm not interested in men? Could it be that my features are deemed palatable but not ""hot,"" ""sexy,"" or ""sexually attractive"" (I hate wearing revealing clothes, my stomach is not the flattest, and I have minor hyperpigmentation on my face, so maybe that’s the issue?)

The thing is I cannot give the person what he seeks and now finally he cuts off the conversations. I gotta say I need him much more than he needs me. Because now I have no one to talk to. One side of me tells me that it was a right moved cuz I don’t want to use him as a temporary thing one month only. And I don’t want to have sex with him. Another side of me blames myself for being a social awkward person that he doesn’t even want to chat with me as a friend anymore, I thought at least we had a good vibe for being friends, which now seems like I was overconfident/thinking too much/probably i suck as being a friend and he chatted with me just for dating. I understand that I have this coming, it’s definitely rational from both sides. I should not blame myself. 

However, it’s still suffering sometimes, and Im trying to not slip back to my old mindset, which is I hate myself for too many reasons.

-My parents never gave me the loving that I needed growing up. It's weird, I know they care, they're just lazy.
-My parents would always smoke in the house and in the car with no regard to me. This lead to me more than likely not having any friends because I always stunk. Never knew I did either until high school when a teacher pointed it out. Then I was severely self conscious about it afterwards.
-I wanted to quit football my freshmen year of high school because I sucked and I knew it. That, and my coach was an asshole to me. Picked on me just because he knew he could. One day at practice I looked away literally for one second (I have ADHD, this is common for me) and I look back as a football he threw at me hit me in the head (I was wearing a helmet, thankfully). He laughed then told me to pay attention.
-I ended up playing out that freshmen season (spent half of it ineligible due to grades) and then quit after the season. I didn't play football my sophomore year and the vibe from my Dad I sure felt. Felt like he hated me until I decided towards the end of sophomore year I'd play again all for a cheap hug.
-Even before high school I had an interest in wanting to learn how to cook (this was before YouTube) and I'd always ask my Mom if she'd show me and I just kept being put off over, and over and over again. I learned how to grill grilled cheeses in middle school and I had so much fun cooking that I kept doing it very often. I guess they never got the hint, or cared.
-I've hardly had very many girlfriends and the last one I had, 9 years ago, broke up with me after I told her I loved her. I had no clue she wasn't interested anymore either so this all came as a shock.
-I became a Christian in my early 20's and I'm sure somehow that has confused and fucked me up even more today than I know with all the rules and whatever. Also, the church people I've come across (this isn't speaking about all) are mostly judgmental, stuck up, money hungry assholes.

I could be missing something. But I'm sure most of this is why I am who I am today. Granted, I can say that a lot that I've learned I've done on my own. I love my parents overall, just the dynamic is so.... weird.",lonely,I think I understand now,2021-09-22 12:24:29

I have no one. I DID have close friend in school but this was YEARS ago.
This person currently lives in Colorado and I live a few states away. 
She had been telling me for years that she was going to visit one day. We don’t talk often but I thought it might be fun.

She would often tell me she was coming and then would never come.
Then one day FINALLY she does end up coming out to where I live. 


I think wow, she is actually coming! Crazy since she always says she is coming and then never does.


So I’m waiting and then she arrives and I know because I see her on Instagram. …..Except she never messages me despite the fact we have been planning this for weeks. She then proceeds to frequently post stories of her doing things in the state where I LIVE! She can see me watching these stories but never says anything.

Before she came she told me that she didn’t know anybody out here and that when she came she would just spend time with me. Low and behold I see her posting selfie’s of her and her brother and her friends out here. So I guess you did know people then?


Finally I know she has one week left to be here so I let her know I’m down to hangout and she says ok sure, that will be fun! 
We plan a day and she never messages me at all or even responds when I message her.



Finally I let her know that I bought her a gift. It was a ten dollar gift card, some candy, and a bear. All if a sudden now she is available to hangout. She lets me know she will come by and she does. 


So let’s get this straight. 

1. She made plans with me knowing she would not even be close to where I was. 

2. Instead of just letting me know that her plans changed and she would not be able to hangout, she posts on Instagram showing her hanging out with people having a good time.

3. She waits for me to message her to ask what’s going on and then after making plans to hangout doesn’t respond when the day comes.

4. Waits for me to tell her I got her a gift and then is suddenly available to hangout. She accepts the gift and then doesn’t speak to me at all.

This is an example of the type of “friend” I have. And what’s even better she will go back to Colorado and have her friends but I stay here with NO ONE even more  discouraged.

1227,Affectionate-Cow-880,1632265471,1,"Hi guys, I'm feeling very down lately.  
Just for background, I'm 32, just in case the following sounds like a teenager complaining.

I feel like I have to make all the effort to hang out with people, and people never make the effort to hang out with me. At least not the people that I would like to hang out with. I know it sounds shitty or spoiled when I'm being picky about the company I keep when I'm lonely, but I used to let people into my life who were not worth it. They didn't really care about me or my interests, they just wanted someone to do drugs with or drink or to make them feel better about themselves. Or maybe I just don't like their vibe and can't always explain it. I want people to say ""hey, want to come to the cottage with us?"" or to let me know when the cool block parties are happening, or art shows, or anything. More specifically, I want guy friends. I have no guy friends who I respect. It's not like I'm weird or creepy or whatever (as far as I know lol), I have lovely conversations with my co-workers and such but I often see social media posts where a bunch of co-workers are hanging out and I didn't even know about it, and obviously I don't want to confront anyone cause that's not going to help at all.  
I've been asking people that I would like to hang out with to hang, get a coffee or lunch or something, but even when I get ""yeah, let's do it, bud!"" There's often no follow-up. I have to keep trying and it gets exhausting, and people often want to bail last minute or keep the hang super short, or they're just not engaged in what's going on. I bet the advice for this is to keep trying, kind of like dating almost - good people are hard to come by and what not. But... man, it feels like the same thing over and over again, I'm not actually sure I'm making progress.

In the movie, Kevin James’ character plays a man who hasn’t gotten over his ex/been in a relationship in 5 years. I thought that was pathetic and that would never be me. Now it is, and I don’t know what to say. My ex broke up with me 6/7 years ago and I haven’t been in a relationship since. 

My ex once said I’m “damaged goods”. I thought she just said that because she was upset or wanted to mess with my head (which she often did) but my best friend once said to me (before she cut contact with me) that no matter how much she tries to lift me up, I always bring myself down. I have zero friends, anyone I do manage to talk to starts moving away from me and keeps their distance. I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with me where I can’t connect to people and self sabotage no matter how desperately I want to be happy. 

I’ve been to ~7 therapists and took meds for a while, but nothing ever worked. 

I have a huge fear of making women uncomfortable so I never talk to girls because I’m afraid I might make them feel uncomfortable. The last thing I want is for them to feel unsafe. 

To be clear, I don’t feel like having a relationship will solve all my problems or turn everything into sunshine and rainbows, but all i have is my work, which is nice and fulfilling, but I want to have someone to share my life with, friends to talk to and make memories with, to give and receive.

I'm a 15yo girl, who's always been lonely, but I started being aware of this only a year ago. I've been a nerdy girl with weird interests since kindergarten. While all the other children played toys and talked to each other, I read books and watched documentary films. I've always been more interested in conversations with people older than me, but now it's difficult because they already have jobs and other things to do. I do a lot to become interesting to people my age, I constantly improve my appearance and knowledge, I know a lot about music, politics, comedy, movies, and so on. But it seems like other people don't care about it at all. Any ""friendship"" I had didn't last for more than a couple months, and I feel like I'm doing something wrong. At school everyone already has their own friends/friend groups, and I'm nothing more than a nerdy classmate. I'm very initiative when it comes to social interaction, and I'm 100% extravert. I can't enjoy time that isn't spent in a group of people, but when I'm not alone, I still think that no one cares about me. I can come to school and no one will talk to me for a whole day. No one has texted me in 3 weeks. I lose motivation to studying, hobbies and self-improvement just because I feel that no one will  pay attention to this.

I am that unfortunate person who never experienced a true friendship or love, I don't even know if I will feel it if I ever get it, I will have no idea and lose them so it's better to accept the loneliness.

A few days back, I got to realise that I have this disease called tinnitus where I hear high pitch sounds randomly at any time which is really irritation, since my childhood, it has been there for ever.
Now I am worried that since it causes me hearing loss, will I ever get to hear the purest form of Love you from just one person who I have been waiting for years?

I talked to my parents about it, that this needs some treatment may be, but they are blaming me about this that because I wake up late, take late showers, eat late, that's why this has developed, but I accept I have been lazing around since last year, but this has been there since my childhood, I just use to think that it's a common thing every human has it, but now I got to know I got a serious disease since my birth may be and no one cares about it. Yes I dont think my family really cares about me and this is not the only reason so don't comfort me.
Now, I have my buds all the time in my ear since I don't want to listen to them atleast and I just want to get deaf may be, may be then they will know it was serious, idk.

But before that, I want to find a person who can atleast say me once, Love you.
How does it feel?
Does it really gives you butterflies in stomach?
Will it finally put a real smile on my face?
I have no idea and will never cause I am gonna be a loner to hell, I don't deserve heaven, I wanna rot in hell may be that will keep me busy from overthinking in afterlife.
May be it's just my destiny, I have become emotionally numb, I have tears in my years, but still don't feel like crying, no pain to be let out, everything inside me, the void pulling me down.
May be a hug could work, I want to feel the warmthness of care for me, but again I will never find anyone. No virtual hugs, never comfort anyone.

But what makes it worse is not having anyone to love me or be kind to me. It would be nice after a long day of being around people to have some one show me some kindness. 

I go to work. People are assholes. I come home to my family of assholes. 
I get negative attention, or negative reactions at the very least. 

I’m not the best communicator. I really fit the description of a high functioning autistic starting with a speech delay in childhood, to lack of eye contact and difficulty finding words. People talk down to me daily as if I don’t understand tone or jokes. I do… but I get these reactions so often I think the problem is they dont understand MY tone. I’ve noticed a pattern of people saying I’m too dramatic or I’m too monotone. Sometimes I think they would criticize me no matter what because I am an easy target. Always have been, in every setting. At every job. I’m just the person to pick on. I simply can’t express myself. Everyday I wish I could go mute, I can’t even imagine the contentment and peace that would come with silence. 

Still, I am friendly. It’s in my nature. It’s such a let down when that friendliness isn’t returned or I’m snubbed in such a rude way. That really hurts. It doesn’t feel human. 

Sometimes there’s a person that gives me a chance. Some times a person might even like me or want to be friends. But it’s rare.

I wasn't good to her, I was an idiot &amp; had no idea how to treat her, but I tried. Pride was a big issue of mine, &amp; it made me awful to her at times.

She wasn't good to me, she soft-cheated (nothing physical that I know of, just talking to guys) multiple times ..but I think this is largely the fault of my stupidity with a bit of her young-n-dumbness.

She left me in Tucson &amp; went back home, that was a day I understood the ""empty apartment"" cliche, and I couldn't even be in that apartment so I ran away, left everything there, just couldn't see it without her.

This was all nearly a decade ago, and I've not loved anyone since. I still don't know that she ever actually loved me, but that could be insecurities speaking.

1313,CasuallySimpin,1632191538,1,"Hello everyone,

My name is Jo. I’m from California, specifically SoCal *(that’s about as specific as I can get for a post).* I just don’t really know anymore. I feel like the idea of meeting a potential partner online is charming but ends up being drastically more difficult than just waiting for dumb luck to give you a meet-cute in real life. Now, I’m open to speaking to ANYONE; I love meeting people and making friends. At the end of the day, it would be nice to find a partner, but I don’t want anyone feeling pressure or thinking that’s why you must message me.

I haven’t been the best person in the past, I’ll admit that. My flaw is getting bored easily then leaving. I’ve done this a few times. The same has been done to me. No matter what the “defense” is, the action is still wrong. Since then, I’ve been better at communicating. If I’m bored or I think we just aren’t clicking, etc. I will be sure to let you know rather than just bouncing. With that said, **please match my energy****.** I truly try hard to talk to people, create conversation, ask questions, insert random anecdotes – but please try to do the same. I don’t like my efforts being in vain.

Some random things about me: 

\- I’m 6’2”

\- I weight 240lbs. Being tall distributes the weight evenly, but I would still say I have a “dad-bod.”

\- I have 2 tattoos: one I regret, the other I don’t. 

\- I have a cat. He will be 3 years old next May. He is an American Shorthair with an orange/white coat. I am happy to share photos of him.

\- I’m an American-born Hispanic. Puedo hablar español con fluidez. I love racist jokes, but don’t like racists. If you have a real hate inside for people because they’re not your race, then please don’t bother.

\- I’m pansexual. Though I find myself dating women for the most part, I’m open to a relationship with anyone at all. And again, if you have a real hate for people who aren’t straight or don’t respect everyone’s choices, then we’re not going to have a good time.

\- I have a “resting bitch face” when I'm not thinking or focusing on giving a smile. However, I’m honestly a very kind, gentle, compassionate, caring and nurturing person – but I will admit my face doesn’t say that.

\- My humor is limitless. I will joke about anything and everything, but at the end of the day, it’s a joke. I also know to pick my audience, so if I sense that my joke will offend at least 1 person around me, I won’t tell it. 

\- My music taste is eclectic – I listen to anything and everything. I also very much enjoy music that’s not in the English language. Personally, I think Italian pop music is great. 

\- I enjoy traveling but haven’t done so much of it. I like long car rides, I’m not afraid of flights, and sitting on a train is a very relaxing experience. I also enjoy exploring, going to museums, hiking on trails, bike riding along the beach, trying a new restaurant, going to a new brewery.

\- I watch plenty of TV &amp; movies. I binge and can juggle multiple shows at one time. However, I dislike watching shows that are currently still airing. I’m a bit too impatient to wait for next week’s episode. Thank the power of streaming services for that.

\- I do play videogames. I usually play on my PC, but I also do own an Xbox, PS4 and Switch.

\- I work a full-time job, and I’m paid salary, meaning I don’t necessarily work 8 hours, it’s more like 10-12. However, I only work M-F, so I am usually free on weekends.

\- I don’t have any socials besides Reddit &amp; Discord *(believe it or not)*. 

Here is a photo of me. I don’t have any opinions on how I look. You’re the one looking at me so you can decide how you think I look. If physical attraction is your thing and I don’t make the cut, then I’m sorry to hear that and I hope you find someone that does.

I feel like I have said way too much so this is where I will wrap things up. I hope that you all find the person you’re looking for; but if you haven’t, feel free to take a shot on me.",lonely,"At this point, any lasting connection would be nice.",2021-09-21 12:32:18
1314,IdioticMind,1632191533,1,"Heya, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

Please read my post well so that you can understand what I'm looking for! 🙂

This year was very tuff.. but i guess everybody feels the same when i say that. So many things happened in my life. 
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

I didn't give up even at the lowest point and i managed to get up again, somehow :)

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT (I'm eating my lentil soup for the last two days rn 😂) since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately. We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. I feel like fallen into the same old dull routine.. And still i love her. It's difficult. 
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other. I don't what to call what I'm looking for. Definitely a friend in some way but maybe more than that? Especially for the last part 🙈
(just to mention, I'm straight)

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday 😊

PS: Just to make sure that you read my post, please send me the first verse of the Song ""Bob Moses - Tearing Me Up"" tell me your impression and why you decided to reach out!

PSS: I don't like chatting on Reddit, so if you can suggest an alternative app to stay in contact, that would be great!",lonely,If you like Piña Coladas write to me and escape!,2021-09-21 12:32:13
1315,confused-yharnamite,1632190650,1,"I remember back when I was a socially awkward, sexually frustrated teenager in high school. I didn't think I would ever get a girlfriend, and it was driving me crazy. Not quite incel levels of frustration but still extremely miserable.

Today I wish I could go back in time and smack myself. When I got into university I finally met my first love. She was super into me and I was madly in love with her. Our relationship wasn't perfect, in fact in hindsight it was probably toxic, but at the time it didn't matter. She made me happy. Those were the best 8 months of my life until we both got out of school and she confessed to sleeping with and having formed a new relationship with her coworker.

I've had a couple girlfriends and a handful of dates since then but they fizzled out relatively quickly, with the longest one lasting a month. Women that I actually connect with and are attracted to are very few and far between. I've now been single for over a year, and not from a lack of trying.

I miss how it feels to have a loved one lay next to me, or to hold and be held by. I miss those little moments where you look into the other person's eyes and feel connected with them on a spiritual level. Spending all day with someone and never growing tired each other's presence. Missing them when they're gone, but being excited to see them again. Feels bad man

At least not for a while. I was looking at my journals from my late teens and I was writing about making friends. I will continue to try and put myself out there, therapy, like I have been. But I might need to give this desire up if I want to be happy.

People like me, are happy to meet me I can have acquaintances. But I can't get to know someone more again. I've had a couple want to be more but I have to feel like they are toxic and I think that's how it is because if I don't recognize a toxic one or not the issues start there. 

I have to be away, otherwise it's just socializing and then it eats at my time and I don't see the meaning anymore. I'm just empty, drifting, different. Otherwise I won't be putting enough hours it takes to make close friends anytime soon. So I have to give this up.

I feel like I’m ready to get back out there but women just don’t seem to want me, it’s weird. I’ve lost 10kg since April, much more confident, I’m lean, more attractive per se, but nobody seems to find me attractive right now it’s weird. 

My luck with women has been poor. My only relationship ended because I called her out for not caring about my mental health, she dumped me right after. 

I dated 2 people after. One was very manipulative and controlling, the other made me get a 2 hour train journey during peak covid to say she likes someone else the next day. 

My friends have been very supportive by saying “you’ll find someone, you’re going to make someone very happy etc” but I don’t believe I’ll find that person. Yes I’m only 21, but I think I’m going to die alone. I hate it so much, it’s eating me up inside…",lonely,"Hey guys, I want some advice on something.",2021-09-21 08:05:31

I used to wonder why there's so many bitter old fools when I was young, now I'm slowly becoming one. I'm too skeptical to become religious, I'm too stupid to become important and quite honestly I believe that I'm just average at best.

Most people don't get interested in gory, gross shit, or fixate on something for well over a year, or rock side to side on their bed (at 21 mind you) whilst listening to music. Most people don't interrupt with random, irrelevant, 'errrr-me-ghad I'm so quirky!' bullshit. Most people aren't scared of the most inane shit. Most people aren't talentless and ugly and so.... Unlovable and unwanted. And that's what I am: unwanted, and if not initially, then eventually.

I just.. I don't want to be a hermit. I want a connection. But I can't. It's like everyone has been given a script but me. I'm jealous all the time. Angry all the time. Sad all the time. 21 and... What do I have to show for it. I'm a woman, still a virgin (please don't DM me creepy shit, please). I haven't kissed or held a hand. I'm scared of phone calls. I get burnt out at jobs easily, struggling to reach even the 2 month mark.

Who is ever going to want an ugly, talentless, sad, sad, sad, depressed woman? Either as a companion or lover? I mean, physically I look 15 - like someone who's not even been through puberty. That kind. My fashion is terrible.

I don't even want to celebrate my 21st birthday (I round up - birthday is in November). I have no friends to celebrate with. I hate drinking because it reminds me how everyone prefers me that way, and not as sober me.

Atm I'd say I'm stuck in a place of almost full self isolation from the outside world.

Mid 2k19 I got diagnosed with cancer. Got the tumor extraction and following chemotherapy the same year and finished in late December that year.

I'm a mere introvert and most of the time just enjoy smoking weed and playing video games. So it was okay for me. I lived with my ex gf during that time.
Over the time we argued more and more. Spent more time separated. Then it was like the start of covid and now with a fucked immune system I couldn't go outside. Didn't bother me much cuz like I said ima introvert.

Lost more and more social contacts.

In May of 2020 my ex gf gave birth to my daughter.
I got the call from the hospital that I am a ""dad"" now.
(didn't know bout her pregnancy till this day, cuz she denied it every time)

We argued more and a month later I moved to my mums apartment, another month later taking the little one with me.
My ex was to overwhelmed with a kid.

Timeskip to now.

Living in a small 2 room apartment with the little one.
Still very few social contacts besides my two brothers and my mother. Maybe like 2 friends.

I suffer from depression since my teenage years.
And I notice, I get lonelier every day.

Often I feel like a hollow husk, with the obligation to watch over my kid. That's it.
Is this life? Should it be like that?

Tbh I just wanna be hugged and told everything's gonna be fine in the end, but it doesn't look like it :/

Well, I'm here because, like you all, I am lonely. I am also here because I want to share some realizations I have had and hopefully help the discourse here.

I recently learned of the meme term ""COPE"", in that sort of *""I'm avoiding facing something so I will hype myself up""* manner.

I just now realized I have been doing this my whole life.

I keep telling myself self-improvement, hobbies, going to the gym (!), make money man, focus only on you, is the path to not worry about loneliness. This is simply a fairy tale we adults believe. No less pathetic as so many other superstitions we have to soothe ourselves.

It is an avoidant tactic we (especially men) utilize to not face our echoing isolation.

I'm especially guilty of always being on my grind, working excessively (workaholic), but really, it is just to escape the excess time in my own thoughts, away from distractions that would force me to come to terms with the emptiness I feel.

Workaholism is just a way for me to avoid facing my loneliness. 

I also posit that for a large portion of occurrences, in our modern society (in personal relationships), ""takers"" are incentivized, and ""givers"" are punished. To go along with this, more often than not, ""extroverts"" are also celebrated, and ""introverts"" are maligned. 

I think this indirectly, contributes to our collective atomization. 

Humans are social creatures, and like our mammalian friends wolves, we cannot survive outside society alone for long. Our mental, spiritual, and physical survival depends on us not being so alone.

We need others, and we need to be needed by others.

I must confess I do not fear my death. I fear dying without knowing what love feels like.

This is a wound that never heals and a suffering I feel constantly. No amount of distraction is enough anymore.

1392,Watman77,1632138771,1,"In my university, we hold a lot of events. These can be some hang outs where we drink beer, play beer pong and often have the possibility to go to sauna (which I really love), LAN parties, tent trips, smaller barbeques evenings, you name it. I really like going to different kind of events,  but not the kind where you dance to pop music. I meet some of my buddies with whom I started studying but also new people. We talk about everything, we laugh and everything seems to go pretty good. The problem is outside of those events.

Many times when I go hangout to those events I hear how my buddies have done so many things together in their free time: Hanging out in each others apartments, possibly playing some board games together, getting wasted together etc. Friday stuff. And I always wonder why nobody is inviting me to hangout with them. I thought I was pretty good friends with most of the people, especially during my first year. 

I have a few times asked a friend if he would like to get wasted and maybe we could invite some friends to come with us too. And we did a few times. After those times I thought we got closer as friends but looks like I was wrong.

I'm afraid that people just think I am annoying. I feel the urge to text those friends from time to time and just ask if there's anything happening on Friday evening, but I don't want to push myself into groups where people don't want me. (If someone doesn't want to hangout with me, I think they shouldn't be forced to). Most of the time when I see some friends outside or during events, I feel like I am always the first to initiate the conversation.

I have literally 2 friends still in my hometown from my elementary school that I hangout with from time to time on weekends but because of their stupid behavior I don't really wanna see them anymore and ""break up"" with them. I have friends from my high school that study in different fields but go to the same university as me. Thing is, the only reason I still have contact with them is Snapchat and if I didn't keep streaks with them, I would've lost contact with them a long time ago most likely. I see them from time to time in events and we just catch up.

I am just afraid that after finishing my studies, I will have zero friends and if I want to prevent it I have to start acting quickly.

I’ve never myself been in a real relationship. Aside being a hookup for someone for about a month. And now seeing my friends getting married or be in these long relationships, I feel more and more alone.

Also, this is not a question reflecting on all women, but merely the few I've experienced this with.

Over the past three months, I - 19 years old - have noticed this happening more and more often with my female friends; close friendships lasting since our time in high school, one childhood friend dating back to Kindergarten even. They always want to talk to you, blowing up your phone to either initiate conversations or see if your still up at 3am. But, whenever I send a simple text saying ""Hey, wassup?"" or ""Hi, how are you doing?"" they always respond with ""What do you want?"" And if you're telling them a funny story or dream they respond with ""So, what?"" or ""I don't care."" Worse, they just never respond to your texts. It's like, some women have this entitled mindset that makes it okay for them to annoy you with messages and bombard you with their own stories and whatnot, but a guy can't even say hello or start a conversation without the guy either being ghosted or being shut down from talking.

It's happening so frequently I often wonder what's the point of having these ""friendships"" if they're never gonna care about me? For the ones who ghosted me, I've already accepted the fact they never want to talk to me, and I've moved on from them.

1444,ENVIOUSDEVlL,1632106512,1,"I very recently made a Reddit, I only started browsing primarily because of people I previously considered friends suggesting specific subs to me.   


I'm 19 and I've turned it during the Pandemic in a fairly bad region amidst the Pandemic, due to that I've had just about no social interaction outside of interactions I'd rather not touch on; most of which were fairly heavily abusive relationships. I grew up in a very harsh household, back and forth between ""Trap houses"" within a pretty terrible area that I unfortunately had no choice but to reside in due to the relatives who did care for me and take care of me not being very financially well-off or stable so to speak.   


My parents were both heavily abusive with drugs, to the point where I didn't really consider that I even had parents as whenever I saw them it was typically them being very heavily physically abusive and mentally as well as emotionally abusive towards me; I can't recount the full amount of times I had to sit and watch while my parents did very hard drugs in-front of me, most of which were of the needle variety.    


I genuinely don't know what to do with my life, I've been in such a bad place emotionally and mentally that I've went from the beliefs that I was raised quite literally drilled into me to constant and frequent mental breakdowns where I can do nothing besides edge myself closer to the point of complete isolation and even more self-destructive thoughts. This Isn't any type of note, I have no intentions of harming myself and I don't ever intend to succumb to harming myself or thoughts of doing so; It's more of a brief portion of my life where I can get this off of my chest anonymously without the constant anxiety and paranoia about being looked down on or viewed as a broken person.  


There is a singular additional thing, from a very young age I was very often and frequently groomed; due to that I have unrealistic explicit expectations and a false sense of security. I believe outside of explicit interaction subconsciously? I'm not really sure if It's subconscious or not that I am completely and entirely useless. Outside of explicit contact and interaction, I don't feel valued and I don't feel like I'll ever genuinely be appreciated.

1452,Asleep-Passenger9806,1632103062,1,"Recap of how I got here:  


\[43M\] I had dated a \[37F\] for 8.5 years who was in and out of active addiction and we still live together because we are both on the deed of the house. She went to rehab for the seventh time and met a guy there who they got kicked out of rehab together because they wouldn't stop crossing over to the other side (males and females were separated). They got high together, and both ended back in rehab together again a couple of times. They are now dating which is fair because I have told her I cannot be in a relationship with her. Her oldest son lives with me and has done so where it was just the two of us while she was in active addiction and rehab.  


 I simultaneously don't want to be in a relationship with her but am incredibly sad that she moved on so quickly. Basically, makes me feel like I was never enough, and failed to be a good partner (yes again irrational because she was a crappy partner while using drugs).  


Another reason for this current fear is that I am currently helping my 73-year-old mother who is alone through some health issues, and it is scaring me that I don't even have a kid of my own that will help me later in life if I need it. As stated, the 18-year-old that lives with me does care about me, but let's be real if I am not in his life there won't be anything connecting us anymore and that connection will fade.   
So, I am fearing the current loneliness as well as the long-term view of not having anyone...Which is irrational to worry about right now.   


I have extroverted tendencies when put in a crowd but my lack of dating experience (this was my first real relationship) has me worried that I will not find another person to share my life with. I have tried some dating apps but I am not getting responses and when a woman reaches out to me I start a conversation and get no replies, call me crazy but I attempt to start conversations to get to know someone before asking if they want to go out (I am talking texts go back and forth like max 3 times) or that I am damaged and/or desperate and just sending that vibe out there.  


I just don't feel in a good place and know that this is temporary but that doesn't make it hurt any less or make me feel any less a failure for not being able to handle this relationship. It makes me question did I make the right choices, by pushing her away after she went to rehab and always being suspicious afterwards, I am talking like the fifth or sixth relapse which outnumber her trips to rehab during this relationship.

1458,tatsbng,1632099063,1,"It's currently my 2nd year of college and i () havent made a friend so far. Like, I get along with some people, but it never goes further than school stuff. Now I guess we have to consider the fact that my first year was entirely online so it messed up my social life a bit, although I didn't really have much friends before either. 

However now that school is back online and everyone seems super happy, I realize how much I enjoyed learning from home because I didn't have to face how lonely I am. I literally go to school only to say 1 or 2 words... I eat alone, and sometimes I help some classmates but as I said, we aren't close. It feels as though only my parents care about me, and it hurts to think that I won't always be able to have them with me.

Now, the problem to this is mostly that I am very shy. I have had so many opportunities to get closer to some girls but I just get too nervous and end up doing nothing, or I embarrass myself, which makes me feel horrible. I feel like I'm nobody, and only my teachers ""appreciate"" me for my good work.

The only friends I have are online friends, and the only thing I look forward to is that my online best friend is going to move in my country when she's done with her studies. However, I know that I cannot rely on people who disappear once the wifi is off. They're there but they're not really there, you know...

As I'm 18, I feel horrible because I heard those were supposed to be your best years, when you party and do crazy stuff... But i have nobody to do crazy stuff with and that only because I'm too shy to approach people :( And it's not like I can do much crazy stuff anyways, I wanna focus on college as well...

So yeah, basically I guess I'd just need tips on how to deepen my relationships with people. I already know who I want to be friends with, I just don't know how to make it more than just school without weirding them out with my awkwardness. I've literally thought about asking one of them ""hey wanna be best friends?"" like bruh who does that.",lonely,im so shy i havent made a friend in 3 years,2021-09-20 10:51:03

I have a Mom, but she has some issues that make talking to her in a meaningful way kind of difficult. I do not mean to sound like I am worse off than some other people in terms of loneliness. I only want to know what I can do to not feel like such a pathetic dip who deserves to feel lonely. It is sometimes hard not to feel disillusioned with life. What do I do when the tears come? Do I just cry? Do I get mad at things? How can I deal with these feelings without simply resigning to my circumstances?

A childhood of unwantedness and abandon by real bullies and fake friends had created a life where my environment never felt like my home.

I arrived in New England over a year and a half ago. Just before the lockdown in 2020. Most of that time was spent homeless, for reasons discussed in ancient comments. 30 minutes away is someone who has repeatedly called my his brother and very best friend,  but in over a year and a half, has never once came to see me. And while I am in a position to be able to visit him, he has spent literally 100% of the last year and. Half with one excuse after another, whether it be work, medical emergency,  family stuff, or just plain doesn't show up or returns calls or texts for up to a week later. 

Before I came here, my final chapter in the south was spending 5 ½ years taking care of my grandmother.  I cooked, cleaned, handled her meds, doctors, everything.  I did it for her, because I loved her. Two years ago I left Atlanta,  and her on the care of relatives who were going to see she wanted for nothing for the rest of her life. Unfortunately,  family drama and federal charges ended up torpedoing the quality of her life. And this all unfolded as I was 1500 miles away.

Last week, on Wednesday,  my 83 year old grandmother passed away. We did get to say our goodbyes when we had the chance, but the pain of knowing she's gone hurts so much.

This person who calls me his brother and very best friend. This douchebag won't ever return my texts. So I told him to never talk to me again, and I blocked him.

Another ""friend"" says she wants to spend time this weekend and help me cope. This is the third time in a row she's done the same shit ""brother"" does. 

My own therapist called me four hours before my phone appointment to reschedule.  This was an hour after I found out my grandmother had died.  Two days later, he doesn't even keep his own appointment. 

AND NONE OF THESE PEOPLE EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER.

For awhile at least, we would always FaceTime during quarantine sometimes and in Group FaceTime’s. there was a point of time when we just had each other. I wish I could go back and do things differently.

during freshman year she changed, not many people really liked her, my friends didn’t like her anymore. She started doing drugs and other stuff when she met this friend that was a bad influence on her. I tried to do something cause I loved her and I didn’t want her to go down that path but she did and I later learned my lesson which just left me in more pain. I was obsessed with her for over a year and I regret it so much. then came one day where it broke me when I found out she did some stuff with one of my “friends”. I later got over it and that’s how I ended up cutting her off for a good while until august when we made up. 

biggest mistake I made. I ended up catching feelings again. I went out of my way to do stuff for her and we even kissed. but like I was straight up being a sumo afterwards and then later when I got her something she needed she changed her mind about wanting to make out again. Then later on that day my friend tells me she asked him to make out for a v pod or wtv and I was like so heart broken. Like she did the exact same thing from last year. how are you going to apologize to me for doing me dirty, cry for me if my attempts actually worked, and tell me you love me. Then do the same exact thing again where you do me dirty. later on I realized what I was doing and I just ended up blocking her on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

It started with her having a headache, i told her theres a pressure point in your hand that can relieve that. She couldnt find it so i broke the touch barrier and asked for her hand and felt that pressure point. I could see she was moderately relieved but i was focusing on how soft her hands felt. I was the one to let go of her hand. Then i noticed she plays with her hair when talking to me and laughs a lot, this is just something ive noticed since that day.

And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by the dragon, seizes a twig growing in a crack in the well and clings to it. His hands are growing weaker and he feels he will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that awaits him above or below, but still he clings on. Then he sees that two mice, a black one and a white one, go regularly round and round the stem of the twig to which he is clinging and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will snap and he will fall into the dragon's jaws. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while still hanging he looks around, sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the twig, reaches them with his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to lick the honey which formerly consoled me, but the honey no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung. I saw the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tasted sweet. I only saw the unescapable dragon and mice, and I could not tear my gaze from them. and this is not a fable but the real unanswerable truth intelligible to all. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me. No matter how often I may be told, ""You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,"" I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false. The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing -- art as I called it -- were no longer sweet to me. ""Family""... said I to myself. But my family -- wife and children -- are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death."" 
- Tolstoy, A Confession. 

Yet, I remind myself of the faith of Sisyphus, forever facing sunwards, valiantly pushing the weight of his torment into eternity. I am reminded of Christ the martyr on calvary bleeding his faith into the Earth crying: ""Father, Father, why have you forsaken me?"" Humanity has collectively and existentially suffered the same feeling of the loneliest of loneliness for thousands of years. Our pain is a part of us, we mustn't let this nihilistic burn reduce us to ash, rather, as Kierkegaard's knight of faith; accept this as a part of our humanity. This existential struggle is what makes us so uniquely human after all. We must find ourselves in a position, where we convince ourselves this abstract game of life and death, is a like a game of chess, the bet is eternity, and by merely choosing to live, you display the greatest act of defiance and faith. By resisting succumbing to the withering forest of life, you have retained your humanity and are truly defined as a free spirit. 

""Faith is the strength of life. If a man lives he believes in something. If he did not believe that one must live for something, he would not live. If he does not see and recognize the illusory nature of the finite, he believes in the finite; if he understands the illusory nature of the finite, he must believe in the infinite. Without faith he cannot live.""

I feel stupid for even feeling this way since he was never mine but I can’t shake it.

I had been talking with this guy for maybe 6 months, we were on friendly terms and well as it’s bound to happen one of us formed feelings for the other and that sucker just happened to be me. He was sweet to me and was there when I needed him. We told each other everything and I hoped he could say the same about me.

I should have seen this coming though. He was once very active on multiple social media platforms and the past month he hasn’t been, at all. The last time we spoke I was in a slump and tried to reach out to him and he lashed out at me, asked “what the fuck do you want from me” and so on. I apologised and said I’m sorry for being annoying and we didn’t speak after that. That came out of know where. Fast forward to a couple of days ago and he finally posts a photo of him and a girl. 

Like I said I feel stupid for even feeling this way and feel like I don’t even have a right to do so. Im happy for him but it still really stings especially after what we had, how he was a big part of my everyday life for 6 months and how it all ended and why it did.

I've made a mini-bio so I hope this helps:

**Basics**: Adult // Guy // United Kingdom // Recently single but looking for FRIENDS ONLY!

**Interests**: Anime, Kpop (although [v. new](https://v.new) to this) / Indie music, Horror / Dystopian novels, Crime Docs on Netflix. 

**Animals**: I love all animals and am trying to become vegetarian. I live near a McDonalds though and this is a constant struggle! I have just adopted an abandoned cat who is my whole world right now and a bit of a rascal honestly. 

**Looking for:** Someone kind, a nerd / geek (interested in movies / videogames / collecting stuff), lover of the natural world and who has interests who they can talk to me about throughout the day. Anyone really as long as they're interesting, cool and kind. Maybe someone I could meet way, way further down the line, you know, in 'real life'? 

**Mental Health:** Long standing social anxiety sufferer but I still try to push through and get on with life. If you have any mental health issues, I promise to always be supportive as I know how crappy it can be.

Anyhow, I'm looking for people that would be interested in joining a small discord server I've been wanting to create for people who share the experience of loneliness and having trouble forming social relationships. 

The reason why I'm doing this is because I'm fucking lonely as fuck and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing wrong. I feel like I'm a very intelligent person, I'm beautiful, sexy, successful, passionate, I believe I have a lot to offer, I've been told I am very thoughtful and caring in relationships. But something is making it impossible for me to form a fulfilling, long-term, two-sided friendships and I don't know what the fuck it is. 

I feel like it would be really helpful for me to talk to people who experience the same thing and maybe even connect. I've been following this sub and other similar subs for a long time and I know I'm not alone in this and I know there are people who could benefit from talking to others about it as well, (others that understand and have been on a similar ride).

1554,Elaurin34,1632044683,1,"I don't really understand why I feel sad once again... I just need to work some things out so feel free to read it. Last Friday I had my second date in total and it was quite awkward to be honest. She was always telling me how much shes talking about nonsense and when we actually met up she was really quiet. I was too but I had warned her that I sometimes am social awkward in before and she said its fine, she even told me stories about herself being comfortable with other socially awkward guys and then at friday afternoon we just awkwardly did what we had chosen as activity (which was football golf). She didnt seem too discouraged after that tho and we went to a coffee afterwards. Then the weird part happened. She started to try come up with a conversation and I never really knew how to react since my dumb brain just isnt able to conduct a conversation... but when I tried she just shrugged her shoulders without much else of a response and continued talking about random things. After this we went back to our cars and the only thing she said was something like ""yeah, it was alright but we definetely shouldnt meet up again"". Since then she is ghosting me altho we got along quite well before we had met. I know its quite common to be ghosted especially with OLD but it makes me really upset because I feel like what an absolutely trashy personality someone has to have to ghost someone... I even messaged her afterwards that it didnt work out as planned and offered to pay for the date but she didnt response anymore... I dont even know why it makes me as mad since I wont throw money after someone like this.

I really  dont understand where others meet these kind, interesting, non judgemental girls and even get them to be interested in them as well. And they even do it multiple times when it didnt work out with the previous girl. I mean... whats wrong with me that girls dont even seem to consider me as someone to talk to or even as a boyfriend? Im kind of sporty, kind, can make others laugh when I feel comfortable I sometimes even think of myself as clever and good looking. I mean everyone else seems to be able to find their significant other despite their imperfections... makes me feel like I am one big imperfection without any advantages...

 Well this date dug up all my insecurities that I thought I had overcome... I feel lonely again when I see others doing activities with their friends and post it on instagram. I never had friends let alone groups of friends with whom I could meet up and do something fun and now it actually bothers me again although I came to the point where I could enjoy myself enough to not care anymore. I also dont have interests or hobbies that I consequently pursue. I see others on instagram posting about their musical progress now playing or dancing in a band, drawing, climbing, hiking, surfing what ever... I just go to work and as soon as I finish I drive home sit down infront of my PC or TV and watch videos about video games or random stuff. I dont even have a video game in which I am interested in long term. Its not like I dont have any interests at all but they are like: Im REALLY interested in something for about 2 weeks and then it takes a year until im interested again...I work out for 3 weeks in a row and then I cant motivate myself anymore...I try to learn 3D modelling and dont want to do it after a few tutorials anymore... its probably the same with everything else... So thanks to my lack of friends, activities, interests and social experience I dont have many things to talk about on dates...

 I just saw a video of someone hiking with his best friend and sleeping on top of the mountain in the middle of winter... Id honestly want to do crazy stuff like this with a best friend. But not on my own... I used to never enjoy things that I am doing alone because it makes me feel even lonelier to see others doing the same thing but with friends... and I seem to have this strange characteristic that strangers never talk to me except when they have to... others tell me about weird stories with strangers all the time...

There isn't a day I won't get reminded of my loneliness and lack of human interaction.

I have tried many times, poured so much energy and focus into changing myself to be able to connect to someone.

Because that's one thing I'm certain about, it's me that have to change. This is not normal.

But every time I just end up with the same realization. It doesn't matter, nothing will change.

&amp;#x200B;

If I try to be more outgoing, I just end up being way too forward and come off as a creep.

I try to be more ""chill"" and nobody wants to interact, and I come off as uninterested.

&amp;#x200B;

I open up about my feelings, struggles and passions, and I'll be too sensitive and an emotional wreck.

I try to tone it down, and suddenly I'm someone who's cold and can't talk about feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm not using OLD, how should I expect meeting someone?

But when I use OLD I just come off as desperate and that's unattractive.

I should try and focus more on myself, carrier, gym, hobbies.

Well now I'm apparently way too self-absorbed and need to make room for a partner.

This has been going on for 14 years. More than a decade of not holding hands, no hugs, no kiss, no date, no flirting or late night talks.

I'm not ""forever alone"" because I did have two relationships in my late teens.

I can't even relate to that person I was back then, matter of fact I don't like that guy. I'm sure if I asked my past partners, they wouldn't think much of it because we were young and stupid, but I would want to apologize to them for my behavior back then and lack of self-awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 years ago, I became deeply depressed because of my situation. It was like from one day to the next it flipped like a switch. There wasn't a day I didn't think about suicide. The depression lasted for about 1-2 years. I never tried to take my own life, and I'm very happy I didn't, because the suicidal thoughts eventually faded away. I started jogging in the forest, which helped immensely with those thoughts.

I'm thankful every day that goes by that don't have those struggles anymore, but I'm also terrified for the day the switch will flip again. Because I'm sure it will.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to an age where I have a good job that pays well, I'm in good physical health, I have a nice home. But there's a deep feeling inside me that gnaws at me and tells me I need a purpose, a partner and kids. This feeling has become my whole identity. I really want my own kids someday, but i won't. Because nothing will ever change.",lonely,A lonely person venting,2021-09-19 16:36:09

It’s always there but I’m also always so tired after everything I have to do. Maybe it’s a good opportunity to stay busy with other things too. But either way I still deep know I feel like shit.

I wish I mattered in someone’s life. 
And dating ? Have not, goes nowhere. Matched with someone I was genuinely interested in, they messaged first immediately, and we still haven’t talked.

1582,jsdfga,1632031851,1,"But in my scenario I don’t believe I have done anything to warrant the absolute torture I am going through. I dated what has turned out to be the most evil person I’ve ever encountered in my life. The story isn’t anything that hasn’t been heard before but the pure obsession and unwavering assault against my character is unlike anything I’ve seen. 

This post could be miles long but for the sake of brevity and cohesiveness. I’ll keep it short. 

I became friends with a woman who was married to a friend of mine. They hit a rough patch and I eventually had to make the choice of who I wanted to be friends with. The husband had shown no interest in continuing a friendship with me as he wanted to restart his social life entirely and he didn’t want ties to his past. I.E. me. So I continued a friendship. 

I should’ve seen some red flags in the beginning as seemingly every single person in her past had done some sort of massive trauma to her and hurt her in wildly vicious ways. But I approached it with the outlook (stupidly) that I could show what it’s like to be cared for. 

We packed up our shit after a few months of dating and moved states together. I cannot stress this enough that things IMMEDIATELY changed after we moved. She became hyper-aggressive, demeaning to me and my disability (I was in a rather horrific car accident that messed my spine up), and just being all around abusive. We would end up in arguments of which she would position herself to bump into me and fall then say “look what you did to me” as if to imply that I was abusing her. 

I begged for her to get a job for over a year. She eventually started delivering food. With one of my vehicles. But would only do that job if I rode around with her. Of which I couldn’t do because I worked 12-15 hours a day from home. I eventually gave up on her actually working so I got her hired to work with me from home. It was a challenge to get her to work at the times she needed to and I had to constantly go to bat for her with my boss to justify her poor performance. I would have to speed through my work. Then do her work for her and still pay her as if she did it herself. 

If you’re noticing my idiocy. Trust me. I’ve reflected enough to second the opinion that I did far too much. But you can fill in the gaps that essentially I did everything and more for this person. I endured a tremendous amount of abuse. Verbally and emotionally. It got so bad that at a point I held my gun in my mouth and was extremely close to ending it. As a result of her torment. 

Eventually we split. She conned me into letting her stay in my house until she found somewhere to go. This process took three months. The entire time she would go to work from 2-11. Come home. Change and leave and stay out until 4-5 a.m.  now. Whereas this wouldn’t bother me I told her that if she wanted to stay in my house we needed to share responsibilities and she was responsible for her dog. This agreement never was reciprocated and I would constantly ask her when she was coming back because I can’t take care of the house and her dog. I also couldn’t lock the house up because she didn’t have a key to the house. So for months I was forced to get up at 7 stay up until 4 the following morning then work 5-6 days a week. 

Once she moves out, things come to light. She had tinder while we were together. Had been sleeping with a coworker while we were together, etc. I let it go. Never said anything. Even told her I hope everything works out for her and she leads a happy life. Only recently have things gotten bad. She has taken it upon herself to post a completely fabricated story that puts me as a domestic abuser as well as an animal abuser. Saying I entrapped her and hit her regularly  Whereas I wouldn’t care about these claims. It won’t stop. This has been going on for months. Coworkers are starting to ask questions. I’ve lost much of the small circle I had already and I am truly truly fucking alone and I have no idea what to do or how to recover from this. 

I need someone to talk to. Just a friend. I’m having trouble finding any backing for me. And I can’t expect it since I’m a stranger in a different state.",lonely,“Victim Mentality” implies that there is a degree of guilt,2021-09-19 16:10:51

The insomnia is effecting me and now I’m just saying random stuff. I’ve met a lot of good people who commented and encouraged me here one year ago. Hence I really have best wishes for every sincere person in this sub Reddit. 

Anyway, I don’t see the existence of myself other than being a useless child of my parents whose spending their money without return. I really feel if it was not me but others be the child of them would be better. They love me without any condition, and I love them also. But still, I want to make them proud of me, if it was someone else, would that person do much better than me? Well, right now I’m just whining. Because I have good parents and a best friend and don’t need to worry about money. Just me being an asshole who hasn’t go home since 2018. And my best friend is just a bit busy recently which is part of reason why I’m here. Lol, I’m certainly not a person without luck and sometimes I feel I’m the luckiest person of all. I’m not even depressed that much anymore. 

There is one book called do androids dream of electric sheep, I haven’t read the book but I really like the title. Do androids dream of electric sheep, do they prey to cyber god also? I have asked myself a lot, why I’m so disappointing? Because I’m too lazy? But I know I should not do this, this is not the right mindset. I’m asking me, but what’s me? I cannot keep people around me and I know once I see they don’t need me or want me anymore, I run, I run to another place. 

Do androids dream of electric sheep? They certainly do not like me, dream of my pathetic whining.  I want to go home. Honestly, I can only blame myself. I will be great! And! When it comes to a woman complaining about workplace assaulting, should never never be a group of guys to determine that! F those phonies! 

Last year, some kind hearted people commented do not fear and trust me! I’m really thankful! I love you all! Every good heart people! Things will be better, one day or another!

1634,ColdWorld_inside,1632014880,1,"The world as it stands, is a lonely place for the downtrodden, a world that graces the wounded soul with the ""respite"" of drowning it in salt. A world of extremities, a world of ice and fire where the damned burns in lonely oblivions of infernos or tundras cold. The burn of a void so deep that it scars our very soul, becoming a part of the most personal side of ourselves: we begin to define ourselves by the pain, losing our very identities, our sense of time, our sense of hope. Eventually becoming nothing but the charred hellstone or obelisks of frost residing within each abyss. For those who have lost hope in the abyss, this is their fate, to be brushed over by the great whirlwind of lost time and misfortune, forever etched in history as a forsaken monument of regret, trapped between the whims of the shifting uncertainties of both past and future. 

""There is an Eastern fable, told long ago, of a traveller overtaken on a plain by an enraged beast. Escaping from the beast he gets into a dry well, but sees at the bottom of the well a dragon that has opened its jaws to swallow him. And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by the dragon, seizes a twig growing in a crack in the well and clings to it. His hands are growing weaker and he feels he will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that awaits him above or below, but still he clings on. Then he sees that two mice, a black one and a white one, go regularly round and round the stem of the twig to which he is clinging and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will snap and he will fall into the dragon's jaws. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while still hanging he looks around, sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the twig, reaches them with his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to lick the honey which formerly consoled me, but the honey no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung. I saw the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tasted sweet. I only saw the unescapable dragon and mice, and I could not tear my gaze from them. and this is not a fable but the real unanswerable truth intelligible to all. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me. No matter how often I may be told, ""You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,"" I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false. The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing -- art as I called it -- were no longer sweet to me. ""Family""... said I to myself. But my family -- wife and children -- are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death."" 
- Tolstoy, A Confession. 

Yet, I remind myself of the faith of Sisyphus, forever facing sunwards, valiantly pushing the weight of his torment into eternity. I am reminded of Christ the martyr on calvary bleeding his faith into the Earth crying: ""Father, Father, why have you forsaken me?"" Humanity has collectively and existentially suffered the same feeling of the loneliest of loneliness for thousands of years. Our pain is a part of us, we mustn't let this nihilistic burn reduce us to ash, rather, as Kierkegaard's knight of faith, accept this as a part of our humanity. This existential struggle is what makes us so uniquely human after all. We must find ourselves in a position, where we convince ourselves this abstract game of life and death, is a like a game of chess, the bet is eternity, and by merely choosing to live, you display the greatest act of defiance and faith. By resisting succumbing to the withering forest of life, you have retained your humanity and are truly defined as a free spirit. 

""Faith is the strength of life. If a man lives he believes in something. If he did not believe that one must live for something, he would not live. If he does not see and recognize the illusory nature of the finite, he believes in the finite; if he understands the illusory nature of the finite, he must believe in the infinite. Without faith he cannot live.""

1635,AnxiousArmadillo123,1632014850,1,"So, my 22nd birthday is coming up this week. Besides my 20th birthday which consisted of being raped and then dumped in the same weekend (you could imagine my state of mind when my friends tried to take me to a Japanese restaurant on my birthday), I have always been so excited for my birthday. It made me feel important for a day and I used to crave attention. I'm not that person anymore. I have been treated so poorly over and over by people that I have learned to expect nothing. 

Anyway, the point is. I just turned off my snapchat birthday notification, so it'll be interesting to see who actually remembers. I know I won't get any sort of surprises or presents. Which is a little sad when I think about. I don't even get presents from my family, not to mention friends. I'm not a materialistic person but if someone sent me a hand-written card or handed me a rock, I would be so happy. Especially since throughout the year I make my friends little gifts like paintings or necklaces I make. 

I am so young and yet I am so lonely. There are only a handful of people who are real friends and the only reason I am still here is because of my mom. I hate feeling like I don't have that one person to turn to, that one person who would put me before anyone else. I am dreading my birthday.

Anytime I go on a date, I have overwhelming anxiety about how this is just the next step towards her leaving my life for good. And if a date ever asks questions about past relationships, I still feel like crying about it, which obviously isn't a good look. 

I just wish someone understood, how you can still love someone but not be with them anymore. 

I think breaking up with her really shattered me, as I feel unfit or unready to begin something brand new. 

Going from having someone who genuinely cares about you and talks to you everyday to having a few casual friends has been so hard. And I feel so empty.. as if a part of me is dead. I didn't expect it would last this long, but I know keeping any connection with her would make that harder in the long run.

I’ve tried talking to girls but I feel like there’s always another guy that’s not me that she’s interested in. And even if I got lucky and got a girl to do something with me, she’d still have another option that’s taller and more handsome.

So...my favourite hobby is roleplaying and I really enjoyed to do it on discord servers to cope with the unfortunate death of my gf (well now ex-gf, I guess). It helped me to be a part of someones story again, to feel useful and accepted. However, things changed and people just blocked me during the story and or ignored my requests. I also noticed the amount of male requests in comparison to female requests. The male ones were wayyy more and didn't achieve any attention as well, because they kept getting resent four-five times a day. It was just easier a few years ago..you could sent an idea and a few people would hop into your dms and be happy to participate in the roleplay, but now it seems like, as if the females would choose the guys they like and just ghost/block the ones they don't like. (At least, I think so, because 8 roleplays ended, due to the female partner blocking me) Maybe I am doing something wrong by only waiting and not being active in the chats? I don't know really. Someone else also told me, that maybe they were crepped out, but this didn't add up for me. Is a ""Hello! I came here, because of the roleplay offer. May I be a part of it?"" good enough to deserve a block? Anyways. Sorry for the long text. I didn't mean to waste your time.

I'm pretty embarassed to admit that throughout the entirety of high school that I acted like an incel. I always whined that girls don't like me because I'm short or because I'm mixed race or because I'm introverted, and that girl's only like assholes. The reality of that matter is that I virtually never talked to girls at all, I was just making shit up in my head. I was pretty fucking naive at the time, just thinking that a girl would randomly fall in love with me, because I was too lazy (and probably too scared) to make the effort to talk to a girl. My appearance didn't help either, on average I slept for 4 hours, so I'd have massive dark eyebags, I had long flat hair that I never combed and most importantly I have a resting bitch face, which were all factors that made me hard to approach. I'm also 5'7 (5'5 during freshman year, 5'6 in sophmore and junior year) which while is short, isn't dwarf level. There were actually times where a girl would try to talk to me genuinely, but I'd usually end the conversation because I assumed they were just pitying me. Even though they obviously weren't attracted to me, I wished I actually did try to talk back because not only would I be overcome my fears, but I'd also learn that girls aren't some sort of alien species

My personality and inability to talk didn't only affect me when it came to talking with girls but also with with making friends. When I moved schools, I expected people to come up to me and just be friends with me. Obviously that never happened, and slowly I just started to assume that everyone in my grade to be an asshole.

LOL. The person I love doesnt love me. The person I dont have any feelings for is still chasing me.

This is why i keep being single.

My name is Hang, I am Vietnamese, Im 24 years old and usually Im the younger one when getting to know someone but yesterday, when I talked to a man who wanted to know me, he said he was 20 years old and I realized I am getting old lol.

Thats why Im here lol.

Im a very normal girl. I have just had 2 years of trying to figure out what I wanna do in life . I graduated with a degree in teaching but I hate it so I have been struggling a lot after graduation.

Then I taught myself translation and now it is becoming my career and at least its something Im proud of. Yea my life is starting to have good signals...and along this way, i feel i need someone.

I used to spend a lot of time on Japanese in college, however, I met a cheesy boss so I fking quitted it, which was one of the dumbest decisions of my life lol

But its okay, Im starting all over again. Im planning to study it again after 3 years. I used to have a huge passion for it, so I believe I will make it!

For my relationship history, I ha 3 exes. I dont know if I should call them bf coz the relationship didnt last for too long. The longest one lasted 3 months and the shortest lasted 15 days.

Bf number 1: We broke up coz both were too childish.

Bf number 2: My depression told me to break up with him and we couldnt get back together after all I said to him.

Bf number 3: I was stupid and trusted him too much lol.

About me:

1. a hopeless romantic
2. hiking and swimming are my hobbies
3. Love learning new languages
4. Love jackfruits. So please give me a lot of jackfruits if we r together

What I expect:

1. a kind and loving guy
2. Loyal
3. From 24-35
4. Seriously looking for someone

Anyone interested, please P.M me.!",lonely,Hello....!!!!Im looking for someone!,2021-09-19 00:57:17
1723,codecrunchie,1631975391,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

1724,IngenuityInternal935,1631972544,1,"When you were a little child in elementary school or even before, you could go to someone who you liked maybe with a gift or anything to be kind to them. You thought ""such a cute boy/girl, I want to talk to him/her"". People had no pressure on you, you just tried to get close to them because you found them attractive.

But now you know people have extreme standards and you can imagine what is proper for the community and what is not. You are afraid of talking to someone and getting close to them because the first thing your mind says ""I'm not enough for him/her"". But it was natural to try to be with them when you were a kid because you couldn't imagine you can be not enough.

In reality, it doesn't matter how insecure someone is and what kind of life they have, they got ridiculous standards. You have to be afraid of losing someone and even just talking to someone because that's the difference between kids and adults: kids can't imagine how others can behave because they think everyone is like them.",lonely,Interesting how things change,2021-09-18 23:42:24

I was working up the courage to do something when one day her and my bestfriend reveal that they have been dating for about a year. They never put together that that was why I became oppossed to hanging out with them in school too frequently.

It's been eating me up inside a lot this year, what with all the lockdowns. I moved out of my childhood home at the beginning of this year and haven't kept in contact with anyone from high school other than the bestfriend. Next year i go back to the university that both of them go to. They broke up the beginning of 2020 (year after highschool). I've never told him (bestfriend) or her (crush) and I've been debating whether or not to tell her if I see her next year.

I’m officially 30 in two days.

So please let me vent.

My idealistic, college self had this vision of being at the pinnacle of life once I hit 30. Being married, having a tiny home of my own, owning  a small car, having my emergency funds, traveling to a different country or two and reveling in a job that I love the most.

Guess what? None of them happened. I’ve been anxious over the past few months over the idea that I’m turning 30 when in fact I’ve never sorted my life out.

Up to this day, I still am trying to figure out what to do for me to reach those dreams, it’s as if progress and my existence do not seem to mesh well. I feel like I’m stuck in my after-grad, 20 year old self who’s still lost and does not know how to maneuver her place in the world.

Everyday’s a constant struggle and that I’m just making both ends meet. I’ve been working hard enough trying to balance my teaching job and my master’s degree and the nitty gritties of life. I definitely made bad choices back then which created a nasty domino effect that gave me self-doubt and has affected my self-esteem.

Does anyone feel the same way? Are you by chance experiencing the same life crisis?

I know we shouldn’t compare other’s success with ours as we have varying timelines and pace. Despite everything, I’m still grateful that I can still eat three times a day and still have a job albeit earning a crust in this pandemic.

To anyone who’s on the same boat as I am who feels so inadequate and barely gives credit to himself/herself, cheer up!

Maybe 30 is a jumpstart to a better lifestyle and a kickstart to healthier choices. Maybe 30 is the right time to step on the pedal and bike one’s way to the route of success. Maybe 30 will help us rethink about those failures and reshape them in such a way that they become our motivations to excel.

Maybe 30 isn’t so bad after all. :)",lonely,"Almost thirty, anxious and sentimental.",2021-09-18 21:56:48

I never find anyone who lives near me that I connect with or like, im a romantic at heart a serious official relationship is something I desire more than anything but I feel it wont ever happen for me, especially because I wont go with just anyone for the sake of being with someone it needs to be someone I truly like and feel comfortable with, as well as find attractive my interests are non mainstream so its hard to find similar people to me, im into things like 70s and 80s rock, glam rock especially, the goth subculture, doll collecting and other strange things, the few guys around here who are into the same stuff as me either are married or in relationships already or turned out to be bad people. so I feel pretty hopeless most of the time.",lonely,I turned 22 and still never been on a date,2021-09-18 17:56:40

22...... I should be out partying with friends, or at least having a few drinks. Like everyone else this age does (whether it’s their birthday or not). I should be meeting girls; not stewing in my own loneliness for half a decade. I can’t lie to myself anymore now, it’s solid proof of what a fucking loser I am and it makes me want to end it.  
  
When you’re losing in a game and you’ve got no chance of getting back on track, you hit the “restart” button. Or you quit the game. You don’t live out your failure for decades and decades. I’m done now. I can’t see light at the end of the tunnel, it’s at the end of a rope, or the bottom of a very large building. Or in the barrel of a shotgun. I haven’t decided yet, but it’s time to accept things aren’t getting better for me. They’ll get worse and worse and worse, like they have done consistently for the past decade or so of “waiting for better days”. Yeah, it’ll get better, sure. But only when I’m completely removed from the equation.   
  
All I can think about is dying. It’s like a chant in my head..... death, death, death, death, death, death   
And sometimes even out loud I say it to myself.  
“I just want to die, I just want to die, I just want to die”.  
  
I don’t want to die, it’s not my preference. I want things to get better. But after waiting so long and making so many positive changes, i don’t see it happening.
  
I would rather die right now than have to live out the rest of my lonely life feeling this touch-starved, unwanted, inadequate, and disappointed. Everyone I see has someone.... I hate myself for hating them for being happy.  
  
It means nothing to them. They take it for granted. It’s like eating, sleeping, love. How the fuck is it so easy for them?

I've had a really rough childhood. I was bullied  at school, and ignored at home so I've never known what it feels like to matter.

I'm 22 years old now, a lot has happened and I still feel like an outsider. Everyone thinks I'm odd, and nobody ever wants to invest any time into me.

Why do I have to be so different from everyone else? I've yet to find someone I can really get along with, and it's exhausting living day after day trying to slog through life alone. 

I've had multiple people throughout myself tell me how annoying I am, how weird I am, tell me that nobody likes me, ""this is why you don't have any friends"", etc.  But nobody has ever told me anything good about me other than maybe that I'm ""nice"" or ""funny"". 

I'm nobody to everybody, and I want to feel special and like I matter, but nobody cares. 

And the responsibility to somehow change this lies with me, I'm supposed to somehow get other people to care about me, which obviously I can't do because it's not my choice whether or not someone else deems me important or valuable.

I just don't understand why nobody cares. I wish I could meet someone in my life that wasn't the polar opposite of me, or someone that could understand how I feel, or at the very least someone that would treat me like I'm valuable as a person.

I'm different then everyone else though, I'm too uptight for everyone else, and Since I have a strong moral compass nobody wants to be around me because I'll call them out on their hypocrisy, or encourage them to fix bad habits.

About myself: I'm an accounting student from Michigan, and I go to a pretty big school but I spend all my free time in the library 🤓. If you're also a student, please let me know how school has been going for you so far. Also, what are your ambitions and career goals? 


As for my interests: I enjoy  fantasy books, creative writing, anime, manga, comics, cartoons, metal music, true crime, mma,  PC gaming, and just about everything else that has ever been considered 'nerdy'. I'm gonna start working out at the gym consistently so a fitness buddy would be great as well.

Hell, even if we don't have much in common, feel free to dm me as long as you aren't a dry texter and you'll attempt to keep a conversation going.

Let me know how you're feeling, what you're interested in, your age, where you're from etc. This post might read a little sad but honestly feeling terrible at the moment, I can be kinda funny and energetic if we click haha. Mostly on discord but I do have an instagram!",lonely,[19M] if we have common interests I'd love to be friends,2021-09-18 13:14:59

I found today extremely mentally taxing other than a small tattoo I got, I had dinner with my grandparents, mother, brothers and my spouse. It was hell..like I do love my brothers but they are all old enough where they should know the basics of birthday or general eating in someone else’s house etiquette, other than my sweet brother who well call X (due to developmental issues.) The middle child who well call Z was being an absolute NIGHTMARE, and I don’t mean oh being fussy or whatever..no Z is about 13 and he was flipping X off over the table the whole time as well as antagonizing him in many other ways. This lead to X obviously getting upset (keep in mind he’s very sweet but he can’t stop himself from being wound up and a bit more upset/excited than most),then Z decided to pull X’ phone from him and run up and around the house for the next two hours. My eldest brother (well call him R, also sorry large family) tried to diffuse the fight multiple times as my mother would try and get flipped off or told of by Z, at this point everyone is yell over the screaming/playing of my two youngest brothers and I just have no idea what to do other than ask them to stop or they’ll loose desert. X’ honestly tries to remain calm for the rest of dinner but every time that Z would get up he’d bother X just to see (I hate to use the term but my apologies) “the spaz freak.”
This basically went one until they left and I felt horrible for my grandmother and grandfather who were basically begging for them to just behave for even A single photo of all of us together, since I moved out honestly we haven’t seen each other as often as we should… I’m back home and basically just reflecting on how this probably torn my grandparents heart and also put more strain on their health issues.
I also had no one come over after to celebrate (lift my spirits a bit) unfortunately because it’s too late, I want to have people over before I started my work week but the good ol morning shift hits me Tmr..and don’t get to see anyone as much with work (we try our best to hang out in between work) it’s honestly taking a toll on me and I’m not suicidal at all but just not looking forward to the rest of my 20’s I guess.",lonely,Happy 20th to me…,2021-09-18 12:00:00

Meanwhile, I’ve found my passion ( cinema ), i’m watching tons of movies, analyzing them and writing my own screenplays. But I feel empty. Guys at my age live their life, they have girlfriends, or at least girl friends, friends in general, have fun.

While I usually go to the cinema alone. I do everything alone. I like taking a walk usually, but I just see couples or cute girls ( i don’t have an high self esteem, so i feel sad every time i see a girl i think is cute ).

Literally a month before she got proposed to she came to my apartment crying. And I listened to her and gave her the best advice I could. But after she got her ring which is what she wanted I didn’t matter anymore. I came to this realization that I was only important when she needed to talk about what was bothering her, granted I’ll always support her no matter what because that’s what one does when they truly love someone. But I was just a blow. This was someone that would sit in front of me and tell me it bothered her that I didn’t open up and that I was reserved. I told her I was introverted because the few times I did open up I realized people just used me and left my life out of no where and she said she would never do that. And that’s what she did. 

And not I realize that i don’t have friends and it really sucks. Sometimes I hate myself because  im too sensitive and I can’t just brush things off. But this made me realize how alone I was. And I just wonder if I’ll ever find someone that honestly genuinely cares about my heart and me and im not just seen as a tool they need for the one being and is put away when it’s no use for them anymore.",lonely,So I realized I have no friends.,2021-09-18 04:29:04

I'm a 24 year old guy, average looking, though a bit on the chubby side. Not particularly happy about my life, haven't experienced much affection in it and never been in a relationship, for the most part because I'm shy and introverted, have absolutely shitty self-esteem and I'm afraid - but not sure of what exactly. I get nervous around someone I have a crush on, and I rarely feel like I have something meaningful to say. The fact that I'm not a particularly interesting person to begin with certainly does not help my case - I mostly stay at home playing piano, reading or gaming. This in turn causes their interest to quickly fizzle out, we eventually stop talking, I start wallowing in sadness as my depression strengthens again - a rejection without even explicitly being rejected. 

This happened a few times to me already, the latest as recently as a week ago. I started talking to a girl from work who seemed to be into similar things as me, it initially was very nice and I - though usually doubtful about everything positive or successful - was almost certain I was seeing some signals, as she was smiling at me, initiating conversation first despite not being much of an extrovert herself, and so on. But despite my thoughts that this might be ""finally it"" and thinking about building up the courage to ask her out (I was already dropping some indirect hints about going to see a movie sometime), the same old thing happened - distance between us started building out from seemingly thin air, we were talking less and less, and now we haven't exchanged a word since a week. What is wrong with me, that everyone I like keeps turning away from me? I just want to be happy.

1873,RaxsGM,1631891973,1,"Hello, 

I am a 20 year old guy from norway. Yesterday evening I was struck with spontaneous and random calling to die. I was not so much wanting to die, but it felt right - like a soothing voice telling me my time was up, like a fitting end to a semi boring movie. For a solid hour I was convinced I was going to take my own life, so I got started writing my will. My fight and flight was in full swing, heart was pumping and i was hyper ventilating - yet I somewhat felt calm. I cried, mostly due to the guilt of thinking about my mom - who is already struggling. It was the first time I've felt an extreme emotion since I was like 7.

The will included the exact price of an alpha romeo spider for my mom, as I promised I'd buy one for her one day. The rest of my belongings were going to go to my 15 yr old step brother.

 I also wanted to give him a document of things I've learned that would be important to him - like investment plans, budgeting, easy portfolio diversification through ETF's, compound investing, property management, a mental health guide(although would prob be a shit one haha) and everything I never got to say to him as an absent brother. 

Well a good portion into the document the feeling disappeared, and I went back to my dull feeling self. I never had suicidal thoughts, and this really caught me by surprise. If I had a will and goodbye doc ready to go, I might have done something really stupid. 

I heard most suicidal ppl have quite frequent thoughts about it. So I'm wondering anyone else had this out of the blue blues. 

Thank you for reading if you came this far, apprieciate your time &lt;3

Only thing left is to make sure you paid your electric bill. So you grab your most recent statement and realize that you haven't been able to pay the electric bill in months and you just have no more energy yourself to do the work necessary to pay this bill.

I've KNOWN the I was lonely, but I didn't realize the severity of it until I just looked up a ""symptoms of loneness"" article online and they say a symptom is taking hot showers and baths ""more than might be considered reasonable"". I do that all time time. Sometimes several a day. I'll take two baths in a day, easily, and stay in for an hour at a time.

It's frustrating and getting more frustrating. People who know me say I'm attractive. They say I'm funny. They say I'm charismatic and ""cool"".

Whenever they're feeling down, they have people by their side who help them, and they get through whatever life may throw at them. Whenever they're happy, they have people who celebrate alongside them and hug them afterwards. They never really feel lonely or hopeless at all. They have comfortable lives where everything seems to make sense. They have deep bonds with longtime friends and family, they have people they can just talk with for hours, people who understand them and would never leave them or hurt them. They have people they can trust and who they feel comfortable around. They don't cry out of sadness, and when they do the sadness is only very temporary and they have people right next to them who want them to feel better. They all have futures to look forward to, they have hopes and dreams and things to look forward to that make life worth it for them. Their lives are so full of love and happiness that they don't know what it's like to not feel that way, it's just unimaginable for them. 

They can't imagine feeling all alone. They can't imagine feeling that no other person like yourself in this vast world ever really thinks about you at all, except as a passing stranger quickly forgotten. It's impossible for them to imagine feeling all alone in your loneliness, and feeling completely and utterly alone and being paralyzed by that feeling. The feeling of hopeless loneliness that never seems to go away. The feeling of being out of place and all alone when everybody else seems to have everything figured out. The way that being lonely makes everything seem so bland and pointless. The thought that your inability to connect with others in any way will prevent you from ever feeling loved by another person, and that you will die never having felt whatever love is. The numbness that loneliness makes you feel all the time. The subtle feeling that you just don't belong in this world.

1918,SlavishConduct,1631856505,1,"So I recently made this account a month-ish ago because I was feeling down, and I’d thought the best way for me to cope a little is to write what’s on my mind. That and pornography purposes but that’s besides the point. I’ve been battling a small amount of depression that I’ve had over the last 4 years. For the most part I’ve managed it very well, and other then my parents who aren’t the brightest in the topic of mental health, I’ve kept it a secret for so long, and it’s both making me feel good, while also tearing me little by little. Luckily (or unluckily from a different perspective because it sort of tears me not to be able to talk to anyone about it) I’ve been able to keep strong at it, and even tho I did consider suicide once, I’m in a good spot at the moment. The reason I’m posting right now is with the issue on how lonely I’m feeling. I’m not talking relationship wise. Even though I crave one, I am not as happy with a girlfriend then with the boys (even though I’ve never had a girlfriend). 

Despite having plenty of friends, some of which I have daily contact with. I feel very lonely. I think it is because I have very few friends at school. School takes up most of my time not just from being physically in it, but also from homework. I just feel like I have no friends in that school, when I actually do, but very few. It’s never gotten to the point where I’m starting to feel my head hurt just thinking about going to school because I feel so lonely. And it’s also been affecting my performance there too. Im not much of an introvert, but I’ve had this anxiety of making friends in that school. Ik a lot of this kids there are truly good people, but I’m always paranoid that if I try to make friends, I’m going to make friends with the wrong person. Not only that, but I am pretty bad at making friends in the first place if they aren’t a friend of my friend. I don’t know what to do and it feels like I’m stuck in this endless cycle of loneliness at school. I’d thought this subreddit would be a good spot to get this off of my chest.

I often keep to myself and don't talk to my female co-workers though, we just don't have anything relatable but I'm not hostile towards any of them. I don't really talk to anyone at work, I just do my job so I come off as pretty quiet.

They often do things to mess with me and it makes me very uncomfortable. I remember one day one of my female co-workers came up to me and randomly asked me for my shoe size. I just thought, ""wow, what a weird question"" but I answered honestly and she laughed and said, ""boys like you always have the big shoes"". I realized what happened and got really upset and embarrassed. Even today, I walked into work and I heard two of my co-workers talk about me as I passed through. They did the middle school thing of ""oooh you two should date, I see how you look at each other"" and the other one replied ""ew no, that's so gross"". I know I normally shouldn't care what other people say about me but for some reason it really got to me. My first hour there, I was choking back tears. I hate the idea of being messed with and this isn't the first time I've heard other women joke about dating me in that way. And if it's not the co-workers, it's other customers even. I have a birth mark on my neck and at first glance, it kinda looks like a hickey so some customers laugh about it or make some lame joke and it makes me very uncomfortable. When stuff like that happens, I don't even try to do the nervous laugh or play along, I just try to pretend nothing happened and move along with work.

I tried telling one of my female friends about what happened and they basically told me I have to stand up and vocalize that I'm uncomfortable because they probably think they're complimenting me. This person is a huge feminist btw so I actually couldn't believe that shit they said to me. What is the compliment in asking me for my shoe size? Or talking about my birthmark? I felt so defeated and straight up depressed. I tried talking with another female friend about everything including how ridiculous my friends response was. They told me they really might just be trying to compliment me and I said the same thing I said earlier, ""what is the compliment in asking for me shoe size"" and she replied with, ""maybe it's just bad small talk"".

I'm trying to keep it together but I don't know what to do. At first, I didn't think what happened to me was sexual harassment but after reading their responses, it reads exactly like what not to say to someone that's being sexually harassed funny enough. Now I'm sat here trying to wonder if what happens to me is supposed to be normal.

2013,throwawayblue900ss,1631791205,1,"TL;DR:  I haven't been touched in 5 years, am unwanted and rejected, despite my  best efforts. I think I may die alone and never know what love is, in  spite of my efforts.

This is long,  but I have to write this as a form of catharsis because I have no one I  can talk to. I have no ""stupid ideas"", so we are clear. However, other  than self-preservation instincts, there is no point in living without a  person in my life to love, romantically. This, dear reader, is not  living, but merely existing. I find my terror, a terror I actively  experience, in a life not fully lived. I only exist.

As  a man, I cannot show any weakness, any doubt, or I dig a deeper hole  for myself. This is my direct experience, and man is nothing, if not a  product of his experience.

You  would never guess I were in a ""...life of quiet desperation..."" if we  met and had a coffee. I seem to have it together, the perpetual  bachelor, living alone. Accountable to no one but himself. No one can  order me around. I see something I like, I buy it. I have a fleet of  very nice vehicles. Then, what seems to be the problem?

I  have been alone for so long, even in a crowd, I am disconnected, set  apart. I can never be myself, though I have tried. When I try, people  distance themselves from me, as if I am a caustic agent.

I  have no support net, no family, no friends, just acquaintances. Once my  mother told me ""I wish I never gave birth to you!"", the bridge of my  family was burned forever.

I have  not had my name spoken to me with fondness, with love, with care, for a  decade or more. I have never been an object of desire, a man to enrich a  woman's life. I have only been used or rejected. I have been used as a  flesh dildo and thrown away. I have only had two girlfriends in my life.  I do not orbit or chase after women. I consider this beneath me. If a  woman is interested, I give back that interest, that flirting. I do not,  as a rule heavily escalate, especially in today's climate of  accusations.

In this, I know, I am  not alone. I am sure, many of you, dear readers, know this emptiness,  this internal chasm. Something is missing inside of me. The echo of  silence is all I hear even when I am spoken to.

I  speak to girls, devour all I can about body language, inference,  nuance, subtlety in discourse. I am dynamic in conversation with a quick  wit, decent comedic timing...but it is not enough. I am not nervous, I  am relaxed and genuinely I'm enjoying myself.

She  is giving me positive eye contact, she is laughing at my jokes. Her  body language is open, kind. Yes, I am making a connection. My heart  races, my soul soars, I am feeling human. I can get to know who she is  as a person, to learn about her. This is great. Then, I am avoided.

Well,  princess, I apologize I am not Henry Cavill or Chris Hemsworth. To  spare her discomfort, I stay far away after my failure to read her. In  one case, I noticed we were passing each-other, and her body language  became guarded, so I didn't make eye contact, and just walked by. Don't  worry, I wasn't going to say anything to you. I know girls get  approached all the time, and ""guarded"" is the default setting. I get it.  Really, I get it. Another time, I totally ignored her open body  language, and walked by her, gave her no eye contact. Treat me as a  non-person, I give what I get.

I  know when I am not wanted. I am never wanted. I am frustrated with the  situation, not a woman's lack of attraction. She, nor I, can change our  attraction. It cannot be negotiated. I get this, also. She is liking  what she sees, what she hears, my pheromones, or, she doesn't.

Perhaps  she is only serial flirting for attention and validation? Perhaps being  friendly? Perhaps a bit of both? Perhaps the Reddit alien is modeled  after me?

Ironically, girls look  at me when I enter a room and I don't know why. I'm not handsome. I am  not ugly, yet I catch them looking at me, fairly often. I catch them  preening when I walk by, or into a room. I notice more things than I  once did. Now, I see the unspoken things our bodies are saying...but  they don't square with my lack of success.

I  have ""very pretty blue eyes"", I get told...yet I'm alone. All the cues,  all the alleged tells are there. I get a lot of eye contact and smiles,  yet I am nowhere.

Yes, I am  well-groomed. Yes, I am tall. Since growing long hair and a beard, I get  much more attention from women. Do they think I am some sort of  musician or something? I got less interest when I was Corporate Clean  Cut Salary Man #7,678 in my city.

I  have changed my appearance and my style, hoping something will strike a  key, what all men want to hear said about them: ""Wow! He's hot!""

In  interactions, I wear my psychological mask when I speak to you,  pretending to be the extrovert, the life of the party. Who you want me  to be, Mr. Accepted, Mr. Gregarious. I smile my big bright smile, my  eyes also smile. I'm not a ""close talker"", or too loud. I listen to what  you say before I respond to you. I maintain eye contact---but no too  much. I gesticulate with my hands to show I am alive, I am enthusiastic,  I am multi-dimensional. I am unguarded, open, naked. I bare myself and  try to be genuine. I fake extroversion, which is not genuine, because  being who I am is even worse. I am a man concerned with results. I am  not looking to get laid. I want love. I want intimacy. I want you to say  my name to me.

I want to  celebrate birthdays. I want orgasm with someone I love. I want thousands  of kisses and hugs over a lifetime spent together. I want the warm  embrace of being nude with my loving wife as I drift into the black  night of unconsciousness until sunrise.

I  want to create life and watch it grow inside of my wife. I want to  teach my children and leave an inheritance of nice motorcycles, classic  cars, a house, etc. I want to provide for those I care for.

I want to be a loving father and husband.

Every  day I wake up to work, and I have never been better financially in my  life. I am very comfortable with no debt, and my assets continue to  grow. Though, if I cannot share it with someone I love, someone I care  for, who care for me in kind, all I can do is spoil myself.

...and  I do. I indulge to the full self-improvement cult so popular and my  hobbies (motorcycles, firearms, running, etc.). After a while, this gets  stale. The money, the security is nice, but how many things can I buy?  Money does not buy happiness, or contentment. It just makes things less  stressful. I want a family. I want to fall in love, get married and  start a family, leave something behind other than ""me, me me!!!""

Just  giving to myself is like looking at myself in the mirror naked and  masturbating at my reflection. It is only concerned with incestuous  self-satisfaction. It disgusts me to live this way. It disgusts me that  this yoke, this burden I carry that no one but you all know about,  crushes me. I am holding back a dam of emotion, of love I want to give.  It is not all about me being loved---I want to give my love, my  affection. I want to share, to give orgasms, not just live for me, me,  me.

I want to be kissed, touched, acknowledged. Acknowledge me!

I  have a full cup I need to pour, but it cannot be tipped, I cannot spill  any emotions, or they will see and judge me. Again, no one can know, or  accept what I have disclosed here. I'm not a human. I am just electrons  on your screen right now.

So, I  carry this burden, day in, day out, as the seasons change, as I age, and  I see I will die alone, unloved, unremembered. If I got cancer, no one  would help me through treatment, or visit me. If I lost this battle, I  would be be thrown away. My birthdays go unobserved. Valentine's Day is  the worst.

What is the point living on my own planet? Being my own island? What misery this is!

I  have not been physically touched for at least 5 years. I crave warmth, I  crave touch, intimacy. I would trade everything I have accumulated  right now, to hold a warm human hand belonging to a good woman who  genuinely looks in my eyes with love, with desire, with contentment.  God, how I miss just the simplest of pleasures, holding hands.

I  can never tell anyone. No one I know can ever know I feel this way. It  would destroy what pathetic life I have. More than anyone, none of the  girls I know, can know. No woman I have ever known, can face these  statements and not be disgusted with me. Don't judge me, because you  haven't walked in my shoes. Or, judge me. It doesn't matter either way.

I have to be strong. I wish to be.

I have to be brave. I wish to be.

I have to be untouchable. I wish to be.

I have to be a great man. I wish to be.

Before  I die, I want to hear ""I love you."", ""You make a difference in my  life."", ""I believe in you."", ""You are the love of my life."" ""You are a  great husband."", ""You are a great father."" spoken to me. Then, I will  know my life was not wasted, and my mother was wrong about her son.

If  desire were enough, I would have what I wanted already. Sometimes, a  mathematical equation has no solution. This is where I am now.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope I helped someone today. I wish all of you love, just as I selfishly wish it for myself.

2015,WorkingOnANovelOrTwo,1631790886,1,"Being lonely isn’t automatic when you’re alone. It’s an emotional response to it. For most people, it’s probably a ‘normal’ response. 

It’s the default. But it doesn’t have to be YOUR default. 

Let’s face it: People are shit to be around. They’re hurtful for their own amusement, they’re self centred, ego- driven narcissistic assholes. 

Better to be alone and avoid most people as much as you can. 

Alone is not only a choice, it’s a damned good one. 

It’s freedom. Freedom to be truly yourself in a way you never can around other people. Freedom to do exactly what you want to do, when you want to do it. Freedom from the expectations of others and freedom from being let down over and over again. 

It’s freedom from being fucked over.

2016,Pretend-Ad-1186,1631789708,1,"I joined this sub-reddit about a week ago, acknowledging that one of the main triggers I have for an addiction I've been fighting to overcome is loneliness. As I said in my last post I've been reading-up on loneliness to try-out some techniques.

One thing I read was that loneliness can almost always lead to depression if it's not dealt with. And having previously experienced depression, loneliness aside, I wouldn't wish it upon anyone either.

A lot of the posts in this group do seem to be an outlet for self-expression, frustration even, but also I wonder if depression might also be apparent in a lot of the posts? I'm not here to judge. Just making an observation.

So I've been stuck due to lockdown and other factors, not been able to get out much since about March 2020. I did start trying some of the techniques online though. One is to lower expectations and keep an open mind. So don't enter a potential scenario expecting necessarily to get a friendship out of it immediately, and don't be dejected if you don't. Keep an open mind, acknowledge it's not always going to happen, and keep trying new situations anyway, keeping an open mind and knowing that a friendship may or may not result. Through this I've started to establish online connection in a very helpful way, so just sharing that.

All the best moving forward, everyone!",lonely,One week after joining this group...,2021-09-16 20:55:08

2048,LopsidedOriginal6736,1631763660,1,"I guess I should give you guys some background context before I spill out 6+ years of emotional soup

Personality type: INFJ

1.  Right, I was an accidental pregnancy...It's alright I've made peace with it but still... My parents are divorced and I never liked my father. NOT BECAUSE OF THE DIVORCE, he's just annoying in the sense he invades personal space and keeps PUSHING me...I'm not sure actually. Originally I liked him but then we just kinda fell apart because my sister and mom kept talking trash about him and I'm glad for the divorce because if it didn't happen I'd have two unhappy parents which would fuck me up even more inside.

2. I have social issues, IDK why but I find it so annoying when people can't catch up, and in ik that it is considered insensitive and arrogant but it's true and I'm not trying to offend anyone on purpose I'm just tired of people who slow me down! I have many (fake) friends who use me for homework and popularity. I'm not popular but I'm popular enough for my grade to know my name. I have one close friend but we haven't been gelling for the past few days.

3. My sister is going to college. Me and my sister were actually close and now she's gone quite literally because she's in victoria, Canada and I'm in Delhi, India. Before she was supposed to go to the airport I made a ""open me when"" card for her and I forgot to give it to her. I'm so stupid how can I forget to give a CARD. and the worst part is that when we couriered it, it never arrived to her... It's lost and I'm not able to forgive myself for it.

4. I'm fat. No, I'm not a skinny girl who thinks she's fat, I'm actually fat. I'm 5'0 ft at the age of 12 and weigh fucking 58 kg. I'm trying to exercise but it's just hard, It's getter better but I have a crippling self-image.  


So yep, that's just the bottom base of my mental health issues. I'll be making several other posts venting about incidents when life fucked me up or just sucked. Also I'm scared, my mom is a psychologist (ironic ik) but I don't want to share this stuff with her since she's already super stressed with financial issues.",lonely,"Hi, I'm new here...",2021-09-16 13:41:00
2049,Lonely_Arsenal,1631763628,1,"I’m new to r/ so I don’t honestly know much at all about how this works. I don’t know if I’m going to be offensive or if I’ll be weird or if I’ll just be boring. 

No clue. 

I’m not doing well right now. I am alone and I am lonely. I haven’t been in a romantic relationship for three years now, much less a sexual one. So that’s lacking. Yet, what they say is absolutely true: you won’t die if you don’t have sex. 

I’m in my late forties. I’m not ugly at all, though I have let myself go over time and I’m embarrassed about myself physically right now. Gonna get on that. I could do with losing about 7-10 pounds. I’m 6’1. Not that any of this really matters. Does it? 

No. 

All I would like is to chat with someone who is as lonely as I am. I’ve never been comfortable around people, though I did have to be very outgoing when I was in the Army, due to my job. Something I will maybe get into. 

I believe that I have completely forgotten how to socialize. I have severe social anxiety; probably some issues with avoidant personality disorder; and other things. 

Just would very much like to talk to another human being sometimes. I’m in no shape or in any way right now capable of relationship anything. Just want a chat buddy. Preferably with a woman, though I’m not opposed to chatting with anyone else. 

I have no idea how to initiate or receive DMs, how to check for them, etc., if I even get any. 

Not ever gonna hold my breath. Rejection is the normal.

2051,No-Arrival-7380,1631762934,1,"Hi,

I recently started my first year of college and I feel a bit lost. I had a group of 6 friends in high school and we spent a lot of time together, especially this last summer. I was always an introvert and had social anxiety but I also really enjoyed having these friends and spending time with them. I have now spent my first 3 weeks pretty much alone and I'm unsure what to think of it. On one hand, it has been extremely relaxing, but I kept stop feeling like I'm missing out on the college experience. My roommate, who was one of the people from my previous friend group, is basically out all day with his new friends. He has been meeting new people every day and goes out drinking basically every day too. I feel like shit every time I see him coming into the room for a minute before leaving to hang out with more people. I feel like I want to have a similar lifestyle and enjoy college, but deep down, I know I could never enjoy a lifestyle like that due to my social anxiety and introvertness. I have been going out alone to get food, go on walks, and often work on my laptop outside instead of staying in my room. It's almost as if I'm doing what I enjoy but feel like I'm missing out still. I can't really find a way to enjoy myself. If I try to be more social I end up exhausted and not really enjoying it, while being on my own makes me think about what I'm missing out non-stop.",lonely,Unsure of what to do,2021-09-16 13:28:54
2052,Available-Duty8714,1631760838,1,"I’m a 20M about to turn 21 in two months and have not had an actual birthday celebration in years. But when I think about it, I don’t even know who I would invite. Realistically, I have 3 friends, people who I have known for a long time. 

I know i’m fortunate to at least have these people in my life, but we’re all getting older. A lot of them are moving away soon and I won’t really have anyone left. I feel like that I am literally unable to make a friend.

I have always been a shy kid, the kind to rather stay at home than go out, sit in the corner at the party I wasn’t invited to, or sit in the empty corner in class. I try to find opportunities to meet people, but I can’t go beyond the usual “Hello”, or “How are you?”. I just feel like all my friends can easily make friends and I am just unable to do so.

To add more to my shy persona, my girlfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me, causing me to close up more. To be honest, we weren’t even friends initially, we only dated because she just randomly reached out to me first. So I think of her as a lucky break.

Overall, i’m just lonely, I distract myself by studying or watching movies until I physically cannot open my eyes anymore. Just don’t know what to do.",lonely,I don’t know how to make friends.,2021-09-16 12:53:58

It seems no matter what I do, people just have no interest in talking to me or hanging out. I just feel like I’m bugging them when I do ask to hangout. I know I still got a lot of life ahead. But I doubt my high school friends will still be with me after high school is done. And as I said, I can never make friends no matter what I do. I’m not suicidal but I do think about it a lot.

2056,CaledoniaHeart91,1631756733,1,"For example, at work it was quiet and everyone started messing around. Playing volleyball with a screwed up bit of paper.

I'm new at that place and wasn't in the best head-space, struggling with mental health, so just kind of stood off to the side and was wiping up the counters etc. They were all laughing, joking, and I honestly felt like I was in a little bubble. On the outside looking in. I get it, I'm new, but that's a common feeling for me. Just on the outside. The awkward one. The quiet, shy one.

What really got to me though was, while they were all having fun (including the supervisor!), the supervisor came up to me and asked me to go wash the dishes. That made me feel like crap in a way I can't really describe. I mean, like I'm not part of their little gang because I'm new, and I'm just a spare part.

And then when I got back from doing that they all pissed off somewhere and left me entirely alone (I work at a Burger King by the way ....) and I am not till trained. Someone came up to the counter looking to order and I didn't have a clue what to do.

The whole day, the whole thing of them having fun then telling me to go do work just made me feel so angry. So alone. So awkward. I was glad when they said there's no point us all staying so they sent me home early.

But it's just like that everywhere. I can laugh at jokes, but I feel like I'm not really laughing. My smile disappears too quickly. And when I do have fun and leave, it just makes me feel even more empty because I know there's no-one there forcing me to be happy any more. 

I'm just tired of being the outsider wherever I go. And that will never change. I have no confidence. No self esteem. Nothing that tells me to just join in and dance in the rain, or have impromptu volleyball games with paper. I'm just socially awkward and I hate it.",lonely,Anyone else so tired of being left out all the time?,2021-09-16 11:45:33

I'm reaching out to communities of people who may be experiencing feelings of depression and/or anxiety and who might be interested in participating in a brief, online, self-guided intervention. This study (detailed below) uses an intervention that is based on a lengthier treatment shown to effectively reduce symptoms of a range of anxiety and depressive disorders.

\----------------------

For my doctoral dissertation, I am examining two brief online self-help interventions to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. **Anyone over the age of 18, residing in the United States, and fluent in English is welcome to participate in this online study**; however, if you are currently experiencing severe depression, especially if you are feeling hopeless or having thoughts of suicide, I encourage you to seek treatment with a provider you can interact with.

If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a few surveys and then you will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a video intervention, a text-based intervention, or an assessment-only group. The intervention should take you roughly 2 hours depending on how often you pause the video or how quickly you read. No matter which group you are in you will be asked to complete surveys at four follow-up periods after you first sign up, around 2, 4, and 6 weeks, with a final one in 6 months. These will take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. **After the 6 week follow-up**, those in the assessment-only group will have access to both the video and text interventions. **After the 6-month follow-up**, those in the intervention groups will have access to whichever intervention they did not already have. All participants will be able to use these interventions until December of 2022. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Central Michigan University. IRB protocol #: 2021-238

2097,Aggressive-Toe9807,1631736402,1,"So I'm a gay guy, 27 years old. I'm sure you've heard of the app Grindr. 

Anyways at the start of lockdown I saw a profile that looked pretty hot so I messaged him and we started chatting and really hit it off. We found out we actually lived like 175 miles away but we quickly moved to Snapchat and spent the entire evening back and forth texting and sending voice clips - it wasn't even anything sexual, it was really innocent and getting to know about eachother. The next day the texting completely dried up from his end and after I messaged him again he actually blocked me. I messaged him on Grindr and was confused and hurt and he explained it wasn't a good time as he's a closeted Muslim and his phone was monitored etc but maybe our paths would cross again some time down the line. 

I ALWAYS thought of him. Even though I was still using the apps and seeing other guys and even dating other guys I always felt really sad and wished that I could find him again and pick up where we left off. Seriously.

I went to London in July and I was hanging out with a friend from there for most of the time. One night he had to work so I had no plans and ended up going for a walk and using Grindr again - and as soon as I opened it I got a message from the guy who was ALSO visiting London. We quickly arranged to meet eachother and we ended up sitting up until 6am talking and kissing/hugging constantly. We kept both saying we couldn't believe the coincedence of it and didn't even want to sleep because we didn't want to 'miss out' on looking at eachother. It was one of the best nights of my life.

When I left in the morning I went back to my hotel (it was like 30 seconds away) and he text me saying he wanted to come see me again before he got his train home. He came round for 30 mins and then I walked him back to the station. Now, at this point I KNEW deep down in my heart I was going to get hurt and he was going to ghost me. I could literally predict how it was going to happen (as it always happens with other guys) and unfortunately I've been 100% accurate -

We were texting consistantly for like a day, still flirting and sending kisses and talking about meeting again. The next day I waited to see if he'd initiate (as it was his 'turn') and he didn't. I waited another two days and he still didn't. I remember feeling that hopeless frustration and just didn't fucking understand what the problem was. I KNEW it was going to happen but WHY? I ended up confronting him about it in a lighthearted way and made a joke about how I was always texting first and he kept saying he was just busy and not to worry or overthink things. Fine. I thought he'd take the hint and text me first the next day but he still didn't. Or the day after. It was then his birthday so I text him birthday wishes and he said thank you...but that was it. I then waited TWO FUCKING WEEKS  to get something from him and still nothing. At this point I was completely resigned to the fact we were never going to meet again but it was so damn painful. I couldn't stop thinking of him. I actually felt sick to my stomach when I remembered being with him. There were too many fucking coincedinces that led us to meet -

\- Both of us visiting London the same time  
\- Our hotels being 30 seconds apart  
\- Us both using Grindr at the same time (I only used it as my friend cancelled and he said he only just downloaded it again that night and I was one of the first profiles)  
\- He also said he was told by a psychic/medium or whatever that a tall guy would come into his life in the summer (I'm tall)

Apparently I was the first guy he ever spent the night with as well.

I messaged him again last night (I know it's pathetic) and tried to see if we could plan something and his replies were so short, blunt and sort of like he was irritated with me. He kept saying he's busy and works non stop and I keep giving him chances and options to PLEASE just block me or tell me he's not interested but he doesn't do it. I honestly feel like I'm in love with him and can't comprehend the fact that it's literally panned out as the worst possible scenario. It couldn't have gone any worse than this. He insisted I took his phone number to stay in contact and I told him I didn't want it as I knew he was going to lose interest. I knew the 'slow fade' would happen and I'd be destroyed. It always happens.",lonely,I feel a bit traumatised after being rejected from a guy (who I met in person by sheer coincedence a year after we lost contact online),2021-09-16 06:06:42
2098,Not_Comfortable1,1631736085,1,"Just to say, this the best place I have got in years, I can just type out anything which doesn't make sense and almost no one even notices my posts so, that's a great thing for me.

And now it's been a habit of having no friends, no one to talk to but still checking on my phone every min if I got any messages, I don't who but someone.

Last week I realised that the things which were hurting me, which I was denying since last 5 years to be just a phase a life may be, and pretending to be happy like this in front of my family, is called depression.
I am not clinically diagnosed and it's stupid enough to say but online all of the online tests I took said I have severe depression, nd I know I have social anxiety, insomnia, loneliness, I overthink a lot, I am emotionally numb at this point because of pretending.

Today, for the first, because I didn't want to feel the certain way, I tried not to overthink, or even think at all, just a blank mind and still am stuck to bed, with all those terrible feeling, a void in my chest hurting me, paralising me, I can't move at times but it's good that I got a lock on my door or I would have died of shame if someone saw me like this. I mean I want to die but not like this, may be I should hire a hitman for myself, idk.

I don't have any idea who am I waiting for to text me at 1:24 a.m. at night, and I even don't want to talk to anyone, but still may be for a validation that someone care about my existence, may be if someone even texted me, I won't even reply back, cause I never know what to say, it requires experience right which I lack a little too much and who likes short talks anyways, idk I do but no one else do.

And it's just so good to just post something out there like this where I know I have put myself out to the world, but still have no attention of others, it's just perfect atleast for me.

A little back one of let's say, pretending friend, showed me how she posted one post with an alt account on reddit and she got 100s of dms in like 3-4 hours, it's was crazy. Now I am here posting everyday cause I love it, not looking for anyone but just to say something if someone's reading, it's the best.

And it's just intentional to write long posts so that people just ignore reading it, anyways who cares about reading this much, and I get to say everything I got in my mind so I like reddit ig.

2110,damagingdefinite,1631727911,1,"[Here is something I created to express myself and represent how I feel](https://imgur.com/a/Ao6LzzH)

Hi, I created this 'artwork' representation how I feel having been socially isolated and lonely essentially my entire life. I had the idea for this when I was walking around town a few weeks ago and watching small groups of people occasionally pass. They would be laughing, talking, and smiling; and I realized I would probably never have that. An incredible existential pain came over me and I wanted to represent it somehow, and maybe put it on peoples radar that there are people really hurting because they are isolated socially and lonely. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation), around 24% of elderly people are socially isolated, and that's just very wrong. I'm young and it hurts badly for me, I can only imagine how badly older people hurt. I can tell you it's akin to torture

My feeling is almost all people *need* physical, in-person bonding with people they trust, and especially with people they care for, and who they perceive care for them. Its so important, and I feel like most people take it for granted. Mutual trust, respect, and caring are the fundamental foundation for human communities, and something individual people crave, in my opinion, and when that degrades, all of society and everyone in it is hurt

Anyway, the artwork... I considered drawing it by hand but the pattern is so simple and repetitive that I just decided to automate it :). So I created this entirely in Mathematica. As a result I can spit new ones out really quickly. Though, since your brain generalizes the faces, the squares, and how it all fits together, all of what can be generated is essentially represented exactly the same by your mind, and so everything that can be generated is equivalent by invariant encoding

One interesting consequence of the grid-like pattern that I didn't intend for is the [grid illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_illusion) that makes the grid of happy squares seem to be much more energetic than the center, and even creates what seems like an illusory fence around the grid, keeping the center square in

I chose to make the center square have sharp corners, rather than the soft, rounded ones the grid squares have; this represents the hardness inside yourself you begin to feel after having been isolated for so long. After awhile you begin to not even think its possible to be a part of a community or know people you have reciprocated caring and trust for. That is what happened to me, at least. And interestingly, the grid illusion is more intense when the the grid square's corners are rounded, which you might take as incidentally representing that the happiness and softness of the grid squares are what gives the grid its energy, and keeps the center square in

The center square's face isn't composed of simple shapes but is warped, representing the anguish you feel and its distortion of your personality, mindset, your self image, and view of reality. The center square is also slightly blue, which is just as it sounds: he / she is blue: sad and depressed. And, the center square isn't just not in the grid but off the grid's spacing entirely. I chose to do this to represent how you become out of sync with others, which creates a gap between you and them that further pushes you away. Going beyond this, the center square has no place in the perfect grid without breaking the grids symmetry, representing the sense of not belonging anywhere in society

Since I created this and I have my soapbox here, I wanted to also say that I miraculously met a girl recently (its extremely rare for me to meet anyone, let alone a girl) who I've now spent a good deal of time with, and who I have a lot in common with. We seem to hit it off really well, and I inevitably developed a crush on her. This crush is really hurting me inside though and I was also trying to distract myself for awhile by making this. Every time I see her in person I just want to tell her how I feel, but I can't get the words out. So I've switched tactics and will just text her, as lame and embarrassing as that is. I'm afraid of the consequences of telling her and that hurts badly, and I know I'll embarrass myself but I just need to get it out of me because it really feels terrible, really embarrassing and like I'm doing something wrong feeling like this, and I need to talk about it with someone consequential. Even if she doesn't feel the same thats totally fine. I just want her to be happy, and if that doesn't include me then I welcome that wholeheartedly!

My recommendation (which will almost certainly not be implemented, but I'll say it anyway) for curing / helping cure social isolation in society, is for every community to build fundamentally belief-agnostic community centers where everyone is encouraged to visit and just maybe sit, walk around, or whatever; along with people who will assist infirm and disabled people getting there. Maybe they could have activities and community classes there as well. One idea is a room with chairs, and anyone who wants to talk but can't or won't approach anyone can just go and sit in a chair and that explicitly signals by design anyone who is willing to approach and help to sit with that person and talk with them

I think many people remember school fondly, and develop so many relationships in school because its an institution which acts to bring people who have some commonalities between them together, and encourages them to work together. University campuses are an especially significant variant of this, as meeting people is easy because you almost certainly have many things in common, people get around by walking, and their activities are synchronized by class schedules. It's my belief that society would begin to flourish more if everyone can come together in *free* (very important) and belief-agnostic institutions like this

Another possibility to help social isolation is some non-profit platform for real-world platonic matchmaking online. This would work very much like dating sites, but specifically just for finding people to have real-world social interactions with, and seeking people out for various kinds of real-world social interaction. Of course, such a platform would have to have a guaranteed userbase or it likely wouldn't work well. I propose that such matchmaking should be a function of the government, or at least competently tried once by some government to see how well it works

Furthermore, I believe that online social interaction, and social interaction via video and phone calls, just doesn't work anywhere even remotely as well as real-world, physical social interaction. There are so many important channels of communications lost when interacting with someone through a screen or text. We need in-person social interactions for everyone!

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this artwork and my commentary! :) If anyone wants to talk just message me. I'm interested in everyones experiences with social isolation and loneliness. I tend to make over-long replies that take a lot of my time to write, though, so I might be slow in replying or might not reply at all if I get overwhelmed

Oh, and as usual, reddit's subreddits are so inflexible and impenetrable that I'm just shamelessly posting this to places where I don't think it will be instantaneously and aggressively deleted. Feel free to remove it if it doesn't make sense to be posted here, though :)",lonely,An image / artwork I made and commentary: representation of being socially isolated and lonely: grid of squares,2021-09-16 03:45:11

2127,xfallenangelx95,1631714202,1,"Please read - People always say ""I'm lonely"" despite being in a relationship or having some friends..They probably don't even know what loneliness really is.If you have a partner you're not a loner.Your partner is (or should be) your friend.
If you have people to talk to - People that you get along with - you're not friendless either.Do you guys know what is loneliness? loneliness is when you don't have anyone to talk to..when you don't feel understood by others (despite them being in your life) When you wake up and don't have a single unread message or one missed call..when you want to call someone you know but everyone is always too busy..people confuse loneliness with boredom.Boredom is not the same as loneliness and never will be.
boredom is temporary loneliness is permanent

I'm here because I would love to find someone to talk to.I don't have any true friends &amp; I want to change my situation.I don't really want to wait any longer than 5 or 6 hours on a message that can be typed and send in a few seconds or minutes..I'm a human too and I hate excuses..I don't need another shallow friendship. I want to meet someone who wants to talk on a daily basis - why? I want to finally see someone's engagement..I want to talk to someone who also needs a friend to talk to throughout the day.I'm always the one waiting for people's messages and I'm sick of them never making any time for me. &amp; I don't feel understood by them.

Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.

I personally don't care about people's interests -common interests.What matters to me is your honesty,respect,your outlook on life.

I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything

I want to meet someone who won't reject me &amp; my friendship

My boyfriend used to treat me like a princess to..leave me..&amp; now? I just need a friend..Nothing else

18-35 age range.

Send me a private message If you want to talk..

I'm not looking for any relationship.Just someone like me..
to cry together and laugh together and support each other.I can't bear the pain..I don't want to hear ""find a therapist"" or ""everything will be ok"" because life is unpredictable..I just want to find someone who can relate..someone in the same situation.Someone who always will be there (If we get along) I need it more than ever.I know how sad my post is but I'm also very sad.I can't believe someone I loved so much just left me.blaming me for everything..I just can't.Nothing hurts more than being super friendless.having no one who understands you..I really would rather talk to someone in exactly the same situation.I'm too sad to talk only about random stuff or hear positive stories from other people.I want to talk to another person willing to listen to me.Another person who doesn't have anyone just to support each other.Someone who would never tell me ""move on"" or ""stop complaining"" someone who needs someone to talk to almost all the time.I don't want to feel like the only sad person in the world or be rejected again.Most people say ""I don't have any friends.I would do anything for a friend"" but they never have time for others..Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.

And just no, I'm not interested in being a third wheel. I already experienced how shitty it is why I would I subject myself again? And my cousin is of course so utterly oblivious to what she's doing.

I have hardcore porn and masturbation addiction and it ruined my life. I started watching porn when I was 16 years old and now 6 years have gone by and my highest streak over these 6 years is just 14 days. I promised my dead grandmother, my mom, to God. But I relapse to porn every single day. Going back four years I joined my university I was a quite good looking guy and I initially got some female attention, but guess what my awkward behaviour always downplayed my potential. I was a complete failure in my college (social life). I have shitty friends who don't care about me and also I grew up to be a very greedy person over the last 4 years. I desperately want to heal. Fast forward 3 years when this lockdown came, I started fapping to porn multiple times a day and every day. It was an endless loop of making a promise and breaking it. My eyes are droopy, my confidence is zero. I am always anxious. I am lazy, all this I know and I do nothing about it. I want to cry desperately but how do I put it, I can't even cry!!! My mind is so wrapped because of this porn addiction. I have never touched a girl in my life, I have never been loved by anyone except for my family. Or I shall put it this way, I never allowed anyone to love me, a close friend of mine (a girl) told me she liked me but again my anxious self rejected it, I gave her many reasons telling that I was not ready. But deep down I was afraid, I was afraid of rejection I was afraid she would find out my little secret, my PORN ADDICTION. I didn't want to be rejected. I was able to bag a shiity job through campus interviews. I hate this job, I know I am capable of more, yet I had to settle for this. I still have some options open but I am not pursuing it because deep down my mind says I cannot do this!!! I don't know why I am such a loser. I also want to pursue my higher studies but I am not preparing for the entrance exams too. All I am doing every day is watch porn and fap. I don't know how this is all gonna end. 

I don't know why my mind always says "" you can't do this"", "" you are not capable"", "" you are not worthy"".


God, I desperately want to end this. I want to heal, I want to be my 10-year-old self. I want to correct all my mistakes. I can't even end this desperate life.

People say not knowing many people is okay in high school and it doesn't matter in the long run. It does matter when I have to go to this place every weekday for 7 hours. Nothing is fun, especially with Covid, how do I meet anyone? Parents say it will happen naturally but nothing is happening ever. The people i've tried to be friends with my whole life still ignore me. People who I tried to be friends with leave me when they can. I'm tired of seeing my one friend snog her boyfriend infront of me. Her boyfriend bullied me on Discord and now I'm too afraid to talk to anyone online. I can't talk to her about it because then she'll get depressed. I'm ugly. Homecoming is coming up, might not even happen though. I don't want it to. 

A shitty story I need to tell someone:

Two years ago, I had a friend that everyone likes named C. She was always talking to people online, often got groomed. Thats besides the point. Boys liked her, wanted to talk to her, and C could do it effortlessly. C and my other friend and her boyfriend and all these other boys always hung outside during lunch in the freezing cold without ever eating. Of course I joined them, I didn't know what else to do. Despite my efforts to be included I just couldn't do it. If I wasn't ignored I was mocked. I would sit on the stairs and watch them while they all hung out. But often, C would have ""a bad day"" and sit on the staircase beside me and put her head in her hands. I would ask her if she's okay and she would tell me to not talk to her. She would only talk if a guy came up to her and asked the same thing. I ended up eating in the bathrooms. Every guy I liked, C knew, and every time I wanted to talk to him, they would ditch me together. Now C is in one of my classes and ignores me. 

I'm not a perfect person but fuck her. Fuck her. She ruined my social life. I hate her and always pissed at her. Why is she perfect and I'm not. Why do I eat in the bathrooms. I'm sorry I'm so whiny.",lonely,I'm going to leave the place where no one likes me,2021-09-15 16:29:17

I’m currently in highschool and not quite invisible but whenever I’m at school or involved with people my age in real life I’m like a background character. 

I have friends online that I call/talk with and have tons of fun, I do tons of stuff outside of my social life (which hardly exists), but in school I can’t describe what position I’m in anyway else besides just the background. I’m not bullied at all, people don’t seem to hate me. Whenever I’m put in a group in class for something I get along with the other people, a couple people (2, sometimes a 3rd) say hi to me when they walk past and stuff but nobody wants to be my friend or ever talk with me more than that. I have streaks on Snapchat with several girls from my school but we never actually say anything. In class whenever we have free time and other people are talking to eachother I just go on my phone. Maybe I’m holding myself back in regards to that but I feel like if they are interested in talking it would happen. I just eat lunch in the gym usually.

2182,throwawayblue900ss,1631680060,1,"TL;DR: I haven't been touched in 5 years, am unwanted and rejected, despite my best efforts. I think I may die alone and never know what love is, in spite of my efforts.

This is long, but I have to write this as a form of catharsis because I have no one I can talk to. I have no ""stupid ideas"", so we are clear. However, other than self-preservation instincts, there is no point in living without a person in my life to love, romantically. This, dear reader, is not living, but merely existing. I find my terror, a terror I actively experience, in a life not fully lived. I only exist.

As a man, I cannot show any weakness, any doubt, or I dig a deeper hole for myself. This is my direct experience, and man is nothing, if not a product of his experience.

You would never guess I were in a ""...life of quiet desperation..."" if we met and had a coffee. I seem to have it together, the perpetual bachelor, living alone. Accountable to no one but himself. No one can order me around. I see something I like, I buy it. I have a fleet of very nice vehicles. Then, what seems to be the problem?

I have been alone for so long, even in a crowd, I am disconnected, set apart. I can never be myself, though I have tried. When I try, people distance themselves from me, as if I am a caustic agent.

I have no support net, no family, no friends, just acquaintances. Once my mother told me ""I wish I never gave birth to you!"", the bridge of my family was burned forever.

I have not had my name spoken to me with fondness, with love, with care, for a decade or more. I have never been an object of desire, a man to enrich a woman's life. I have only been used or rejected. I have been used as a flesh dildo and thrown away. I have only had two girlfriends in my life. I do not orbit or chase after women. I consider this beneath me. If a woman is interested, I give back that interest, that flirting. I do not, as a rule heavily escalate, especially in today's climate of accusations.

In this, I know, I am not alone. I am sure, many of you, dear readers, know this emptiness, this internal chasm. Something is missing inside of me. The echo of silence is all I hear even when I am spoken to.

I speak to girls, devour all I can about body language, inference, nuance, subtlety in discourse. I am dynamic in conversation with a quick wit, decent comedic timing...but it is not enough. I am not nervous, I am relaxed and genuinely I'm enjoying myself. 

She is giving me positive eye contact, she is laughing at my jokes. Her body language is open, kind. Yes, I am making a connection. My heart races, my soul soars, I am feeling human. I can get to know who she is as a person, to learn about her. This is great. Then, I am avoided. 

Well, princess, I apologize I am not Henry Cavill or Chris Hemsworth. To spare her discomfort, I stay far away after my failure to read her. In one case, I noticed we were passing each-other, and her body language became guarded, so I didn't make eye contact, and just walked by. Don't worry, I wasn't going to say anything to you. I know girls get approached all the time, and ""guarded"" is the default setting. I get it. Really, I get it. Another time, I totally ignored her open body language, and walked by her, gave her no eye contact. Treat me as a non-person, I give what I get.

I know when I am not wanted. I am never wanted. I am frustrated with the situation, not a woman's lack of attraction. She, nor I, can change our attraction. It cannot be negotiated. I get this, also. She is liking what she sees, what she hears, my pheromones, or, she doesn't.

Perhaps she is only serial flirting for attention and validation? Perhaps being friendly? Perhaps a bit of both? Perhaps the Reddit alien is modeled after me? 

Ironically, girls look at me when I enter a room and I don't know why. I'm not handsome. I am not ugly, yet I catch them looking at me, fairly often. I catch them preening when I walk by, or into a room. I notice more things than I once did. Now, I see the unspoken things our bodies are saying...but they don't square with my lack of success.

I have ""very pretty blue eyes"", I get told...yet I'm alone. All the cues, all the alleged tells are there. I get a lot of eye contact and smiles, yet I am nowhere.

Yes, I am well-groomed. Yes, I am tall. Since growing long hair and a beard, I get much more attention from women. Do they think I am some sort of musician or something? I got less interest when I was Corporate Clean Cut Salary Man #7,678 in my city.

I have changed my appearance and my style, hoping something will strike a key, what all men want to hear said about them: ""Wow! He's hot!""

In interactions, I wear my psychological mask when I speak to you, pretending to be the extrovert, the life of the party. Who you want me to be, Mr. Accepted, Mr. Gregarious. I smile my big bright smile, my eyes also smile. I'm not a ""close talker"", or too loud. I listen to what you say before I respond to you. I maintain eye contact---but no too much. I gesticulate with my hands to show I am alive, I am enthusiastic, I am multi-dimensional. I am unguarded, open, naked. I bare myself and try to be genuine. I fake extroversion, which is not genuine, because being who I am is even worse. I am a man concerned with results. I am not looking to get laid. I want love. I want intimacy. I want you to say my name to me. 

I want to celebrate birthdays. I want orgasm with someone I love. I want thousands of kisses and hugs over a lifetime spent together. I want the warm embrace of being nude with my loving wife as I drift into the black night of unconsciousness until sunrise.

I want to create life and watch it grow inside of my wife. I want to teach my children and leave an inheritance of nice motorcycles, classic cars, a house, etc. I want to provide for those I care for.

I want to be a loving father and husband. 

Every day I wake up to work, and I have never been better financially in my life. I am very comfortable with no debt, and my assets continue to grow. Though, if I cannot share it with someone I love, someone I care for, who care for me in kind, all I can do is spoil myself.

...and I do. I indulge to the full self-improvement cult so popular and my hobbies (motorcycles, firearms, running, etc.). After a while, this gets stale. The money, the security is nice, but how many things can I buy? Money does not buy happiness, or contentment. It just makes things less stressful. I want a family. I want to fall in love, get married and start a family, leave something behind other than ""me, me me!!!""

Just giving to myself is like looking at myself in the mirror naked and masturbating at my reflection. It is only concerned with incestuous self-satisfaction. It disgusts me to live this way. It disgusts me that this yoke, this burden I carry that no one but you all know about, crushes me. I am holding back a dam of emotion, of love I want to give. It is not all about me being loved---I want to give my love, my affection. I want to share, to give orgasms, not just live for me, me, me.

I want to be kissed, touched, acknowledged. Acknowledge me!

I have a full cup I need to pour, but it cannot be tipped, I cannot spill any emotions, or they will see and judge me. Again, no one can know, or accept what I have disclosed here. I'm not a human. I am just electrons on your screen right now.

So, I carry this burden, day in, day out, as the seasons change, as I age, and I see I will die alone, unloved, unremembered. If I got cancer, no one would help me through treatment, or visit me. If I lost this battle, I would be be thrown away. My birthdays go unobserved. Valentine's Day is the worst.

What is the point living on my own planet? Being my own island? What misery this is!

I have not been physically touched for at least 5 years. I crave warmth, I crave touch, intimacy. I would trade everything I have accumulated right now, to hold a warm human hand belonging to a good woman who genuinely looks in my eyes with love, with desire, with contentment. God, how I miss just the simplest of pleasures, holding hands.

I can never tell anyone. No one I know can ever know I feel this way. It would destroy what pathetic life I have. More than anyone, none of the girls I know, can know. No woman I have ever known, can face these statements and not be disgusted with me. Don't judge me, because you haven't walked in my shoes. Or, judge me. It doesn't matter either way.

I have to be strong. I wish to be.

I have to be brave. I wish to be.

I have to be untouchable. I wish to be.

I have to be a great man. I wish to be.

Before I die, I want to hear ""I love you."", ""You make a difference in my life."", ""I believe in you."", ""You are the love of my life."" ""You are a great husband."", ""You are a great father."" spoken to me. Then, I will know my life was not wasted, and my mother was wrong about her son.

If desire were enough, I would have what I wanted already. Sometimes, a mathematical equation has no solution. This is where I am now.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope I helped someone today. I wish all of you love, just as I selfishly wish it for myself.",lonely,Warning: Novel inside...tired of not being human.,2021-09-15 14:27:40
2183,KyaleCarey,1631679003,1,"I've always been overweight, it's something that was normal in my family for so long. I lost a lot of it in middle school. People started talking to me more, were more friendly to me, and for a while I was happy. As all fools do I fell in love with someone, then became obsessed with them, and of course when I finally asked her to be more I was met with the ""no"" I knew deep down was coming. The facade I'd desperately created had shattered and reality had delivered a gut punch I didn't know I could feel. I text my mom that day, said I needed to leave school, and to this day I'll never know how she really knew something was wrong, I complained about school all the time. I left in the middle of biology and walked home, I hurt myself that day on the walk home, I had to feel something, it became a bad habit of mine to drag my knuckles along the concrete retaining wall I always passed. My uncle was waiting for me when I got home and I just cried, he took me to McDonalds and bought me chicken nuggets and a chocolate milkshake, I think that's when I started eating because I was sad, not hungry. I went from 170 to 290 over the course of a few years. Developed a deep depression that still bites at me, I've been medicated since that day as well, I sought treatment and for a few years it might have helped but then I quit going. I had a girlfriend for a couple of years in there as well, my weight had always been a problem in the relationship but I thought I could do it, though I could finally lose that weight with someone by my side. I couldn't, she was there for me and I didn't care, she broke up with me a little after we got to college. That night sent me through the last of my straws, that night I almost took my life, I was going to take my hunting rifle and go out to a field somewhere, somewhere peaceful. I cried outside of my mom's house for two hours in my car but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Today I went to a friend's dorm, we went and smoked a little, then went back to his dorm, I felt like such a stranger, it felt wrong being there. My friends have all gone away to college again, they haven't spoken to me much since they left. I've messaged them but they don't keep the conversation. I've never felt longer than I do tonight, and I feel like it's my weight to blame. I hate myself every day for not being healthier, for not working out or eating right. I'm terrified that I'll be this person for the rest of my life, I don't want to be me anymore.

2184,peaked_at_age_four,1631677796,1,"*a quick note: i originally posted this under r/ college, but it got removed for unknown reasons. i'm reposting it here because the application is much more broad than just college; i've found the mindset i describe here useful during various different phases in my own life. however, the ideas in this post can only be taken so far, and i don't pretend to have a magical cure for real loneliness. this is just a small thing that i hope is helpful for someone out there :)*

So you don't have that amazing group of college friends you dreamed of, and it seems like everyone else has found their people but you still feel alone. There's all sorts of advice out there about how to talk to people and make friends, and that's fantastic, but to my mind the more important thing is this: You need to learn to enjoy your own company. On a regular basis, literally everyone in college, no matter how social, eats alone, walks alone, studies alone, and so on. After college, this will most likely only become more pronounced, particularly if you live alone. It's not wrong, it's not weird, in fact it's the opposite: solitude is simply a part of every person's life, though its prominence will vary.

Moreover, it's good thing to spend time by yourself. Adulthood is about independence, part of which is finding your identity within yourself rather than defining yourself only by the people you surround yourself with (or lack thereof). When you're alone, it's easier to stop comparing yourself to others and wondering what they think of you, and instead to listen to your true thoughts and get to know yourself.

Practically speaking, one thing I'd recommend would be to find things that you enjoy doing by yourself. I actually look forward to when I have a longish block of time to eat alone, because I go to my favorite bench in this particular little garden and read a book. Or when I'm walking by myself, I might listen to my favorite tunes just for those main character vibes. I'd also highly recommend exploring campus alone, because you can go at your own pace and notice all the little things you wouldn't otherwise. Look for free stuff, top-secret study spots, interesting posters, random cartoons on office doors, secret passageways, or whatever else might happen your way. None of these are big things, but they make me happy! When you're alone, you don't have to be lonely.

That said, I don't mean to trivialize loneliness and the difficulties of getting to know people in college. Friendship and support are of course, incredibly important. But frankly, people come and go. Yourself, however, you can't help but be stuck with for the rest of your life, and to my mind, college is an excellent place to start living with this fact. Get to know yourself. Learn how to learn, how to take care of yourself, how to handle stressful situations and difficult emotions. Find the things that genuinely fulfill and gratify you, and make the time to actually do them.

Most of all, be patient. Friendships take time. Feeling at home in a new place takes time. Growth takes so, so much time. It's alright.",lonely,To the college student who feels alone,2021-09-15 13:49:56

Or I assume I will get ignored and forgotten and cut the person off first. And yes, I know that shows how broken I am. 

I am so desperate for any shred of human connection, I spend too much time seeking it out, checking for notifications, checking apps anyway when I see zero notifications….and I keep getting let down. Over and over. And I am not mad at anyone. Nobody is obligated to talk to me. They just don’t feel a connection or have an interest and move on. It’s just how people are, including me, so I understand. But when it happens with literally everyone, including my family, it hurts. 

Ok, I have a wife, but she doesn’t want to talk to me or to listen to me. I try to talk but she is on TikTok or working or wanting me to be quiet, or mocking me for how I feel, or interrupting me or telling how I am worthless or wrong or just wanting to use me. I would rather be alone, but can’t. 

I need to be able to let it go, to stop trying to find friends and connections. I spend too much time worrying about something that goes nowhere, something that just hurts.

In some way, it feels more frustrating than being at home. I definitely prefer being back on-campus rather than being holed-up in my home. However, it's frustrating to see so many eyes around you, but no eyes locking with yours.

When sitting with a mask on in a lecture hall and in indoor areas to study, it felt like a repeat of semesters past of being in-person. I was not social then, and because of that, I never found my own tight-knit group of university friends to study with and hang out with. Now, with the mindset and urge to put myself in positions to be more social, it feels nearly impossible. I feel even more invisible.

How do you meet new people, and let it be impactful enough? Friendships? Heck, even more that friends?

I'm not the biggest fan of social media apps because I think they can portray a false image - but then again, not entirely. :) I do see how they can be useful, but I'm just not a big user in the first place so I don't have much of a presence on there.

Since its summer I should go outside more but alone I just have 0 motivation. And since I live in a village with basically nothing, the next place to at least buy some food is around 15 minutes with the bus.

The other girl has been who I considered my best friend since grade 7 but we really went our separate ways in high school. I am in college now and we never hangout but chat sometimes. Those are the only two people I really consider my friends. I’ve hung out with a lot of people through my boyfriend but they have all moved away after the summer. My boyfriend and I live together so we obviously hangout all the time but it’s just not the same. In my program at college I don’t know a single person and it’s very group oriented.

I really struggle with social situations and continuously think people are judging me and thinking portly of me. I always compare myself to others and see how they are all better than me. I lack social confidence and self esteem. I struggle so much with it that between classes I cry in my car. I feel so embarrassed.

I’m a senior in hs this year. I should be happy and excited, and overall having a good time... right? I get to finish up with public school, hang out with friends, and get to play sports.

Wrong. 

My best friend moved out of the country, none of my other friends who I’ve know since elementary school even talk to me, my friend who moved back to town refuses to hang out with me.

My mental health has been completely unstable, I don’t know what to think of myself. I genuinely feel useless/unimportant.

I play soccer for my school, and I was feeling sick before I went to practice (not covid). So I let a coach know that I may be a bit off, but he just sent me home so I would get anyone else sick. After falling asleep for a bit I woke up to a photo in our team group chat. 

They all had a great practice, and a parent brought milkshakes for them after, (us seniors and the coaches payed for all of them and for the underclassmen to make sure everyone got one). It looked so fun, like everyone was happy.

But no one even asked if I was ok. 

I don’t want to sound selfish but I just want someone to care, to see if I’m doing alright. It’s already so difficult for me to express how I’m feeling.

Everyone who I’ve interacted with for a long time used to say, “You’re so calm” “you’re so quiet.” 

But now it’s turned into back handed statements. “You’re like a ghost” “Ah well you’re just forgettable.”

2263,makario,1631630801,1,"Last week, a close friend of mine was going through a difficult time. I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.

The way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people ""hold hands"" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.

It's available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yokereba.held) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/held-together/id1585062364), and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.

I realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.

Ever since i was a child i had obvious social problems, the main one was that i never felt like i fit in and even with my friend that i knew for 10 years i always felt that i was lost and away from them. I used to move back and forth and during my middle school and such i never really grew better at dealing with my mental problems. I came to high school and things were looking better but suddenly got worse. There began the main problem, i was supposed to move.

Frankfurt Germany was the place i was supposed to go, i hated Germany and Frankfurt. Even before i set foot there i hated it, despised it and it disgusted me, i had to move against my own will and the plan was delayed for some 2 years. I always cried when that topic was brought up, even if i had a lot of friends that were never there for me (except one) it was still really bad for me to handle it. Que march 2021, and as things could not even get worse. I got manipulated, made fun of and literally emotionally abused by the 2 persons i thought at the time were my friends, i hate them and they made problems for me that lasted for a long time. I eventually was left alone, for once in my life my mind hit a reset button and i was left completely alone, seeing only one person who was always there for me and who never left my side, that is why i fell in love with her along with many things. april, we hooked up and we are still together. We go to school enjoying every second of it and then the summer brake hits and we enjoy it as well. 

My departure was very heavy, i was supposed to leave at the end of august. I did and it left a hole inside us that we can never fill except if we are together. I am currently 16 years old, i have semi bad parents that made a bad decision, i lost everything that made me happy (that was not just her), i fight with my mom on a daily basis and i was thinking of committing suicide for a very long time but i know i have her waiting  for me to get back.

This does not go into detail, it does not tell a story. I am just here to say that never in my life, have i felt so drained, heavy and utterly broken.

Hi everyone. Don't know how to express my feelings about my situation but i'll give a try. 

I am 22 years old virgin male. I don't fell attractive and no girl can like me because of i have something like social phobia. I live alone and i don't have someone i can call my bestfriend or gf. I feel alone for like 2 years. I always wanted a girl to do something with her because time doesn't pass.  So i spend my days by myself even if i don't want to.

For about 1 month ago my ex called me despite we made a promise about not to communicate. I was very curious about what could have happened and started to talk with her. Our chat was short and it wasn't very exciting. 3 days later she called me again and she said 'i wanted to be with you but i have no feelings for you and never will be. So if you don't feel anything for me we can hang out.(she lives in another city)' She got me in a second. I promised her and I agreed her offer. We planned to meet 1 week later to hang out at my house.

That week i felt my steps shake the ground. I remembered how i felt when i got some attention. I thought after she's gone i can meet some people and find some friends or even a gf. I was hopeful about my feature. 

Then she came to my house everything was good. We had fun. But we didn't have sex for 2 days. And i didn't want to push her. At third day i do some foreplays for her. But then i got erectile dysfunction becaues i was very excited. She didnt care about and said 'It's okay. We can do it later. It was fun so far.' I felt happy becaues she encouraged me. 

After few days we started arguing very often. And we didnt get close. She told me she broke up her bf and she just want to look for someone to hang with and i came to her mind. She told i overthink and dont chill. I felt like shit. I felt like i was just an object. My feelings and ego was hurt so bad. Because i wanted to be desired. After this the arguements became more often. 

Two days ago she went holiday by herself. I have to study for my lessons. And wanted to just take a breath. I am trying to chill down and dont think about her or my worth. But i feel like a shit. My life was worse before she called me. Now i realized how i feel with a girl. I dont want to be old me. But she hurt my ego and i want to go back my safezone again. Dont know how to feel. Dont know what to do. 

She will come in 3 days and i am mentally so bad. I am thinking of i cant find someone as i desire her. Being with someone can solve my all problems. But i dont have such self confidence and dont know how to meet new people. If only some one come out and like me. I swear it all be solved.",lonely,i feel like worthless and i can't fix it,2021-09-14 17:43:31

This is my first Reddit post so pls be nice :P 

Im 22, turning 23 soon and I’ve never had a boyfriend. When I was younger, like 16-20, this really bothered me bc all my friends we’re getting boyfriends, but no one seemed to be into me. However, I realized that I was insanely insecure in my looks &amp; my personality and I knew I needed to work on that before trying to date someone. So I really started to enjoy being single when I was 20-22 because I was just learning to love myself and be confident. Now, I’m at a place where I know I won’t change who I am for anyone bc I love my personality, and ngl, im pretty hot🤷🏾‍♀️ But the only thing that’s changed is guys being sexually interested in me. Which can be fun for a while, but I honestly feel so lonely sometimes. I want someone to want to get to know me, be intrigued by me and I want to feel that way about them. Like I don’t even care if my first relationship ends in complete heartbreak bc then at least I know what it feels like to fall in love and be loved. I’d even appreciate having a cute mini relationship for a couple months, I just want that intimate feeling with a guy. I know I’m young and plenty of people haven’t dated at my age, and I know it’s dramatic to assume I’ll never find love blah blah blah, but I genuinely can’t shake this overwhelming feeling that there’s no one out there that I’ll click with. I’ll feel fine for a month or two and then this feeling just comes in waves, and I feel that hopeless feeling again.

2307,Gribble_Waltz,1631589450,1,"For reasons I don't want to get into cause I hate to relive them, I'd been dreading the idea of being alone. I had been in that mentality and state of living before and it led me to some point I'd never thought I could reach. One thing lead to another and I'm back at square one, back after so much work to get ""happy"".

But, being back in this state of mind, where my mind is at war with itself about the legitimacy of my relationships and whether or not tomorrow will be a good day, I've come to be numb to it all. But I don't want to be. Not one bit.

I tell myself to think positively, but then my mind conjurs terrible scenarios and thinking negatively is just thinking negatively. But now, I've just accepted that if things go bad, I just have to hope they aren't too bad or if things go good, I'll just accept that.

I know it's not ideal to think happy ALL the time; that's unrealistic. But I can't think negative all the time either; that too is unrealistic. I understand that there's a middle ground, a fact that one can't truly be happy unless they accept that life isn't in their control, but I can't seem to reach that uniform state of emotion. I loathe the idea of loneliness, but can't bring myself to be happy enough to let it be in the corner of the room.

I just want someone, anyone. If It happens, it happens. If not, then not. And that scares me because I'm not at peace with that. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to be alone again, but my head keeps telling me that maybe this is how it was suppose to be.

2321,KTheThrowaway9,1631584523,1,"Hello everybody

Not really sure what to put on these so let's give it a shot.

As   the title states, I am a 27 male Hispanic. Not a big fan of online      dating due to not sure what to say in texts. I always preferred   talking    to people face-to-face. Idk, the conversations are more   intimate and I    like to joke around a lot, so it makes it hard to make   some of those    jokes behind a screen, y'know?

With that being said, I am here trying it out. Any feedback would be great as I am new to this.

A bit about me:

* Comedy      is a big factor of my life. Laughter is a great medicine and    honestly,   we all need to laugh a bit more. I would love to go to more    comedy  clubs  but.. well... COVID
* Speaking      of which, right before COVID started I was trying to be more of an      extrovert, GOD said ""Oh hell nah, sending a plague to fix this      immediately"" I am not saying it's my fault, all I am saying that it's a      big coincidence
* I am fully vaccinated, whoop whoop, and I still wear a mask in public. (I know, wild)
* [Here is a picture of me if this helps](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/167154973_4086216864733311_3173660175737779058_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=09cbfe&amp;_nc_ohc=7HSPBz26xvsAX-ou_Dr&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&amp;oh=9f6913f837945f5652ab56260eb6518b&amp;oe=61618432), still planning on growing out my hair some more, don't know for how much longer yet, wanted to try something new
* Recently started a new job, so I am happy where I am heading Career-wise
* I      am more on the nerdy side of things, I love video games, movies,     anime,  (been to a few cons) etc. I will watch and play them, always     much more  fun playing with friends on Discord. Oh I also like true     crime stuff
* I am not super active/athletic as I used to be but I am not opposed on trying out new things
* I guess here is where I would mention '6"", average build? more or less, still getting in the groove of working out again
* I      am shy at first, which people who know me do not believe this, but I      like to make things weird and joke around which does help break  some   of   the tension. It works sometimes

What am I looking for?

Idk    haha. Well definitely someone with similar interests helps but you      know, some times opposites attract. Helps also if it's in the area,      again, would like for more of a face-to-face kind of thing but talking      online is still fine. Oh and if you are cool with sharing a picture  or     two, just to confirm you are who you say are and stuff. It is  the     internet, who can you trust?

If      you made it this far, then great! Feel free to send me a message!  If     possible some feedback would be cool. Can't get better at  something if     you don't know what you're doing wrong right?

Thanks everyone,

\-K

2352,Different_Cookie_606,1631572109,1,"  My wife and I and have been together for 13 years now.  She had a child from a previous relationship and the father is not in the picture.  We have had 2 more children together, I live them so much.  The 2 youngest are just always together and never really want to do anything with me.  The oldest is 17 and I don’t even matter in her world.  I bust my ass for her and she just ignores me.  

  My wife over the last year has just disappeared emotionally and physically.  She works constantly and then when she is home she talks about woe or is on her phone.  I try and talk about my feelings and the future but she either makes me feel like a POS for having feelings or shrugs off all my plans.  She has decided take up drinking a lot and seems to do the at work before she comes home. Then when say something I am the asshole. 

  I have been trying really hard to be supportive of everything she does I cook, clean, most of the stuff around the house.  So when she does come home she can sit and relax and spend time with us. But she just sits out side and smokes with her phone in her hand.  

  We have talked about the lack of intimacy.  Found out she hates being touched and needs to be inebriated to have sex.  Even then she try’s to avoid it.  She also let it go that she hates orgasms “They don’t make me feel good”. Direct quote.  All I want is hug but I know I will brake down like and baby and cry.

I am a married 65yo retired accountant.  I have three gurlfriends,  two in the Philippines and One in Malaysia.  When I tell my friends that I am so happy we are sharing our love and doing everything we can to figure out how to be together,  I get very few ""you are so brave. ""
I get why? , ""seek therapy "", ""I don't understand "", ""this does not belong on Facebook "", ""you cheater"" , "" tyranny chaser "" , ""lier"", and my all time favorite "" what you are doing is immoral. "".
The sad part is ""you cheater"" , "" tyranny chaser "" , ""lier"" all came to me from the trans community while I was giving someone support.  I am lonely and extremely depressed.  How I treat myself is to try to give others support and encouragement on their tough roads. 
The trans community in developed countries has lost all perspective IMHO. I suggest you contact your sisters in less developed countries.  
One gurlfriend 31, has NEVER lived on her own.  The house she lives in, floods every time it rains because the government at that time releases water down the street where she lives. After it had rained, the water was up to the top of a bicycle tire, and the water in there house was 2.5 feet deep. She can't come live with me because she can't leave her parents like this. 
My other gurlfriend is 22. She lives with her grandmother.  Her 30 yo brother just died of Pneumonia.  There custom is to have a vigal over a week.  The funeral was on the same day as her passport appointment and had to miss it. I found out that her brother lived next door.  The house would have been condemned in the worst slums here.  It was just a large room, maybe 1200 Sq ft. No walls inside, roof made of grass, I don't think any glass on windows,  , no ac, grass on roof that leaks when it rains.  The point is she doesn't believe she is brave. It is her life. I do know that I love her and I will find a way to live together with them despite our governments.  I have been trying to go see these amazing gurls, but covid is stopping me. I am not trying to discount your feelings in any way. They are important.  I hope you wind all the happiness you can grab. I am only trying to give you perspective.  
You will not be able to meet any of these amazing gurls here. Their government blocks reddit.  If anyone would like to meet one of these amazing women I can direct you to ways and places how. That would make me very happy if this post generates that. What it will probably generate being taken down, scorn from your sisters and nasty notes from too many to count.  I was not ""brave"" to write this.  I feel I have nothing to lose but time and everything to gain from it. I can gain a warm heart from you helping these wonderful gurls, you feeling good about the great place you have been raised in. I hope that many of you will reach out to me and want to meet some of these amazing gurls. If you do, you will not regret it. I want nothing from any of you but understanding. Money to me is not involved nor is there a catch. 
Finally,  I have used the term gurl in this on purpose.  If it bothers you. good. Non of you speak for the entire trans community.  You don't even speak for a majority.  My gurlfriends appreciate it because I love them and they perfer to eat and love the world THEY are in.  All you lonely people,  here is your opertunity call. There is an entire nation that wants to be loved. 
Ok trolls and haters . Go for it.

I finished uni 2 years ago, I’m still friends with a couple of people I met however they live at least 3 hours away. We meet up when we can however this isn’t a regular thing because of the distance. Around 9 months ago I pretty much stopped smoking weed, I got myself a career, and really became an adult. I also got into my first relationship which I’m still very happy in. My problem is, since doing all of this not many people wanna hang out with me, I regularly ask people to go swimming, yoga, badminton or any kind of activity but I often get ignored or declined. I get asked if I want to go the pub (where most of the people I know works) but I’m tired of always hearing about the place. They all hang out there even on their days off and only really seem interested in smoking and drinking. I’ve started mainly hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends because they actually want to go out and do things with me.

I feel sorta pathedic. but, there's this girl at work who is the nicest human being and always is so kind to me. she's an older lady, who's first language isn't english so sometimes there's communication barriers. I work primarily alone at my job, but I see her the most out of anyone. which still isn't much, but its more than I see anyone ever in my day to day. she leaves work at 10:00pm and I leave work at 11:00pm. one night it was around 10:40pm and I still hadn't seen her come in to clock out and I almost got so worried I was thinking of calling the big boss. luckily she was fine and safe and just running behind. anyway, she's always so nice to me. she offers me snacks sometimes. sometimes, on the rare occasion, I get to stop my job and help her with hers when she needs me. thats only about twice a month or less. but I cherish when I get to help her out. one time she gave me a whole talk about not to be too nice but to still be kind to even strangers. and it was just so wholesome. she didn't know it but I really really needed someone to just even want to talk and connect with me like that. today, I was working and having the absolute worst cramps. so bad I was tearing up. again, I work alone so I was sure it wasn't like anyone would see me because that would be embarrassing af. but she came around to get something and she saw me and I was embarrassed but she asked what was wrong so I told her I had bad cramps. she immediately was doing all she could to help me. she got me tampons (like an idiot I forgot mine) and it was a whole brand new box and she tried to give me the whole box! lmao I ended up leaving it at work and putting a note on it letting anyone know they can have some if they need them. anyway, after she found out I already took pain meds that weren't helping, she stopped her busy work schedule and straight up brought me tea. later tonight she ended up telling me she's had a bad headache and suffering the past two days because of it. and im just thinking... this amazing lady really dropped everything, despite being busy and having a bad headache, just to make me tea so my cramping could maybe feel better??? I could cry. she is so fucking amazing and sweet. and we don't really know eachother too much. and the language barrier is a thing somewhat ofen. which doesn't bother me but I think it can make her feel uncomfortable and nervous(?). but if only she knew how much her kindness means to me. truly. I want nothing but good things for her. tbh, I think she's just like this with everyone. our bosses don't even treat her that great. they tend to get upset with her fast and its so upsetting. she deserves good things. one day important keys were missing and for some reason they automatically blamed her. and they ended up being in my bosses office. like??? what?? shit like that happens to her a lot. and it makes me upset. I know I've said this before, but she just... really deserves the world. I wish I could bring her a present without it being weird. idk what she'd even want. ive seen her eating oreos. maybe those lol. but anyway.

It eventually came out that I don’t believe in god in my mid 20s, all of my Jehovah’s Witness friends disowned me and my life has become more and more self destructive and I’m now ending my early 30s and entering my mid 30s without being single af and completely friendless. 

All that being said I’m a mess. I’ve developed a terrible lottery addiction over the past 7-8 years that’s gotten worse and worse. I have so much debt, I’m behind on all off my bills except rent, have zero friends, drink way too heavily, and am barely hanging on to my overpaying but demeaning job, and have gained 25 lbs over the past 10 months. 

My therapist says that me not having any to hold me accountable is what’s causing me my dysfunction. I don’t have a GF, roommate, or friends to call me out on my bullshit. I agree with him because info straighten up on those rare occasions that I do find a GF but I’ve sadly given up on having a social life. I flat out out don’t relate with other men, they say I’m cool, but I don’t connect enough for them to want to actually hang out with me. Doesn’t matter how much or little I try. And I can find a GF if I search hard enough, but they eventually get creeped out by me not having any friends after being with me for months. Once they realize that I have absolutely no one else present in my life it’s over. 

So at this point I’m stuck in a routine of stupid, spending all my money on lottery tickets and alcohol. Nobody around to care if I’m doing right or wrong. I don’t want to wind up homeless from losing on lottery tickets or with liver failure from drinking every night, but in the end it doesn’t matter.

I could have a great day or a good week, but all roads seem to lead right to this empty feeling. Right back to this gaping maw that takes a bite into me and doesn't let go. And bit by bit, I feel it consuming my soul.

I've never been more depressed in my life. It's taken a lot of courage for me to even admit that, but now even I can see it. I'm sure it's painfully obvious, at this point, to the few people in my life, but no one cares. I've regressed to the same old habits of years past. 

Sometimes I have a moment of clarity. For a fleeting few thoughts I can see how I need to change. What I need to do and learn to improve my situation, and my life. But then I lose focus again, along with another bit of my soul. Right down into that fucking abyss.

 I do have wants and desires aside from being a shut in. Thinking on it... Fundamentally, I want to make people happy. Every now and then, the opportunity to put a smile on someone's face shows itself. If I succeed and I make someone's day, my day is also made.

2440,Throwaway_12545,1631509533,1,"Hi everyone, I am new here but using a throwaway account. Sorry if my punctuation is bad, I may tend to go on tangents when writing emotional stuff like these and tend to forget.

First of all, I don't want any sympathy because I do not deserve it... What has happened is purely my fault and should not be excused.

Let's go back to the start of February 2019, without going into too many details, I had met this lovely girl through circumstance and she was amazing.  She was everything I could have asked for in a girl and more. She was kind, smart, funny and just beautiful... She was always so giving and helpful to those around her, expecting nothing in return. We became really good friends quite quickly as we sorta understood each other you know? The conversation always felt moving and natural... We got along very well.... But just as friends. Needless to say, it didn't take long for me to fall for her.... I gained feelings for her. Whenever I talked to her I sometimes felt a little jittery and just overly happy which may have given away that I liked her. Here's the kicker though, as much as I wanted to be with her, as much as I wanted to give her the world I couldn't, why? Because she was married, I had fallen for a married woman who is actually in a very happy marriage with her husband. It hurt, every night where I knew me and her wouldn't be a thing, not in a million years. We remained friends for two years but everything changed in December of 2020 because of my wrongdoings.

We had been friends for two years at this point, and she felt very comfortable around me, she had helped me with my problems and I helped her with hers... Why did I screw up so bad? I had messaged her, confessing how I felt about her for so long... knowing full well she was in a happy marriage already, how could I? She felt taken a back and said that she needs some space... I understood. That was the last time she messaged me. I messaged a few days later apologising for what I said, but got no response and I was blocked on all her social media accounts. That December felt like hell, even my friends couldn't make me feel better. I deleted all my social media as well, out of guilt and spent the whole month of December by myself, isolated from everyone, I went to a very very dark place.

Spent nights hating myself for what I had done and how much I hurt her by saying that. Why the hell did I do such a thing? I should have just kept my emotions and feelings in check, she was already with someone, I shouldn't have said what I said and regret it all the time. I felt so bad for her, I put her in such a tough and uncomfortable situation for what? Just so I could tell her how I feel? 

I haven't heard from her since then. My friends eventually got to me and helped me feel less miserable than I was during those days, I created new social media and tried to get my life back on track... Trying to be happy but deep down I haven't felt genuinely happy since last year, when she was in my life. That's messed up isn't it.... to still miss her... despite hurting her in such a way, what am I thinking... I don't deserve to miss her. I am still the most selfish asshole I was back in December.

Meeting new people is so much more difficult than it once was, I always doubt myself whether or not they like me or am I just getting in their hair. I feel like, I should deserve to be lonely and miserable for the rest of my life because I just ruin the lives around me. I just hope that she is genuinely happy, and is living her life to the fullest now, not worrying about me, she deserves to be happy after all. Of course, I wouldn't know, I haven't talked to her in 9 months and I just hope her and her husband are doing okay. I just hope to become a better person in the future.

Recently one of my “close” friends has really hurt me and I blocked him because of it.
For a while now a lot of red flags have been popping up in our relationship, as in he seems to always exclude me from everything deemed social. At one point he even called me his “best friend”, but I’m certain that was a blatant lie. First time he posted on his story him hanging out wit some friends, and I was kinda confused why he didn’t invite me, so I talked to my friend Michael about it, in which he said that he tried inviting me but I couldn’t come. He never invited me to begin with, so I confronted him about it, and he said it wasn’t intentionally exclusive to not include me and he said he’d promise to invite me the next time. Well, a few weeks ago, I check my Instagram feed and find that he posted a story which I could only see on my alt. And it was him hanging out with friends again and what not, but it wasn’t showing up on my main account, meaning he intentionally hid it from me and excluded me from the group again. I’ve blocked him and I’m really hurting and honestly feeling suicidal. I have no meaningful relationships, he was my one good friend for years and he betrayed me as well, and I don’t want to live anymore. I’ve done the best as a friend as I could and put time and effort into our relationship only to realize he was using me. I’m a loner with no friends, and even after blocking him he didn’t even make an attempt to contact me and ask why I blocked him and what not.

2473,Outrageous-Error-137,1631495683,1,"Hey all. Haven’t posted much on Reddit but been feeling lonely and decided to turn to one of my hobbies, writing. There is some satire here and not all of it is PC and it’s written from a male perspective. 

~Untitled~
I’ve been single most of my life. Although I consider myself handsome, full of personality and posses a basic level of confidence on most days.

Yet, til this day- at age 33, it’s still hard to understand how…I’m still single.

The law of attraction is very real, I believe. How have I not attracted anyone? 

I sit at beautiful Forsyth park in the heart of Savannah and just people watch. I often see very beautiful and attractive women. And often times they’re with a male partner of some sort. Albeit a relationship, friendship or acquaintances. They’re partnered together with someone.

I’d see a beautiful fair skinned girl, with red curly hair, in a dress. Walking next to some guy, who looks fine I suppose.

I’d see another couple, actually a young quartet. 2 girls and 2 guys. One of the girls, a typical young beauty of Savannah. Slim, fit with an artsy appearance.

They probably all met at SCAD. Doing a school project together. The odds were clearly in those guys favor.

Yes and clearly when it comes to me and being favored by women, I’m unfavorable.

What ever happened to all the women that like well spoken, well written, intelligent, sensitive men? Or was that all a fascade? Propaganda pushed by a committee of alpha males to sell to us lads with no father figures or role models, so that they can further monopolize the p*ssy population away from naive, average Joe’s like me?

Where are these people meeting anyway? Have these guys, who are seen with these beautiful women, mastered cold approaches and reading the minds of these women? To the point that these ladies they just decide to give the guy a chance?

Are their social lives so abundant that they’re constantly being introduced to these beautiful women that one of the ladies just happens to like them?

Is their aura so masculine and attractive that these beautiful women just can’t resist and flock to these guys?

I’ll never know, perhaps . Read a couple pick up artist books, tuned in into a few redpill YouTube videos, tried my hand at a couple of tips for attracting women. Aw what’s the use? 

It very well May be that some of us are just  destined to be lonely. No matter what positive attributes you may have that another May see in you and value- like the ‘uncool’ kid at recess waiting to get chosen for kick ball- you’re always picked last, if at all.

Defeatist mentality? Maybe. But with the majority of my post pubescent life being single and lonely- one may very well decide to come to terms with this and accept fate as it may be and look for other avenues of true satisfaction and happiness.

I get we can all use improvement, especially when it comes to wanting to attract a mate from the opposite gender or same gender in some cases. I Can get a little bit more buff, or lose a little weight, try a different haircut, become a little more confident, a little more accomplished.

But should I become a totally different person to be accepted by someone else? Liked by someone else?

I think I’ll continue write and do other things that bring me joy. Whatever happens, happens. Being single isn’t the worse thing in the world. After all, never know what May come my way. Hey now, I didn’t say that I was holding my breath for them. And at the end of the day there’s always porn hub. Lol",lonely,A piece I wrote at the park today,2021-09-13 11:14:43

I just want a genuine connection with someone for once and idk if I’ll ever find it myself. I’ve been told all my life by girls such as my own exes that they personally never found me attractive and been told by plenty of girls in school that I was ugly as well. Been told by one ex she only pretended to love me just so I’d know what it would be like to be loved and that she thought I’d be alone for the rest of my life so pretty much don’t think any of that has helped my own confidence at all. I just feel so tired of being alone and hate how I always end up being alone. I don’t even know how I’m gonna make it the next few years and I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do in life.

Being someone who finds it impossible to trust people and cripplingly difficult to open up to people. Yet I can tell when someone genuinely wants me around and who is only going through the motions because they don't want to hurt feelings. Usually I spare them the awkward feelings and just dissappear. I can leave people and not think twice about it even if we were ""close"".  Being around people just hurts me. I wasn't born to fit in or be around other human beings. No matter how hard I try it always affects my mental health badly.  Feeling happy is so often a burden cause the feeling does not last. The high is too short. Feeling low and dark and in a bad headspace is what is consistent for me. It feels normal to feel awful if that makes any sense.  To read alone and listen to music or just seek constant solitude is what I have grown accustomed to. Is it strange and or out of sorts to always strive to be unhappy simply cause it is what you know? For happiness to be foreign to you and uncomfortable? To feel that you are an unbearable person to be around and that you are a burden to the people that are in your life?

2491,TazeDaTree,1631481737,1,"Story time boys.

I met this girl 4 months ago she became my first girlfriend and the first girl I fooled with and the first girl I loved. We hung out every chance we got called eachother nightly showed each other off to our friends and family, we never fought and my friend who set us up said she could see us getting married.



The one problem with her is that she doesn't have a spine when it comes to her mother, her mother has a lot of sway with her and she does whatever mommy says. This caused some issues with her personal life that I'm not going into detail about. 



Fast forward 2 months and without talking to me about it or asking my feelings she spoke to a military recruiter and said she was joining, after that we lasted less than a week. My reaction wasn't great I asked her to explain her reasoning behind this and she never gave her reason only that her parents expect her to join, I told her I don't support this choice but it hurt me that she didn't talk to me about it first. She went and told her mother this and now her mother hates me, her father hates me, and her brother hates me.


 So we spent one last night together and it was perfect, on the way home I talked to her about going to college and I'm willing to help her get her license and join the college since the military was a bad idea, I dropped her off said I love her and went home. Next morning I call her to ask what we are doing that night and she never answered. I texted her have I pissed you off or are you angry, she sends me a paragraph text saying it's done we're no more. I call her again and she kept calling my by our pet name and I told her to fucking stop calling me that while I was in tears and she hung up on me. I texted her saying I'm willing to talk this through and try to salvage this and she proceeded to tell me what is there left to save. After that she quit responding to my texts and I dropped off a few things she left at my house.


It took me a week to process what actually happened I kept hoping she would call me and beg for me back and when it didn't happen it broke me. I cried for a hour and have been the most depressed I've been in awhile, 2 months later I feel the same way. I go through a list of emotions most nights that vary from pity to rage. 



Fast forward to last night. The friend who set us up was talking to her mother and she's been sitting at the house alone and pouting and that she decided to NOT join the military after she broke up with me so she could join. My immediate reaction was immense rage and I walked off and screamed in anger and cried in despair.


My final thoughts are why did she do this why end the one good thing you have in your shitty life to join the military and not fucking join.",lonely,Since my ex left me I've felt completely alone,2021-09-13 07:22:17

2512,bibobbjoebillyjoe,1631475848,1,"I've suffered loneliness my whole life and noticed effects that NHS doctors insisted were impossible, so decided to put my University research study to good use. I'm not just surprised by the results but amazed at how significant they were.

I've just completed a lengthy study on The Effect of Loneliness on Muscle Mass &amp; Muscle Gain. The results were startling.

Not only did participants gain considerably less muscle in the isolated (lonely) group, but this was the case even when they performed the same (set) exercises and ate the same (provided) diet.

Participants were split into groups: ""Lonely"" and ""Socialised"". The lonely group were prevented from contact with people they know (in any form), with meals delivered daily &amp; exercise routine provided. The socialised group were given the exact same conditions but were also permitted contact with friends &amp; family. There were also groups whose diet &amp; exercise plans were advised but not controlled by the study.

A few more observations from the results (diet &amp; exercise were controlled):- Loneliness increased the pain of physical tasks such as working out- Loneliness increases cortisol (this we knew already from previous studies)- Loneliness increased inflammation markers- Loneliness significantly decreased muscle gain, and in some cases it was reversed (muscle loss)- 100% of lonely participants failed to stick to their advised diet plan, while only 29% of well-socialised participants failed to stick to their advised diet plan.- Of those whose diet &amp; exercise were forcibly restricted by the study, the lonely group gained considerably less muscle mass than the socialised group, but gained more fat.- All lonely groups experienced a significant metabolic rate decrease compared to the socialised groups, regardless of diet &amp; exercise.- Brain functions were altered in the lonely groups; slower at mathetmatics &amp; logic-based problem solving after the study.

The startling result is the muscle gain being affected by a lack of socialisation regardless of diet or exercise. This means that not only is loneliness a state of mind but it effects the physical process of converting nutrition into muscle inside the body, metabolic rate, and the process of fat storage.",lonely,Does being lonely directly affect muscle mass or metabolism?,2021-09-13 05:44:08
2513,cassady_forever,1631475537,1," 

When I was younger, I made choices that allowed me to follow my dream for 35 years.  Most of the time, I worked away from home from 1 week to a month at a time.   My second marriage lasted 40 years.  It was a disaster even more than my first but I still chose to stick it out because my SO was fine with staying home and taking care of the kids.  He was a great Dad to my kids but it wasn’t so great for anyone when I was at the house.  The fighting never stopped.  Usually over a new toy he would want to buy, or because I was being pissy because I was running ragged trying to make sure everything was ready at the house before I left for work again.

Now I’m trying to deal with the aftermath and it’s not going all that well for me.  I had to stop working 11 years ago due to physical issues. I miss my job desperately.  When I was away working, I was at peace with myself and, for the only time in my life, felt like I was where I belonged.  I was alone but never lonely.  

SO died 8 years ago and I don’t miss him.  Someone told me once that what he and I had was an addiction, not love.  I think that’s true.  After I retired, I stayed with him because his health was failing and I meant it when I said my vows about “sickness and health”. His never ending mind games wore me out.  Withholding affection made me think there was something wrong with me and that I was unlovable but I didn’t walk away.  

Now it’s just me living alone, leaving the house a couple of times a month, whenever I can  make arrangements,  feeling like I’ve been sentenced to solitary confinement without parole. I don’t know how to make friends. I was an introvert from birth and my work gave me an excuse so I didn’t have to learn.  

I know when I was young that I was a flaming bitch and was pissed off at the world but I eventually worked hard to get my act together when I realized just how exhausting it is to be angry all the time. Still, I don’t believe I was so bad that I should be punished for the rest of my life to be so profoundly sad and lonely.

My biggest regret is that it’s too late for me.  I will never find someone to love me just the way I am and not expect me to change to please them.  Someone who wouldn’t push me away when I needed a hug.  Someone who loves to laugh and could appreciate my sense of humor.  Someone who is comfortable sitting quietly together without the need for talking.  Someone who would be my true friend.

I've never thought myself to be attractive but rather average if anything. However I've been told by so many people (mostly friends and family so I'm not to sure how much I should beleive them) that I'm extremely attractive and that they're genuinely surprised that I'm single. Many of the same people have also mentioned that they'd sleep with me or be begging to have me be their BF if they were a girl or if I was their type...

Cool, complementing me on my looks is a bit of a confidence booster... however, it never helps as I've never been scared of my looks but more of my personality. I'm shy and reserved, I'm way to scared to put my self out there and actually talk to girls, or just people in general as I would like to have more friends. I've forced myself to go to bars by my self a few times (only one who is 21 in my friend group) but only ever had 1 beer and barely talked to anyone and left. 

I know I'm young still and have time but I seriously feel like if I dont get a girlfriend soon and/or by the time I graduate college (2 more years to go)... I'm never going to be able to get a GF or ever get one in the future.

It doesnt help that my ""friends"" and people I went to grade and highschool with would make ""jokes"" to me all the time about how I'm annoying and am going to die alone as a single kissless virgin. Growing up and mostly after I moved, people always made fun or degraded my personality, saying I'm weird, annoying, and just down right stupid so it made it hard for me to make new friends, one of the biggest people who does that still is a friend of mine. I use to be able to make friends super easy and talk to anyone about anything but once I got to highschool I just became a really quiet and reserved person.

I know I shouldn't listen to them but Idk why I do and why I just cant put my self out there and meet people! Worst part is... when I do my friends still mock and make fun of me for it. I wonder if they're jealous because they're shy and awkward like me aswell but idk maybe I'm just looking into things to much.",lonely,I'm (21M) an attractive guy... to bad I dont have the outgoing personality to go with it...

All anyone can talk to me about is how much they are stuggling in finding a job and with their families. All I really want is to have a fun and happy conversation with someone who it’s my mom. I think my main issue is the dumb things I like. Since I was a kid I’ve been-mocked for anything I like. And even at my age I still enjoy dolls and girly anime. I used to enjoy writing stores but now everything I write just feels stupid. My friends back in college like anime too but when I showed them something I really like they would say it’s creepy or go on a rant about “capitalize” or whatever problematic thing they find with it.  But I think the main issue why I’m alone is my fear of talking to new people. Whenever I’m around a new person I get really quiet and afraid of saying something stupid. I feel it’s all my fault I’m like this and my failure to get a job and still living with my mother just makes it worst.,lonely,Everything feels horrible,2021-09-12 23:05:36

There is more to the story, like for example me breaking human morals out of pure anger and my mental illnesses, so she really  had a good reason to leave me.

It was fine for some time but I’m starting to miss her endlessly now. She was my best friend of near 2 years and we texted every single damn day. She was always there for me and I fucked it up by letting her see my bad sides. 

I just now had a dream about her visiting me  irl still hateful and angered, but not talking to me nor letting me see her face. The words ""She doesn’t wanna talk to you"" and ""Shes already over you"" crushed my heart so hard as I recoiled and woke up.

Ive tried reaching out to her on multiple occassions, even being as pathetic to try ask her only other friend if I could have a word with them, but all my attempts ended in me getting Blocked.

I really miss the friendship I had with my best friend, she was by my side every day, she was someone I could get comfortable with and talk to about anything without feeling horrible. I’m never going to find such a friend again, I really doubt it now.

Before, I’d look for people to chat with and try to make some friends. Although exciting, doing this can be a little risky. More often than not, I just end up feeling even more miserable still.

Yesterday, I tried to drown my thoughts by reading. I picked up Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami. It has been a while since I read that book. I don’t even remember what happened in the story. I read a line that struck a chord within me, and before I knew it, I just started crying. Reading lonely books has always been cathartic for me. It makes me feel less alone somehow.

Today, I woke up early, but I stayed in bed for over two hours, just listening to music. Absorbing the lyrics, bobbing my head to the melody. I love how music can give you the illusion of having a company, if that makes sense.

Then, I tidied my room, tried to work on some passion projects, and reached out to a few friends. I still feel lonely, but at least I can say that this day has been fruitful.

I do feel bad every time I made jokes, sarcasm, teasing to friends or a person I sort of cared about or affects how I think about them. It's like my sadness split me into different kinds of people, not allowing me to show any of my pains, so I covered up with sarcasm and another kind of truth instead of mine. I don't know how to feel anymore except pains. Happiness seems to be good to true and temporary, it'll fall apart eventually. Imaging knife pierces through my heart. No one volunteers to loves me. During the lockdown, I kept looking for distractions and exhaust myself, and lay on the bed without feeling tired, but my heart and mind feels really tired. I decided not willing to share with friends because none of them understand the feeling. They gauge the traumas of mine with theirs which is incomparable. The pain, loneliness, dying, anxiety, traumas for my childhood, and abandonment from my mom then my dad when I was a young adult. No one calls me, cares without me reaching out first. I need someone out there to grab my hand, PLEASE!

I am all alone at home and all alone at work with no assistance. Trying to figure it myself. I want to treat people better, but it opens up a vulnerability in sense of the being nice. I think I can be nice at the same time proactively limiting myself from being vulnerable. I feel like nobody. When I try to remove the childhood traumas, I feel empty. No values as a person. Why didn't I turn bad or seek drugs? I've been crying just listening to songs like 1800 by Logic.

(random vent)

Anyways just joined this sub cuz well... I feel alone. Maybe I don't perceive it as a feeling but definitely as a factual statement - I'm alone, there's no one in my life.

I really don't want to feel pitty about myself at times like this, cause it's mostly useless. Tho this loneliness thing is starting to shut me down. People need people. I've learned to be alone for most of my life but it gets to a point where trying to be self sufficient is not healthy anymore.

Someone I cared for just showed me a lot of disinterest and that really frustrated me. But I can't get myself to cry, nor feel anything too strongly. I'm really trying to be open to people, but I keep being shut down to the point I became a socially akward person.

Just the fact I'm writing those words in here show how much I'm lost on myself. I love myself, don't get me wrong, but it's not enough. it's just not enough.

All I could say is I'm tired, even though I really don't know if that's how I'm feeling. 

I'm over it. I'm over myself, my own company, my own soothing. I can't afford to love and care for people that simply don't perceive me. Its just.... enough.

I'm really struggling.

“Protracted loneliness causes you to shut down socially, and to be more suspicious of any social contact, he found. You become hypervigilant. You start to be more likely to take offense where none was intended, and to be afraid of strangers. You start to be afraid of the very thing you need most. John calls this a “snowball” effect, as disconnection spirals into more disconnection. Lonely people are scanning for threats because they unconsciously know that nobody is looking out for them, so no one will help them if they are hurt. This snowball effect, he learned, can be reversed—but to help a depressed or severely anxious person out of it, they need more love, and more reassurance, than they would have needed in the first place. The tragedy, John realized, is that many depressed and anxious people receive less love, as they become harder to be around. Indeed, they receive judgment, and criticism, and this accelerates their retreat from the world. They snowball into an ever colder place.”

I just finished horimiya and I loved the friendships and relationships that formed in this show. Having something as beautiful as what they have is all some of us could ever ask for, but I've also come to a realization after watching so much romance anime that it's not very realistic in the real world. Not saying it's impossible, but it's not as common or even imaginable as one would like. Still I'm not giving up hope on having friendships and/or a relationship like I see in these shows because I remember in horimiya there was this one miniscule moment that changed this guy's life for the better. From being a loner to having a loving gf and a group of great friends. Usually we shut ourselves off from the outside world because of others in the past or other reasons, we may believe we aren't good enough to be loved or maybe just given up completely, but there's honestly so many of us on this thread that are hurting I feel like there has to be someone out there for us right? Someone we can share our pain with and heal. Someone we can create our dream friendships and relationships with because there are obviously people out there who want it as much as the next person.

I 21f, have people not liking me for no reason. I’ve asked most people in my life if there’s something off putting about my behavior or vibe, and nobody can think of anything. Yet the people I meet seem to not like me that much. 

Earlier this week I asked someone if I could get their number so they could help me on an assignment. They agreed, but when I asked them a question they ghosted me. It also happened at a job I had for a few months. I was amiable and chit chatted when I could. But there were several coworkers who would act cold towards me, yell at me, etc. never could understand why. They never even had a conversation with me. The friends and family I have really enjoy my company, and those who know me like me. But I have all these people (mostly women) who act shitty towards me. I’m not ugly, have good hygiene, no resting bitch face. 

I have ADHD but it’s a mild case (don’t need accommodations). Get good grades, like art, music, nature, science fiction, etc.

Nature was rolling a dice and I was the one in seven billion to be miserable like this. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and tried so many kinds of medications to get rid of that. At one point my doctor was wondering how am I even functioning with that level of depression and anxiety. The medications seemed to work for some time but then I was back to square one soon. The reason I am writing all of these in the past tense is that I have decided to give myself a chance. A few weeks ago I told myself out loud that I don't stay depressed and miserable anymore. I have been trying, trust me y'all. I am trying really hard to stay well and focus on the positivity of life. But I don't know if it will work. I will try my hardest to get better. I have decided I won't let anything get in my way of doing so. But I have some concerns about this approach.
Concern 1. I don't know what will happen if I fail. I mean I am doing everything lately to do good for myself. I workout, meditate, drink water, go out and eat properly. I mean I feel okay. But at the same time I feel like I am faking it and forcing myself to feel good. I might get tired of it and give up at some point and that seems scary.
Concern 2. Trying to do good for me has kind of made me indifferent to things as I have noticed recently. Don't get me wrong. I haven't become selfish or anything. But I remember I used to feel so much about everything. For example, If the sky was pretty someday, I would start crying about it. I am not that person anymore. I have made myself really numb about everything and that too without any medications. I am scared and I wonder if I am on the verge of becoming a machine.

This is literally me ranting about how I feel so empty inside, alone, and depressed. This is long so I do apologize, I'll start from the beginning.

So I met this girl about 6 months ago online over some guys stream on Twitch. Me and him played a bit and the girl would randomly, jokingly flirt with me in his Twitch chat. I found out that she also streamed and one day I popped into her stream to talk to her. She was a small streamer but her viewer base was mainly guys that would always try and flirt and hit on her or donate etc. She said Hi to me and eventually we started playing when she streamed. After stream one day I DMd her and we hit it off hard. 

For 5 months straight, LITERALLY every single day from that point we did everything together online. She has a lot of trauma and mental illnesses so it started off with her just asking if we could call and talk on the phone and just stay on their all night because she didn't want to be alone. This is how every single day went: We both woke up (if one of us woke up before the other we would stay on the phone but be quiet so the other could sleep.) Then we would play games or watch movies or TV shows together online, we would be in discord the ENTIRE time. Before bed we would call each other and talk for hours in bed on the phone until we fell asleep. We would be on the the phone all night while asleep and eventually wake up, still on the phone, and repeat. This happened every single day for 5 months straight. The ONLY time we didn't do this was when we were at work, and we still texted nonstop and called on breaks.

We talked about everything.. she told me stuff she never told her own mother (she had A LOT of childhood problems and trauma etc but it's not my place to discuss this with others). She told me about everything, she opened up about everything. We know everything about each other for the most part. 

Here's where it gets sticky... we weren't ""officially"" dating. However we might as well have been.. We were together 24/7, we did sexual things on the phone, we both told each other we loved one another, we told things to each other that we never shared with anyone. 

I have been with other girls before, I've been with girls online or IRL, for shorter time periods and some for longer (longest was 3 years). This girl was different, she was special. She made me feel needed, she made me feel cared for more than the other relationships, she made me feel loved, she made me feel special, she made me feel like I had a place in the world. 

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a sad or depressed person, I was super relaxed, chill, kind of a loner with a few good friends. But i was  happy with the little I had because I didn't need anything else.

I've been hurt by other girls, I have been cheated on before, I've lost loved ones and family. But I have never felt the pain that I do now.

We were playing games one night and we were losing pretty bad. She wanted to quit and go to bed but I insisted we do just one more.... and then everything fell apart. We played with a guy that was REALLY good at this game and won. He added her to his friends list and she accepted it. A few days later she invited him to our gaming session and we voice called with him and she started acting more giggly and flirty than normal. The next day she said she promised to play with him for a bit and I was like okay. Then this  happened more often, she would hang with him more and more. I get it though, 24/7 with me and she had other friends too so yeah. Then a week later hit and she all of a sudden wanted to stop doing sexual stuff on the phone, a few days later she said she wanted to sleep without being on the phone. She said it would be just a night or so... but since then it's been never.

its been 1 and a half months since this started and our 24/7 time became her texting me occasionally throughout the day, no more phone calls, no more games, no more watching stuff, no more nothing.... 

She said me and her were never ""official"" so I shouldn't be upset. They started saying ""i love you"" after just 2 weeks of knowing each other, he plays games with her all the time, tv shows all the time, phone all the time... he literally replaced me. When we do text she gives small and vague replies like ""oh ok"" or ""yeah"" and she rarely holds a conversation with me. However on rare occasions when she has a mental breakdown or panic attack she will call me and talk to me because she knows I will comfort her and be there for her, but she will never bring up these sad breakdowns with him because she doesn't want him to be sad (he also has alot of trauma too and she doenst want to put it on him).

I tried to break it off with her and stop being friends but she called me and cried with the most heart piercing voice of not to leave because I'm her best friend and her abandonment issues. So i stuck around... Every single day I hurt because I am in love with this girl so much. 

When she has terrible problems she talks to me about it, but if she's fine or content or happy or wants to hang out she goes to him. Don;t get me wrong, I will always be there even in bad times but it's the fact that she refuses to have anything negative happen around him and uses me to throw it on. 

For a month straight I would cry myself to sleep, get 2-4 hours of sleep a night, stare at my computer screen with it turned off. I couldn't play the game I have because they all reminded me of her, I had to stop talking to friends I made because they reminded me of her. 

I started losing weight and making future plans for myself to become a Plumber and make something with my life, most of it is because I wanted a future with this girl and I knew the way I was wouldn't help so I changed. I'm currently down 50 lbs which is good but this stuff made it worse.. Not only am I losing sleep, btu the first week i starved myself out of depression, after awhile i was so weak and hurt I tried to eat normally again but it was hard. I still struggle and eat maybe once a day if I am lucky, it;s not that I don't want to, its that when i try to eat I cant keep it down or I don't have an appetite.

It's been almost 2 months total now and I am able to play the games we used to but I still have this eating problem. I sleep better now but barely, I still cry  roughly 3 times a week to get to bed. And what's worse is I still haven't blocked her and I still try and text with her daily... I can't just let her go and it's becoming a problem, I tried removing her off my friends list on some stuff and she called me crying so I readded her.. 

I don't use reddit at all, I only use it to look at memes but this past week I've been looking at nonstop posts on here hoping to find a friend to hang with. I don't need to vent to them or anything, and I am open to helping anyone that needs its. This might seem weird or creepy but I've been strictly trying to find female friends only too. I'm not looking for any sort of relationship, it's just so much easier to talk to girls about feelings than it is guys and I feel weird talking to guys about my feelings in general, even my best friend of 12 years I can't tell this stuff to.

The worst part of this is... It's my fault and I can't live it down... if I just stopped playing with her that night instead of insisting on one more game, this wouldn't have happened... I feel used and hurt and stuck and sad and lonely. I've thought about taking my life several times but not going through with it. I hate everything. I try and put on a happy face in front of people the best I can. I met this one girl on Reddit who actually stuck. She's pretty neat and we play similar games and I hope we stay friends too. It's comforting knowing I can hang with someone. 

Anyway I know most replies are gonna be to block this girl or stop talking to her, at least until my feelings end etc.

I'm not looking for help or pity or anything either, I just want to rant and type this all out and get it off my chest. To anyone reading this, thank you for taking the time to",lonely,Just Venting,2021-09-12 12:38:18

I go to an ordinary American public school and I feel like everyone are already grouped up. I take an English for immigrants class but it is still impossible to make connections because most of the students there have even worse English then me and we’re all speak different languages. I feel like it will might be too late to find a group of friends to be with, and I’ll just be alone for the rest of the school year. My mom found someone that his daughter go to my school and speak my native language, so I got her number and talk to her by text, we agreed to meet during lunch next day, it went well and she was very nice, I felt very good to finally have someone to be with during lunch. Later that day I sent her a message to thank her and she blocked me. I think it might was because of my appearance, I am not that good looking and I am very short. It’s makes me so sad to be alone all the time, to eat lunches alone on the school’s floor next to the bathroom, I feel so unconfident, I wish this period will be over I’d even rather go back to my country although it is not safe.

Let me start by saying I do have friends. Ive known them since pre school. I honestly dont know who I would be if I didnt grow up with them.

In the past few years they've changed a lot. Gone are the days of going round eachothers houses to watch movies and play games. Now, all they want to do is go clubbing, get drunk and bitch about the people they work with. None of those things interest me at all. I dont and never will drink, clubbing just sounds awful and I dont even work with them. I never would after hearing about the bitching that goes on.

I dont even know how to talk to them anymore. Whenever I meet up with them I just feel awkward. I just dont know what to say to them anymore. We're so different. We dont even have the same sense of humour anymore.

And it just feels so fucking isolating. I dont have anyone to open up to anymore. I had another friend, she was literally my fucking life and i would've done anything to help her. We lost contact. She wont even talk to me anymore. I dont even know why. Thats also given me really bad trust issues.

Stage one: I lost my friends and my girl friend. My life was in shambles and it used all my energy each day to keep my sanity and my life.

Stage two: My cat passed away and I was heart broken once again. During this time i spent most of my day mixing drugs, alcohol and smoking weed.

Stage three: I smacked myself and started hanging with the few friends i had left. The pain of rejection was starting to fade making it easier to move and and easier to lose even more friends.

Stage four: I subjected myself to sever isolation. I had at most two moments of human contact a day for over two weeks. I started hearing voices and attempted three times.

Stage five: I meet my boy friend and we fell in love with each other. Things started gaining traction and I felt good about moving forward.

Stage six: My boy friend lost his cool and yelled at me for doing such an atrocity. I also cut the rest of my friends out of my life around this time with my only remaining contact being my bf.

Stage seven: Me and my bf went into a poly relationship. We found a girl and not so long after she left us due to respectable reasons. This put intense pressure on me and my bf. I was used to it he was not.

I'm currently still living in this stage and I'm thinking of breaking up with him. I've gone through hell within the span of a year and the future couldn't look any more dark. I know I have the strength to move forward but if I had to guess I've lost half of what made me, me. I feel like a walking husk and just trying to make new friends is a next to impossible task.

I'm in therapy and I receive support from those who do still talk to me. Medication and psycho analysis can only go so far when your closest friend is someone you meet three days ago.

Symptoms I’m experiencing:

- Low energy: I feel physically weak. I’m mentally strong and come to terms to loneliness, but my body is still catching up. There are days when I need a cane to hold on to something. 

- severe heart aches: they’re not heart attacks, but the emotional pain gets so painful that I can’t tell if it’s emotional or physical anymore. I do ignore it. That’s my only option

- inability to cry nor laugh: I haven’t cried in 14 years. Haven’t laughed in 7. I recognize how things can be funny, but I don’t experience the soulful laugh when I was younger. I won’t lie I miss it. As for crying, it didn’t happen anymore. I feel that it would help alleviate the pain.

I guess she thought it was a work mates drink, rather than a date (I guess I should of made that clear) because soon after I found out she was seeing someone else. She knows how I feel about her and while she still is a good friend, that's all I ever can be.

2675,Burlesque_carnival,1631388807,1,"Yes YOU.

I appreciate you. Not enough people will tell you that in life and I’m certain you won’t feel it as much as you deserve.

You shouldn’t feel insecure today, because you… you are perfect. You’re unique and no one can take that from you. Stop comparing yourself to the world because this life is meant for you. No one else. This life wouldn’t be the same without you so I’m glad you’re here. Thank you.

When you can, say hello to strangers. Smile a lot. Even when it’s hard. Say thank you when kindness is projected on to you. Say thank you again because you can. Wave to your neighbor. Maybe they have had a rough day too.

You have a lovely home and family (pets?) Taking care of it is hard! You’re doing great though. 
Recycle. Turn off the electronics that are not in use before you leave. Shut off the lights. I know you do this already, but I remind you because we care about this world, you and I. We want our children to have a healthy environment.  I’m proud of you for eating all those vegetables this week too. Our bodies deserve the best. Be sure to wash them down with an unreasonable amount of water. Your body loves that shit. Seriously… it’s essentially made up of the stuff! 

Oh, and breathe. Stop… and just do that. Do it a lot. It’s kind of important.

I forgot to remind you how foxy you are! I would tell you every day if I could! Your style is fantastic. Wear those sexy shorts on the days you struggle liking your legs. You really need to show off those fantastic shoes anyway. Your tops pattern also goes exceptionally well with your smile. I light up when you smile! That’s the best accessory you possess. Remember you can share it. So do that. Lots. Then hug your parents and pets. Buy yourself some flowers. I do. Why not? I like them.

Enjoy your morning. Enjoy a latte at the corner cafe in quiet. Put your phone down. Watch that elderly couple laugh and daydream about the future. Watch the kid who daydreams over the pastry cabinet. Remind yourself what you want out of this crazy life. You deserve every desire you behold.

Write lists. Hide them. If it’s love you seek, you already have that. The universe loves you. I love you. I know you can’t always feel that. Even when you don’t feel like it’s enough, we never stops loving you anyway. 

I know it hurts when your heart breaks. It hurts being lonely. Just remember that it’s all for soul growth. Everyone and hardship presented in your life has a lesson ready to teach you. Stop ignoring it. Learn the lesson! They may move along afterwards, but that is quite alright. Thank them. If they caused you pain in their departure… still, thank them. If they gave you something you were missing, tell them. I assure you, you’ve grown much wiser then before. 

It’s important to tell the people who are valuable to you how you feel. Seriously… I meant now, silly! We sometimes wait until it’s too late. I know you know better though. You’re one smart cookie.

Best friends and family need protecting. Even when you’re angry. I know you must be an amazing best friend to someone. They are lucky to have you. You are kind and selfless. They love you so much. Take care of one another. Text them today… just to say, “I am thinking about you and miss you terribly.” I bet you will make their day.

Did I mention I appreciate you? I think you’re funny, witty and smart as fuck! Keep learning. You will never have enough information to use. Be strong. Make mistakes. Cry… cry it out. Be accountable by confessing to your wrong doings. I’m sure you’re aware how people respect that in you. You can’t always be right. Even though you try. Grow. Don’t look back. Always be better then yesterday. Dance. Dance too much. There is still not enough dancing! Sing too! I think your voice is beautiful!

Did I say thank you for being around? Ok. Just wanted to be sure. You kick ass. You’re strong. Because you’re a big deal and I wanted to remind you of that today.

Love,

Someone who gives a shit about you.",lonely,An Open Letter To You,2021-09-12 05:33:27

For some reason people come telling me everything is fine, I shouldn't say I'm lonely because I can say I have people...who aren't there. I don't belong anywhere, I'm merely an empty vessel doing some tasks throughout the day. It doesn't matter at the end of the day if I was there or not.

I've tried, I've done my part. Messages, questions, suggestions, invitations. With people online I can just blame myself, I'm not good enough to hold a conversation or I'm too aware of how horrible I am, so everything dies thanks to me. But my problem isn't exactly like ''how do I find more people in my life?'' 

Anyway, I'm already well aware I'm not worth it. I'm way too boring, regular media is very limited to me thanks to sexualisation, I have many problems, I'm not interesting and I don't have anything worthy to talk about.

I do feel bad every time I made jokes, sarcasm, teasing to friends or a person I sort of cared about or affects how I think about them. It's like my sadness split me into different kinds of people, not allowing me to show any of my pains, so I covered up with sarcasm and another kind of truth instead of mine. I don't know how to feel anymore except pains. Happiness seems to be good to true and temporary, it'll fall apart eventually. Imaging knife pierces through my heart. No one volunteers to loves me. During the lockdown, I kept looking for distractions and exhaust myself, and lay on the bed without feeling tired, but my heart and mind feels really tired. I decided not willing to share with friends because none of them understand the feeling. They gauge the traumas of mine with theirs which is incomparable. The pain, loneliness, dying, anxiety, traumas for my childhood, and abandonment from my mom then my dad when I was a young adult. No one calls me, cares without me reaching out first. I need someone out there to grab my hand, PLEASE!

I am all alone at home and all alone at work with no assistance. Trying to figure it myself. I want to treat people better, but it opens up a vulnerability in sense of the being nice. I think I can be nice at the same time proactively limiting myself from being vulnerable. I feel like nobody. When I try to remove the childhood traumas, I feel empty. No values as a person. Why didn't I turn bad or seek drugs? I've been crying just listening to songs like 1800 by Logic.

Sometimes I feel so lonely and miserable my chest hurts and I feel physical pain. Thought out my years I’ve wasted my life because of social anxiety. I wasted so many opportunities because I was shy and dumb. I didn’t have a good high school experience and I don’t have many friends. They say the worse kind of loneliness is when u are surrounded by people. Even when I do hangout with my friends, this feeling will hit me , I see that everyone is laughing and having a good time, but I’m just *there* and I realised I’m not having a good time. And no one notices . Most of my friends are also closer to each other than me. I feel like no one has seen the real me. It sucks I can’t share anything with anyone. 
I hate going to parties and gatherings but whenever I get dragged to one it’s always the same outcome. They just make me feel so much more alone. I feel it’s because of my social anxiety. It hits harder some nights when I realise no one in my life understands what I’m going through. I don’t even want a significant other I just want some people to genuinely like me for me and know the real me.

I always start strong and well but I can never maintain the spark, even if there is sexual tension it always is just a one night stand then I get ghosted in the morning.

Even if someone was able to look past my abhorrent looks (and let's be honest here that's a pretty big if), they'd have to put up with a chronically depressed, dying man with little money or future to speak of. My entire life goal as of right now is to save up the bare minimum I need to live out my lasts years (which are rapidly approaching) in relative peace.

What could I truly provide a partner? Love and affection? They could get that anywhere else without all my baggage and they'd be right to do so. What right do I have to even try? Even if some poor foolish woman fell in love with me, I'd only make her life worse. How could I knowingly do that to someone just because I want to be loved? No one deserves a life like that.

i like many ppl on this sub am very lonely. mainly, not having friends. Before quarantine and all stuff I did make some friends at my school but like i am pretty socially awkward to most and dont know what to chat abt, and basically i go pretty ok with them at school but online… i struggle to keep a convo going. 

i think quarantine has at least some contribution to my increased loneliness. 

I see my friends less and less, on socials they can still see me posting stuff they would just hit the like and then move on. The otherday i was scrolling thru my ins post. I noticed the ppl commenting on my posts just diminished over time, them commenting on my posts were at least some interaction with me (as previously mentioned i dont rlly text with my friends. But some how my friends all stopped even commenting and so I feel very very very very lonely. 

i overthink a lot and probably that contributes to me making friends. i often judge them for the smallest of things but i really do try to avoid it. Unsuccessfully.

 i do have one friend who i get along pretty well. But they 1) are moving to another school so i wont see them often any more 2)they told me themselves that they can easily destroy friendships by accidentally manipulating their friends. I try not to get too attached to them because ik one day or another, this friendship would end. but sometimes, they are the only person i can talk to. Haha i feel like im just leaking personal info…

now i just spend my spare time browsing thru yt and not being productive. My grades got lower also bc of this. I want to make a change from this corpse like lifestyle... any suggestions? I see ppl saying this low-social stamina stage would slowly go away and not to worry abt it but i am worrying abt it. 2 years of this probably is pretty short compared to other ppl.

So as a result of that, im not able to be myself around the few of them that I really like and its been driving me crazy for years so now I pretty much hardly talk to any of them unless they talk to me first(which is very rarely) and even then I don't say much because thats the only way I can stay out of their dumb shit.

This past year I've tried to find a new group of online friends who have no connection to my current ones, and I did manage to find about 5-7 people who I feel I could be good friends with but guess what? None of them talk to me, they are already apart of their own group of friends. I've tried talking to them, and 2 of them did kind of become my friends but we never even talk. Maybe once in a while we will message each other for like 2 days but then I don't hear a word from them for weeks or months. And we have things in common so like idk why its so hard. Im not blaming them, if I look at it from their point of view it makes perfect sense, they already have their friends(eachother) and to them I'm  just some random guy that they know exists. 

I can't break through to the next level, I can never truly become someone that they think of as a genuine friend, because they already have friends, their needs are met, they don't need me.

I've been working on trying to befriend these people for a year now, maybe a little longer and I've pretty much given up at this point.

I'm getting too old(27) everyone already found their friends when they were teenagers or early 20s.

So I feel like my only chance at having friends is with my original online friend group I've had for the past 12 years. 

So i either keep talking to the people I dislike, or be completely alone forever.

That's why I can't make myself completely cut off contact with them, because I'm scared of losing the only friends I've ever had, even though they are piece of shit manipulative liars who don't give a shit about me in the first place.

I have nobody who I can just talk to about my thoughts, I have nobody who looks forward to talking to me, I have nobody who cares what I have to say, I have nobody who wants to talk to me about their day, I have nobody who talks to me about anything.

There was this one girl I've known for a few years and last year there was a period of like 1 month where we would talk and watch things everyday together, it was effortless to talk to her, I didn't have to think about what I was going to say, I didn't have to worry about how she would react, I didn't have to keep my guard up. It was amazing and honestly probably the happiest I had felt in the past 7 years(pathetic, i know) but it didn't last.

I felt like we really had a connection so I told her that I liked her and of course she didn't like me back lol, that was the first time in my life I felt so strongly about somebody that I just had to actually tell her I wanted to be with her.

I do have one friend outside of my shitty friend group who I talk to daily for about 2 years now and I'm pretty comfortable talking to this friend but I think I got too comfortable and write too much and get no response(happens A LOT lately) so yep...

I just don't know what to do at this point.

This is gonna sound pathetic but I really wish I could get a girlfriend who I could give my love and attention too but honestly it just feels impossible for me.

Even just a friend who genuinely enjoyed talking to me would be enough but the problem with that is once that friend finds a bf/gf then I won't be important to them anymore. 

I'm nobody's #1 person, that's all I want, I want to be someone's #1 person and I want to find someone to be my #1 person. 

All of my friends have a bf/gf or a friend they like more than me, it fucking sucks.

Ive found that mentioning your depression to any friends is always a bad idea, it will just change the way  they view you. They will think you are stupid,unstable, and who knows what else. Even if they say otherwise, even if they act nice, their view of you is changed forever if you mention your depression and problems.

It sucks that it's so hard for people to be open and honest with each other.

And if this wasn't obvious already, every friend I mention are online only friends.

I've pretty much given up at this point, and I'd be lying If I said I wasn't hoping to find some friends by making this post  but the thing is I've revealed too much about myself already to anybody who read this post, you've already judged me, you already have a picture of who I am in your head. You think you know me but you don't, everything I said here is just a small portion of why I hate my life. Even though I hate life, I also love it.

At least I'm not as depressed as I once was, im not suicidal.(never truly was)

I'm just tired and done with everything.

So theres the flaw in trying to find friends here.

2748,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1631345116,1,"Well, I will quickly get the basic out of the way: I am a 32 Male from the Midwest (US) I'm a full-time student and I work as a program administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work and teach.  

Before the pandemic, I had a moderately sociable daily life. Because of the sort of work I do, my pool of new people to hangout with was constantly renewed every few months even if some of it was just for work. But, now it seems that virtuous cycle has been broken. I haven't been around anyone except close family and a few colleagues, even with things getting back to some semblance of normalcy. However, I'm still feeling starved for connection that is more than just the superficialities. It has actually began to affect me in many ways. I have a nagging, incessant restlessness in the last few months that I can't seem to shake; sometimes I drive aimlessly for hours in my city almost wishfully, hoping that someone would call or text to meet-up like earlier days. But of course, wishful thinking never makes things materialize.

I can't seen to muster the motivation to do the usual things I enjoy either, like writing music and recording (I'm a guitarist), reading ( I'm pretty voracious), writing, and other projects that keep me busy. I just pine for that kind of connection with somebody that has casual depth; that is to say, being able to fluidly shift between the banal, hum-drum things to even deeper topics, ideas, and feelings-- and back again. Well, without getting too neurotic, message me if you think this might be what you're seeking too! 

I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :)

I made some really good friends in high school, but since finishing hs it just feels like we are drifting a part. 

It seems as if they dont really care if I am part of their lives or not. Sometimes I feel like I am overreacting because you know people are busy, they cant be thinking about you like that. But it kinda hurts that I am literally always the one initiating the convos, the one asking how they are doing and all that.

I feel like I have ""friends"", but not someone that I can fully open up, someone that actually cares, someone that would actually choose me first and not as an afterthought. There are things I have been through that no one knows and it kinda hurts, I just wish I had someone that I could have those convos.

Looking back, I think I made lots of bad decisions regarding friendships that, at the moment, I didnt even realise. I guess I push people away. I feel like I just dont fit it. I dont drink, I am not really into a lot of mainstream stuff, maybe I just make it hard for others, but I dont want to change who I am/be someone else for someone to like be more.

I never had a girlfriend, never kissed, had sex (turning 20 in a week lol). It feels like I live isolated (even without the pandemic). I wonder if I will ever be able to find someone or have the guts to do so.

however, even with online friends i made, i can still feel lonely because there's always a time where you feel like ""no one understands me"" and then you refuse to be open with your online friends but at least if i really need it, i can always go to my online friends... while the lonely guys have no one. of course we girls get unwanted attentions like those sexist jerks, gross horny guys or guys who only wants to date but there are nice people out there that you'd run into. i just feel like if i was a guy, i wouldn't have been friends with my close online friends because they wouldn't have initiated first. i once had a friend who gifted me a game very early in our friendship, i asked him if i was a guy, would he have done the same, he told me ""probably not"".

i am sorry for you lonely guys out there but this is my best advice, initiate first to anyone you want to be friends with! there's definitely gonna be jerks out there that will be rude to you but at least you tried and one less jerk you deal with! you might make a beautiful friendship regardless of gender! this is hypocrite of me to advise because i don't initiate conversations which made it easier for me but i feel like it's something i can share from the other end.

Around junior year of HS I was introduced to a group of 3 people, and I finally found people who accepted me and I felt a connection with. Especially with one person. I was in a rough spot, she was too. We worked through those things together, and then we got feelings for each other and dated. It was really my happiest point, up until she changed.

Turns out she was cheating on me... she told me within a week or two of me going away for college. That and finding my 2 other very close friends were molesting a sibling of theirs....... I felt a disconnect and loneliness, worse than ever, that lasted throughout college.

Now I have graduated in May, and I look on Facebook Messenger. I see a message from her from a couple months back. I wasn't in a good place, and I also wanted closure, so I reply. We talk, and talk a lot. She then explains how she then did the same thing to her now ex after a 3 year relationship, except with a mutual friend. She tries to paint that she feels bad, but still blames him for being distant because of covid, college and work (basically down from seeing each other 3 times a week to once.... sure, ""distant"").

I soon realize that the timing of her contacting me wasn't for a supposed ""apology"" like she very shittingly gave me, it was for me to give her comfort over her fuck ups to me and the other poor guy. The nail in the coffin was when I talked about some things that were personal to me and she not only showed no reciprocation, but also avoided talking to me altogether because of it. I gave her a long-winded ""I'm sick and tired of your shit"" and got outta that. That was a little over a month ago now.

That was the only person I had what feels like a true connection with, but I realize now it's all fake. I feel like I always fuck up with the few friends I do have, I feel a disconnect from my family, and I don't feel like I can openly talk about this to really anyone.

2770,dracus17,1631338134,1,"Why, even though there are people in my life, some that genuinely care about me, are there moments of crippling loneliness? 

Sometimes all I want is a real, deep conversation with someone, just anyone. Something that leads to hours of discussion about all sorts of varied topics, all of them interesting in some way or another.

I feel a genuine need for deep, philosophical conversation, and also for talking about simple things (e.g. as simple as cooking, or a favourite series), just as long as it's meaningful.

I also feel a need to talk with someone who won't abandon or ignore me, as it seems like most people in my life fall into either category; as if every conversation I have is eventually bound to end in a message — be it a question or comment — from me that is left unanswered.

And this feeling of having people in my life, but no-one to talk to — really talk to —, is unbearably, crushingly, dry, empty and, well, lonely.

2806,GoodGosh314,1631322730,1,"So, today was my birthday - and as I continue to repeat - I have no family, friends or love in my life. I’m 100% alone despite being reasonably successful as an engineer living in Silicon Valley who has purchased a home home here.   Yeah, so, anyway, today I was considering joining a dating app - which led to the question of which one (when you’re old).  Then, I sort of forgot that most charge money. Money isn’t the issue with me - what is the issue is how dating apps just do not work if you don’t happen to look like a male model.  

Backstory:  So during the 90s and early 2000s I used dating apps.  I remember using Yahoo Personals a lot.   But, here’s how it was for me - a short, ugly, skinny male.  I’m like 5’7” and 120 pounds back then.   My experience was roughly this - I’d have to send about 100 to 200 emails to all these women before I’d get one phone call and \*maybe\* a date - maybe.  I wish I were exaggerating - but, that’s just how fickle everyone was about dating me.  A few women made a point of saying we could meet, but it wasn’t a date. Could you make me feel any more worthless?  So, yeah, after sending a huge number of emails to women about how I like to take long walks on the beach or whatever I might get a meeting at a coffee shop or something and, of course nothing ever progress beyond that.   

Believe it or not - I didn’t think too much of it at the time.  I didn’t really question it - until I ran a test.  I created a fake profile identical to mine, but using a good looking male and changing my height to 6 feet.  Other than those two things I changed - the fake profile and my real profile were identical.  Boy, was I in for a shock.  I was flippin’ bombarded with emails from women.  And, they’d send more than one email to this fake profile - in hopes of getting a response.  The crazy thing was that I didn’t send ANY emails from the fake profile to anyone. THEY were contacting ME without any effort on my part - beyond spending 15 minutes creating a profile.     My real profile had been up for years and I got zero emails (not counting porn bots - but that’s pretty obviously fake).  I responded to none of these women that had reached out to the fake profile.

After that experience it couldn't be more clear to me what the real problem was.   I might have had my electrical engineering degrees, the job and today my property is about 1 million dollars - but, it all came down to looks.  I’m ugly.   And, because of that I’ve spent my life in isolation.  

So, getting back to today.   On my birthday - I got lonely - and idly thought - maybe I’d entertain some dating site - but then the ugly memories hit me like a brick.

I feel like there aren't people who deeply care about me or understand me. When I go somewhere I put on this mask and hide my true self. The worst of all it is not like I can just put the mask down, I do want to, but I can't.

I once had a girlfriend( she was my first, and after her, I haven't had any), I even loved her. After half a year I started to slowly open myself up. I did put the mask down. But after few months she broke up with me. Of course, she said this you're a great guy, but I think she did it because of my sad vibes.

 I am too afraid of losing all of my friends too, by being myself. And the main problem is that I can't support my friends if I can't support even myself. I don't have anything to offer in friendships.
 
Some nights I have dreams where I am with a crush of mine and she in these dreams cares deeply for who I am, she supported me, told me that everything will be okay, I was loved.  In this dream I finally were myself again. And then in the morning, the reality hit me. At that point, I wish I could go back to my fantasy world, because it won't happen ever.

Not only do women not like short and unattractive men, even more so if they’re shy, sensitive, socially awkward, timid, weak and not masculine at all (sorry but r/RoleReversal is not realistic, women want dominant, masculine partners who are a challenge and women do not want to protect men, men who are bullied and do not want to emotionally support men as women find weakness disgusting), and I mean women of all looks and social levels, no woman also wants an inexperienced kissless virgin by 25. If you do get lucky you should lie about your virginity and lack of dating experience, but it’s probably over for you. You missed out on young love, you missed out on love without responsibility and seriousness, where you having a good job, your own place and money didn’t matter. You missed out on things your younger peers got to experience that you won’t. Women are miles more experienced than you. They don’t want to be teacher to a clueless, nervous man who has less experience than some 13 year olds. It’s over. 

Face it. I’m 25 and never been on a date or had my first kiss, because I’m ugly, chubby (my fault), short, socially awkward, sensitive, emotional, shy, anxious, sad, possibly autistic. I still with my parents and have been unemployed for almost 3 years (though I’m applying for jobs, they’re crappy minimum wage jobs since I only have a community college degree), and am a lonely NEET. Meanwhile, most of the people I knew from school have nice jobs, nice cars, are getting married and are having kids. The fact that I’m an ugly, manchild loser is bad on it’s own, but the fact that I’m a kissless virgin on top of that at 25 is just a massive red flag. It’s probably over for me. Even if I do find a relationship, it’ll be with a woman who settles for me after years of fun with hot guys who doesn’t actually find me attractive. 

“It’s been hopeless for a long time, from the very beginning. You will never represent, Raphaël, a young girl’s erotic dream. You have to resign yourself to the inevitable; such things are not for you. It’s already too late, in any case. The sexual failure you’ve known since your adolescence, Raphaël, the frustration that has followed you since the age of thirteen, will leave their indelible mark. Even supposing that you might have women in the future — which in all frankness I doubt — this will not be enough; nothing will ever be enough. You will always be an orphan to those adolescent loves you never knew.”

-Michel Houellebecq, Whatever

  Over the quarantine, I’ve concluded who my real friends are and who isn’t. I only have 2-3 friends at school but two of them
have more friends than me so everytime i ty to talk to them at school, someone just takes them away and I have to just walk somewhere else. The other friend is also by herself too and she’s my best friend but I have zero classes with her and only see her in the halls for three minutes and have lunch with her one 1-2 times in the week. Any other day I just sit alone outside or on the floor inside. 

In 9th grade I always had someone to walk, eat or had a class with but not anymore.  This junior year I have ZERO classes with anyone I know other than biology. On top of that, I dislike the classes I picked out now as well. Everyone has their own friend groups so they probably won’t talk to you consistently. The only time people have said something to me was when they wanted to compliment my outfit. I hardly speak all day. Normally, I like being alone but it is very awkward to have no social life at school b/c it’s awkward. I only talk to my online friends throughout the day. 

I’m tired of being told highschool is supposed to  be the best 4 years of my life when I’m going through this. 9th grade was not fun but it was tolerable. I felt like I was going to cry at the end of the day on Wednesday and when I got home I ended up crying (I also started crying typing this). 

I just feel like a loser and a bitch and I feel like it’s going to affect my class performance or something that’s all.",lonely,I’m alone at school and extremely sad(16F),2021-09-11 10:26:59

But the hole inside my chest is bigger each year and I didn’t have succeed to resolve this problem. I try hard to find new friends since nine years (I am 32 years old) to fill that hole. It’s complicated outside the work because I don’t have much time to do that. And at work, I had some good moments with colleagues but no new friend since nine years. Why it’s so hard for me to connect deeply at work ? Each two years, I find a new job with the hope to do better next time to find friends (and better than zero is quite easy). Now it’s time for me to find a new job and it’s so hard because I’m quite sure that I will never find the place where I can work and be at ease, at peace and find at least a great friend.

I don't even know where to begin.. 15 years old, had scholarships left and right for hockey, was lined up for potential draft picks at 18, got 6 concussions in a row, some overlapping, devastated me as that's all I was good at. 16 years old I lost my Grampa to cancer, he was like my dad though, adopted by my grandparents as a baby in the last court session before I was to be put in the system and he stood up and adopted me without a word said to anyone else, purely out of the kindness of his heart and his own will. He meant everything to me and then when I was hurting most I had to move towns and change schools, but before he passed I started dating a girl who helped me through it all and I ended up filling all the holes in my heart with her. Then after 11 months of drinking every weekend with my buddies to just forget I finally fucked up and cheated, never meant to, walked out mid way after I realised what I was doing and sobered up so nothing happened anyways. The next couple months were rough but we made it work and fixed things (more or less both forgot about it) and then after 2 years she's living in her university dorm and cheats just under ten times with the same guy and was thinking of leaving me just to fuck him as he was cheating too and wasn't prepared for a relationship... Anyways I forgave and moved on, during this whole ordeal I had been kicked out of my grandmothers and experienced a month of homelessness, mom came and picked me up finally and took me to the city I currently live in and let me stay there till I was 18, the entire time I couldn't find any work and ended up dealing until I was 18 and I didn't have enough money to find a place of my own and she moved on with her life and left me there with nowhere to go so I was homeless for another couple months, this time though couch surfing instead of staying behind a gas station. Anyways saved up enough money to get my own place and then began letting my ""friends"" stay there and deal so we could pay rent together and that was honestly the best part of the entire past 5 years... Even though it only lasted 8 months and then my girlfriend came home from working remotely and I found out she had cheated again.. But I had nowhere to go.. So I forgave again and now here  years later, three quarter ways through a 2 year lease with both our names, multiple pets... Etc. And Im just now realising that it's not what I want... I've been coasting for 2 years content with the stability and now there's someone else in my life causing me to feel things I forgot about and thinking ways I haven't thought in a long time.

So; I met this girl during my first year of uni (online) after having joined a student society. We met through one of her friends, who happened to be the society’s co-prez. We started as friends, gradually becoming closer and then confessing our feelings for each other. Fast forward to a few months later, family and work pressure made it nearly impossible to see her (which she made clear she wasn’t happy about). It was either I gave her more time, or we break up. At that point, work and family had become unbearable. I decided to break up (yes I know dumbass decision on my part I’ll take all the blame). We broke in the middle of summer and everything didn’t seem so bad, as I was socially isolated anyway because of Covid restrictions and was really busy with work. However, school recently started and I noticed my friend circle (that were closer to her than me) completely stopped hanging out with me even though we had spend so much time bonding together. Even my close friend, who I had known before having met my ex, stopped talking to me and took my ex’s side. 

I’m now alone, not sure how to get out of this loneliness. Making friends is hard. I’m spending my uni days eating alone and staying in the library after classes ends. Days feel like a continuous loop of lobulées.

If anyone had any similar experience, please let me know how you managed and share how you coped. Or just let me know any advice in general in how to make friends. Thanks!",lonely,Broke up with my gf and now I lost all of my friend circle,2021-09-11 10:02:25

When I show up at school I'm this joyous, happy and positive guy, I got into one of the best schools in my country(It was really hard to get in, like the first 300 people from all over the country) and to be part of a group I tend to act as if I'm smart, but in reality that is annoying to lots of people around me. I feel like there aren't people that deeply care about me or understand me. When I go somewhere I put on this mask and hide my true self. Recently it came to my mind why I am doing all of this. The worst of all it is not like I can just put the mask down, I do want to, but I can't.

I once had a girlfriend( she was my first, and after her, I haven't had any), I even loved her. After half a year I started to slowly open myself up. I did put the mask down. But after few months she broke up with me. Of course, she said it was her fault, but I think she did it because of my sad vibes.

 I am too afraid of losing all of my friends too, by being myself. And the main problem is that I can't support my friends if I can't support even myself. I don't have anything to offer in friendships.
 
Some nights I have dreams where I am with a crush of mine and she in these dreams cares deeply for who I am, she supports me, she helps me to get back on my feet and be myself, I was loved. I was in the right place.  And then in the morning, the reality hit me. At that point, I wish I could go back and live my dreams.

2823,That-Map9685,1631314799,1,"This is the perfect place to write it down I guess. I know how people, that came here for seeking inspiration, distraction, being interested in how others deal with lonliness or other those who have other background stories why they came here feel. Just being alone for a day doesn´t mean you are lonely, but if you get the constant feeling everyday that you don´t find peace and joy and happiness with anyone, then that feeling disctracts you, makes you really thoughtful and comes up again and again, sometimes stronger, sometimes its rather in the background, but its there. I never noticed how lonely I actually was because everyone went so fast. I think the beginning of the pandemic, the restrictions, the lockdowns affected all our social lives heavily. There was this sort of strange feeling, that many are living on their own now. You would not actually notice it during the first lockdown because it was all new, but when the normal live began to get up and running again, I am sure many of us began to get the feeling that I mentioned before. If I spoke for myself, then I´d say that my personality has changed drastically after the last year, and it remains stilll changed. I had my few ups and downs here and there and until this summer everything went just a little bit up and then a little bit down again. I just knew how to deal with it and I managed to live with it. The situation is kind of messed up because I am either an extrovert or a total introvert, but I always felt sort of different and thus I felt lonely and I still do at some point. And then you get to that point where you see a light and you reach for it, a human that seems to have the same weirdness as you do appears. You talk for hours, everyday and even mess up your sleep cycle just to talk to that one random girl that appeared out of nowhere. Then you meet, she looses the interest in you and gets attracted by your actually-nice mate that you took with you because you want to spice up the atmosphere by being a bigger group. You talked too much, cared too much and suddenly her affection for you and your mate is gone. They pretend they never knew you and you slip right back into feeling lonely again - the point where you started. That was a background story, not my main problem right now. The past weeks I have been noticing what a weirdo I was, I either deactivate my inner filter completely or I dont even talk at all, so I can switch from extrovert to introvert like immediately because yes, I am an overthinker. I overthink every situation, every conversation, just everything. And now... I  came to a point where I want to change my lifestlye, I just noticed how unmotivated I have been for the last couple of months and overhtought everything so much that I even thought that it would not be worth it starting a conversation because I would get disappointed anyways. I compared myself to everybody, adapted myself to everybody and all the time I had the feeling that I am the worst weirdo of all time. But as I said before, now with the start of the next school year next monday, I want to see things differently, I want to enjoy things differently, I have like so much planned to change. I will start to grind sports, keep on practicinig things on the piano and get to socialize. I am sick of the half-hearted people in my class, all avoiding me because I sort of have social anxiety and I show that too much. To everyone who is still reading this and got a similar feeling, please do not have doubts in yourself. Everyone you do not feel appreciated by is just not worth your time, find people who treat you as you would treat them and make efforts like you do. And dont let anyone effect your vibe, your inner atmosphere. Furthermore, do not stick to the people that harm you mentally, or make you doubt that you are unique. You are unique in every way human history can even imagine.

Before the incel hunters come at me, I don't expect sex nor do I expect a long-term relationship right away : since I have no experience, I just wish I had opportunities to meet women, learn to socialize and maybe, with a little bit of luck, get a date.

I might be introverted, but when you never spend time with anyone, never share anything with anyone, it gets depressive at some point.
Some nights I just want to let it all out, just cry big time and release some steam, but I don't even remember the last I cried, feels like my brain forgot how to do it.

In highschool I thought I had time, that I would meet someone by luck, I thought I just had to wait for the opportunity to come.

I don't understand why I get treated so badly and isolated from the rest.

I don't even have a friend to talk to. Everyone has people texting them on phone or snapchat. People in real life hate me so the Internet is the only platform I have to turn to. I try my hardest to get some real answers as to why I'm so lonely but I don't get them. 

Why is it that I don't deserve anyone to talk to? Why is it that others can do as they please yet me being quiet and keeping to myself get the most hate from others?

Being left there all alone?
Somedays I’ll see the light,
Then sucked up, back to fight. 
I will stand, raise my fist,
Sharp knife, deathly grips,
Bury deep in my chest,
Not my fault, I’m the best. 
Yeah you sealed my fate;
Wanting me but it’s too late. 
Going fast, deadly speed. 
It is you planting seed. 
Much to give, none to lose. 
Time to end this lonely cruise. 
Who are we to judge the wrong;
Being left there all alone?
Buried deep in the sand; 
No-one’s walking on that land. 
Buried deep in the dust;
Understand all their lust. 
I am done, life is gone,
Bleeding, I hit the stone 
Who are we to judge the gone;
Being left there all alone?
Silent cries, sobbing souls. 
Who are they? We both know.

2853,nunuhoho,1631302204,1,"32. F. I’m heartbroken and sad. I need some support.

I can’t be left alone with my thoughts. 

I just got rejected 5 months ago, it is because I assumed he didn’t want me. Still don’t know how to forgive and stop blaming myself for this. 

He is my colleague. Had a crush on him when he was going thru a divorce, didn’t act on it. Only got close after he was officially single. We confessed and Had a great time, but my negative thoughts caused me to assume that he didn’t want me enough to get together. 

Initially we agreed to stop seeing each other but I wanted him to reconsider his decision. He didn’t want to. It’s so difficult because we are a 3 man team and I see him every day, laughing and being fine while I’m crumbling and crying at the sight of his smile. In between, bosses got to know. One is kinda supportive, one isn’t (his brother). Kinda feel it’s unfair to me but I guess I understand the complexities of it. Already proved with this heck of a mess. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Breaking down in office alone has become a norm. 

I’m in HR so he has to report to me for his leave etc. Earlier today He just told me that he is going to travel for two weeks, and one of the countries he’s visiting is where his ex-wife resides in. Naturally I broke down again hearing this…

I just want to feel better. I don’t want to spiral into sadness and feeling hopeles. Please help me. I need lots of kindness and help and tenderness.

If you can, please do spare me some kind words to get me through. :’)

but right now as i write this, almost 3 am, alone in my room, listening to music, i feel really nice. i feel clean, i feel happy, i feel motivated to do stuff. im doing work rn but as i was vibing to music i realized i actually feel great. and i had to express it. and maybe this is the start of me getting better again, i hope. 

after work, im gonna clean my room, because it's been really messy, and gonna be working out and take a walk with my brother later morning. he also invited me to eat ice cream for breakfast.

I've been invited to hang with my friends and shit, but I just sit there laughing at other people in the group and so I just dropped out of the group because I felt embarrassed that I don't add anything and didn't wanna come off as a loser

I was talking with a girl over the summer, but I've only realized recently that I was probably annoying her. It's been two weeks and not a word from her.

A few years ago my siblings left me traumatised because they didn’t approve of a relationship I was in and were so mad that I didn’t tell them. I told them gradually but they were so mad with me that they ended up telling our mum without me knowing and then our mum pretty much stopped talking to me and blamed for everything saying I’m disobedient and disrespectful to her etc. I also hid my relationship out of fear of expressing myself, not out of spite but they spun the story out of proportion to make it look like I did. They then interrogated me for an entire 5-7 hours demanding me to give them a timeline of my relationship e.g. when our first kiss was, when we hooked up, and other really intimate details etc. It was absolutely horrible. I never said a word to stand up for myself because they screamed back at me and told me to stfu and listen as if I committed a crime. To top that off they ignored me for two weeks, we’re in the same house so they ignored me the entire time, posted photos together on social media knowing I’d see it. 

Ever since then, I’ve been struggling with abandonment issues and loneliness for the past 6 years. I’ve never felt so lonely in my life.

However, last year I started going to therapy to heal myself from everything and it went really well for me! I rekindled with my family again and they apologised to me which I really appreciated. 

That all well until this week. 

I had a terrible trigger that hurt me so bad that I’m currently isolated in my room away from them because I’m really mad and upset at them. I’ve been crying all night. They also didn’t even realise what they did until I told them today so that’s what hurts even more.

Lets be honest here. We know the reason we're in this situation is because of being ugly. The worst part is we can't really do anything natural to change our face, we can only bring out the best in it. 

We ugly people should just accept that we will never be the PRIORITY. We will always be the last option.

Or we can just wait to be in our 30s or 40s because thats the only time girls will pick partners not based on their looks.

2928,BadWinter3256,1631253199,1," Closeted guy here —
          I still think about this boy who’s last name is Knight. We met in a four week semester course of a class about interpersonal communications. 
He &amp; I shared similar interests and finished each other’s jokes. We always understood what we would struggle to say at times and Knight was just one very nice boy.
He was so nice to me that I misinterpreted it. I fell for him and eventually I got too obsessed with him until he noticed (he was definitely straight) and— well Knight distance himself away from me until we no longer talked.
        Our “friendship” only lasted for like two months but during those two months, I was at my happiest because NO ONE else in my life ever made me feel heard, wanted, &amp; cared for like he did. Every time I made him laugh, my heart fluttered like crazy. OR the two times he asked me to hangout, my mind would explode of happiness. 
      Last time I saw him was in 2019 and now he lives in Idaho. I have no contact of him what so ever. (Technically, he’s on my friends list on Venmo, but that’s about it lol) I’m sure he forgot about me and if he were to remember me, I’d know for sure that he would do whatever to forget about me. 
      I also still feel very awful to this day, that I became so obsessed with him. I couldn’t help it simply because I’ve never been treated so great. If my present self were friends with him during the two months we hanged out, [We would still be friends.!]
Being gay and closeted is one of the worst feelings.

2947,IsaacAsshimoff,1631244177,1,"Hello out there. This is my second year of uni. I’m more than halfway through both it and my degree. I haven’t made a single friend. I had one night out last semester, which was our first in-person teaching period, and couldn’t relax at all, even after 9 hours of constant drinking. 

Now, to be clear, this year is so much better than last year. I was in student accommodation with this misogynistic fuck who used to brag about his sexual exploits and had an Uber eats bag full of eggshells sitting on the living room floor. He was filthy. In 9 months we had three conversations. I fell into a deeper depression, which I hadn’t really thought possible. Two months earlier I was with a friend through his drug-induced psychosis. He has cut all ties with me. Anyway that incident had crippled me psychologically, alongside a lot of concurrent trauma that I was uncovering. Somehow, though, I got much much worse over the course of the year.
Recently I met my neighbors, after they more or less forced themselves into my life against my will. I appreciate it so much. They’re truly lovely people, and we’re friends, which feels great, but I still feel like I’m stifling myself whenever I’m around them. They’re moving in a few weeks. I don’t know how I’m going to cope. I’m in a new city, I have pretty crippling anxiety and depression, my teenage years were spent unhappily at boarding school where I essentially played a character for four years (including adopting a new accent and interests to fit in), and I don’t know how to cope with relationships.

Uni is a completely nightmare. The tutors are pretentious, the classes are tedious, and everything I’m learning could have been imparted just as easily by a reading list. 

One of my only friends in the country, who hasn’t spoken to me in a few days because he was dumb enough to cheat on his girlfriend with my neighbor and I took her side, lives on campus. He complains about it a lot, but Christ I envy him. The idea of having an in-built community is absolutely intoxicating to me. Just having people recognize your face, having somewhere to interact on a casual level without the pressure of being in public, or the fear that you’re going to screw up your only opportunity to be social, means so much more than he’ll ever understand.

I dream about finding somebody who could love me, but it feels fruitless. Nobody really knows me. I’m not sure I do, either. I’m trying to improve myself, I’m getting treatment for my mental illness, and I’ve definitely noticed an improvement in my state of mind in public and during minor interactions, but I still never feel authentic.

Anybody out there know what I mean?",lonely,University loneliness,2021-09-10 13:22:57

So I went to a concert with my sister and her friend, we’ll call her Denise. Ive hung out with Denice once before when my sister has parties or get togethers or whatever, but I’m usually shy and quiet until I get to know people better. At this concert, i think Denise was coming onto me a little bit, she kept sticking her fingers in my mouth, touching me, grabbing me, dancing with me. It was fun, she’s engaged so I don’t think I want to do anything, but I was having some fun. 
Anyways, it got me thinking that i don’t really want a girlfriend, i don’t mind being alone. It’s not really something I need right now and there is people who are interested in me, I also recently got hit on by a gay man, and it was kind of a relief in a way, i cant sit here and say no one is into me anymore, I can’t say I’m undesirable or anything like that.

I’ve never had a girlfriend and I just can’t really hold conversations with people.  and play varsity sports and workout consistently. I also can’t approach girls and start getting red when attention gets brought to me. What just made this worse was that I was at a party with friends and I was talking to an extremely pretty girl for half an hour or something like that. I added her on snap but she isn’t adding me back. For me it makes me seem undervalued. I also have the driest phone known to man and i always have to start snapping people to interact with them. I basically just want a relationship with someone😅.

Once I became suspicious that they were dating someone already I downloaded Tinder out of spite and wanted to show them that I was just as ready to move on. However, once I truly did find out that my partner was dating someone knew I felt even worse. I told them how it made me feel and that I was truly was struggling through this time period, but I was called out for my hypocrisy for downloading Tinder.

3005,BrauseBonbon,1631220746,1,"So maybe this sounds weird, but I guess it is part of my life. 
Even though I would not admit it, I have no friends, it does feel like it. It is hard to describe, but I will try my best: 
I know quite a bunch of people, I would refer to others as ""friends"" even though I don’t know if this is accurate.
I am volunteering a lot, and we have a weekly meeting of our organization. There I meet most of my friends. And besides the events, we organize, this is often times the only time we meet in a whole week. Since I only live in a small town, I have known most of them since I was a child, and we have not met because of the volunteering as well. But still, I feel lonely most of the time. Yes, I do see them besides that. I do get invited to birthday parties and rarely some friend group events. But when I am at home afterwards, I feel alone as ever. 
On Monday, I asked a few friends, if they wanted to try a new restaurant on Thursday (today). A few agreed, but those, who agreed, besides one friend, canceled last minute. So because only two of us were left, we decided to postpone our dinner. To be honest, this probably would have been the highlight of my week.
For me, it takes quite a lot of courage to ask my friends, to do something, because I fear rejection. But I try to still do it, but I often fail, and I really don’t understand why. If I meet my friends, we seem to get along really well, but most of the time, my phone stays dry. I know that they meet each other besides the events/meetings often. Not even the whole group all together.
I just want to get asked to hang out or have a normal conversation.
Has anyone experienced this? It feels like, I am alone yet having friends. From the outside it probably looks like, I have a working social life, but I really don’t. Uni starts in about a month and I really would like to enjoy the time with my friends, but nobody seems to care. I can’t even remember, when somebody asked, how I was. Even though there is not much happening in my life right now, I would still like to share some of it, but there is no one. Throughout the day, I sometimes fantasize about talking with my friends about what had happened and how they would react, to compensate.

The date was great. But there's a catch, she already has a boyfriend. I mean she loves him, but he doesn't love her that much I guess, because she is always sad because of not getting the deserved attention. And she is the most beautiful girl from my workplace. That's why I was shocked when she asked me out, because I am a below average looking guy. She also gets jealous when some other girl gives me attention. So here's is the thing, I asked her would she like us to be a couple. She directly declined. Said it is impossible because she already has someone and she loves him. For her and for my best friend (who left me) I am just the good guy who is available whenever they feel like. My best friend comes to me to get relationship advice for the guy for whom she dumped me. I am not a rude person, rather soft, and I try to help people if I can. I am 24 years old and I've never had a ""girlfriend"" so far. My best friend was the closest thing to a girlfriend. So I really thought I could hit it off with this new girl and finally have someone I can refer to as ""my girl"". Hell, she asked me for a 2nd outing too after the first one went great. So I'm really confused. What girls really want? Am I the ultimate loser or what ! Was I just a timepass for her while her proper boyfriend was not giving attention.

I've had a lifelong disability, and in the last few years I've had worsening health, and have gone from crutches to a wheelchair.  And, kiss of death, I don't have a job, or rather, I feel like my job is survival.  No, I don't mooch off the people around me.      
So, once in a while, a ""new"" person will talk to me, or respond to me.  I've found that I am developing a sort of pre-emptive fear of the ""Oh?  You don't have a job?  Fuck you, loser.""  Not always in those words, but yeah... I can't count how many (mostly women) have shut me down in an instant when they find out that my life is not going so well.    
Sometimes it's just a ""I don't want someone who will make me sad.  Uplifting people only!""  Sometimes, much, much worse.   
So I developed a pre-emptive fear of this rejection and actually withdraw from chances to make new friends.  I think I've ""blown it"" at least few times. But I simply am not in a place where I want to be called a ""useless garbage hobo"" again (true story.)  Seemingly ""nice"" people have turned in an instant on me when they learn about how ""well"" I'm doing.  And it's not like I was moaning and moping and doing a ""poor me"" to them when it happened.      
So the withdrawal, it's a ""survival"" technique, but it's likely not a good one.

Or so I thought.

3 days ago we were flirting and she started trying to make that into a sexual experience. I stopped her and said I dont want to do this right now. Since I just didjt want to. Since then she has either ignored me, not replied back and just making me feel like absolute shit because we didnt have sex.

It's annoying adf because ei thought someone actually liked me for me, but I guess people will say anything to get their way. The thing is I dont even get it, I'm not like the greatest looking person in the world if anything I'm average so why would anyone actually want to just use me for sex anyway?? It makes no sense.

On top of that ive found out my abusive ex has not only kept my nudes but she has also shared them with other people. I dont know how long this has been going on but someone who's friends with her and myself, sent me a photo of a chat they had about me and the ex ended up posting a photo of my nudes.

Yet again... why? I dont get it.

Isnt that shit illegal??? 

I came to this subreddit lonely asf, speaking to nobody being truly alone. And now I have people to talk to, and I somehow feel more lonely. I'm.juat so annoyed at this point. (Also this isnt any hate to anyone I've met and speak to on this subreddit, everyone has been extremely lovely)

3037,krispyyyykremeeee,1631197521,1,"So I (23F) haven’t really been seeing my friends often as is because of my eating disorder and also cuz I’ve been needing space to recharge my social battery in general. Yesterday I decided to hit up one of my best friends (23F) to see how she was doing cuz I hadn’t seen her in about a month. I went over to her place and we got to talking and she started telling me all about her relationship problems, she’s been with this guy for about 3/4 years now but she was telling me she was considering leaving because he’s not making the changes she’s been asking him to in order for them to move forward. 

I told her I’d be supportive regardless of her decision and I know how hard it is to force yourself to leave a long term relationship even tho you don’t want to but that sometimes it’s in your best interest. She replied to that saying she understands where I’m coming from but that if she leaves what is she gonna go back to? Sleeping around and being a “thot” (as she put it)? And it’s like she completely undermines my experience as a woman yet again because I’ve been single for almost a year now and I haven’t been sleeping around like that because I’m not too into hookup culture. 

But she acts as if the only two options are being happy, or in this case unhappy, in a relationship or being single, lonely and sleeping around. I fell out with this guy I had grown to love about a month ago and she gave me this whole pep talk about how being single isn’t the worst thing in the world and all this other bullshit that just confirmed it was bullshit because of what she’s saying now about her current relationship. I get that maybe from an outsiders perspective it’s probably a little sad all things considered because I’ve been there, begging someone to change and giving them chance after chance because I want to make things work but knowing you’ll probably eventually have to leave. 

But still I guess I’m just bitter over the fact that even if she does get out of the relationship I don’t think she’ll ever feel lonely for as long as I have. And she’s been my best friend since we were kids, I hope she’s not but it’s like fuck if I don’t have her talking to me about her relationship it’s both of my other best friends talking to me about theirs. I’ve told them all about how lonely I feel so idk why they can’t just be mindful and understand that I don’t want to hear about their stupid relationship problems because at the end of the day they still have someone. It’s like if they were starving and I was telling them about how they didn’t have the right cut of steak at the restaurant I went to, or maybe that’s a bad analogy but you all get the gist.",lonely,Over listening to my friends talk about their relationships,2021-09-10 00:25:21

3039,IrishSteel75,1631192788,1,"I am told by so many people how I will find that special someone, or how I am such a catch, such a great guy, will be the best boyfriend/husband. I told this by not just family and close friends but by many more! I am annoyed by it so much and enraged by the fact that it annoys me because these are sincere amazing things to be told that I know other people would love to hear! Still I hate hearing it! Worst one is ""you will find that special someone"" to which me (M33) will sometimes reply (more frequently now) ""when?"" Or ""how much longer?"" And ""if you know I will can you describe her in any way? Or tell me specifics on meeting her?"". It's all depressing sarcasm because of course they don't know but I guess I am just trying to convey that telling me this over and over and over again for years without anything working is taxing on me. 

Sorry for anyone reading what I think and have been told is just whining but I have tried! I have tried for years! You name the thing to go out and meet a potential partner or just a girl to hangout with and I have tried it many times with either failing or just coming up short. 

The only close or intimate time I have had with a girl in the past few years? (been so long I have forgot) has been paid for. Apologies to anyone who would find that offensive as I do not think low of any woman who chooses to do that and honestly if I hadn't chose to go that route I would be worse off mentally. While I chose to do it and the only real regret is that I could have used that money for debts and all. Also over the years it has become less and less helpful, I would enjoy the moment but later would almost forget it happened. I would have had s‐x but since it wasn't with someone special and had its limits my mind would phase it into some less important thing! But as I find myself craving attention from a woman I keep finding my doing it again and again. 

Back to my original rant (thank you to those still reading and considering) but I get so annoyed and upset when people say for me to just ""go out and find a girl"", they give off this impression like it's just as easy as shopping for groceries. In my mind going out seems like this annoying and mentally exhausting chore, it has become so bad that I have it in my own thoughts! I will try to imagine a date but get already annoyed at how much I will have to prepare myself for a simple dinner or meet for coffee! That scares me that I have become numb or used to this but also self aware! Stuff drives me crazy. 

I workout as much as my mental motivation let's me but sometimes I get burnt out. Video games help but like so much else I even get tired of those. Hobbies, learning, exploring, etc. All bring me back to the fact I spend night after night after night alone, mostly wondering what I did wrong with one of the many women liked and wanted to be with. I can't remember a day where I truly felt free from a thought of how I think.

Please feel free to ask anything about me if you are curious on what I have tried/done but please be respectful as I can't or choose not to give out too much info.",lonely,"Encouragement, Compliments, and Hope causing the exact opposite reaction people intend.",2021-09-09 23:06:28

3047,LonelyGal22,1631181710,1,"Sorry this is a long post😔 I’m new to reddit and have posted it on another reddit page.

As the title suggests, I am massively struggling when it comes to friends and I have for years now. 

I have a boyfriend of 6 years and I am very close with my parents. I also have a sister who I speak to (but we aren’t super close in regard to speaking every day as she lives a very busy life). 

I just feel very withdrawn from people outside of my family. I do have a friend who I’ve known since I was 11. However, we rarely speak except for the holidays and Xmas. 

I had a pretty big group of friends in high school. However, one girl really fancied a guy (my boyfriend) and when she found out he liked me, she kinda turned the whole group against me. I was no longer invited anywhere, new group chats were made and I spent the last 3 months of 6th form pretty much alone. 

At uni I kinda found it hard to make friends. Everyone seemed to make friends because they lived in halls but I lived at home. I had people who I would speak to in lectures but I just never seemed to be able to develop it into a friendship. 

It’s the same at work. I used to work in a Crown Court and all the staff were around my age but I just never felt like I could develop work colleagues into friends. Now I work somewhere else where most staff are 15-25 years older than me so I feel like we’ve nothing in common. 

When I really sit and think about it, I think it might simmer down to some kind of social anxiety. I am not “socially anxious”. I can talk to groups, i don’t feel shy if I meet new people. It’s just stepping from acquaintance to becoming friends I have trouble with. I always feel like people don’t like me. I always get this overwhelming feeling that people, for whatever reason, just don’t like me. I don’t do anything to annoy people or anything and I’m mindful to be kind and thoughtful of others. So I don’t know why my mind is set to think like that. I daren’t make the first move because I feel like I’m unliked (for some weird reason) then when I’m not included in things with people I know it reinforces my original thoughts. 
 
I just don’t know what’s wrong. But just lately I keep thinking about how if it wasn’t for my parents, sister and bf I would literally never speak to anyone outside of work.

3067,ubergw,1631163138,1,"This is a long one, but necessary please provide insight:


My ex and I moved into the same small apartments on this quaint beach walk street. She was just out of a broken engagement and I was finally getting my life together after having an addiction to opiates.  The first time I saw her, I thought she was incredibly gorgeous however I could see the pain in her eyes. Having been in a long term relationship and almost married, she needed time to explore.  I also had a failed relationship of seven years, and one other relationship of a few years I knew I needed time and was only interested in friendship. 

Eventually we did start hanging out and having more frequent conversations.  The first time we hung out outside of the apartment courtyard we went surfing.  It turned out to be a magical morning.  We floated and talked, eventually holding hands when a seal popped up right behind us.  Afterwards we had breakfast burritos and had our first of many deep conversations.  The hand holding was our only physical contact for us over the next year. I eventually started dating some one and so did she.  We would still grab dinner every now and then and catch up.  Both of us never discussed our relationships other than surface things which is how it should be. I wasn’t interested in emotional cheating and she respected the relationship boundaries.  My relationship went on a break and  I believe at the moment she was single she mentioned she was only looking for fun but I wasn’t wanting a fwb or a one time fling. I eventually got back with my ex and she did as well and the pandemic hit. She went home and I stored her packages. We stayed in touch and when she got back in town we had dinner. I started to notice she wouldn’t bring up her boyfriend and would be vague about who she was doing things with. I had just been cheated on and my heart was hurting so I was hyper aware. I had a recording session coming up and she wanted to go so I took her with me.  That night was like a movie and I realized out of respect for her boyfriend this wasn’t right of us to be hanging out late at night like this.  mind you i always paid for everything she never once offered to split the bill.(that’s no issue I don’t mind paying but that’s date manners not friends) so it took me a few days but I typed an email and sent it to her cause I didn’t know if I could do it over the phone or in person without cowering. She responded a few days later saying how all her favorite memories were with me and she was happy in her current relationship but she still wanted to hang out with me.  A few things stood out to me. I never said she wasn’t happy I just felt like I was going to fall for her and try to kiss her or something and I wanted to put a stop to that. I really loved the friendship we had built.  We both came from different financial upbringings but we endured struggles personally and overcame them.  We both loved being creative and enjoyed the same interests.  Even with her response I still withdrew 90%. However her dog got sick and I made sure to check on her. So that was the furthest extent. 


About a month later I was moving away to a part of town she use to live and noticed she had a huge box of wine delivered. I asked if things were okay kind of jokingly and she said she had just broken up with the guy she was dating and had seen her ex fiancé due to the dog being sick end it was kind of rough. So I offered to take her to lunch and talk. We ended up having dinner as well and some wine and went into some really meaningful conversation.  Afterwards we went to our own places like we did every-time we never even hugged.  

One thing that was weird is that she purchased a condo and didn’t tell me until she was in escrow.  I was extremely happy for her but did find it weird she never brought it up. 


After that her and I started spending time together about once a week. As we were friends I didn’t think much of how her schedule was because when I’m single I try to fill my days. If she took a while to respond to a text of call I wasn’t thinking too highly of it. We were both casually dating other people but never discussed it. I also never wanted to make a move because I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship..  I’m also so nervous about making the first move for a kiss that I’m usually not the move maker. After multiple nights of hanging out and one night with a bottle and maybe some more she made it obviously clear she wanted me to make a move. I did. The first night we kissed was the first night we did everything. I asked if it was okay before I progressed to each step and that was anunforgettable night. We were so comfortable with one another.  She almost immediately left and I asked her to cuddle some and she left in the middle of the night which I found kinda odd, I just didn’t pay attention to it like every other red flag I Ignored. After that night she was over 3/4 times a week. Eventually leaving an overnight toiletry bag.  I loved the sex but I loved our friendship more snd she didn’t want to date me it was obvious. So I never pressed it . I did say to her I needed to take a step back she didn’t want that because she liked what we had but I didn’t I was feeling like an object and I’m over sex like that.  I reveled hard in my youth.  I also wanted to save the friend ship before it got too far. Within a week she said she wanted to date but that it would be difficult. I didn’t understand that then, eventually I saw why. Over the next couple months of dating we went to Vegas, spent thanksgiving together and were madly in love. At least I was and she told me how she wanted to grow old with me and how she was crazy in love with me. I now realized that was love bombing.  It was right around Christmas when things got weird.  


She had invited me to go home with her and took it back twice. Also at her friends Christmas it was apparent what they thought of me. I’m a creative/entrepreneur and they are all engineers.  They saw me as a fun thing for  her and not serious. I have tattoos and sometimes color my hair but I love me and that doesn’t make me less than in any way.  That night she said some really hurtful things and basically said she ended her last relationship to have sex with me, with no intention of dating me.  At that moment I started to question our whole time as friends.  

Her closest friend is a wreck and I tried every way to get her to like me.  One thing that really got to me is she would invite my girlfriend to parties with her boyfriend and her with his single friends but not invite me.  it’s like she wanted her to either cheat or find somebody else to get over me with. I never once complained about her hanging out with her friends or how there would be weeks where I would be told I’ll let you know when I’m free.  I never once was a priority in the relationship and it’s like I still was a threat to her friend who needed her as kind of a competitor and someone to break the rules with because of their like for cocaine and ketamine.  

One trend that stood out to me is that when we were together time stood still and we would have great conversation and do a bunch of cool things together. in the moment she left my place  or the moment I left her place she became unhappy because it’s like when she wasn’t with me she wasn’t her true self.

So after Christmas it was my birthday we made it through that weekend and then the next week there was a disagreement over something small and she decided she wanted to break up and that was that and I was kind of blindsided by it but I thought I could take it as a time to think about everything.  This is a good time to let you know that most of the relationship relied upon me reaching out to her in which she would take hours to respond to my text, she never called me unless she was out of town and it was more to look good with her friends or when she was around other people.  if I did anything that I felt was too much I started to freak out because I didn’t want to push her away so I was constantly walking on egg shells. I never knew what she was doing on her days she would never let me know when she was free or what her weekends were until last minute then she would say she went and hung out with friends but would be very vague so I started to see that it probably wasn’t just me she was hanging out with even though she swore that she was in love with me and cared about me so much.  

The argument  that led to our first  break up was because she was at her friends who was just broken up with which my mentor had just passed away and this was the second time she had seen her that we can put me on the back burner and she was supposed to come over to spend the night and I hadn’t heard from her and I called her at 12:30am after I had passed out on the couch and she said she was still coming but I asked what for.  I understand girlfriends need girlfriends when they go through a break up however my needs were completely disregarded and that really hurt my feelings especially considering my mentor is a big part of my life and where I’m at today. 

One thing to also point out is a lot of her friends are guys which I have no problem with a lot of my friends are girls but I’m not hanging out with them at night alone in their apartment and even though she swore up and down she wouldn’t cheat on me knowing that I had just been a very Trumatic experience of my last break up it vstill rubbed me the wrong way and there would be nights I never heard from her going out and it was just very odd. 

It had been about five days and I had reached out to her saying I wanted to bring her stuff over from my place and that we could talk and kind of go our separate ways and she responded that she made a mistake and she wanted to still be in a relationship and this was after she sent it through text not calling. I know hindsight is 2020 however if I could go back to any time it would be that day to stand my ground and say yeah I’m not comfortable I need to MoveOn because the next month put me through even more pain that I’m still lingering with today.  

After getting back together she distanced herself even more I became even less of a priority she had booked a trip to Big Bear for us for Valentine’s Day after she invited her friend who is just broken up with prior to us breaking up to go to the mountains with all her friends and husbands so she didn’t have to be alone but did not invite me so at that point I questioned what this was all about again.  I had held off on getting our skiing tickets to the mountains because I didn’t know if we were going to be together and by the time I got the tickets they only had evening sessions which she was pissed off about. She was mad that she was in traffic coming to my house before leaving that weekend it’s like she was using that weekend as a excuse to push me to say fine it’s over.  

Granted she is a very good skier and I’m not it was more about spending time together and that weekend out of all the time we may have spent only two hours on the slopes.  I also forgot to mention that one of the things that really bothered her in our relationship apparently was that she made more money than me at the time we were dating two months later after we broke up that all changed but even though she made more money than I did I still paid for everything and it was still a problem which at that point I thought she’s just grasping for straws looking for any reason to make it look like this could never work when in the end her friends didn’t believe in my career choice she didn’t believe in my career choice which in turn didn’t make me believe in myself and my self-esteem started going straight down the drain because I had no support from my relationship. My friends and family were OK and supportive but my lover and one of my best friends started to question me because her friends didn’t care for me.  It also wasn’t her friends it was her one friend that she keeps away from her other set of friends because they don’t really like her so I don’t know if there’s an infatuation there.  Our last weekend together was Valentine’s Day she found out that she owed a lot of money in taxes and her mood changed after that and I didn’t have the money to give to her and I think she kind of resented the fact I didn’t have money like that and we were together but it’s not like we were engaged or married and if I did I still wouldn’t have gave it to her because we weren’t married that’s a lot of money and she comes from a family of wealth who would easily give it to her.  The car ride home she was rushing to get home she barely gave me a hug and kiss goodbye and that was the last day I saw her the next day she broke up with me through text message it took me two months after that to see her face-to-face to get some sort of closure which was really detrimental to my health mentally because of the things that she said and I’m still hurt by it because I don’t understand how people can be such great friends and through all that to the wayside but now that I look back on it it’s just an ulterior motive and it was just a shitty place for me to be and I should’ve been stronger to MoveOn but I wasn’t.  shortly after we broke up she started dating and started hooking up with other guys and ghosted me and never talked to me again.  I was diagnosed with some unfortunate health conditions and she doesn’t seem to care whatsoever about just saying hey I hope you feel OK or I hope you’re OK.  The last time we spoke she said that the best times of her life were with me and that she was her most trueself when she was with me and I don’t understand why you would leave someone who Brought out the complete best in you it sounds like her priorities are elsewhere in pleasing other people and how she looks to other people instead of really pleasing her self.  The saddest part of all this is I’m still stuck in it because one I can’t date because of my health and two I just feel used. I understand there were things that we could’ve worked on or maybe I could’ve been better at.  I took care of her as best as I know how I I really went above and beyond and it’s as if my kindness was mistaken for a weakness and that I was just a stepping stone or somebody to pass the time with because she did at one point said she didn’t wanna be alone and that Really fucked with my head she also said she couldn’t get over my appearance which she knew about my body dysmorphia issues along with my mental health and past drug addiction. Her reasons kept changing and kept cutting.  


I apologize for this being so long of a post but I thought you should know the whole backstory because it helps paint a picture of how jaded it all seems and how I’ve become so bitter about love and trust due to this relationship.  I’m not jealous of the guy she’s with because I know that I am a really good person and I know that I have set a bar that would be hard to pole vault. one day I’ll find someone, maybe, I don’t know and what scares me is it’s been four months and I can’t stop thinking about it and put it behind me.  I now know that I won’t except any bit of this in a relationship going forward but I noticed that I have started to do some of the things that she was doing to me to other people and I guess that is my subconscious because I’m constantly thinking about that and not moving on so I neglect other people that reach out to me.


If anyone has any advice or knowledge they can share to help that would be great if not I hope somebody can benefit from reading this and seeing it in their relationships to hopefully spare the same sort of pain that I did because it’s at times unbearable.   I don’t care about sex, I care about the friendship and I lost one of my best friends and it stings really really bad. If you got this far then thank you.  If you want to talk about a current problem with you or have insight please reach out. Thanks for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day.

3068,zigzagboomer,1631162684,1,"I'm apparently a lot older than most of you...I have more years of extreme loneliness under my belt ;-) Reading some posts here has given me perspective, and likewise I've thought about whether I have any perspectives to share.  It's probably not necessary to go **too** far into the very peculiar reasons I am lonely.  It's taken me years to completely figure it out, culminating with finding a good therapist. Suffice it to say that, although I am a bit of a ""natural loner"", my family did almost everything they could do to keep me emotionally crippled and devoid of close friendships. If I started making friends, they would dissuade that relationship.  Say they thought the kid's family was creepy, or too liberal, lived on the wrong side of town, whatever.  It was always something.  This isn't unprecedented...it was interesting to read that NY Times critic Pauline Kael, was apparently manipulative and over-protective of her only daughter. (I'm not the only child to suffer from them, my sister was almost disowned for just dating a mixed-race guy even though he was was about to go to an Ivy League university. Really messed up her life because the rebound guys were a disaster and she never recovered having her self-worth so denigrated.  She did ok undergrad, but then bombed out of first year of law school having a nervous breakdown and it was all downhill from there.  So my parents are crazy and racist people but that's not the main point here)

Unfortunately, bad luck and fate sometimes intervened on their side....a few of my closest friends in K12 died, sometimes from extreme events like an airplane crash.  I got **very** used to having to say goodbye.  But again, point is I never felt truly, deeply close to anyone since about 2 years ago, in my mid 40s, but then I had to end that relationship a couple months ago because there were a lot of things toxic about it. So...hardly ever did anything with other kids in K12. I had a couple ""talk on the phone a few times a year"" friends from college, and coworkers who I very occasionally saw outside of work.  That's it.  No romantic connections beyond failed first dates.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, as I think about HOW I survived my loneliness - this is what comes to my mind. These first ones are not recommendations, per se, just observations.

1) Although I always thought of myself as a pessimist, I actually had a secret optimistic fantasies that I kept to myself.  OTOH, a couple years with a good therapist (more on that in a moment) helped me to see that a lot of these fantasies were silly, unrealistic or a kind of self-gaslighting.  But, they kept me alive.

2) Staying away from drugs and alcohol...personally I think these things would well have destroyed me in my teens or 20s, but YMMV. I came from a family with a lot of alcoholism so that was my impetus to avoid it.

3) Being a ""flaneur"" on the internet.  From the earliest days of people having personal websites in the mid-late 90s, I spent a lot of time living vicariously. Of course on many levels this was a mistake, but living vicariously still felt like living! A guy named Phil Greenspun is an example, he was wealthy and traveled the world and posted pictures to a site he owned called [photo.net](https://photo.net).  I could dream about living his life...sadly if I hadn't been taught to viciously hate myself, I probably could have been that kind of wealthy.  As it is, I work in IT and do OK.  I'm financially stable and own a home at least.

Now, as for what I can say for sure are actual recommendations:

1) Get a pet if you can afford it. For decades I looked down on people who relied on animals for companionship...then I got a cat about a year ago, and I realize how stupid and hard-headed I had been.

2) Taking what scraps of friendship I could get where I could get them.  I was often ""nicer"" to my coworkers than they were back to me, BUT, I benefitted from doing that.  Like starting around 2001 I sometimes made mix CDs for close coworkers.  One of those coworkers encouraged me to buy a house which was a very wise financial decision.  I really needed someone to do that for me. My family, horrible people they are, have never given me any good career or life advice at all, and in fact cruelly belittled my efforts to buy a house.  Luckily back then you could get an 80/20 loan so I didn't need a down payment.  I had the last laugh, I doubled my money in 4 years during the 2000s RE boom and sold just before the (obviously about to happen) crash.

Similarly, my neighbors were often more friendly to me and took more genuine interest in me than my parents did.  So I probably got lucky in that way.  Maybe there's a broader theme here of just accepting the role that luck and bad luck will play in one's life.

3) I think a lot of people here, especially those who have friends and still feel lonely, have untreated depression.  Get it treated.  At the very least, try out a few anti-depressants via your primary care provider.  When I started taking lexapro a few years ago, it was life changing because I was also suffering anxiety disorder at the time.  I could only START the emotionally close relationship I referred to above, because I got my anxiety dialed down enough to trust someone else!  About a year later, thank goodness I found about about ketamine.  (legal IV infusion, mind you) That has coupled well with:

4) Again, if you can afford it, get a therapist.  Key warning though: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SHOP AROUND.  If you don't feel like you click with them the first session, you're probably not going to.  I knew with the first one it was not going to happen.  He was a prick. Then I went to another one for about 6 months.  He was better, but I sensed it wasn't going anywhere and that he found me annoying.  Then I found one who I spent 2 years with and who really helped me unravel what had happened in my life and why I had the problems that I do. Ketamine can really help you to unlearn/disconnect from things you need to unlearn and I highly recommend coupling it w/therapy.  I think the IV infusions are better than other forms.  In one of my infusions I had a incredibly sad, heart-breaking vision of my family dying, but I think what was happening was my subconscious was letting go of them.  The delusional myth of who I wished them to be - decent people - was dying.   I was accepting what horrible people they always had been and that thy were responsible for a lot of my problems (though not all of them of course)  Since then, it doesn't trigger me as much to deal with them, which is good.

I guess deep down I never really even noticed this until I met a girl Online.

Never met her, fell in love. I don’t know if that’s real love or not but it really feels/felt like it. 

She seemed like the one, and I know how stupid that sounds. I guess my mind isn’t very grounded in reality.

We did do a relationship for awhile but I was desperate for her love, approval, effort, care and I think that really pushes her away.. I mean on top of that my fears of not being good enough manifested in stupid mistakes of me leaving because I felt like I cared more than her and I was too scared to just communicate about things.

We recently broke things off because I wanted a relationship still and she didn’t… but then I left because I wanted to move on. But then it seemed like she really did care about the relationship based on stuff she said.

So last night I ask her what we are in terms of that and she hasn’t responded since… I guess that’s a no.

The worst part about this is if I was so damn pathetic and clingy this all could’ve worked. I could have really had love.

But now I’m alone again, I know she is the only person who will ever show interest in me again. I’m nothing special at all, I’m nice… that’s it. Even then I’m not really nice deep down. I say mean things, think mean things.

Maybe I’m overreacting and she’s thinking what to say but I think it’s over.

She has probably already found someone to replace what I was giving, and that person is prolly more laid back and chill about everything.

I just want a family who supports and loves me. Is that too much to ask for? People say stuff like “things will get better” or “time will heal”, but no one is gonna magically appear to be my parents. I am gonna be alone for the rest of my life. 

For that reason, I stopped getting therapy today. My problem isn’t gonna simply go away. Just because I talk to my therapist, things aren’t gonna get better. I’ll still be alone in the world.

I havent done anything wrong in order to be “kicked out” of the group, so i guess its just a ‘after highschool’ and corona kinda thing.

Well, even with not being friends with my highschool friends anymore, i tried to move on and make new friends by using apps like Bumble BFF mode to find friends near me. unfortunately, no one holds a conversation w/ me or they dont want to actually chill and do things together. its getting so frustrating and makes me feel like i might be a shitty person, or weird, and makes me overthink alot. 

ive realized over the last year of trying to make new friends, its always been dudes who eventually try and get in my pants, and that doesn’t help with me overthinking that thats all I’m good for.

ive had to go through ALOT of hardships by myself for the past year or so w/o having literally anybody there for me; and it was incredibly difficult on me. i miss having a friend to call every other day or so and just catch up on each other’s lives, going out and making plans together, helping each other and being there for each other, and to just have someone around.",lonely,I just graduated highschool and no one ever keeps in contact with me; not even some of what i considered my best friends.,2021-09-09 07:13:20

Well the bit that's bothering me most is my husband has to go back to the office for 3 days a week from now, while I still wfh. For the office days, he wants to sleep over at his mums as the commute would be cut in half. But it means I'm totally alone for 3 days a week. Except for my cats. Yes I'm sure he's not cheating but I do feel it's weird he's happy to cut our time almost in half just for some convenience. Then again I also really hate commuting so I can understand him. I've said I'm lonely and miss him to him, but not asked him to stay here in our home. I feel like that'd be controlling and he probably would say no anyway.

3134,codecrunchie,1631122848,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

Talking to my sister today really made me think about it, 
""Hey do you ever think about having a boyfriend?""

Many times, it's just that I know for a fact, someone who ghosted the most sweet, caring, and kind, person, just because they felt bored, shouldn't have the right to be in a relationship. 
I know I'll hurt whoever I'm with, so why do I keep wishing for that someone...

I hate myself.

My mom said if I don't have a boyfriend by next year, she'll arrange one for me, because she's obsessed with the idea of being a young grandma, telling myself growing up that she didn't mind if I were to be a teen mom, and she'll look after the baby for me.
How can someone who's emotionally and physically abused their child have the right to say that? 

I know for a fact if I were to ever have a partner all I'll do is hurt them, I know for a fact if I were to ever have kids, I'll F them up as much as I was.

I can tell she's getting desperate, but not only am I 18, as I've mentioned above, I cannot let another human being have to go through the same trauma I have.

So I got to thinking, maybe if being truly alone was possible then I wouldn’t feel lonely? Like maybe our loneliness stems from the need to fit in to a society that we are forced to take part in. You have to go to the store for groceries, work to earn money, go to school for an education. We’re constantly coming into contact with hundreds of people and we see them living lives that we are told is “normal” so we want to be like them. Then there’s social media, we see all these people and think about how we want what they have.

Like right now, I should be working, but instead I'm wrapped in a blanket and holding a pillow...thanks to the advent of remote work. Don't get me wrong though, I eventually will myself to work (usually through mental trickery like coffee and listening to music with headphones), but sometimes the loneliness just wins out and I have to think about it...for some reason.

Like what good is that going to do? I know I'm lonely. I know it's something I want to fix in my life. But feeling lonely at 7:30am on a weekday isn't going to help me much...although I suppose it does make me fire up the dating apps, so maybe it does. That's just our biological drives at work, I suppose.

**Tl;dr: How do I fix my mindset when I know logically that I should be patient with my girlfriend because she’s temporarily very busy with her career, but I struggle to do so?**

Here’s the story:

We used to call 20 minutes a day, or even longer at times. Now we've reached a point where we don't talk for days on end aside from the texts/voice messages we send when we're both awake. I'm trying to understand that she just resumed classes in law school and she may be really busy. But I struggle to reconcile with the idea that she could be so busy she can't make time to talk to me anymore. I mean, is that even possible?

I've talked to her about scheduling regular talks, but she just seems aloof all the time. Her original suggestion was to call while she walks to school, to which I said that while I would prefer another time because I want to sleep early, I'd be down for it if there was no better choice. She said she could call while preparing for classes. I agreed. But every day since, she's cancelled. I confronted her about this and she said she just can't make time happen. I don't think she even apologized for flaking. She said she's usually freer to make time around one hour before I wake up, but she wouldn't ask that of me. I told her that by all means she could if that was the only choice. She said she'll figure out a schedule and will try to call on the weekend. She hasn't. 

I'm trying REALLY hard to be patient, but if two people in a relationship can neither see nor talk to each other, I feel like the relationship doesn't exist anymore. She's the first woman I've ever actually loved and I really wanna make this work, but sometimes I can't help my brain thinking I'm the only one who's trying. I know logically that's far from the truth, but my emotions get the better of me sometimes. 

To add to that, she's previously asked me to send her a voice message greeting her good morning everytime I wake up. I had initially resisted the idea because there are days when I'm just not in the mood. Despite that, she made it known how important it is to her, so I eventually agreed. These days, it feels like a third of the few conversations we're having is just me saying good morning, her replying, and us going back and forth a little. 

I hate what I've become. I try to avoid having more talks about having more time for each other. Because even though I frame the conversations as having more time for ""each other"", silently, I know it's just me asking for more of her time when she already has most she needs of mine. Mostly, when we talk about time, I feel like I'm just begging. 

The other day, she called me out of nowhere to my pleasant surprise, but when I got to saying, ""I've missed you, there's so much I want to share!"" She said, ""I have 30 minutes."" Instantly, I felt like I'm talking to a countdown timer who just goes, ""Hmm… yeah? Uh-huh."" So I tried to shift the conversation towards her by asking, ""How about you, how've you been doing, baby?"" I was expecting more details about her life and she just basically  said she's tired and very busy. She said she needed to sleep after just ten minutes, instead of the intended 30. I playfully protested a little, to which she said, ""You know I didn't have to call you. Would you prefer I don't talk to you at all?""

When we started dating, I was very vocal about wanting an open relationship so I wouldn't have to adjust too much, but she's super into monogamy so I agreed to be monogamous. I think that through time she noticed how miserable I am about my inability to be with her physically, so she told me she would allow me to have sex with other women temporarily. I declined her offer because I knew she wasn't completely comfortable with it and the pandemic helped start me to be more comfortable with monogamy. Now I'm so tempted to ask again because of how absent she is. But I won't.

In terms of solutions, I know I just need to keep myself distracted. But then the more try to occupy myself the more I want to share with her. Now it's like we don't know what's going on in each other's lives anymore. 

I love this girl and I want to hold on, so I'm desperate for advice. I'm particularly looking for ones on how to fix my mindset, but any kind is welcome. Thank you very much!",lonely,It feels like my relationship doesn't even exist anymore,2021-09-08 18:26:37

Some people are just meant to be alone, to embrace the still void of unending darkness and fall in love with it.

That hurts, ouch
I feel the loneliness physically. I could see it. Make it real. 
Hi everyone. 
I have a cat and my favorite color is purple. I cry often thinking about it. But i'm a normal person. I just got lonely. I got alone. And when I see someone, I am reminded of it. I am scared of people's faces, because they might see me. They might see that we live in different worlds. I don't want them to know. But I do want someone to know. 
I want to tell them my pain. And see it in their eyes. That person knows, everything. They know the loneliness, the thoughts, the pain. I see it in their throat and I put my hand on it. Thank you. I appreciate.
I want this to happen and I dream about this. I feed off of it. I want him to be real. I put my hand on my head, what is going on.

I was thinking about this today. Maybe i should go to a psychiatric hospital. I need to be loved to learn to regulate myself. That I didn't have from my parents. I don't know if I believe in fairy tales anymore. I am empathetic, but I am starting to believe that I am the only one. I always thought that one day, when I grow up, I will meet someone who cares about me. I tried to rely on my friends. School were my family, and when I changed school, I lost it, that's why it hurt so much. The worst is losing. Then you get used to it. Time flies. 5 years. Still. 
When my cat died, I had no one to comfort me. 
When I cut contact wih my mother, no one was there to comfort me.
When I lost my friends, no one was there to comfort me.
When I was anxious about school, no one was there to comfort me. 
No one hugged me. No one listened to me. No one even knew me. 
When I felt alone, no one was there. When I cried, I had to make sure no one heard me. When i wanted to die, no one was there to comfort me. When I failed school, no one was there to comfort me. When I was in physical pain, no one was there to comfort me. It piles up.

I feel like I am manipulating myself into making me think that I am suffering from depression, like the whatever I feel is invalid because I might be imitating whatever I've seen from the internet or tv shows. But then I also feel like I am not in control of my thoughts, like I am just making things up. It's hard to explain. I feel like I don't have a personality so much so that I am hyper aware of what I am thinking ( maybe it's because I have too much time in my hands to waste since I'm not doing anything productive). I am so aware of what I am thinking that I have to explain and assess it right after I have thought the thought. It's like a battle within my head.

It’s been like this for so long but at least during high school I had a friend group. I was never really close with any of them but I made them laugh. Even though I was never their first option, even though they all had relationships while I never had one, at least I had them.

I graduated high school over 2 years ago and haven’t made a single friend since. I had my family who cared about me and some what understood me for most of the pandemic, but I moved away from them for college (again). So now I really have no one. I go to class for a bit, say nothing, come home, do nothing, go to sleep, wake up rinse and repeat. I have nothing to live for and my loneliness is a leading cause for that.

I feel like I’m going insane. I exist but only to myself, no one acknowledges my existence. I’m there but I’m not. I walk around in box made out of 2 way mirrors. And even if people did see me I would never be brave enough to step out of that box. I live in my own head and that is the worst place to be. My brain never turns off.

I fear I will never have friends again. I fear I will go my entire life without being someone’s other half. I don’t think I can or will ever be intimate with another person.

3225,Alister017,1631069267,1," 

A lot of the time I feel alone. Not singled out, because then I would have everyone’s attention when I don’t. It’s like I have this natural ability to fade away from people’s minds. I’m part of the background. Look away for too long or don’t talk to me and poof. It’s like I was never there. The only time when people remember me (Family doesn’t count) is when they need something done. I work hard so that must be it. “Alex can do it”. “He knows how”. Other than that I’m a walking object. An NPC. A tool or utility. 

I don’t have many friends. Even still I don’t feel close with anyone. Even my best friend. I always feel just on the outside of every social circle I find. I know enough to be able to interact with everyone but never feel like I’m a part of the group.

I might be imagining things or making these thoughts up in my head. I’ve been told not to overthink stuff. To go with the flow. It’s hard as fuck to do that. It’s not how my head works. I tried that recently. I fell for a girl, tried to get close to her, and failed. It’s not me, it’s her I was told. I’m unintentionally rushing things. And when I took a step back to how I usually think, I saw it. I fucked it all up because I went with the flow. I rode my emotional roller coaster and it crashed and burned. If I had just kept with how I usually see the world maybe I’d be in a better situation with her right now.

Anyway, that’s not what I’m supposed to be talking about right now. Long story short, too long don’t read, yes, there are people in my life who I care for. I have friends but I don’t fit in that well. I can interact but not fit in. Looking at it objectively I want something that probably doesn’t exist.

I now live 4 hours away from everyone I've ever known and loved. I'm going to school for something I believe in and wanted to use it as an opportunity to venture out on my own. 

However, I'm really bad at making and maintaining friendships. Real connection is hard to come by, and affection of any kind is rare. It was bad enough back home where I barely have any friends and certainly no one close enough to confide in, besides my sister. 

Trauma has also made me put up walls I didn't want to, but had to for my own safety and now can't take down no matter how hard I try.

It's all coming to a head right now and I feel insanely alone and depressed.

I had never once felt like I was good enough for a relationship. Does that energy radiate off me? Probably, but it's not like there's a switch to turn these feelings off. Or, if there is, can you show me where it is so I can switch them off and cement the damn thing down so it doesn't turn back on?

Fear of happiness.

I miss him so much, but am more sad about what it ending showed me. He was the first person in 15 years to say he wanted to commit to me, to want to meet my family, etc. and in the end it was very easy for him to walk away. 

He went from meeting my family on a Sunday to three days later saying how lucky he was to be with me to dumping me in a text three days after that. No sadness or reluctance on his part. It was like he was canceling his Netflix subscription.

He’s been with someone else pretty much since then and she’s his dream girl. 12 years younger, gorgeous, in amazing shape, happy/generous/not needy/fun. 

I’m jealous of her but jealous of him, too. This time last year he was going through a terrible breakup, suicidal, quit his job. Now he has his ideal job and his ideal girl, and he knows there’s someone else who would pretty much chew glass for another chance with him.

I’ve never been adored or missed like that. I’ve always been easy to throw away, and this breakup just confirmed it.

I’m dying this year. It’s something I’ve wanted for a long time. A lonely life as a person with no romantic/sexual value isn’t worth it. But I’m trying to do it the ethical way - euthanasia at a clinic. I don’t want anyone to have to find a body (if I can avoid it).

The application process is long and every day is so painful. I keep trying to remind myself that it will all be over in a few months; if I don’t get into the clinic I have a plan B.

3262,Black_prince_93,1631055749,1,"Long post so I apologise in advance.

I guess I've always felt lonely through the 28 years of my life so far. Have been used to being a loner really as I was bullied a lot at school, never felt like my friends really were my friends and drifted about a lot so never had a solid friends circle to do things with.

But I have been ok with it as I have been able to do things that I enjoy doing on my own. Haven't had a gf since I was about 14 so haven't had to worry about relationship commitments for a.very long time.

But all that changed last year. I was put onto furlough during the early 2020 lockdown (UK) until August when I went back to work. Perfectly fine during that as it was a nice break from my job and gave me a chance to sort things out that I wanted to do for a while.

September was when it all started going downhill. Unable to do what I normally could do in my spare time so it was pretty much work all day and home in the evening. I found myself alone with my thoughts a lot since then and started to think critically of myself. And one thing that stuck out more than anything was how lonely I truly have been over the years. 

Having no real friends of my own, not having a girlfriend (haven't dated anyone since 2007), it all just got to me badly and hit me like a brick in the face every single day on top of everything else I was thinking critically about. It kept getting to the point where I'm driving back from work, I can feel it all building up so having to pull over and park up, let all the tears just burst out from me and scream my head off in the car to let it all loose.

Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and started reaching out to those I had contacts with on FB, some responded with decent conversation, others initially before ignoring me afterwards and some completely ignored me. Luckily one of them, an old classmate from Secondary School, invited me to join her WhatsApp group for wellbeing purposes. 

There I was able to chat with others who were having similar problems due to lockdown and eventually started meeting up with quite a few of them once the lockdowns lifted. So started to feel less lonely as I now had a decent social group.

Lacking a gf is still causing an issue as last year was the first time in years that I thought long and hard about it. Haven't been too bothered to look for someone as my priority has been to sort my life out since 2014 when I got medically discharged from the army. In a better position now I guess but still working on it. 

But seeing others on social media getting into relationships, getting married, starting families of their own.... it does make me miss being with someone and I have started to wish that I did have a gf again even though I keep telling myself I'm still not ready or good enough to start dating.

Each time I start to feel it come on, I swear I can feel someone trying to wrap their arms around me from behind, trying to reassure me and tell me I'll be ok. It gives me small comfort but makes me feel worse when I realise no-one is there. Just gets me really upset and tearful knowing how lonely I am and not having someone to comfort me.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read it. Just need to let it out every so often.",lonely,The lonely loner,2021-09-08 09:02:29

3264,mold-,1631054101,1,"For years I have lived to myself until I started believing it. Telling myself I'm simply not a people person, that I'm a serious introvert, that I enjoy my space and all those sorts of things. Well, laying here alone in bed at midnight like any other night and every other night, I finally let myself accept it. I long for someone to share my time with, and though I do have people at school I hang out with I always feel like I'm that one guy who just sits there, barely speaks and who just walks along with the group. I'm a background character in not just the lives of those I call my friends, but of my own as well. I live day by day, spending my time locked behind the doors and walls of my home, telling myself that one day I'll just magically become happy and content. It makes me feel pathetic. 

Never had a friend who I could share everything with, with whom I had an unspoken language and who we understood by simply a glance. Never have I had that one sibling or parent who just knocked on my bedroom door to check up on me, knowing I struggle with anxiety, depression and lots of fears. Never had a real partner who gave me a warm and gentle embrace where I could let my worries out and feel safe and like myself. All I ever had was single player games, shows, movies and myself to distract myself from the ever looming loneliness. 

And yet, as I write this, I feel like I'm only doing this for attention. It's like I know noone honestly gives a damn about what some random stranger who they'll most likely never actually meet is currently feeling like, and yet I still write this all out because of the 'attention.' Pathetic. That's what I feel like. Taking the attention of those who have it much worse for my own petty needs. 

I know I did all of this. I pushed everyone away without second thought, wishing they'd just leave me be. I got my wish, and I'm not enjoying it. It's exhausting to know all your suffering is caused by yourself throughout the years. Whether it's physical pain because of bad posture and not caring, whether it's emotional pain because you're trying to deceive yourself this wasn't your own doing and that some day you'll get your happily ever after, whether it's mental pain because you keep torturing yourself about all your shortcomings that you could have easily prevented, knowing you're suffering because you CHOSE to live like this is exhausting. 

Realising I'm lonely and if I keep this shit up I'll die alone and before I even hit 40 and yet doing nothing to change it is exhausting, especially because it makes me wonder when I did give up and why I'm no longer trying to pick myself up and because I'm blaming myself for all of this because I know it's my own fucking fault. I can blame anyone I want, but I know for a fact I fucked this up. I fucked myself up. I was never meant to be born and I'm a disappointment to my father. He wanted a functioning human, not some waste of oxygen who fucks themselves up and does nothing about it and yet complains about it. I'm not a human. I'm not a person.

The scary part is that I feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by expecting someone to naturally help me feel better with their presence when that should be no one's job.

So I went out with this girl two times a couple of weeks ago, but I messed it up by being too clingy and she said we should be just friends. Also there is this girl in my political science class I currently like and we had good conversations and I noticed she was shy. I asked her out a few classes later but I felt like I asked her out when she was in a bit of a rush and she only got my number. (I didn’t get hers) She hasn’t texted me since and has been very active on social media, but I’m confused if she is interested in me or not because one time she didn’t say hi to me when we passed by, but then apologized the next day for not saying it. Some people gave me advice saying that I should ask her out again next time. I’m just very scared she is going to reject me. She is very cute and we have a lot in common. I’m really tempted to add her on Instagram but I was recommended not to. Im just very lonely and depressed right now.

3307,Ok_Midnight1414,1631032032,1,"My depression stems from lack of social contact. I deeply desire a romantic relationship and have since I was a teenager. The problem: I'm undesirable. I am not the one people pine for. I am the one that a random person decides to waste time with in between relationships every 10-12 years. The only purpose I have in life is to work and that is it. All my friends are gone as they are married with kids now. I've done all the cliche suggestions to better myself and more. I am simply not meant/allowed to be in a relationship. I've tried therapy because apparently you're not trying unless you do that (and all the other suggestions people give) but it was all for not as the therapists either never returned my calls or, for the one that finally took me as a client, constantly cancelled and asked to reschedule sessions. In a year's time I only had 2 sessions. I don't/can't live like this anymore. What's worse is that I'm not allowed to talk about this with anyone outside the internet (even the internet doesn't want to hear it either) because I'm bringing them down and ruining their good time. I'm just so sad and disappointed with my life. I saw things going so differently. I didn't expect to become rich and famous. I just wanted to be happy. That's it. Asking for happiness and a relationship is selfish apparently. Either people say you're deserving of love or you're a toxic SOB who isn't entitled to love. Well which one is it? I know I'm not deserving or entitled to love. I know this with every fiber of my being as my entire life has been one giant example of it. The only thing I do is try to find the latest hobby to obsess over to keep my mind off the fact that I fucking hate my life and then move to the next one once I've exhausted my enthusiasm for it.

Even though I gave my them everything I had, they never seemed to notice my existence outside of being ""that guy who tags along"". I'm gonna be turning 21 in November and I have no one to celebrate it with. Nothing says ""happy birthday"" like sitting alone at a bar drinking away the pain.

I think my problem is that I'm too boring. I have no personality aside from my various mental health issues, I'm 5'7 so I don't really stand out in a crowd, and I have an average and forgettable face. If life were a movie I would be one of the background characters you see for one scene. Even my family doesn't notice when I get up and leave the room. I can show up to a family gathering, eat, and leave without anybody even knowing I was there. It's no wonder why I've never been on a date before either. How can I expect someone to be interested in me when they don't even know I exist? And even if they did, who would want to date me? I've got as much personality as a mannequin and an appearance to match.

If I were to dissappear from the face of the earth, I can guarantee that no one would notice for at least a couple days, and even then it would only be like 3 people. Although after a week or so, they would forget I ever even existed. The worst part of all is that there's nothing I can do to fix it short of paying people to hang out with me. Sure I could read self help books and join clubs, but I'll never do that because I'm a lazy piece of shit and changing myself sounds like a lot of work. Also, joining clubs does nothing because I have no idea how to socialize properly and would just end up alienating myself from society even further.

Last year I was in a bad place mentally but at least I had friends and I even took the courage to apply for a job and it kept me busy for a couple of months but this year I’ve lost the motivation.

I’ve been struggling with my social anxiety for years but it got worse with the pandemic. I lost my job in March and tbh it was a crap call centre job and it got too much for me.

I’ve been doing online courses and I have a call today from this government agency who try and help find you a job and I’m dreading it because I’ve only applied for 2 jobs and I lost interest in applying for anything. 

I even cancelled some appointment because of my anxiety and I’m embarrassed to be seen outside because I havent been out that much.

I’am seeing a therapist but it takes time. I know I need to get back there but I have no motivation or interest. I don’t know what to do I know I shouldn’t rely on people for my self esteem but it has really affected me.",lonely,Feeling stuck,2021-09-07 20:12:43

I quite like the accent of British people so while Im looking for a friend to chat and share moments with, I wanna practice my English with a native British too :))

Im more like looking for a friend, a friend whom I feel comfortable to talk to and feel happy when I see his/her videos.

Im female, looking for female/male, but I prefer having a sister &lt;3 &lt;3

I managed to find one good friend on Reddit (David- Florida, US), but he has a gf now so Im looking for another friend hahaha

3338,-demonicentity,1631004029,1,"I’ve been feeling lonely since like a year ago or something like that. I have friends, 2 friends, I always feel excluded. They just do things together without me and they seem closer to each other than me. I mean, maybe they have their reasons, but idk :\ it sucks feeling excluded and feeling like im nothing for them. It was different before. It seemed like we were a group of 3 and we were all closer to each other and we really had fun together. Things between my friends and I had changed a lot and it doesn’t feels the same. Maybe is because we’re growing up idk. I just want to go back to the time no one was excluded. Now I always text them, but sometimes they even ignore me. I think that if I don’t text them maybe we would barely talk. 

I'm not even close to my parents. I feel like I can’t trust them. My mom complains because I don’t trust her enough to talk about my feelings, my life and my problems with her, and like a month ago we had a discussion about it and I told her some things about her that didn’t make me trust her and some of my problems and she just told me I didn’t try enough and I kept complaining instead of changing my life and she just basically said that I had no problems lol and my dad never really cared about me. He’s always everywhere for everyone except for me. Last Thursday was my birthday, my dad told me that he would take me to dinner for my birthday for the weekend cause he was busy that day, today is Tuesday and the dinner didn’t happen lol and I texted him today and he didn’t even seems to remember that he said that. He does that all the time.

I feel so lonely. I don’t have someone to talk with. I don’t have someone that really cares about me, someone that understands me or at least tries to do it, someone that hears me. I feel so bored and numb all the time. I just want to sleep and forget about everything. I just want to stop thinking. 

I just want to enjoy my loneliness. I’m done trying to make friends in the internet. Everyone just ghosts me. I’m done trying to fix my relationship with my parents, they don’t even care. I’m done with people. I just want to stop feeling this stupid loneliness and this stupid void inside. Ive been in therapy for months and I feel like my therapist doesn’t understands me.

I feel this empty void. As if there’s a hole in my heart or my soul that I want to fill someone to love. And I can’t find anyone. I’m too young anyway, but why is this here? Why do I have such a longing for affection and love. To feel like someone cares about me and would do things for me? I would do things for them.

I would wanna go on long walk holding hands talking about everything. Go on dates to the park, watch the sunset there, and cuddle late at night or early morning. 

This void has been in me for a long time. Ever since 6th grade. I would imagine this crushes or girls in my class. Now I have no one. It’s a strange void. I know I don’t need a partner this early in life, and most people around my age don’t seem to appealing.

But I still want affection the way so many people have. I don’t even care that much for sexual interest. All I would want is some kisses from someone I love, I can’t even get that right now.

3360,Xayton,1630988867,1,"It was recently my 31st birthday (M) about a week and a half ago or so and I came to the realization that aside from my roommates I am extremely alone.  

The last actual relationship I had was a one year one about 7 years ago at this point.  I haven't even dated since.  Like I literally have not gone on a date since.  To make it worse that relationship was the only real girlfriend I have ever had.  Real being the keyword.  The only two other relationships I had were very odd flings that lasted like a month at most with people who I am no longer friends with...

My ex who now my roommate and best friend (yes I know it is weird but trust me it's fine, we are WAY better this way) Is really the only friend I have.  My other roommate while my friend per se is way more my ex's then mine...by a very large and very noticeable margin.

They both actively have a bunch of friends.  Then there is me.  My ex alone has dated and or slept with easily 20 or more people since we broke up.  I have done neither since we broke up 7 years ago I have no one.  

I work work from home so I don't really get to make ""work friends.""  I can't afford a car due to my insurance costs being sky high due to terrible credit.  So I can't get anywhere outside of a small area.  I am extremely broke due to having to pay back a lot of money to people I needed to borrow before I got my current job.  None of these are attractive to people.

Having only dated and been with one person at my age is a large red flag to people.  It is very strange and people will wonder what is wrong with him.  Even more so because I am not unattractive.  Or so I am told.

I also have very little to offer people at the end of the day.  I honestly talk way to much sometimes.  My roommates joke to people by saying just ""we just ignore him till he shuts up"" when they introduce me to someone new.  I realistically complain too much, I get told by my roommates that I am not really a nice person, I'm not really all that caring.  I am not heartless but I don't express care to people almost at all.  I do actually care about my best friend but you'd likely never know it most of the time.   I don't really treat people all that well.  I tend to forget or not think about ""the little things"" that make people feel like your csre and stuff like that.  I tend to talk loudly when excited or slightly annoyed and it is often mistaken for yelling which gets really frustrating because people obviously get annoyed at me because they think I am yelling.  I am also borderline incapable of change which is actually really annoying and upsetting to me.  However that probably ties into a lack of caring at the end of the day.  I get accused of only caring about myself unfortunately.  This likely stems from moving schools a lot as a kid so I never really learned to develop caring relationships.

While really down one time I said I don't really have any redeemable qualities to my ex and she said sure you do.  I asked to please name me one and she couldn't tell me anything.  This is coming from someone I have known for going on 8 years at this point.

I am very introverted so I have a very strong aversion to gatherings / parties. I really hate drinking so that makes those worse.  This isn't to say I can't socialize.  100% fine at it and I do know how to talk to people and be charming if need be.  It's just superficial and not real though.

Both my ex and roommate have tons of friends and are actively trying to date people with varying degrees of success.  Meanwhile I am just getting older and watching my life go by alone.

I’m not entirely unfortunate looking. I think I have a rather interesting life. I don’t think Id have trouble dating if I tried…. But for some reason I just can’t trust anyone. NO ONE. I think everyone is just saying nice things to get what they want. Attractive men seem to all have a temporary agenda. I know what happens if I give them attention back.  So… I don’t.

3366,just_some_toast,1630987737,1,"(Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just writing down my thoughts as they come to me.)

I've always been alone, even when I had friends. I was never invited to birthday parties, sleepovers, or to just hangout. I was no one's best friend. Even though I gave my them everything I had, they never seemed to notice my existence outside of being ""that guy who tags along"". I'm gonna be turning 21 in November and I have no one to celebrate it with. Nothing says ""happy birthday"" like sitting alone at a bar drinking away the pain.

I think my problem is that I'm too boring. I have no personality aside from my various mental health issues, I'm 5'7 so I don't really stand out in a crowd, and I have an average and forgettable face. If life were a movie I would be one of the background characters you see for one scene. Even my family doesn't notice when I get up and leave the room. I can show up to a family gathering, eat, and leave without anybody even knowing I was there. It's no wonder why I've never been on a date before either. How can I expect someone to be interested in me when they don't even know I exist? And even if they did, who would want to date me? I've got as much personality as a mannequin and an appearance to match.

If I were to dissappear from the face of the earth, I can guarantee that no one would notice for at least a couple days, and even then it would only be like 3 people. Although after a week or so, they would forget I ever even existed. The worst part of all is that there's nothing I can do to fix it short of paying people to hang out with me. Sure I could read self help books and join clubs, but I'll never do that because I'm a lazy piece of shit and changing myself sounds like a lot of work. Also, joining clubs does nothing because I have no idea how to socialize properly and would just end up alienating myself from society even further.

It was my first relationship and it was a really serious one at that. Although we had been together for 2 years, our relationship had been a series of rough patches mixed with comfort, love and support from both our ends. We shared many great memories, and were sure we'd be able to work through things as time went on but unfortunately we couldn't let go of our own faults and is what ultimately led to us parting ways. Those faults being a mix of what we wanted out of each other, our values, and insecurities playing a part as well which made us conflicted. I was wondering if there'd be any advice I could get from anyone who's gone through the same situation or a similar one as mine. I don't really have too many friends and my parents are constantly arguing, going at each other every other day as they're on the verge of a divorce so it's all becoming incredibly overwhelming.  I know a lot of people say to keep busy but that doesn't really help too much whether it be when I'm at school, work or home. I'm at that point where I see her all the places she'd be throughout our relationship whether it be laying on my bed, the passenger seat of my car, parks, places we've been too and it just puts me at a more down place emotionally with myself. We'd always text throughout each day and hour aside from when we were at work, school. I'd always look forward most to going to her place after work, school when we had gaps, spending the night. Her coming over to cuddle and sleep at my house, then us heading out to various places to explore, go to &amp; all that's just gone now. It's fascinating how we just celebrated my 20th birthday as well as our 2 year anniversary 2 weeks ago and now it's over.

I have a job I currently hate, no friends to hang out with irl because we have to communicate through phones or discord now (both due to COVID and us all going our separate ways). I'm 22 and I've never had a girlfriend or even a first kiss because I was so focused on school and too shy to actually try developing a relationship. The few times I did try when I was very young, I was quickly shot down or the person ended up being way weirder (almost obsessive) after getting to know them as a friend first. 

I'm losing passion for things I like. Video games, anime, manga. It's all becoming so stale and repetitive to me. I currently live at home because I'm saving money working at a job I don't like, but it provides benefits and sort of have a transfer option. I'm surrounded by family but I feel so alone. I've got a degree in history that I have no clue what to do with anymore, because apparently the effort of becoming a college professor may not even be worth it. 

I've been trying to turn to religion. Listening to religious music, talking to some members of Christianity online, but nothing seems to be working. I go to therapy, but he tells me the same things. Just look for opportunities. Well I haven't exactly seen any in the past few months. 

I want to eventually move out of my family's house because I want to be my own person. But once I do, it'll just be me in an apartment, alone. Yeah I could get a pet, but that's just more responsibility on top of bills and paying off student loan debt.

Because after long days at work I don't feel like going to a bar or anything like that. On my days off I just want to sit at home and enjoy my time where I get to choose what I do.

This has been a major insecurity that I had to show alot of courage to share with someone because i feared it will make me seem super needy and insecure. 

For one reason or another I've lost friends from different phases of life. Sometimes it's my fault, sometimes it's theirs, it happens. I'm trying to be more comfortable with this, at least enough to be able to talk about it without feeling needy.

It does hurt that some very old bonds have died like that. Reasons range from fuckups, not putting in the effort and losing touch, to not feeling wanted when you do put in the effort. I feel that in spite of socializing not being my forte, the fact that I've had close friends, even if briefly, is something good. It gives me hope that I'll have people in my life who value me. I am hopeful that I'll come across people who will be there to stay, as difficult as it may seem in the middle of a bloody pandemic.

I'm not a go-getter like my peers, but I get the job done very efficiently.  I left an awesome support group in my last job for a real \*redacted\* job and so far, I'm not having a good time.  It's not fun.  Why do I befriend my new co-workers?  I don't necessarily like them.  They're not the type of people I want to befriend.  However, they are all very competent.  I've never worked with a team of competent people before, so I guess this is good experience to prepare myself for the future.  Do I think of myself as competent?  I barely am.

At home, my life is also terrible.  I still live with my parents.  I don't hang out with anyone in my contacts because I'm a lazy, insecure, socially awkward asshole that likes to keep to himself.  I used to drive around to pass the time, but sadly, ever since my last accident, I've been doing it much less.  When it comes down to my at-home life, I despise my neighbors.  They're waiting for the day I move out to throw a huge party because I'm a terrible person.  It's true, I can't help it.  I'm a short-tempered kid in an adult's body.  For my day-today, my weekends are like my weekdays, the only difference is the lack of work:

**Wake-up** \-&gt; beat it -&gt; shower -&gt; lotion bod/deo pits -&gt; pop in expensive earbuds and listen to music -&gt; take a break from music binge to joke/argue with my parents -&gt; head out for a drive or to pick up some lunch -&gt; start second listening session -&gt; beat meat -&gt; fantasize of the perfect girlfriend -&gt; **sleep**

Oh yeah, I have a new neighbor.  Their sister hates me for.  What happened?  I think it's because we were both similar at one point: No car, no job, etc.  She didn't want to feel like the only one struggling.  She wanted someone to use for her excuses, ""See the neighbor doesn't have a job yet, just give me some time.""  To this day, I don't think she bothered to find a job.  It took me about 6 months of job hunting in 2019 to finally break into my field of study and from there I've been doing fairly good.  Now, that I'm doing better than her, she got jealous.

Idk…I’m just reminded of how alone I really am. 

Sure, I take myself out for some “me time” and genuinely have a good time with myself but coming home to an empty and quiet apartment has really been taking a toll on me. Most of my friends live out of state. My family lives close but they don’t actually “get me” nor do they ever really try. They rarely even visit. 

The thing that hurts the most is that my love life is non existent. I’m literally on every dating app. I live in one of the biggest cities in the US and still can’t land a date. All of my experiences with love have been me meeting toxic and unhealthy people. I’ve never experienced a real healthy love. And that’s all I want right now. I know romantic love isn’t everything but it’s what I want. I wanna settle down. Find my person. Travel the world. Try new things. I know I can do that on my own but that’s my point. I’m alone. Always alone. No one ever wants me. No one ever sees me. I’m only good for either mindless sex or just what I can DO for people. 

And I hate that. I wanna be loved too. Truly loved and cared for. But it feels like I’ll never actually find that. It sucks watching all my friends or associates get married and find their person. I feel like I’ll never have that. Even my own therapist is at a loss for how to help me. Aren’t I just pathetic? 

I want to be okay with these feelings of loneliness. I really do. But man I feel like absolute crap right now.

I wish I was invited to that. Just once, you know? Even if I don’t like it— just for the experience.

But the point I’m trying to make is that I’m not close enough to everyone to get invited to do stuff like that. And it’s my fault. I’m not too active in the group chats, I’m not really proactive in buildings bridges with these people, I’m not trying to be a better friend.

Also, I do believe in God and in Christ, but I'll never believe in the Church, because what is obvious is obvious (I don't care on others beliefs, because I don't have the absolute truth, but I also don't like being considered as a ""retrograde"", and even worse when those hypocrites tell me that they're fine with my beliefs). And a very important part: I do things because I want to or I need to, meaning that I don't move for money or having false friends. To me these things are sacred, and I will never change that. These, among other things, are the reasons why I don't have friends. However, I feel quite lonely. So... is there someone like me?

Today marks 1 year that my ex and I parted ways, and the loneliness has come in waves since then. But anxiety and depression have been steadily sneaking up on me, and I'm realizing how much the lack of human connection is affecting me. The happiest times in my life were those in school when I was surrounded by people that cared about me, however slight. The lowest have been the opposite, when I isolate myself and withdraw from friendships.

Ultimately I think what's eating at me is a denial of self. My heart naturally wants to give and love others, but all it takes is a thought reminder of how I've gotten hurt in the past to keep me doing nothing. My mind will try to make me feel better by telling me I don't need anyone to be happy. Like, there were yogis that would stay in a cave for years and find eternal peace within. If they can do it, so can I, right? I'm realizing the isolation path is like doing life on hard mode, there are far easier ways to be happy again, and all it really takes is putting myself out there without fear of rejection in order to build the support systems I need to get through the hard times.

No one is perfect, and we don't have to wait to become perfect before we try to make real connections with others. There will inevitably be mistakes made and heartaches.

3446,Winter-Scene-3592,1630954332,1,"I (23F) just spoke to a classmate from school after like  7 years and he asked if I was in touch with any of our classmates from that year, and while he easily listed like 10 people, I couldn't name one. It's the same with college friends, I graduated last year and even though everyone said they'd be in touch, no one actually did and now I have no one to talk to. No one drops in messages or ever asks me how I'm doing. Other than my family and my sister's boyfriend, no one even wished me on my birthday, and that really bugged me. It's been this way for so many years now. And this is when I wish them on their birthdays and if they ever ask for help with anything, I drop everything and always try to help as best as I can. And then they just go away.

Sometimes I get excited about sharing things/events I find on social media or when something shitty happens and I want to vent or make sense of things, I realise that I have no one I can do those things with. So I just have those conversations in my head, and it's pretty pathetic but that's how I cope.

If I were to drop dead tomorrow in an accident perhaps, none of the people I know from school or college will find out for months probably.

And thinking about all of this really makes me so sad, especially since I look at my sister and how she has a million friends and so many people to talk to, I find myself really envying her. How do people have friends who give a shit about them? I don't want to feel this lonely all the time, I want to have people in my life that I can share things with.

I’m a fairly good-looking, smart, funny, twenty-seven years old gay man. I’m successful at work, and even have a few friends. Yet I feel unwanted, abandoned and neglected. I pretend that it’s fine when my friends stand me up but I hate it. I don’t want to seem desperate when I constantly ask them out but they reject me. The truth is that I do become desperate. 

I have had quite a few romantic and sexual partners. I’m single now tho. I’ve been going out on dates just so that I feel less alone. And I hate it. I’m utterly unhappy and I feel like it’s cruel to the guys I’m seeing. I want to love and feel loved. It starts to seem that my heart is worn out. And it feels inevitable that soon my body will turn into something nobody wants to look at, much less wants to come near. (Yes, that was a CMBYN reference. I hope I managed to cheer you up a little bit while reading this. :)) I feel like I will never find someone who actually makes me feel things.

I’m on a somewhat self destructive path as I abuse alcohol, numb myself with Netflix and video games, and post my nudes online for strangers just to feel wanted. I don’t want to hurt or harm myself yet I seem to manage to do it anyway.

I feel hopeless and life just seems meaningless. There might be some hope as I’ve been fortunate enough to be in therapy for the last five months. Sadly healing takes time during which I feel like the arms of the sea of hollowness are pulling me in deeper and deeper. The thing I’m hopeful about tho is that they say that in therapy you have to feel worse before you can feel better. I don’t want to feel hopeless, I don’t want to numb myself, and I don’t want to not see meaning in life.

Whenever one of us was having a rough day, we would be there for each other, to comfort and encourage one another. But then I confessed my feelings for him February this year. He didn't talk to me for a while after that and as an attempt to salvage our friendship, I decided to set aside my romantic feelings for him. Our friendship got back on track after that and then after a while, he started sharing stories about a girl he liked who also liked him back. Obviously, his stories hurt me but I just shrug it off because at that time, I thought that he would think that I was over reacting when I say it hurts me. He then started to have less time for me, which I get because he likes someone else, but what I don't like about that situation is that he would just remember me or talk to me when he's not getting enough love from the girl he likes. That hurt me even more because I felt like I was just a ""back up friend"". I remember crying every night because of all the emotional pain I was in. I even unfollowed him in his socials as an attempt to move on but it turns out he didn't even notice it. Last July 28, we talked for the last time. I told him what I felt and that I'll cut him off until I completely moved on from him. He agreed to it, and said that we could still reconcile in the future (I kinda don't want to go back to being friends with him because it still hurts). I blocked his socials and deleted his number from my phone from that moment. Also, I heard that he and the girl he likes are officially together rn.

I know that it's already been a few months but it just saddens me to know that I probably never even crossed his mind, or that I'm the only one suffering from this situation.

I'm graduating college this spring and now I'm busy trying to finish my last semesters, looking for jobs, studying for my state exam, and looking for apartments. Now I almost don't even want a boyfriend because it's just another responsibility and possibly stressor if he isn't a good one. I've been going on dates back to back the entire summer which just resulted in me getting ghosted. I'm currently still talking to my last date but I feel I don't even want too anymore. I'm just mentally exhausted with dating and I doubt he has the patience for me. I'm halfway terrified to get serious with someone because I know they're going to loose interest at some point. I think my self esteem and confidence is just too low to be in a stable relationship, but it's low because I'm constantly rejected. It's just a never ending cycle. I want to be loved but I'm too scared to put my guard down which is ruining my chances. I just wish I had a relationship when I was younger and I needed one. I wouldn't be so messed up and mentally exhausted today. But you can't change the past so it is what it is.",lonely,I don't know what I want and that is a huge part of my problem,2021-09-07 01:21:24

I am so alone. I can’t keep living like this. 

I try approach my friends about how I’m feeling. I’ve told them all straight up “I’m very lonely, I’m struggling mentally. I need some company and some help please”. It’s always a half assed excuse as to why they don’t have time for me.

I know it’s hard to expect people to be enthusiastic about spending time around such a downer.

I know some people have friends that are just ""school friends"", you know, friends that are only friends because of school and don't really talk outside of school. But I don't think we were. We had discord &amp; messenger group chats where people just posted stupid shit and talked about other stuff. Well sometime last year, I left both of them since that's really all they were lol plus nobody really talked anymore.

Then, some time this year I started to notice more and more my friends and mutual friends were hanging out without me. They would post to Facebook about going to the movies, baseball games, having parties, etc. That and I drive by most of their houses on my way home from work and usually see each other's car parked outside another friends house. Now, I don't really care for baseball so I probably wouldn't have gone if they asked, but the thing is they never did.

I eventually got tired of seeing it all and unfriended and deleted all of them from wherever I was ""friends"" with them. Facebook, Discord, Steam, Instagram, everywhere. And before you say it, no, it wasn't for attention. I never once thought while unfriending them, ""Man I hope they send me a message or something."" Nope, I was tired of clearly being left out. 

Well it's about six months later and I've come to the realization that these shitty friends were also my only friends. I no longer have anyone to talk to, hang out with, anything. I have people I'm friendly with at work but I've never seen them outside of work hours.

3518,KingAris,1630913626,1,"So to address any potential concerns right off, the title is not alluding to potential suicide. I don't have any intention to do that to those I care for. Frankly, I'm just at a weird point in my life and I think it may help to vent anonymously. I have (what I consider) to be plenty of friends. By that I mean a handful of guys I've known for a decade that I am certain would be there for me at the drop of a hat if they thought I needed them. Which goes both ways. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my friends and count myself lucky for that, but I also don't wanna just bitch to them about stuff like this when I could deal with it on my own. Then again, I am posting on social media about it, so I recognize the hypocrisy of that statement. 

Anyway, the reason I'm posting is that I'm just...tired of being alone. It has been almost a decade since my last meaningful relationship with a woman. For a long time, that relationship fucked me up and made me distrust things like romantic feelings and made me far pickier than I had much right to be in pursuit of them. It was like that for a few years until I fell for someone out of nowhere, only to be blindsided by someone I cared deeply for. 

For a long time, I just wanted to improve myself in my career and financially. Then I met a girl at work and got interested. I fell hard for her the first time we went out, but then she just strung me along for a year, going back and forth between wanting to be with me and not, explaining it away with personal circumstances. I tried to be the patient, understanding guy that waited and loved her anyway. It took her getting into a relationship with me and promising not to just leave without explaining anything for the second time for me to finally accept what my friends told me the whole time: She was using me to make herself feel better and never had any real affection for me, whether she claimed to or not. 

Anyway, since that, I've felt pretty empty inside. It was a year ago, and ever since I've been trying to improve my career and derive some sense of purpose or happiness from that, but it hasn't worked. The fact is, I really hate a lot of aspects of myself. Stuff like laziness and the weakness to not pursue things I know I should, like getting in better shape or maybe going back to school. Recently, I quit my job to try to find something that doesn't make me wanna blow my brains out on a daily basis. Fortunately, I have money in savings that I can float on for a while, but I was recently reminded of how lonely I feel and can't seem to shake it. I just feel very low and worthless at the moment.

If anyone does read this whole thing and actually cares, you are a fucking saint and I wish the best for you. If you don't, I can't blame you.

It's been a long time since I've been alone in my home, not because the pandemic but before it. Before the COVID thing I was ending a relationship with a girl, she was my best friend and I had to end things because I was a mess  in the relationship, at that moment I was seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds.   Months before the pandemic I decided to move into a new apartment and to take some months to see a new kind or psychological approach with a new psychotherapist, this time not  psychiatrist. All of that helped me a lot, I've been able to overcome a lot of problem and improve, be a better person but I ended a lot of relationships I had back in the time, including my best friend (my ex). 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, things here are getting better in terms of the pandemic, now we don't even have general lockdown or restrictions and people are starting to go out again. I found that in this time (more than a year) of being alone, I started to avoid human interactions, I'm an introvert and kind of a social anxiety mess but my life hasn't been this lonely. I've been trying to go out, dating and all. But it seems to be a very difficult task, and after some attempts I found myself super tired. 

I'm ok with being alone, but I want to meet new people and make new friends. But this new reality has  changed everything and make things more difficult.  So I want to ask all of you here, how are you doing this? rebuilding human interactions, relationships and al, how do you even try?

Idk, do I even have something to be upset about in the first place?   


Met this amazing, wonderful woman online. The first few months were great, fantastic even. We'd spend all day, pretty much every day talking and hanging out on VR chat or RecRoom. Then we switched it up and played switch together. We were always on a call. Always talking on discord or through text when we weren't. We fell in love, hard and got really close to one another. But recently, she went back to school to finish college. Since then... well communication has been spotty. 

I understand how school can be stressful and how it also soaks up a lot of time. I get that, I really do. Eh, but it's more than that. When she isn't doing something related to school, she's playing games or simply not there at all. She used to greet me every morning and wish me goodnight when we went to bed. She seemed... excited to see me all the time and I feel the same. I still do. But I get the feeling she isn't as excited to see me as I am to see her.

There isn't anything wrong with the relationship I don't think. Certainly not on my end. Things still seem to be going quite well in that respect. 

Eh.

It's just...

I'm trying to be understanding of her current situation. I'm trying to give her whatever space she needs. I'm trying hard to be patient and wait for her to be available, and sure, on the weekends we do get to spend some time together. I just...  


Well... Idk, it just feels like sometimes she's ignoring me. Like I've become a bit of a nuisance to her. I'll message her and most of the time she replies back but then hours pass without a single word and when she does finally reply, it's two or three words and then silence for hours again. 

I dunno, I just feel... ignored. I feel like whatever she's doing is more important than spending time with me. Of course, I don't want to press her. I don't want to come at her angry or accusatory or anything.   


\*sigh\* It's just hard I guess. I'm lonely a lot of the time and hardly have any friends I can talk to or hang out with. It was the same with her but now that she's back in classes, she's meeting new people, talking to new friends and idk I miss her so much all the time. The last thing  I want to do is put a burden on her or make her feel guilty for enjoying herself just to cater to me and my needs. That seems selfish to me. 

Maybe I'm just being too clingy, too needy, too... too much. Maybe I'm just blowing this up to be something it's not. Maybe I'm just being a dumbass.

I guess in the end I just needed to get this out there. At least I can pretend someone cares then?",lonely,I feel ignored and alone.,2021-09-06 17:03:22
3525,aseiniki,1630911609,1,"Ever since the start of the pandemic and lockdown since March 2020 for me, I realized I had no friends. My online friends had all but disappeared. My real life friends have their own closer friend groups. Everyday I spend my time pretending I have things to do so I don’t look lonely. Everyone around me has a group of friends and a decent social life. I want a group of close friends like that, I want a social life like that. I don’t want to be lonely anymore. Over the course of the pandemic I’ve lost all interest in everything I used to like. I can’t contribute and talk in the communities I used to be in, because I stopped being invested in it. I don’t have anything in common with anyone. I’ve never been an interesting person, but I want to be someone important and interesting. I never felt truly close with anybody. Ever since childhood I couldn’t hold down long term friendships. All I want is to be able to talk to someone.
I don’t get text, I don’t get calls. I spent the summer alone, with little to no social interactions. I’m too afraid to text people because, unlike me, they have actual substance in life, they actually have a stuff to do. I feel like I’m bothering someone simple by talking or texting. They probably have stuff to to, they’re busy, they don’t have to pretend to do stuff to look like they aren’t lonely. The only social interactions I get now are from school. Yet, it doesn’t really matter since I don’t feel close to them. I don’t feel close to anyone anymore. I wished I was a somebody too, I wished I was popular and well-liked.
I don’t want to think about this stuff, but I can’t. I don’t want to be the loser without friends or a social life. This loneliness is driving me crazy. I try to ignore it and just  try to pick up one of my old hobbies and interests to ignore it, but I still feel so lonely.",lonely,I want a social life. I want a friend group.

Either way, I have health anxiety and I've constantly been obsessing about dying, which has also fueld great stress and top it off with my worsened anxiety and this last month has been utter dog shit.

3581,Real-Development3322,1630888167,1,"Over the past few years ive been online dating this girl. She constantly spoke of starting a life together and marriage. We had a fight and didn't speak for a couple weeks, started back speaking and she tells me that she's been speaking with this other guy now and won't stop. I probably should've left her then but i was too weak i guess. I stayed in the picture because she said she still cares for me and want it to work but she's confused.
 Soon after, I began to feel the drifting. Less time and effort being put into it, but i tried to hold on. 
 Now she's hot and cold to me and even harsh at times. Our convo's start off with her being how she used to be but eventually leads to her saying hurtful things and blaming me for all of this ""mess"". 
 I was there for her through her depressed stages over the years and now she's like leaving me for a new guy who she says she's only known for like a month or so(long distance) saying he was there for comfort in her time of need.
 I suffered a devastating heartbreak long ago and vowed to never let happen again. I opened to her about that after she gained my trust . 
 Our last convo started off great but eventually led to her saying some extremely hurtful things to me basically telling me im nothing and our interactions are meaningless to her now is probably the nicest way i can word it. She apologized a while later for it  and says the words comes from the hurt i caused her, which I've apologized for countless times even Though i feel like it was all due to a  miscommunication error. 
 So honestly idk if its the depression magnifying the hurt she's feeling or what. She seems perfectly fine and sweet until the ""hurt"" re-enters her mind. Im still stuck on her and the way we were before the ""hurt"". I know from experience how depression can interfere with one's thoughts and moods, not saying its the depression causing this but possibly a role in it. 
 She mentioned long ago how she begins to push people away when she gets depressed.
I don't know what to make of all of this ongoing hot and cold daily. Its as if she panics and puts up immediate walls whenever she starts to get super lovey.
Any thoughts and advice are welcomed

TLDR:
* invested emotionally into girl online 
*Became pretty serious 
*Had disagreement, new guy in picture
*She's now hot and cold (sweet and numb)
*Blames me for the hurt she feels and exhibits towards me through anger randomly during convos
*Still reaches out and initiates at times but has fear that im going to hurt her emotionally
*Panics and go cold after being super sweet and letting her walls down again temporarily
*Im attached to her and don't know what to do",lonely,THREW OUT LIKE YESTERDAY'S LEFTOVERS,2021-09-06 10:29:27

For the past year I have felt so touch starved.  I have been single before. I was single through a pregnancy and for 3 years I did okay without having the comfort of a partner.  Now that I am single again I feel so much more alone than I ever did before.  I don't know if it's my age [f31] or if it's something else.  

My first relationship lasted about 6 years but I stuck around an additional 2 years to raise my kids while their father was in a full blown relationship with someone else.  Sounds really stupid but I was content just raising my little ones and he was never really loving towards me so I guess I was use to being alone.  He was always gone anyway so I learned to not need anyone.

I've always been pretty self sufficient but now that I am single again it feels different this time.  I've never been the type to really date.  All my relationships have always started off as friends except for this last one [together 6 years, engaged for 4 years].  He was very lovey and sweet in the beginning and still sort of was touchey feely through the years.  

I still have no desire to date but I am finding myself longing to be comforted, hugged, held, anything that would fill that basic need.  I feel pathetic because of this but I can't help it.  I don't mean I need it in a sexual way.  I mean, I'm sure sex would be nice but I can handle that end by myself lol [I have a really high sex drive].  I strictly mean in an intimate way. I don't currently and have never desired a fk buddy.  Not my kind of Kool aide.  

How long does it take to get past this feeling?  Did it get better with time or intensify?  How did you deal with it?

I was talking with someone online who I thought loved me but turns out they didn't. We were kinda intimate and I was getting attached to them only for them to suddenly tell me that they met someone else and they didn't want to talk to me in a intimate way anymore. I think they were afraid to reject me outright. 

I thought they understood me and I know they care about me but I honestly didn't expect this from them. They said they liked me only as a friend and admitted to talking with me because they were lonely. They apologized and expressed remorse for it but it still stung.

Luckily I got over it but I think its affected me a lot on how I view myself and my interactions with people.

I'm a pretty lonely person, I live in a toxic enviroment, recently had a death in the family and suffer from mental health issues. I just feel like people will get tired of me. I have such low self esteem and I think I was desparte for anyone to listen and validate me. Someone theorized that I probably subconsiously look for my parent's narcissitic/abusive traits when it comes to meeting new people. Idk. I bonded with the person over mental health stuff and I really thought we had a connection. But I wasn't enough. They got tired of me. I had a brief thought of hurting myself and just dying just so I couldn't feel the hurt but decided against it.

The other person reminded me a lot of myself. They hated themselves and thought of themselves as toxic. I could relate with that. 

I'm trying not to let this get to me. I blocked the person, promised myself I would never talk to them, but then contacted them when I was in crisis like a dumbass and idk. I don't know why I do the things I do. I feel like I have no self-respect. Like I'm desperate. I wanted to be friends with them but I ended up finding out that they were even worse than I expected and it just broke me. Despite it I still can't help but care for them but I know they don't give two shits about me.

I go to therapy but somestimes I feel like my therapist is too detached from me. I just want to connect with someone you know? Someone that'll understand my struggles and get me. I don't even want a romantic relationship. I just crave the fantasy of someone caring for me and not getting tired of me. I had that understanding with my mother when I was younger but we've grown apart when I recognized some of her toxic traits.

Am I just gonna be alone forever? Why do people get tired of me? I don't know how to connect with people. I'm scared of people and the shit they're capable of.

I am an intern within children and youthcare, currently working with 1-4th grade at a school. It is my last year, but i really struggle a lot. 

Every time i think of my workplace, a sense of dread fills me head and chest, and it kind of gets hard to breath. I treasure the weekends away from work, but when its time to go back, i feel like I'm about to enter hell. 

I am fortunately done next hear, but i really struggle to find the motivation to keep going. If i end this and quit, i loose my education and i will not have finished school.. but for some reason that is not enough motivation.

My guide (the one who is supposed to teach me) expects way too much of me, and as soon as i oppose her or show my disagreement or try to stand up for myself, she behaves very rudely and shuts me down. I have become afraid of talking to her or asking her questions..

I struggle a lot with anxiety as well. I have social phobia, social anxiety, panic anxiety and mild depression.. which dies not make this case easier, and she is aware of it all..

I feel so alone with this, yes my parents are here but they dont really understand much.. i just feel like i have nobody to relate to or find comfort in.

3613,Briskicedteax,1630870147,1,"Back story so you can know a bit about me. I'm a skinny white 24 yr old, with post prone acne face. I'll admit I'm more on the ugly side. And I probably have a stoner face (if that's even possible) I never had a gf, and only have my old high school friends as I haven't made any new ones after high school.

So basically everywhere I go I feel like/ know I get looks, whether dirty, glaring, or double checking looks at me. When I am walking to my car from apt. Store, work, etc. And someone is going in after parking their car, they almost always beep lock their car, as I am fucking walking out the door and they're walking in. Even in elevators, people would rather wait then ride down or up with me, I've seen people walking to the elevators behind me, and they just run to the stairs.

It feels very fucking disrespectful, because if im going to be honest with myself, most people who know me think im like the nicest person. Although I don't exactly agree, I just have to take their word for it.

I just started the best job I ever had and I still get these looks, and it makes me feel less of myself. I'm living in my brothers 2500$ apt rn, so I'm living my best life, but when I get in contact with people they automatically treat me like I'm a fucking loser or criminal or some bs like that, or atleast I assume. I've walked by people, (who have walked by multiple people ahead of me) and they completely go silent in conversation like I am making them uncomfortable. In reality I've grown so accustomed to this THAT I'm more scared of them then they probably are towards me. I actually usually don't even look at them besides a quick glance, and they're just staring at me.


At the end of the day, this stuff makes feel like I don't belong. Like I am doing something wrong. Any suggestions besides just stomaching it and moving on?

Yes, because irrespective of what you believe in, life in itself lacks meaning. Everything is a social construct. Nothing is inherently good, bad or meaningful. So when you're not receiving happiness should you die? Or like Santiago from OLD MAN AND THE SEA, you should keep struggling just for the sake of it? Why is life so precious, that when you don't have anything that makes you happy, you'll have to stay? Am I selfish for saying this? Absolutely. And it doesn't matter, since we all are selfish. You don't love a person unless they have done a significant lot for you. Until you find them attractive in some way, or their presence makes you happy. We all are selfish beasts. You don't do good for another person selflessly, you've been conditioned to believe that helping others brings in rewards. To the point where the act of helping becomes the reward. Society moulded you that way.

We hung around a lot during the summer. But ever since she had a mental breakdown after some traumatic events, she’s been distant. I’ve tried my best to include her but it’s now futile, she won’t hang with barely anyone. 

Today she told me she is going to work two jobs and take extra classes to take her mind off things. Which means she will literally have no time for anything. She and I always talked about what we would do once college starts again, and I thought we would be starting new opportunities together. But she just dipped out without a care. 

I’ve supported and included her as much as I could. She now uses me as a free therapist 

I don’t have any close girlfriends on campus right now, and I kinda want to block her for essentially lying to and abandoning me. She’s been a shit friend for months. But now I feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness.

I tried finding someone new during those 12 years but the interest of the other party only lasted a few days, a week tops. Being completely numb and robotic, accepting what my future held, I had given up the hope of finding anyone who would be interested. It's just isn't in the cards for me. Some people are just meant to be alone. You never think that that possibly could be you but, believe me, it is a truly sobering experience when that acceptance creeps in. But then, you showed up. I was hesitant and dismissing the possibility that you were actually interested and just being friendly and polite. To my absolute delight the realization that you were interested made me feel the happiest I'd ever been. Honestly, it wasn't a happiness that resulted in a musical number of dancing down the street, just a pleasant feeling that perhaps my thinking of the past 12 years was completely wrong and all that time working on myself, in all the suggested ways, was actually genuine and real. I used appropriate caution to not scare you away but because, maybe, my lack of experience of how to navigate romance, made me too relaxed and it turned you off. I didn't absorb you in my life completely and insist that we didn't merge into the same person and maintain our own person. I'm not sure if that was my fatal decision. I'm not sure what I did wrong. Ultimately, in your very sweet way, you let me down easy giving me your list of reasons to leave too include your feeling that you weren't ready for a relationship. You can't imagine the hurt I felt seeing you a month later in a commited relationship. I don't blame you, really. I know it's my fault and I'm happy that you're happy. I wasn't capable of going through the trials and errors of earlier relationships to give you what you needed. So here I am, alone again with the same thinking as the first 12 year block.

I’m autistic so I already struggle with people and life. I really liked this girl, my first proper crush, I really liked her. I liked her at a time where she wasn’t doing too good and I really wanted to help her we became really close friends and I thought I really liked her, not in a crush way or in a friend way just in a way where you just want to spend all your time with that person. 

Anyways, I helped her through quite a lot, I didn’t and don’t have many friends and so she was pretty much all I really had to speak to. She was struggling with school and lots family and friend issues and i wanted to help her since it was exam times here in the UK and I know how stressful it is. But once exam periods were over and I had helped her pass, she stopped speaking to me completely, same with how I encouraged her to speak to someone she thought she wanted to be friends with. This was about a 9 month period and I really liked this girl and I can’t begin to explain how much and the story is much longer but it ended with her saying there wasn’t ever a friendship between us even though she said there was prior. 

And now I have no friends and I don’t know why but I feel even more lonely, I feel used abd now seeing her with a massive friend group just makes me feel so sad , the worst part is that it hasn’t affected her, she doesn’t care.

3644,dizismyjourneyy,1630848348,1,"My bestfriend that I knew since I was a child (21 now) got this new friend around 5 years ago and I feel replaced. My bestfriend is the type to talk about what pisses her off about her other friends to me and now that i’m not around her to hang out much anymore, I feel like she’s doing that about me to her friend. I tried my best to there and make myself available when she’s sad, happy, depressed and she never seem to make time for me when I wasn’t feeling good nor asks me to hang out?

I think now she has realized that I haven’t spoken much to her neither asked her to chill because I can’t be the only one asking and providing in the friendship while she just receives and never gives back. I don’t ask for materialistic things, I just want the genuine friendship we had. I know she feels salty because now her friend works and goes to school while I am doing my own personal things in life and she’s left alone so it turned back on her. Also, she sees quotes that I like on instagram and she tries to shade me by reposting other quotes.

How should I feel or what should I do? I always feel bad for her and want her to be MY bestfriend but I feel like she sometimes isn’t the same like we used to be and she doesn’t seem to see it. I do feel replaced, while I don’t care if she had friends, I can sense the energy of her not being so involved as I was so I give up when we hang together and can’t fake it so I just stay to myself.",lonely,Idk,2021-09-05 23:25:48

3646,Exact-Quote3464,1630846971,1,"I’m starting to reconsider whether or not it’s even a bad thing I’m single. I’ll probably sound bitter and cynical but I see how so many people around me seem to be miserable in their relationships, and feel like most of them might even dream of being in my position sometimes. Maybe it’s because I’m at an age when couples have been together for a few years by now, since many get together in their early 20s and we’re now in our late 20s, and the honeymoon phase has been over for a little while, leaving room for the routine and family life. I see what having a family involves, how it ruins many couples, and makes people feel trapped etc.

But again, I’m still saddened by my loneliness. The lack of affection still weighs me. I still wish I had a special someone I could take care of and be taken care of by. I guess what I’m trying to say is just that sometimes we crave for and idealise something that can make us even sadder than we are now. I’m starting to relativise and see the perks of my situation too.

- If I want to move to the other side of the globe (and it’s the case, I’m trying to move abroad), I can without having to have a serious talk with a partner, re-organise everything (kids schools, partner’s job etc). No strings attached, besides my mom and a couple friends who I would miss.
- I don’t have kids, I’ve never wanted any and can’t imagine myself as a parent. Especially since I’m writing this as I’m hearing my neighbours kids cry.  
- I’m very solitary by nature and a pretty secret person, so the idea of living with someone isn’t appealing to me. I like walking him and know I will have some time alone.

When I get dressed up and have some makeup, I feel wow, I deserve a chance to look for love :)

Yea. My life is pretty dark at the moment because I wanted to work in the tourism industry but Covid came and ruined everything.

I have a job now but I hate it coz it doesnt pay well. I lose confidence in myself because of this. But now I realize I need to seek someone.

This afternoon, I watched a bunch of movies about love and suddenly the tears came out.

I realize I need love too. I want to be cared about and I want to be cherished by someone I also have feelings for.

Right now, when I am writing this post, it is raining outside and the smell of the rain reminds of me years ago, in 2003, 2004 haha. I have always missed that cozy feeling when winter came and my family all got curled up in a blanket, my siblings and I had pillow fights and laughed together.

Now everyone parts ways...I realize I need to find a family for my own too!

""I'm so sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

its amazing how these small little words could make me change my entire perspective of what friendship meant to me. in a matter of seconds, i knew i was disrespecting myself being with people who are inconsiderate, low-life, egotistic, conceited, selfish, dumb ASF, and not at all socially aware of human behavior. like how could you live to adult hood with a brain the size of a kindergartener. like how does that make any fucking sense?

&amp;#x200B;

today is the day i have decided to cut off almost all my friends. it was actually a very hard decision to make, it was on my mind for about 5 years, but today, its time i let them go. 

&amp;#x200B;

they leave me lonely. never call, never text yet they swear they miss me. while im in my room, crying about being alone, yall are out having the time of your lives clubbing and meeting new people and traveling. then come running back to me to tell me as if it wouldn't hurt my feelings. Worst of all, my best friend is the cause of this shit. 

known her for almost all my life. been getting bad vibes from her like 5-6 years ago, but i always move past it because i love her(well...used to now). today she BEGGED me to come to this shitty ass fair i didn't have the money nor the interesting in doing. the thing about my best friend is, she thinks self care is being selfish and inconsiderate to other people, especially those who actually have her back. i don't know how you could take something so good for your soul and make it so damn toxic. she makes me feel neglected, insecure, and gives me a competition vibe. like she is afraid of my potential of being greater than her in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

she never lets me hang out with our ""friends"". it consisted of 4 girls, including me and they are mostly close to her and they dont bother to call nor text me. only when its convenient  for them of course or when they want to get in contact with my best friend when she doesnt answer the phone. 

today, we linked with our old friends and shes been hanging out with them all summer without telling me. i sat home all summer bored ash because i had no one hitting me up. and the sad thing is, they asked about me coming over all the time. they told me why i never came when they invited me out. i was confused, stating i was never told about any of these events, but that my best freind knew. she was suppose to tell me but of course, lied and said I couldn't make it or i didnt wanna come. 

&amp;#x200B;

except the fair. the fair she begged me to come. i dont trust her already, but i went to meet my old friends. we go there, there's 5 girls in total, including me. and they shut the gate(active shooter?? they lied about that just to get people out). my best friend and one of my old friend snuck in while the 3 of us stood outside for 3-4 hours in the literal cold trynna get past cops and guards. 

&amp;#x200B;

after hours of walking, running, sneaking, climbing on cars and gates, and lying our asses off, my best friend and my old friend leave the fair and hits us with a ""I'm so sorry. There was nothing we could do to get y'all inside the fair"".....

like they were deadass about it too. I spent money i didn't have, got dressed and makeup on and everything and I was actually really excited to have meet with my old friends, just to be left in the literal cold.

&amp;#x200B;

And the thing that got me real heated, was the fact that they were reassuring us it wasn't their fault we didn't have a good time today. They could've just left the fair and we could've went to the club or do something else TOGETHER. like that was the point of going out anyways, to make memories together. why would they even think about going to ride the rides and eat food while 3 of us struggle to even get past the gates of the fair?

&amp;#x200B;

its quite simple actually. they are selfish assholes. never again will i ever decide to go out with those 2 again. i am sick of being treated with such disrespect in from people who shouldn't even be acting this way towards me. 

&amp;#x200B;

with my 4 group friends, they leave me out in trip information's and only tell me when they know its too late, they don't call/text, they go out and come to me telling me stories i have no relation with and talk about people i don't know at all. its like they want to purposely make me confused and insecure 24 fucking 7.  to let me know how much better their lives are without me interfering. 

now with my old friends, i can see it will be the exact same shit because of my best friend. and i will not deal with this cycle again. 

&amp;#x200B;

it's like people have really forgotten what the word friendship means. because of my past experiences of friendships, I take them so seriously and I am very careful of who I call a friend nowadays. I don't need to make myself feel insecure, lonely, or wonder if there is something wrong with the way I look or in my personality.  feeling like your stuck with people like this, it made me very depressed growing up, along with other issues i am not comfortable speaking about on this post. it just hurts to see someone you were comfortable enough to express your true self with, become a complete stranger. even worse when they start attacking the character you thought they enjoyed. because at the end, you'll have to come to terms with the fact that, life changes people and that means you will always lose something to gain something better. but for now, i haven't been able to find that better replacement. so my heartache is hurting like a bitch. 

i don't if it will get any better. I thought it would be different with my old friends, but its the same shit. It's gotten so bad that I would think about manifesting my friend group. like how sad is that.

3679,UsernameTakenSigh,1630830041,1,"Hi, I'm 15 years old who started off freshmen online, all year. Now I'm a sophomore who doesn't know how high school is suppose to be like, I don't know what I'm suppose to do or go when I get there on the 7th. My most major concern is socializing. I haven't socialized since 8th grade outside. I haven't had an IRL friend since 6th grade, and even then, I don't talk to many people online. I feel like I'll spend my high school years alone and terrible, and I don't even know what I'll do for my future, idk what will interests me, for what I'll do for a living. There's people my age working a job and I don't want to, not because I'm lazy, in fact I want a job since I don't want to rely on my parent's money (I feel bad whenever I ask them to buy something for me). I just don't see any reason why I'll be able to get a part time job as I don't have any interesting qualities/experiences. I feel very incompetent. 

I want to make friends, but making friends looks impossible since I'm so bad at socializing, not just at talking, but facial expression, understanding the situation, everything. I don't know the world that teens of my generation live in since I've essentially excluded myself from society. I feel like I don't fit in.

I feel like I'll grow into a old cat lady... I kinda feel like one already, without the cats though.

I'm just feeling very overwhelmed as school is coming closer and closer. I dislike school overall, thinking about going there scares me a lot, and I'm not so sure why. 

Thank you to those who read through my rant. I appreciate it. I don't have anyone to talk to about this.",lonely,Scared of school,2021-09-05 18:20:41

3682,Degoliver,1630827695,1,"M(30), I feel very lonely and empty inside. I have tried going to therapy so I can stop feeling this way, but it hasn't worked. 

I am not good at talking, so when I am in front of other people my mind goes blank, many times people think that I am too serious, I am angry or I am bored. 

This has affected my financial situation, since I have failed many job interviews, due to fear, anxiety and getting nervous that prevent me from being seen as a responsible person. 

In my house, the relationship with my family is awful, my mother thinks that I am a terrible person, and has even told me that I am a shameful person, that she is fed up with me or that she had wished for me to not be her son. I have always tried to make her proud, but nothing that I do is enough for her. 

A long time ago I had a friend with whom I talked, usually she was the one who told me about her problems or about her life. But I stopped talking to her after she tried to sue me for bullying after we talked about a video of her dancing. The video does not contain any sexual material, nor is she in any compromising position, she is simply dancing. We shot the video at a party with her consent and she even had found it funny at the time. We had only talked about it once or twice, and she had never told me that it bothered her, otherwise I would have never mentioned it.

I don't have many friends and after that I'm afraid of losing the two that I have right now.So I have decided to distance myself from them, as not to do something stupid that would make them hate me. I know that I am not the best person and that I have many defects, but it terrifies me to think that the people I love would come to hate me. 

I don't know what to do, many times I have thought about that it would be better if I was no longer alive, In the past I have tried 2 times, but I did not succeed. Nobody noticed when I have tried it, and I am afraid that, no one would care.

The last few months have been really rough on me because I have not really had a lot of positive genuine human connections other than from my immediate family. I also just moved into a new apartment near a university a few weeks ago that houses mostly college students, and it’s been extremely difficult to watch so many other younger people hang out with their friends or listen to parties late at night where people are clearly having a good time, while I’m laying in bed crying. I’ve accepted that the loneliness I feel is just a part of growing up and there’s nothing I can do to escape it, yet somehow that makes me feel worse. Tonight’s another hard night, but reading everyone else’s experiences on here actually made me feel a little bit less lonely.

3699,Uberbooger98,1630819255,1,"The title goes without explanation, I also hugged a pillow so I wouldn't feel deprived. This isn't the first time either. I mean, I'm a 22 year old man living alone with no close friends or gf. I'm not even in college, but plan to next year. I'm so lonely that I physically feel it in my chest sometimes, like there's something heavy on it. I just really want someone to talk to or hug/snuggle with. I want to feel someone's touch to know that I matter to someone other than just my family because that's really all I have.

Dating apps don't work for me, 95% of the time when I match no one wants to go the other 50% in a conversation, other 5% I go on a perfect date and they ditch me like they don't care. I care a lot about people, sometimes more than myself. Every girl I have ever known or dated has never wanted (or expressed want) to start a relationship with me, despite my obvious intentions to commit and start a happy relationship. I sometimes ask myself if I'm not interesting enough, or good enough looking to keep people's attention.

Aside from dating apps, I don't have any other prospects except the people I know at work. But then again, they are my coworkers. As I said before, I dont attend college so meeting people there is currently out of the question. Same goes for bars, clubs, or parties because I'm very socially anxious and awkwardly silent at times.

I'm having trouble expressing what I'm often feeling but it's a troubled mix of depression, sadness, lonliness, touch deprivation, anxiety, grief, and sometimes anger (though never towards other people). I suppress my feelings when I'm around people like when I'm at work, but how can people understand me if they don't really understand me if I'm being silent?

In public or at work I can seem funny, smart, or kind, but when the day is over and I head home I start to feel like shit. Thoughts of wanting touch, positive affirmation, or closeness turn into what feel like physical aches in my chest and sad thoughts of desperation in my head. I'm not saying I want sex with random people, far from it, I want a deep connection with someone special and whome I can love dearly. I don't want to be alone anymore.

I'm a guy who owns multiple businesses, and I talk to people all the time. I have had many girlfriends in the past, and I deal with a lot of different clients and just a lot going on... that doesn't stop loneliness.

I had a girlfriend I was with from December 2018 - August 2020. She was beautiful, amazing, all that on the outside. She was a stunner. A woman most men would chase. I had her. She was abusive as fuck. A gaslighter and was just always making shit up or twisting my reality into her hands and it just fucked me up so bad that someone I loved and put so much trust into just manipulated, abused, and really just thought of me as just one of her many boy toys.

She ended up marrying someone behind my back while we were still together. She's gone. I left her. I haven't been with anyone officially since. Had plenty of women in my bed since and I'll tell you something... a woman in your bed doesn't do shit for loneliness. If anything one night stands make it a  lot worse because you spent all this effort to get laid or a couple dates and it's like being broken up with over and over. You hop from chick to chick but every time you fuck one it's like... well she'll be gone in the morning... and then you're all alone again. There's no love or connection there so it's even worse than not having one at all. 

You may be lonely, you may yearn for belonging, but there are plenty of people out here who ""have someone"" who are absolutely miserable and wish they were alone... being lonely aint so bad when you see what the other side has... 

Just my two cents.",lonely,Advice to all the lonely people here...,2021-09-05 14:22:18

3716,No-Arrival-7380,1630815134,1,"Hi, 

I was always a pretty introverted person and never had too many friends. I relocated to the US about 6 years ago and was basically alone for about 3-4 years. 

During 10th grade, someone in my class walked up to me and asked if I wanted to hang out. This person became a very close friend and we formed sort of a friend group of 6 people over the past two years. During COVID we would talk on discord basically 24/7 and we all became very close.

Now everyone left for college and I just feel so alone and sad. Everyone around me seems to be so excited about making new friends and starting a new life while I just wanted to stay with the friends that I finally had for once. 

I did end up dorming with one close friend but I feel like I'm losing him as a friend now. I have yet to make any friends while he already found a new friend group which I am not a part of and a new best friend on the first day. 

Every time I ask him to do something he turns me down and ends up doing something very similar with his other friends instead. The one time he offered to get lunch, he left me as soon as we arrived since his other friend group was there and I ended up sitting alone.

He mentioned a few times how this new friend is like me but more fun, and I just feel like shit now like I was some sort of side friend. I feel like I was just a compromise until he could find more fun people to hang out with.

I tend to be close friends with other people like me who also have only a few close friends so this just feels very weird for me. I feel like this whole time I thought he was one of my best friends while he just considered me a last resort. 

 I don't really enjoy hanging out with him anyone but for some reason I get upset every time he posts going out on instagram with other people. He keeps ghosting me and treating me like shit but for some reason I keep messaging him hoping he wants to hangout. I can't control it and I don't know why I even care about it. It's bad to the point where I could be talking to a better friend and having fun on discord but I would still check my dms with him hoping he will reply so I could play or hangout with him instead.

I honestly think my best option is to move on and cut him out of my life, but I am now dorming with him for at least a semester if not the rest of the year and I don't really know what to do.",lonely,I feel betrayed by my friend,2021-09-05 14:12:14

My best friend of four years recently ditched me to hang out with her bf. i move across the country in two weeks so i'll leave her behind anyway, even if we were on good terms. im embarrassed too, because i'm about to be 18 and ive never even went on a date or held hands with anybody, and my ""luck"" with romance includes getting rejected by guys who openly admitted to having feelings for me but turning me down anyways. so fuck it, the only place i feel safe is in my little fantasy world of people who actually love me.",lonely,"hate being alone, scared of companionship",2021-09-05 13:00:10
3727,TsukiHaibara,1630810556,1,"The cold start of april rain
Nothing to do nothing to make nothing to gain
Eating something sour
And then she appeared 
A beautiful april flower 
Why does this feel so weird

She made me feel things
Made me want to do things
Made me feel more alive
And most importantly make me alive 
But idk what to do
Or what I should do

Hesitation questioning naivety 
Are the words that make me me
And differ me from others
In the end I only want us to be lovers
And not another wound to cover yet again
Like last time back then

Love is frightening but also beautiful 
But stories can have two endings
Good or bad one of them is harmful 
Is the only thing Im thinking with these sendings
Do I have chance ?
No one knows with certainty 
As always seems like normally 

So I went with it falling for her
Things that never seemed real
all appeared with her
But the problem is, is this even real
Nobody knows about her except me
I felt special is this really me
Or just another naive play on emotions
That just tries to let me drown in this ocean

Memories laughs and an unforgettable moment
That’s what I think of when I think of her
But I feel like this is an enrollment 
For whom can get that heart of hers
But I’ll fight 
Through the night
For everything 
And nothing 

Stupidity naivety and disappointment 
Love is annoying with commitment
Breaking me every time
How can I go back
When life used to be like wine
Sour but not a drawback 
When the sun used to shine

I lost yet again
Another wound to cover again
But then another saint appeared
And fixed a wound that was torn
Took me in like a coat that she has worn
And that rain finally cleared",lonely,A song that I wrote out of a heart break,2021-09-05 12:55:56

3737,tkvg,1630804548,1,"im 30. i live in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with my dog. about five years ago I had a bad break up with a girl that I really loved. do you guys remember that scene in the 'aviator' when di caprio is living in his theater and living off of cookies and collecting piss. well that was me for a year after the break up. i moved into a crappy house with a bunch of random people. it was easier for me to pee into a kombucha bottle then leave my room to go to the bathroom, i just did not want social interaction at all. it got dark. i would only leave at night or just live off of dominoes pizza deliveries late at night. i went through three jobs at first but i just ended up stopping work all together. eventually i got out of there and moved into my dads cabin. he always told me he left it to me in his will so i just moved in early i guess.

 it took three years to get over that girl. working for my dad and some neighbors cutting dead trees down, pruning, mowing grass. im my own boss out here so i tend to slack off. spend too much time reading books and playing video games than working. 

before that break up i traveled to every state in the US, living on the road by way of thumb and rail since i was 17. never went to college. i got a job and saved up for a plane ticket to europe where i spent a year drifting around penniless. met my birth mom in romania. then after that i went directly to south america and spent a year there. so ive already gotten out and about and seen things so its not like i feel trapped in this cabin. cabin life is something ive always fantasized about while traveling.

after these last years im happier than i was. i have my dog, who is my boy. but thats pretty much it. i get one bar of cell service if i position my phone carefully on the window seal of the bathroom. and using a tethering app i connect my laptop to it. 144p youtube videos is all i get but to me thats like having civilization in the bathroom. when covid happened and everyone had to be isolated i was laughing internally: 'welcome to my world'.

all my friends from school have moved on, facebook is permanently dead like ive been ghosted by everyone. probably because i ghosted them first because of hard traveling. i dont really know what im doing typing this. or what i expect. something i learned is that loneliness only gets better when you figure out how to be friends with yourself. but damn i miss chatting with my buddies. i miss being in love with that girl. of course shes getting married now. woe is me right internet?",lonely,woe,2021-09-05 11:15:48

I have talked to girls ever since I got in, but I honestly don't think we are on the same page. I want something genuine and not only having a fun time overnight or just for a weekend. I want someone who also cares about me other than myself. Someone who is there when I need and I can be there for.

3757,TRIFFICbro,1630797111,1,"I don't like people, I don't mind being alone, etc. Yet, I keep being plagued with what I call a feeling of 'loneliness'. It's like I get this urge to find people to talk to and complain about stuff. I don't get it. I know it's stupid, I know it's useless and yet I can't help it. It distracts me so much from being productive. It's like I can't stand the fact that people younger than me are out living their lives, having friends and all this stuff while I didn't. It bothers me so much. I think it might change when I turn 24 later this month. Hopefully. Maybe that's why. I feel like I'm exiting my early twenties and so the pressure is on my mind of this was your last chance to socialise with young people. Hmmmm. Not sure. Either way, I just get this immensely distracting feeling of regret and, potentially, loneliness, though I think primarily regret, that prompts me to want to talk to people. And yet I

I can make friends to talk to (online). That's not the issue, I'm not looking for advice or someone to be friends with, people online just don't do it for me. I seem to use them just to complain and as a result I don't talk to anyone online because it's not fair on them. I've cut off all my online friends because it's like I just can't handle being in an online friendship. They last a couple months at most, so I just don't bother with them anymore. SO WHY DO I STILL HAVE THE URGE TO FIND PEOPLE TO TALK TO. Why am I on Reddit!? Or Twitter!? Or anywhere else I go to find complete randoms to talk to.

Idk. All I konw is that once I eradicate this feeling, I can be 100% productive. My focus is so OFF and has been for so long.

Any tips on how to eradicate this feeling?

It feels like all I attract are toxic people. Or I’m never enough for people. 
Dating is a train wreck. It just feels like I’ll never meet my person. Just aimlessly swiping through strangers. I hate this. I want chemistry. Love. Tenderness. Intimacy. Vulnerability. 


I feel like I’m just constantly wallowing in my feelings. Like yeah i have fantastic friends. I do. I go out. And take myself on dates. I work on myself. Manifest. Go to therapy. Do my shadow work. So I understand romantic relationships are the end all be all. But it’s something that *I* want. Something that’s important to me. It’s starting to feel like I’m gonna be alone forever. Like I’m impossible to love. Like I could never be desirable or loved or missed. 


It always hits me the hardest at night or on the weekends. I try to go go out but I can’t all the time. I try to distract myself but then late at night all the feelings and thoughts come rushing back. 


Everytime I match with someone on dating apps it never leads anywhere. It’s like no one is interested in me or even just holding a decent conversation. It’s so disheartening. I give up. Clearly love isn’t for me. How cruel that the universe made me a hopeless romantic.

You seem so mature for your age."" And that's where it usually stops. I find it disturbing that girls like me only for my baseline personality traits, but not how I make them feel or what they think I can offer in a relationship that extends just past a friendship. They never mention anything deep, but just enough to fill up the same space as an introductory character card. However, if I have a crush on a woman and enough so to gain the courage to tell her that, there'd be a lot more I say rather than, ""Oh, you're pretty. You're nice. You make me laugh.""

Some of you may be saying, ""It's nice you have traits women find attractive,"" but it seems like the more and more I learn about women these are merely but ""nice guy"" traits. Traits that's nice to have in a guy, but not what woman are really looking for. Even if women say those are the reasons why they have crushes or have fallen in love with me, I find it hard to believe that. All of my previous relationships have started with women saying those exact things, and it always ends with the woman being bored or her breaking up with me while simultaneously friend-zoning me.

Hello, about 8 months ago I was in an extremely depressing area.

I created a post about how touch deprived I was, and I was so surprised to receive such positive comments. It was the first time I saw so many people reach out to me to help me. I couldn't respond to every message since I was fairly new to reddit, so I apologize if I never responded to your message.

Although it's old, it will always have an influence on me. Those days were absolute torture. I didn't shower for weeks, and I'd just sit at my desk for half the day doing nothing. I failed almost everything, and I couldn't bring myself to do anything at all. I wanted to die every day, and eventually the depression formed into an empty, void-like feeling. Instead of crying at random times like I had done, I just couldn't bring myself to cry for months. I feel like that had been the most darkest place I had ever been in. I contacted my teachers and even a simple response like ""We understand"" brought me to **tears.** It's always been hard for me to reach out to someone because I'm terrified I might sound like I'm attention seeking.

However, I've definitely gotten better. It's a whole new school year, yet my grades are terrible even at the beginning of the semester. I genuinely can't bring myself to focus. In terms of mental health, I genuinely feel as if I've improved... I actually can bring myself to shower! :D My family still criticizes me, but I think it's gotten a bit better. It pains me because I understand that my parents love me, but they don't realize how damaging it is. I still plan on moving out some day with my friends. :)

Though I still have some issues and it won't be the last time I'll probably be ranting in here, but I genuinely would like to thank this sub. I still have an empty void-like feeling that won't go away, but I promise that I will try my best to get better. I'll try my best to get my motivation up, and I'll try to pull my life together once and for all.

Thank you for the motivation, and thank you for the help. It's been a long time, but I genuinely thank this sub for reaching out to me. I really appreciate it, and I'm always here to talk too for anyone who needs it. &lt;3",lonely,Just a thank you to this sub,2021-09-05 05:36:26

I couldn't respond to every message since I was fairly new to reddit, so I apologize if I never responded to your message.

Although it's old, it will always have an influence on me. Those days were absolute torture. I didn't shower for weeks, and I'd just sit at my desk for half the day doing nothing. I failed almost everything, and I couldn't bring myself to do anything at all. I wanted to die every day, and eventually the depression formed into an empty, void-like feeling. Instead of crying at random times like I had done, I just couldn't bring myself to cry for months. I feel like that had been the most darkest place I had ever been in. I contacted my teachers and even a simple response like ""We understand"" brought me to **tears.** It's always been hard for me to reach out to someone because I'm terrified I might sound like I'm attention seeking. 

However, I've definitely gotten better. It's a whole new school year, yet my grades are terrible even at the beginning of the semester. I genuinely can't bring myself to focus. In terms of mental health, I genuinely feel as if I've improved... I actually can bring myself to shower! :D My family still criticizes me, but I think it's gotten a bit better. It pains me because I understand that my parents love me, but they don't realize how damaging it is. I still plan on moving out some day with my friends. :) 

Though I still have some issues and it won't be the last time I'll probably be ranting in here, but I genuinely would like to thank this sub. I still have an empty void-like feeling that won't go away, but I promise that I will try my best to get better. I'll try my best to get my motivation up, and I'll try to pull my life together once and for all.

Thank you for the motivation, and thank you for the help. It's been a long time, but I genuinely thank this sub for reaching out to me. I really appreciate it, and I'm always here to talk too for anyone who needs it. &lt;3",lonely,random post,2021-09-05 05:35:46

I’m 21 and have dated girls here and there, but it obviously never went anywhere. Never gone further then making out either.

Most of my dating happened during high school, and after entering college I tried dating apps, even met someone on Discord. But it always ends up in no spark from her side, getting ghosted or going back to an ex. Safe to say I just pretty much quit seriously trying as it basically ends up in disappointment and heartbreak every time. Not really active on dating apps either since I pretty much never get any likes or matches.

Lately I’ve started going to the gym and I have been feeling a bit more better about my situation and kinda made peace with the fact ending up ‘alone’ is just a very real possibility in this day and age. I have great friends, I want to get a cat as soon as I move out but a significant other is something else entirely of course.

But I don’t know what the future will bring. A gut feeling of mine tels me I’ll be in the same spot 10 years from now, the rational side of me tells me each day is full of surprises. But I’ve been shifting more and more to working on myself and my body and to forget about relationships.",lonely,Do you think you’ll truly end up alone in the sense that you won’t find a romantic partner?,2021-09-05 00:11:55

I have trouble with comparing my self to YouTubers and Successful twitch streamers. I even tried to start a YouTube channel. or start a twitch channel but all I have is a phone. but Im greatful for what I have sometimes.. I know money isn't happiness but is part of it. 

everyones goal is happiness. everyone wants to be happy, everyone wants to matter, most everyone wants to change the world. me included.

people suggested self help books and meditation and exercise. how will those make me better? I don't know what to give a fuck about. things that make me happy?

I want to improve and be smarter and gain more knowledge.. all i can do is learn from internet. by reading books or learning a skill.

I want to try out new stuff but I haven't got the money to. most of the stuff that I'm able to do is free. infinite knowledge around internet but idk whats useful or not

but I don't know what is worth reading or a skill worth learning. or idk how to be smart

bc of nothing new or interesting to do. I would fap everyday. all i could think of were girls online. bc datings not allowed in my town.

porn crushes my soul. 20 days of no fapping was hard. I guess all i can do is read books.
and hope I will be smarter and not watch porn again. after porn I lose most interest in women. I can't make them my ""goal""

I'm a bit upset, I'm 13 and I don't really have any friends and i feel lonely, I don't have any online friends anymore either
I'm honestly not good at socializing and stuff unfortunately, so this could be the reason why
My claasmates all make plans together and post their pictures online, and im always the only one that's excluded, it makes me upset
My mom, dad and brother all tell me that there's no hope in me finding any friends ever, which makes me ahhh,, less enthusiastic?  Today i had a dream that i was with this girl, about my age and she hugged me and said ""i love you"" and she smiled and she was so nice to me, i was so so happy but then i woke up later and felt really upset it wasn't real

3867,TurnipsOP,1630728777,1,"   Where did I go wrong? Could I even change it if I went back in time? Part of me still holds onto hope for the future. I mean, I'm only 23. I have plenty of time, right? Then, I realize that I haven't changed at all. No matter how many people I talk to, or videos I watch, I'm still the boring, awkward guy that nobody likes. I can make friends, sure, but it's only a matter of time before they stop contacting me. If I can't even hold a friendship, how am I going to have even a slight chance at a relationship?  


 I am forced to observe. I live with roommates who are madly in love with each other. I see them cuddling when I get home, watch as they laugh when they talk, and hear them love through these thin walls. At first, I always just ignored it and told myself I will eventually get something like that. Yet, how can I? With who I am? With how I look? A huge part of me believes I don't even deserve love. I was terrible when I was younger. Did things that haunt me to this day.   


 Then the days like these come, where I start thinking about how this is now my life. I'm not sure if I can really handle it for too much longer. It wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't everywhere I go.

3868,ALotOfRandomThoughts,1630728344,1,"Recent events have got me thinking about how I’ve never had someone who was actually “there” for me. The only friendships I’ve ever had were more like acquaintances. I was the kind of person that wasn’t so bad to have a casual conversation with, but no one would want me around if someone more interesting came along or if I tried talking about some of the heavier things on my mind. Now I’ve been thinking about that a lot, what would it even feel like to actually have a connection to another person?

I’ve always been emotionally distant, that basically became my defense mechanism. If I never talked about my feelings then I wouldn’t scare people off or allow them to hurt me. Just push everything down so no one has to deal with my problems. When I get sad or angry I shut down completely. I can’t even muster up the strength to speak. I can’t tell people that I love them or anything like that. It’s like there’s a physical wall there whenever I try to speak those words aloud. It doesn’t even have to be a romantic sense either. I’ve never been able to tell my parents or family that I love them and it feels so shitty of me when they say it and I can’t say it back. 

I’ve tried connecting with people online as well. Granted it is a lot easier since the anonymity and the ability to type rather than speak help. It still feels like something isn’t right though. I don’t know maybe I’m missing something? Like I see people having discussions about stuff all the time on reddit but even if I try to engage with someone there’s never any back and forth. I’ve gotten kinda scared to comment on posts or anything because the thought of not getting a response terrifies me. I’m probably thinking too hard about it, but I tend to think that I said something stupid so I delete it later anyway. I get so anxious worrying that I’m going to screw up that I give myself migraines, which makes me want to distance myself even further. 

TLDR: I feel like I can’t share my emotions with people. I become incredibly distant so I don’t have to be vulnerable. Talking with people is anxiety inducing to the point of giving me migraines.",lonely,I feel like it’s impossible for me to connect with people,2021-09-04 14:05:44

3881,LordJimqua,1630722750,1,"I feel very sad for you guys. So many of you are so young and already feeling lost and abandoned and hopeless. 

I know its tough guys... but trust me when i say you're just young. Now I'm not much older than some of you, I'm only 35 myself, but I've been here and there, died a few times, lost days of my life due to black outs and drugs, went from being the hang out hub of my friend group to having 1 person outside of my wife that I can still consider a good friend. 

It isn't fair. Growing up is stupid and hard. People drift apart.  It sucks. But most of them aren't doing it maliciously. Distance is a huge problem for people, anything outside of a 15 minute drive and people start to question the distance. Work is also a big factor. Sometimes its a matter of work schedules just not lining up.  And just because they went out with someone else and didn't invite you isn't a direct attack against you. 

I commend a lot of you though for reaching out to the internet. the terrible terrible internet. there is light amongst the darkness, sure... but people would rather troll then be genuine. And I get it... being a genuine nice person always blows up negatively in your face. It will be the cause of many hardships. Being good is stupid and hard. But its the way to be.

I don't know if this is still taught.. but there is a thing in life called the Golden Rule that not a lot of people abide by. Which is dumb because it's literally the best suggestion and way to live. Golden Rule: Treat others as you wish to be treated. aka dont be a dick. 

\-sigh- unfortunatly my ADHD and depression has just gotten me and lost my train of thought... but please... Guys or Girls... remember that You Are Not Alone. please reach out. please talk to someone. 

I am currently a stay at home dad on USEast time. But I have insomnia and wake up every day around 6am. Please reach out to me if you need someone to talk to.

3895,Dark_Room_3147,1630716650,1,"I (20M) don't know how to be happy. I cannot think of a single social relationship I have or have had where I felt fulfilled.

Back when I was in high school I had a tight group of friends, we had a great deal of fun together. Most of them were nice, but i never felt like i had a genuine connection with any of them but two; 

One of them was my best friend at the time, he is very diffcult, a bit of a narcissist and quite manipulative. T don't talk to him a lot anymore, I often felt belittled by him, and all my other friends had a level of respect and love for him that I never felt they had for me. Still, out of all the people in my life he remains the one I have had the most meaningfull and honest talks with, even though in retrospect they don't feel the same.

The other was a girl I had a crush on back then, she was often mean to me, and I was an asshole to her intern. over the years we developed an implicit understanding of each other and I believe I might have loved her at some point, that doesn't take from the fact that she was often selfish and self centered in a way that hurt me several times. Shes had a lot of boyfriends over the years and a often vents to me about her romantic issues, she's done this pretty much since we became friends.

Anyways, she and I ended up having sex a couple of years back, we did a couple of times and over that period we found out we both had a crush on each other at the same time back in high school. Also at the time she had a boyfriend who she was cheating on with me. 

Eventually she got another boyfriend and we stopped doing it, we've grown appart since then but we still talk. She's moving to Canada at the end of this year and I might not see her again.

Since then, I have a hard time seeing people as friends, I guess I have these strange standards about what constitutes a friendship but I still feel lonely all the fucking time. I still feel like I have nobody to talk to and nobody who actually loves me, I don't feel like I love anyone either, sometimes I feel like I'm just incapable of love.

I don't know what to do, I just feel incompetent, I try and I try and at the end of the day I'm just the same pathetic loser that doesn't care about anything I was 5 years ago.

Maybe the reason I feel like I can't connect with people is because nobody would want to have a   
 fun conversation with me unless they were trying to abuse me in some way.

I've never had what you would call a serious girlfriend, I don't even know how I'd go about getting there. I have tried stuff like Tinder but the fact that the very few people that I match with don't text me back just helps feed the narrative that I'm just not fun or attractive.

I hate being alone, and I hate the feeling that I can't do anything about it, I want a friend group of people that love each other and can tell each other anything, that natural organic joy I've seen so much in other people, I want a girlfriend that I can talk to for hours, someone I can share my life with and make happy.

I want something to dispell the evergrowing notion that I will die alone because nobody in the world could ever truly appreciate me.

I have people around me that seem to like me and are willing to listen to me, so why does it all feel fake? It seems like theres a world of opportinuities out there to meet new people, so why can't I? Fuck, I even have days were I think I'm attractive and funny, so why do I start hating myself so much after every conversation I have? I ether have or could potentially have everything to be happy, so why am I so miserable all the time?

This post is all over the place, it's full of contradictions and nonsense. I'm sorry if you sat through it, but thank you for doing so.

3905,Feisty-Owl4339,1630711893,1,"I was doing great until about 2 weeks ago, then it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I’m really lonely. 

I grew up believing that the majority of relationships turned miserable. My parents were miserable, my mom screaming at my dad for hours every day and filled with contempt. I knew 50% of marriages ended in divorce and based on what I’d seen at home and elsewhere, it seemed like way more probably should. I told myself if I was lucky enough to find one of those special, rare, good relationships, I would happily take it. And if I found someone good enough to have kids with, I would. But if not, I was ok on my own.

And really, my crippling social anxiety was enough of a project to focus on — my goal was just avoiding becoming “the weird dude in the basement”. I pushed myself, went to therapy for years, got a great job, moved to NYC, eventually found true friends that care about me, travelled, I got in shape, I saved and invested my money enough to work on starting my own little company full-time. I even dated a little in fits and spurts. I had made a much better life for myself than I thought was in store for me and while I hadn’t ever found that good relationship, it was ok. I’d still avoided misery.

But now, near my 43rd birthday, I suddenly woke up with a soul-crushing feeling in the pit of my stomach. Everything feels so dark and meaningless.  I am very much NOT ok on my own, not forever. I’m lonely and I’m afraid what my life will be like in the future if things stay this way.

I have good friends that I’m thankful for, some that I’ve known for almost 20 years and are like family. But “like-family” is only like family as long as no one has an actual family. So many have paired off now, moved away, and become text bubbles on my phone. We stay in touch and care about each other, but it’s not the same.

I thought relationships were built on feelings of butterflies and faIling in love— things I honestly never have felt and was ok with. But now I want someone to hold me on bad days, to be my obvious emergency contact when I fill out forms, and to help keep me from getting too weird. And I want to be that person for someone else too.

The idea of having kids always seemed like a remote possibility that I would consider if I was truly in a great relationship with someone who I thought would be a good parent. Again, if not, that was ok. But now that I’m on the far edge of that being a possibility, I’m suddenly hit by visions of my nonexistent hypothetical kid.  I envy happy families. I even envy the people who got themselves into those miserable marriages, had kids, and divorced. Is there anything to life besides family, even with all the possible miserableness?

I’m not in a good place. I feel like I’m on fire from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep. I feel like crying and raging and panic swiping every dating app and hating myself for taking so long to stop being afraid of people, for not understanding the world better.

3907,lilacf,1630710493,1,"Hi everyone. I'm writing here for the first time because I don't know who to talk to. I'm feeling more and more alone, even if I have friends. I have different friends from the different groups (secondary, high school and university) and I was close with all of them (they're little groups). Anyway, since pandemic I started feeling worse with my mental health, fell back again in old habits (I had anorexia when I was 16/18, now I'm almost 23), but this time is worse, because other than restricting I'm also purging, and no one notices me because of pandemic. Even after lockdown, I didn't go out, and when I did everyone noticed my weight loss, but didn't ask me anything for a while. I also tried to talk to these friends (at least the closest ones) that I had problems with anxiety and so on, and they kind of respected that giving me some space, even if maybe I would have preferred that someone stayed by my side the whole time... I have one really close friend who I talk to everyday, but I never tell her about what's going on with me, because she's having problems too with mental health, and we always talk about what she's worried about, and sometimes (of course she didn't do it on purpose) but she even triggered me for some stuff (that concerns my ed). No one knows that I have one, no... everyone suspects it, but there's literally no one that had sincerely asked me how I was doing... My family always makes comments about it, about how I look unhealthy, how I'm gonna pass out at work etc but no one faces the argument. I even tried to express my concerns to this friend, and she triggered even more; I tried with another friend and she expressed concern, but she never faced the argument too. So what's like, when they say they're gonna be there for you, and when you try to open they don't talk about it? For me it took lots of effort to open about this, and I get nothing...
I'm feeling more and more alone, I have problems with my family, and I still have to decide what to do about my master, and fearing I'll be alone. And the one person I talk the most is this one friend (who I really love), that has lots of problems going on, and so when we talk it's only about her. She also says she's sorry etc, that she can't talk about anything else and I get that she sees me as the one person who you can totally rely, who you can be honest with, that you know it's gonna be there for you... And I don't, I just really need that one person for me too, because I'm suffering so much right now and can't tell anyone about it. And because of my suffering my ed is getting worse because I want people to see that I'm not okay, and the only way I know is by keeping doing this. And I know that is a sick thought, but I don't know what to do. I'm writing here because I really don't know who to talk to about this, and I just want someone who's gonna say to me that he's with me, no matter what, I never felt that kind of support, and now I really need it.",lonely,"I'm feeling so alone, have an ed and no one to talk to",2021-09-04 09:08:13

\-I like board games, table top rpgs, poetry and much more!

\-I speak English, Spanish and Italian.

Because of everything going on last year, I didn't really get any help or emotional support dealing with the loss. I only have two people to turn to. My mom flat out told me to get over it, because moping wouldn't make it any better. The person I considered to be my closest friend said ""That sucks, dude."" and then made no other efforts to speak to me, even when I reached out. 

My mom at least got more sympathetic later on. I think mostly she just felt guilty at never making amends with my old man before he died. While they had an uneventful divorce, she was mad at him for a long time. Because of that anger, and how quickly Alzheimer's can progress at the end, she never could apologize.

My friend, though... I don't know if I can even call her my friend anymore? She's essentially replaced me with her online friends. She's very introverted, and I wonder if maybe I was too energetic or talkative for her. I suppose that's a rant for another time.

This year without my dad, and last year during the quarantine, I've come to realize that I'm both incredibly lonely and have absolutely no idea how to make friends with people. I'm not the only one, of course. It feels like you need a solid friend group already assembled coming into your 30s, because after 30 socializing is a foreign landscape. I don't have a partner or kids as a gateway to meeting other people.

I also worry that there's something wrong with me in particular, and I can't see it from my side. I have never in my life had friends who seek me out, and instead I'm always doing the reaching. My therapist says I have no sense of self, and that perhaps I come across as disingenuous or fake with my interactions, but how then am I supposed to act? I even worry that by simply expecting people to like me just because I'm nice means I'm turning into some form of legbeard, as if I deserve anything from anyone just because I'm being a decent human being.

Sure I got one female friend, but I grew up with her and don’t want to lose her in any way.

I‘ve deleted my dating apps and given up the dating scene, because I just encountered bots, fakes and women that wanted to feel desired. And I just want to give it one try with a woman that I‘ve met 3 years ago and had me suspicious about being a catfish, but proved me wrong. Still has it been my mistake to think about her that way, but because of that and me being a stubborn idiot when we argued about that I‘ve blown my chances.

TL;DR: I‘m super sad about my overall life and I have given up the hopes of „getting found“ and it just wants me to drown myself in alcohol and weed.",lonely,I‘m feeling like I‘m tumbling down a hole,2021-09-04 07:47:12

3921,Finkenn,1630703014,1,"I felt the need for self-disclosure. Tomorrow is my 22nd birthday and I‘m anxious of that. I have been deeply sad lately, so hopefully the worst is already over.

It’s a pathetic anniversary: In the 10 years I haven’t invited anyone to my birthday. 10 times in a row. Most of the time I didn’t have any friends. I thought about like, is this a little excuse?

I’ve made my first (former) buddy when I was 6 years old, because my mother convinced me to invite him to my birthday, which he did vice versa and so on… 

tho for the last 5 years I’ve stayed in my bedroom most of the time and I had little contact to the real outside world. So I literally had almost nobody that I could’ve invited. Also I don’t want to invite the old (verbatim senile) friends of my mum lol, I don’t even talk to them.

For this year, I thought about using a dating app again, to ask for someone to hang out on that day. Or alternatively, doing the same shlt on my twitter. But I realized they‘re a few reasons against it:

1. shame and embarrassment
2. it’s just symbolic and even if I’m having a good day, it probably won’t help long-term cause I’m bad at „keeping momentum“
3. you cannot force luck and the attempt is pathetic
4. maybe it won’t be fun. I don’t really know the other person. I’m not experienced with chatting, that’s such a strain
5. I don’t want to take advantage of someone’s pity. They wouldn’t tell me the truth. I need someone that is actually willing to see me
6. I don’t want them to use me, them objectifying me, taking advantage of my situation or my generosity (if I was really going for it, I’d be open to pay for everything and let them choose what to do)
7. i don’t feel ready. It’s just a symbolic day/benchmark. I need some patience. It’s not another defeat, just a missed opportunity.

Sure, in the near future I will take in hand to be more risky and open. I have nothing to lose. My time is yet to come. For now, as usual, i will hang out with my parents. We’ll go to a fine restaurant. Eating and music is like my only joy in life so hopefully I can enjoy myself. At least there are 1~2 persons that truely care about me. I will distract myself and pretend like it’s a normal family day.

TL;DR Around midday I paused writing this post because I way too lazy to translate and all that jazz, but now I had to hurry up, because its less than 1 hour until my bday.

Also please don’t make anything into a competition who is „objectively“ worst off. There’s always someone that is better than you in any competition :D Also some people don’t know any other way, it’s normal state for them. They don’t even realize how much they’re missing out.

I have had no relationships for last 6-7 years.After my last thing I just got into a different mode where I chose to have life where my career , cigarettes,alcohol, pot in that order were my priorities and shunted the world. But I made sure to be the person who shows up friends and listen to them whenever they needed to be heard. I have severed my relationship with my parents too who have been very supportive of me.Yes I might be sounding narcissistic or maybe I am but I just need somebody to tell me that you are ok. But I guess that's not gonna happen.

We have a discord sever and most of the people have already made friends. I had two friends and we three became friends even before the discord server was created. Somedays back I asked my these two friends about have they made any new friends and their reply came as a shock to me. They told me that they have talked to about 20-30 new people and are close friends with 5-6 of them. As for me, I had not talked to a single person except those two till that day. When I asked them how were they able to make new friends, they told (both gave same answer) that people messaged them first and asked to be friends or be in touch. This took me by shock, however I was more sad than surprised because no one has messaged me first. You may think that it is because they would have been more active in discord but it is not so. One of them is really active but the other one has never been active but still she received messages from other people. So I tried messaging first myself only.

I just felt really frustrated about the lack of concern. What if I actually went blind? Would they have engaged with me more? They did ask me if I was ok, but I can't shake off the feeling that they asked just to be polite about it, because they just ended the convo with that. i don't know if I'm demanding too much but I just wish they tried to show a bit more concern.

Idk, I've had other instances where I've felt like I'm just being 'tolerated' out of politeness/ignored and I usually just shrug it off. But today I'm feeling extra emotional about it.

I stood there in an auditorium full of people I barely knew. Surrounded by “friends” who would later not even help me through the worst time in my life having to watch my grandmas health decline because of the ruthless brain cancer that took her away from me.

Instead they blamed me for my depression. Telling me that I choose not to be happy on purpose. That it wasn’t their responsibility to “send their regards and condolences” to me when she died, let alone even come to the funeral.

They cast me out. Hoping I would off myself probably. Telling me I was mentally insane and that I needed to “do better”

I felt a bit lonely these days and was searching for people to talk to. I kind of prefere people who search long term friendship, but if you just want to chat for some hours/days, I'm also ok with it.
Not searching for a relationship tho, so Female, Trans, Male and all other genders are welcome :)

Also, I'm ok if you feel insecure and/or you have social anxiety, I'm not the kind of guy that get upset or bored easily. So, please don't be scared to talk, I would be glad to hear from you, whoever you are :)
I can also play some video games with you if you want to.

It's difficult to explain all my hobbies because I'm the kind of guy who is really interested in too many things and I legit don't have the time to do everything I want to do.
I'm really interested in language learning, I speak French, English. I understand German but I really struggle to talk. And I'm currently learning Japanese.
I also like to read some books, watch movies and play some video games sometimes. I'm currently in engineering school, studying cybersecurity (To simplify, that means that I make sure that evil hackers won't steal data or hack anything).

Please, HMU if you want to chat a bit, you can directly DM me.

And please, even if you don't DM me, I wish you a really nice day and I hope you're safe and doing well. Please take care of yourself &lt;3",lonely,[Chat] M22 - Who anyone who search a safe place to talk,2021-09-03 19:01:44

3987,lilshopofhorror,1630647767,1,"Flash backs are the real pits. They really are! It’s both remarkable and cruel how the brain can reach for a memory and instantaneously transport you to the past; to hold you prisoner in that moment in time. 

Sounds. There are so many of them. There are sounds that I cannot or have never been able to identify: sounds which are not human or are perhaps something more than human, the sound of lives slipping away but also the sound innocence being taken. 

You try to shove as many memories as you can in this tiny box under lock and key. Yet they are like water, and they eventually seep. You try to shed your skin; rebuild your identity. You change jobs, you change scenery, you go to therapy and you discard all physical reminisce of your former life. Yet, like a jilted lover, they follow you. 

Peace. It is a mere illusion. 

In my former life I dealt with domestic violence and sexual assault matters. Perhaps one too many. I was not a victim. I was not a first responder. I was not a case worker. I was a prosecutor. 

I would rummage through their files; nitpick their stories. And, if necessary, extenuate them so I can tug on the heart strings of a jury. Marionettes juries tend to be and, in the right circumstances, they can be easily played.  I would make every girl and women relive them. It was utter torture; you can see the agony on their faces. 

Your brain tends to rationalise your actions; that this is all in pursuit of justice. Yet have we ever considered how justice is actually measured? 

The reality for any prosecutor’s office (or at least where I'm from) is that it is measured by your caseload and your success ratio. The unwritten rule. The higher the ratio, the more effective you are and the better you have ‘dispensed justice’.  So they say! The system has much to be desired. 

I’ve put so many people through unnecessary trauma so I could get the ‘W’. A woman once told me, it was like she was raped all over again. 

These are faces that I cannot erase from my mind. Their voices and their stories continue to gnaw at my nape, telling me that I should have done better. That I should’ve protected them. 

In my life, I’ve come to realise that men are capable of doing some pretty depraved acts of cruelty on women.  And it takes a different beast entirely to ask her to relive it, without so much as batting an eyelid. 

I was that beast.

3998,PhoenixSelarom,1630641843,1,"I was very sheltered as a kid so making friends has always been an issue for me. I've moved around a bit and most of my close friends are back in another city, while in my current city I've only been able to make a handful of friends, several of which have moved away. Now they all have families and jobs to tend to and I just find myself spending all of my time at home by myself stuck in my room. I've been working out and working on music to try and keep myself occupied, but I keep hitting walls in both fields. I am tired of being by myself all of the time. There is really only one night of the week when I can actually go out, have a good time and see my friends. Tonight is that night, and here I am home alone because no one could make it.

Lately I've started getting a crush on one of my friends. I really like her: she makes me laugh, feel comfortable and we enjoy being silly with each other all the time. Still, I don't know that she feels the same way about me. I have never been great at relationships. I didn't have my first kiss or girlfriend until I was 21, and that relationship only really lasted about 8 months followed by about 2 years of back and forth toxicity and manipulative behavior from my ex. I felt unworthy and still do and I've never been in another relationship since. That was 10 years ago, and outside of a few dates and one brief friend with benefits who also made me feel like shit and unworthy I have been alone for most of my life.

It's my birthday at the end of the month (turning 32) and I always feel especially lonely around this time. I do really like this girl, we even went to a concert together a few days ago and had a great time, but I was too hesitant to make a move. My past feelings of unworthiness make it hard for me to believe that she could feel the same about me, and I'm terrible at figuring out if she is flirting with me or just being a friend to me. The fact that I don't have a job or much of a life to speak of isn't doing me any favors either, cause it makes me feel like she deserves better. But I do want to be with her, and I'm tired of being alone.

Last week I was hanging out with her and my friends, and a friend of hers was there. He's a very obnoxious dude with a huge ego who is constantly groping at her and being touchy feely with her. That night he decided to really rub it in and randomly told me that no one wants me and it hit me like a ton of bricks especially cause he said it in front of my crush who he's been shamelessly flirting and groping all night. My crush got mad at him for it, and she messaged me later and consoled me telling me he was out of line. I know she doesn't like him and I know I shouldn't be jealous, but I just wish I was able to be more comfortable showing affection to her like he does, without annoying her to the point where he wants to punch her. He kept doing other things like swiping my drinks and randomly licking me or getting real close and uncomfortable with me just to try and piss me off. Another person also mocked my singing at the end of the night and had earlier questioned why I kept posting my workout progress on my facebook, kind of hitting me below the belt without meaning to on the only two things that have been keeping me sane during this time. At the end of the night I just felt awful about myself.

I just feel like I have nowhere left to turn. I have dealt with depression and anxiety and unfortunately my friends have had to deal with the brunt of my emotional meltdowns and I don't want to continue burdening them with my pain, and I don't want to show that side of myself to my crush for fear of ruining any chance I might have with her. I just want to feel like I belong, like I matter to someone, like I deserve to be loved and that I am wanted and needed. The few friends I have keep telling me that they love me and care and that I matter, but I'm still by myself 99% of the time. I'm just overwhelmed and confused and lonely and I just don't know who to turn to anymore or how to trust and love myself. I feel like I've never gotten anywhere I wanted to go and I fear I'm never going to get there either.

I was homeschooled in primary school and moved around different cities due to my parents work during my high school years so I didn’t really made any significant connections during this portion of my life. I was very lonely but I wasn’t miserable, I recognise that I’m lonely because I move away before I make any connections with people so I was hopeful that things would improve after high school when I move out of my parents and live on my own… And I was right, during the first two years of uni my life got filled with relationships that I always wanted. I got a bunch of like minded friends, got into a few relationships and experienced a lot. 

But slowly, this feeling of emptiness I got during my childhood started creeping back even tho I’m not “alone”. I would be surrounded with people I care about and still feel so lonely, like I’m the only person in the room. Most of my romantic relationships also ended because of this, I would fall in love with an amazing, smart and caring girl only to just lose interest out of no where. Dates and hangouts started to feel like a chore to the point where I completely lose motivation. Also my family who I love and loves me sometimes feel like strangers. 

To me having loving people in your life and still feels disconnected and lonely is worse than having no one at all because during my childhood I was hopeful and that the only reason why Im lonely is caused by external circumstances which is temporary, but now I’m an adult and the cause of my loneliness is my self and I don’t think this is temporary. Its hard to explain the feeling, but its like a void that I cant fill because I already filled it…. If that make sense? I thought I won against my childhood loneliness by surrounding my self with people who I care so much about and me to them but now this loneliness is back but what do I do?

4028,_stardustx,1630626813,1,"(I'm putting this as a discussion so you can put your thoughts on what I'm about to say or your personal experiences / life experience / wisdom / whatever you want to share)

I'm currently in highschool and I've never had a close friend / close group of friends. I mostly have acquaintances but I don't have anyone to sit with at lunch or anyone to hang out with after school. Everyone else in my family (my parents and brother and sister) do have people to hang out with. In fact they all have close friends they're always going out with. They all have great personalities and they're funny, whereas I come off as a bit more weird and awkward. The main thing I have is that I'm nice and considerate, but it's not enough when it comes to making close friends. 

The closest thing I've had to a friend group where I could actually hang out with them afterschool and stuff was in elementary, but then later on I realized that they never actually liked me and the only reason I was still in that group was because they didn't know how to kick me out. They made it pretty obvious they didn't like me too, but I was so happy to have friends that I didn't realize until after they kicked me out the summer we were switching to middle school.

And since then I haven't gotten any friendship better than that. It's just acquaintances. During lunch I sit with acquaintances but the whole time I'm ignored and I'm not able to talk to anyone because they don't like me since they don't know me. 

I've just kind of realized over time I'm not the type of person to have a close friend like that. I don't have much to offer in a friendship; most people want a friend whose funny or attractive and I'm neither.

Today i told my grandpa that I am lonely. I have 2 friends and they both don’t value me as much is a do them. One of the 2 has a girlfriend who he is with every weekend and I don’t know how to say that I am lonely and really want more attention, I’ve told him a couple weeks ago that I’m experiencing loneliness and maybe we could hang a little bit more but it didn’t help the cause. The other one is always on the go and when he is with me he is always on his phone and when we don’t smoke weed he don’t want come over because he can do ‘better’ things.

My point is really that in the worst days in my life my friends weren’t there for me and that is hurting me the most. Because I’ve been there for them.

4032,Objective_Power_2000,1630623900,1,"Hey guys, I am a 30 year old dude and I am sort of using this a place to organize my thoughts and listen to others ideas about my mind set.

  
I don't know exactly why I feel so alone at the moment, it could be a variety of reasons. Anything from a break up 7 months ago after five years. Starting university again and the stress from that, or that I have very few friends. Maybe it's a porn addiction and affecting my brain chemistry. It could be any or all of these things but fuck I feel lonely as hell, nothing has been appealing that I would normally love. Normally I can escape my mental hell by playing some games or exercising but nothing is able to hold my attention lately.

I recently got out of a five year long relationship where it all ended quite suddenly after I discovered I was being cheated on. She had months to create an emotional disconnect and begin a brand new honeymoon phase with someone else while I was none the wiser. I ask myself all the time ""How could I not see this happening right in front of me?"" but as we all have been I am sure, been very depressed due to COVID, I live in an area where I have no family, friends and my only healthy hobbies were closed for the pandemic. But it's an excuse to not have seen it. After it all ended it turns out she had been thinking about breaking up with me for over three years and never expressed this or communicated with me about it, it was just me putting in effort and making self sacrifice to keep the relationship alive. Looking back on it I will never sacrifice my mental health, physical health, or anything to that degree for anyone ever again.

Honestly, it can't be university because being in class again is one the few things I get to look forward to every day, I get to be surrounded by people with similar degree interest. the only sad part is I am much older than a lot of these people and don't feel comfortable really being friends with them because I am the old man in most of my classes, despite appearing to be similar age to them.

I definitely have few friends here and that sucks, not much explaining to do other than that I moved here a year before the pandemic and was in a relationship and never felt the need to get out and make friends, I had everyone I wanted in my life at the time.

Porn addiction is most likely one of the biggest contributors to my feelings of loneliness. Not necessarily because porn is bad and should never be consumed. But because I really want to love and be loved by others and have a family some day. How are these things linked? I don't know I just have a gut feeling that is telling me to stop.

My entire school and highschool, almost everybody shunned me because I was too nerdy or geeky to be included in anything. It was my fault anyway, who wants to be friends with a geek who doesn't like sports?

I have even overheard my parents commenting how I look average-ish. I was too young so don't remember what else they were talking about but growing up I always thought nobody would like me. And that was alright.

But then came college and with it came this one person who I clicked with the most. After sharing countless emotional moments with her over 4 years, we had the talk. I was an idiot to think somebody would like me. Why did I ever think otherwise?! It was so awkward even for her that she had to beat around the bush without directly rejecting me. I never should have made friends.

I am thinning all over my head. 3 derms have said it looks like baldness is kicking in. So now not only am I an awkward geek, I also look like shit. I cried some days ago. Again.

I was never good at making friends and the ones I had never lasted with me longer, I have a curse on me, I can't have friends.

So that's why I have been trying some online apps and things here and there to find friends, even a short convo to convience myself that I am not the worst. I found a lot of people, or I will say girls(I am a guy, 20). As I wanted to be anonymous I never wanted to get into relationship or anything like that but now I don't feel like it anymore. I don't want to talk to anyone.
All these girls text me everyday, that's what I wanted, I wanted friends to talk to everyday but now, it's just not that anymore, I still feel lonely, I still have that pain in my chest everyday, I want to cry right now but I have gone so much emotionally numb that my dumb ass can't even cry.
I can't even tell them that I want some my time, cause they tell me they like to talk to me and I can't leave them in this state, cause they also don't have friends, I want to be with them, want to help them out of it until they find a true good/best friend for themselves, but at this point, it's just eating up my inner peace.
I never had any good friend my entire life, everyone betrayed me, used me, moved on from me as I never even existed, whats wrong with me?
I never tried to hurt anyone, never abused at anyone, but did my introvertness made me so boring that no body wants me around them, they go with those douche people who abuse and talk shit about people.
I don't know, may be those girls like talking to me cause I am nice, but that because I want to be nice, but I also want some life, I don't wanna be alone my whole life but even after so many online friends, I am alone.
I feel like just to block all my socials where I talk to any of them and leave this world, but then they won't have anyone to talk to. I like to help people, it makes me happy to listen to them as they want to be listened, but it's a 5 min smile for me and then into complete pain, should I just stop thinking, should I just leave them, should I just annoy them so they leave me instead, should I just leave the world, may be hell is better cause I am never gonna get to heaven.

I don't want this pain anymore where I can't even cry it out in my room when I am alone, am I scared of something, do I have anything to lose, should I end myself....no, I don't want to do any of these, but what are my options anymore.
Nobody likes me anyway, my family gives me sympathy and food, that's it, pretending there fake love as if I don't know, they hate me from the depth of there heart, I am so annoying to myself how can someone else stand me like that?
I had no friends, they just try to be one for there use and then abandon me nowhere, I am fed up this 2 month friendship thing where they will get there work done and then pretend I don't even exist.
Am I ugly that people are disgust by me, am I too much irritating that people repel off me, am I stupid that people throw me away to be dumb...I don't think so, I mean in my head, yes, but I am not ugly, I talk minimum to irritate anyone, then what's the exact issue that people leave me in that situation.
I feel lonely dude, don't give me hope that I have someone and use my nice behaviour to get your work done and then leave me to rot in this crowd of moron who disgust off me.

I just wanna vent this shit out. 
I've noticed this soooo much with parents here. 
If u are independent (taking care of yourself financially)  only then can u express your opinion and can afford to raise your voice against them . 

Every single time an argument or some shit happens and u speak back its so fucked up when they just keep stressing their point without letting u get a word in and they pull out the "" learn to take care of yourself first before arguing "" card. Its just irks me so much and im so helpless because i can't react right in those situations.  I feel everytime u keep quiet when your principles or what u hold dear is being trashed about , u are killing the essence of your individuality . 
I hate my past so much . My father was very physically abusive towards me when i was a child . This went on well into my teens and i never went to therapy ans shit either . God knows how many mental health issues i have.  I got addicted to fast food during  my teens which is one of my worst regrets.  I then dropped out of college after a year . Then the covid shit began. 

It might sound weird to western people who read this.
As i know most of them if not all usually end up making a place or start taking care of  themselves in the world starting at 18 . At least thats how its stereotyped. 

My parents made me depend on them in the first place. 
And i would very fucking gladly be independent and would have walked the fuck out of my house and even worked as a newspaper guy if it wasn't for my fat ass.
I'm overweight as hell because of my eating disorder and when i began eating junk years ago.

There have been a zillion moments of suicidal thoughts and shit . But i guess in those weak moments of yourself u start seeing the world as is and i started seeing my parents and so many other people as just like other people. Not the pedestal i had put them on. 

If it wasn't for money i wouldn't need my parents at all. Like at this moment that's the only thing they provide me with. I have had uncountable gym memberships etc and shit. But now its been a month and I've been on a proper uphill healthwise . I was praying to see a change in my body and i have now , which will not make me stop anywhere till i reach my fitness goals. Its so fucked up that even when I'm making these changes they bring up my past and find faults without expecting me to lash out at their parenting capabilities which again ends with 
the golden card of theirs. 

Funny part is even when i hope all goes well in the end 
and i see myself with achieved goals and friends and stuff . Lets say u do get to live a better life . 
What's the point of it all. And i here i go praying i die in my sleep every night . I guess i am a coward.",lonely,Hmmst,2021-09-03 02:34:41

I know a story has two side so I'm gonna tell it in a neutral way. So let me tell you how it all started. A year ago when lockdown started my mental health started going downhill after the second month of lockdown. So I become a lot more silent and distancing myself from everyone and I also start losing motivation for school. At first both of my parents they were a bit ""supportive"" they ""listened"" to my problems but they didn't do anything. After a few months have passed I started feeling a bit better but they decided to barge in to my room without knocking and make me go back down the hole again, and every time my dad threatened me with violence and makes fun of me while my mom just watched. They said they want me to be better but they keep make fun of me and make me feel worse than before. In one of these events I throw a punch at my dad when he started hurting me, he said that I'm a disappointment because he never teaches his sons to use violence while keep hurting me and makes fun of me. Now he were never been in my life for more than a day since 3rd grade, my parents were divorced during that time. My parents and family has always been blaming me for everything ever since my grandma died. I'm sorry for going out of the railway there, so I'm gonna go back to today event.
So like everytime my parents barges into my room I was feeling a bit better after three months. My dad just started yelling at me and hurting me. He makes fun of me while my mom again just watched. He started hurting me more and more than before, he said he's not gonna use violence but if I don't answer him he gonna hurt me more while he keeps hurting me. He started to put his knee at my throat so I started yelling that I'm about to get raped, but my dad have bribe the police near our house and he tells them that he's just doing his job as a parent. My mom just keep watching and not trying to stop my dad, but she keeps saying she wanted to see me happy even as I'm still in pain. My dad threatened to took away my phone even though he not the one that pay for it. He says if tomorrow I'm still silent he will beat me up more. Now I'm scared that I'm gonna lose the only thing that help me keep being sane.
So yeah that's what happened to me today.
I hope this is the right subreddit and I'm sorry if my English and my grammar doesn't make sense but I hope you get the gist of it.

P.s. The reason they comes to my room without knocking is because I didn't go to my online school and I have tell you guys the reason, but my parents wouldn't listen to me.

P.p.s. I'm thinking about between committing suicide or run away. If I chose to run away I don't know where to go and I don't have any money.

P.p.p.s. I hope you're day is better than mine and I hope you're going places :)

4099,codecrunchie,1630585894,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

4100,nobodyhere01,1630585817,1,"So what happens to you when you've  tried over and over again to be one of those ""normal"" people who have  sex and get into relationships, and you failed? What happens when you've  lost even the hope that you'll meet someone who actually loves you?  Life just becomes a drag, and it is for most people, but sex and  relationships make it a little more bearable. Most people's days are  spent at a job they don't care about but they put up with it because  they can make money, which they can then spend mostly in ways they can  make themselves more sexually attractive. And if they don't already have  a partner, the cycle then becomes; working all week and then spending  the money you made on the weekend going out, buying drinks and going  clubbing. The purpose of clubbing of course being putting yourself in  places where you can meet people and hook up.

What  happens then, when you've tried all this and nothing happened except  rejections which resulted in low self-esteem? What happens when you're  convinced that you will certainly die alone? Suddenly, work becomes  meaningless because you realize that you're working just so you can keep  on living a lonely life. You might make a lot of money and buy all  kinds of nice things, but at the end of the day you'll come back to an  empty house with no love. You'll try to distract yourself with hobbies,  video games or whatever, but the feeling of loneliness and being  unwanted will remain because you're biologically programmed to want  connection and intimacy. Isn't that messed up, that some of us are  biologically programmed to want we can't have?

The  question then becomes; what's the point? Why bother to go on living  when you already know the way your life is gonna go? For me, I've gone  beyond rejection. I've reached a point where If I see a girl I'm  attracted to, I know for a fact that she's not going to be attracted to  me. It's almost become a law, like the law of gravity.

It felt very uncomfortable when I was probably the only “lonely girl” in Elementary and Middle school. But what should I do about it? It would’ve been too late to get myself out of this rut because by then my only characteristic to others would be “lonely girl.”

I have many things I want to share to people so they can get to know me as this knowledgeable and responsible person. But when the moment actually comes that I get a chance to socialize, I stay withdrawn, my thoughts go blank, and I begin acting clumsily.

I have a best friend and she was the only one who managed to get past half of my barriers. The furthest anyone has ever got. Recently I’ve been wondering why she even hangs out with me. Why she even cares about me if I don’t bother to vocalize myself more. I’m trying, I really am, but I almost always have to force myself to think of something worthwhile. I just feel so damn guilty for being the one she hangs out with the most when she has plenty of other close friends. I think “why even bother?”

My family doesn’t know me. My male cousin jokes about me not socializing and being a weird hermit and my mom and dad probably only see me as this good grade achiever, disguising this all as “love.”

4110,Efficient-Report3615,1630572750,1,"I still remember being a young teen and the feeling of friendships then. Friends didn't want anything from you apart from your company; They truly cared about you. They were okay with sitting and talking about life for hours. Everything was straightforward and natural. As you get older, people stop listening to your stuff and become self-absorbed. The unconditional caring that you felt when you were a kid isn't there anymore. Friends only call or message me if they want to vent or if they want me to do them a favor. Nobody ever talks to me just to talk to me or ask me how I am doing. 

People nowadays either can't, or don't want to, have genuine friendships where you talk to each other about personal feelings. All of my friendships are shallow asf. We talk about superficial stuff all the time, and honestly I don't think I can even consider them as friends. They always ignore me if I ever talk about anything deep. I've tried making new friends irl/online but it's always the same. Sometimes I feel like I am the only person that actually cares about friendships, like it seems impossible to find a genuine connection these days.

I never get any messages just asking what’s up, and most days if I don’t try to talk to someone, then I’m not talking to anyone that day. I don’t know how long I’d be able to just be a hermit before someone asks where I’ve been, but it’s a thought I have that makes me kinda sad considering I could just be missing and I don’t think they’d notice.

Then there’s the issue with when I try to talk to people. I really don’t think anybody cares. I’ll be with people and everyone’s just talking, but any time I say something either the conversation dies or I get interrupted. The latter has been happening for so long that I just shut up when it does happen without even thinking about it. After a few times I’ll realize what’s going on and start to try and notice if it’s happening to anyone else there. Usually it’s not.

So often I find myself wanting to tell someone about something only to pour over all the people I know and think… They don’t care. Why would they? They never cared before. Or I feel like what I have to say is too weird and would be awkward to bring up to them.

I like talking with new people, because a lot of the time they’re kind and will ask me something and actually try to listen, but I’m pretty shy so I have a hard time actually making a connection with them.

I guess I just want to note that I don’t want people questioning my friendships.

4116,BespoKe_Soul,1630568127,1,"Hello world,

I am a 27 year old male and an introvert. From a young age, I have been suffering from severe anxiety and depression which acts as a major hurdle in my life. Anyway, so this post is regarding a major event that happened to me last year in December which I am struggling to cope with. I think I need a bit of help.
When I was in high school I was considered an outcast and couldn't form any long lasting real friendships. Even if there were some people I thought were my good friends, but it was all kind of on the surface, due to no intention of their own I am sure. Maybe it was all me who couldn't give enough to the friendships and sometimes manipulated my ways into gaining new friends who obviously felt less towards me once they realised that I have not been my true self, but rather adapting to their taste to form these friendships. Anyway when I joined college, I quickly lost connections with all my so called friendships from school and I was all alone again. That's when I met let's call her Jen. She was my first crush and somehow very quickly we became very good friends too. We had a lot in common like reading books or just general views towards the world. So I felt really comfortable around her and didn't feel the necessity to pretend to be someone I am not. So for the first year or so along with being my best friend, she was my only crush till date too. I really liked her. But then she got a boyfriend. At first, I was a bit upset but I never told her about my feelings due to the fear of losing my only best friend by then. So I went along and supported her with whatever she wished to do. From picking gifts for her boyfriend to lending her an ear whenever she needed to me to. She did the same for me when I was struggling with my own issues such as my anxiety issues and other chronic health conditions I suffer from. Anyway in a few years, I moved to another city and she stayed back in my hometown and we remained best friends throughout all those years. We used to talk almost everyday. Even though I had a few crushes during that time, they never became anyhting more than a crush as I retained my super shy character. Even when the other person sometimes realised that I liked them or something, they immediately backed off from having any further communications with me. I think mostly because I am not at all attractive I guess. I am a bit overweight too. But through all these Jen has always stayed by my side and I stayed by her. It was like the perfect friendship. I am so grateful to have had something so constant in my life. Last year, we celebrated 12 years of our friendship and last year was the year I came back to my hometown due to the pandemic. As me and Jen were in the same city now after so long of staying apart, we met very frequently. We went out to lots of cafes in the evenings and talked a lot and every one of those meetings grew my feelings for her. But she was in a relationship and I didn't want to spoil our friendship. So I carried along. But in September 2020, in one of our cafe meet ups, she mentioned that she's compromising a lot with her current boyfriend. That he doesn't understand her emotionally at all. And I asked her why are you still with him then? And she said, She's too old now to find someone else and he really loves her so she is ready to compromise. I was giving her driving lessons by November. In one of those driving lessons, her boyfriend also joined along and I really didn't like that and felt really uncomfortable. Anyway, slowly I didn't like her boyfriend more and more and one day I decided that I should let her know how I feel about her. So I wrote a letter and gave it to her. The next day onwards she stopped talking to me. Like completely. At first she didn't respond to my messages and calls, then she deleted all of our photos from Instagram and blocked me. I visited her place and waited outside wishing to have a talk with her. But she pretended that she didn't see me and texted me later that how dare I invade her space like that? I wanted once to talk to her. But that seemed impossible at that point. As I lost my only friend and best friend suddenly like that, my life fell apart. I took long absences from work, performed poorly when I did go to work, had severe panic attacks now and then. It reached a point, when one day while coming back from work, I suddenly couldn't see anything and my whole body froze and I crashed my car on the roadside. Luckily no harm was done to any other people. I was rushed to the ER and I got diagnosed with severe depression and it was an incident of a psychogenic blackout. After that incident, my parents and family came to know about what happened between me and Jen and I was assigned regular counselling to deal with it. Since then, I am feeling better physically and mentally and I have tried a few ways to meet new people and form a friendship or two. But right now I am facing this issue where I am scared to open up to anyone. A few of the new people I am talking to, beyond a certain point, I feel like not talking to them anymore. So many of these attempts to make new friends are failing. Because again I am not able to open up to them. When I am with them, all I do is listen and not talk anything about myself. Sometimes I am even absent minded and that puts them off. So they slowly drift away. I still feel really guilty about opening up to Jen about my feelings. All the time. I feel like I betrayed her and couldn't live up to her expectations. When she considered me her best friend, I just considered my romantic feelings for her which I feel now is the most unfair thing to haapen to someone. She trusted me with all her secrets But I broke her trust. I am not able to forgive myself or make peace with the fact that I hurt her so bad. I didn't know who else to ask what to do now! So I posted here. Sometimes I feel like ending it all and consider suicide. But then I don't think I am strong enough to go through that. My parents are wonderful, but they are not someone I can express to very easily. And there is no one else. Yesterday I looked through my contact list at night to see if there is someone I can talk to.  But then I realised there is no one except my family there who knows even my full name. Anyway, today again I have taken a day off so that I can sleep a bit more. But I couldn't fall asleep and I thought of writing here. If someone is kind enough to suugest me something I can do, please let me know. I will be very grateful. I want to feel a bit happy again. Even a little bit would do. Thank you :)",lonely,A quiet struggle within me,2021-09-02 17:35:27

She is the one whose touch I still hang on to today. I can never forget my first love, especially since I still have the scar from when you stabbed me in the leg. And although you never admitted that you had feelings for me, same as I, something tells me you did. I just wish I could have told you how much you meant to me.

He was there for me at my worst, I took you're drugs to numb out the pain of everything, but you probably didn't know that. I think you were just happy to have someone to do drugs with because you were just as empty as me, but together we were whole. And then you left, but the addiction stuck around for years, unlike you. 

He was the one who showed me that the fun didn't have to end and that drugs didn't have to be involved. For once I felt like I truly could be accepted by others for who I was and the you turned into the rest of them.

I want to die. Plain and simple. I've only ever focused on the negative and never learned to love myself. I grew up in an environment where any negative emotion was to be completely dismissed. I was diagnosed with BPD at a young age, and while I like to think I've overcome it now that I'm older and wiser, it still kicks my ass and destroys every platonic or romantic relationship I've ever had. While I know my broken relationships aren't an exact result of my behavior, I know I'm a huge factor in it. I'm distant, shy, awkward, and downright depressing to be around. I was always told to smile more or stop pouting. Nothing irritated me more than people telling that to me. I just don't think it's worth being here anymore. Arguably, I've never been ""here."" Just simply passing through life. I don't think I have a future, no matter what people say to me. I just.... don't even think I exist if that makes any sense at all. So what's the point? I've never had real connections with people, and if I have then those people certainly have moved on already. I wish I had any kind of support system.

- I'll never go through with it but I think of suicide regularly: I don't want to off myself, I just wish for nonexistence
- I'm a hermit/recluse: I leave the house for work and an occasional walk - that's it
- Zero ambition to do anything
- It takes a hell of a lot for me to trust someone, which leads me to believe that a relationship is an impossibility, therefore marriage/kids are a complete no-go

I like to tell myself that I'm fine being single and my career and education is fulfilling but it's really not. I mean, I considered myself gay until recently because I felt that, well, clearly my issues step from something besides me just being lonely so I MUST be gay. Well, that's not really the case, so I guess I consider myself pansexual.

I've never really had friends outside of work and my work friends aren't someone I can really share things with. For example, I work for a religious organization that would likely frown upon some of my feelings, but it is what it is. Prior to this, I worked with people who were overtly professional and didn't tend to personalize the work or even meet up outside of work.

Due to my job, I don't attend classes in person, so the opportunity of meeting some new friends at school is thrown out the window. I don't really have any current friends outside of school (I hang out with my brothers once in awhile, but they hardly qualify as friends in this regard).

I guess I'm just mad because even though my career is progressing well, I feel a sinking feeling that I'm going to die alone. I get in these moods sometimes where I think ""if only I had someone to talk this out with who knew me on a very personal level"". That just makes me more angry because I pride myself on being someone who ""doesn't need someone else to feel validated"" but apparently I do.

Nowadays I don’t feel like trying anymore because I know I’ll have to face loneliness in the end no matter how positive I try to be about it, but even so sometimes I try to get along with my classmates/people I want to be friends with or am on good terms with with a bit of hope. I don’t know how to describe it, it’s that I want to disappear so badly and think about wanting to die almost every minute of the day but I find myself trying to have the good/decent highschool social life I see others being able to have. And when I do receive the coldness or the you-don’t-really-exist/please-go attitude from others, my heart hurts. It’s like even though I know that I’ll get the same outcome, I still try to just change my fate of being lonely.",lonely,Today was also spent alone,2021-09-02 13:09:38

I grew up moving all over the country (USA) because of my dad's job so I never really made close friends in high school. I made really good friends when I studied abroad my junior year of high school, but those friends now live literally on completely different continents

I went to an extremely international university where our classes are quite small. I met a girl literally my first week there and we dated for almost my entire time on undergrad. I made some friends, but not many because I spent all of my time with her. On top of that, just like the only real friends I made in high school, after I graduated my university friends now live all over the world.

So here I am graduated now working in a big city, lonely, lost and depressed. It's just so hard to go out and meet new people alone but I know it's what I need to do.

 Don't get me wrong - I have had a lot of wonderful experiences and I'm so grateful for those around me. I have had a rlly good life and I know I'm more privileged than most. I'm just so fucking alone and I feel like I have no one. All my other siblings have had severe depression/self harm issues. I have always been the ""rock"" for my mother and them so I feel like I can't even talk to them about it. And my dad is out of the picture now.

Hi guys. This past week I think a lot of feelings that’ve been accumulating have really come to a head. I’m 22 and just graduated college, so lots of stress with money and finding a job I like and debt. The anxiety from that doesn’t help, but what’s mainly getting me lately is how incredibly lonely I feel. I thought I had some really solid friends, but lately they’ve been very busy with their own life and significant others that they’ve been ignoring me. I feel like no one really wants to know me, or actively spend time with me. I don’t have anyone that asks me how my day has been. Even my discord friends I’ve made feel so distant. I guess I just feel really disposable.

Of course my family loves me (and I love them too), but they’re sort of obligated to and they live a bit aways. I’ve felt so down these past few days that I really wish it would end. Of course I’ve read all the stuff online I should do to make myself feel better but it just feels far away at this point.

One memory that stayed with me for 30 years was when we had birthday parties we’d write the kids names we wanted to invite on the chalkboard. I was always the only one in the entire class left out, I was 6 year old. 20 years ago Moving to London until today felt like I never belonged to any group/clique. Every group of friends would eventually phase me out and stay close from high school to university to work colleagues. Although I’m outwardly confident, charismatic, soft hearted etc I never fit in anywhere, or I felt like I didn’t. I always feel rejected, left out, secretly hated. I finally moved to East Africa and at first thinking I’d made all these friends (mostly white) through my travel not realising I was actually their token friend. I noticed the same pattern, I was being left out again, not being included. I get it, as foreigners people are comfortable with the familiar and a black South African girl with a strong London accent is NOT familiar. So I’m now in a foreign African country that is very xenophobic towards black foreigners, with no friends and with other expats weary of being friends with. One of the expat girls told me they only invite me because they feel bad I have no friends.
Its gotten nasty for me to the point of being bullied by people because of the disposable nature of a token friend. And bullied by locals who don’t understand what a black foreigner is doing here. I’ve considered suicide. 
Year after year I’ve watched people nurture close friendships in circles I thought I belonged to leave me out, travel together. 
Someone I believed was one of my best friend cut me out as a bridesmaid without telling me because she said I didn’t chase her enough. I flew to visit her 3 times, inc. for her wedding. When my mother died she didn’t even drive a few miles to see me. 
I don’t belong in the place of my birth. I never belonged where I grew up. I’m rejected where I ran to. I feel like an empty abyss.

I have shelter, water, sustenance

Skin and bones in a frosted glass box
How much longer before my body gives in
I feel my ribs protruding 
My frame unable to stay upright 
My mind being corroded
I want to find strength to run away
But when I mustered it before 
I landed somewhere far to familiar 
Now with the remaining will I had
Depleted into an empty void
Reality is too real
I cannot pretend to be okay anymore
I'm losing my friends
My partner
My family seems to shutter from my presence
I see the disappointment and sorrow 
When they look at me
I can no longer hide that void 
I dont have the energy 
And others want to get away from it

And seeing hopelessness is too painful 
I understand

4196,qowoeorotoyoo,1630524766,1,"I'm 19 and I'm yet to be in a relationship. Previously I have had 2 crushes. One, I didn't talk to. Second, we were very close. I had confessed to her and she told me she liked me too. But as we were going to different colleges in different cities, she didn't want to start a long term relationship. I was heartbroken. It's been more than 1.5 yrs now and I still wonder if I am completely over her or not. 

My first yr in college was completely online. 3rd sem is still going online. I'hv made only a very few ""friends"" online and ofc didn't meet or socialise with new people. 

I crave intimacy more than anything at this moment. I don't have anyone to talk to. I just spend my days on front of the screen, in classes or doing assignments and the remaining time on my mobile watching YouTube and going through other social media apps. I just want to be with a person who I can trust, share, care for and be taken care by; a person with whom I can hold hands and look them in the eye for hours as we talk about our lives...just to cuddle and spend our times.... 

I don't crave sex. Just the connection, the intimacy. I feel that this world is getting devoid of this. It's so hard to find the right person with whom the timing match as well. My last crush was very good to me. But it wasn't the right time. But I sometimes feel that if the time wasn't right, maybe she wasn't the right person.

It's a paradox. I want a gf with whom I can be intimate with but I know this is not the right time as after graduation we would be going to different places, different cities in the world, atleast me, for our masters. I'm scared that if I do find a gf in my college, things would ultimately get ruined...just as it did with my crush... distance ruins people only few succeed and breakup is fucking hard.",lonely,"19M, I want intimacy",2021-09-02 05:32:46

I confess, I've pretty much lived on the internet since its early days.  I found it simpler and easier, at least in the old days, to socialize online than with strangers in person... joining clubs, trying to meet new people, small talking with strangers, it was ridiculously hard and didn't work well, back then, in person.  I ""flourished"" on the internet, by comparison.  


But my internet life has completely dried up now.  Where once I got enough socialization on facebook or okcupid or whatever, it's gone now.  I get crickets and silence on facebook now, and no, I still post the same things, so it's not like I've changed my content.  It's just... dried up completely.  Where once I had ""friends"" there's just silence.  I can go literally years now without a word or response on some dating sites where I used to get enough attention to get by.  (I'm a hermit at heart, so it's not like I needed a lot.)  


Long story short, I'm very, very close to hitting the delete button on all my once vibrant communities.  This is either going to be ok, or a rash, terrible decision brought on by loneliness that the internet can no longer fix.  I can't seem to work out which one it is, my logic may be emotionally compromised, I think.",lonely,"So, thinking about changing the way I live online. Or not.",2021-09-02 03:40:06

I would consider myself to be very friendly and (average?) looking. I'm not attending college at the moment, just paying the bills and all.

I'm also pretty Introverted when at home, but also kinda high energy and restless when at work.

My problem is that my work schedule hardly leaves any room to meet new people and form stronger relationships outside of my job. I get along fine with my coworkers (even have a crush on one or two), but WE ARE WORKING. I think my problem is that I place too much emphasis on my professional life and not enough on myself and the people I know.

I dont have any significant friends or a significant other, it just feels like me and my family most of the time even though I live on my own now.

Here after school I hit up a classmate, who is also one of the closest people I have from my class, to ask her what I do wrong socially.. Am I not trying enough? Am I trying too hard?
Am I too pessimistic about everything?

She told me I just needed to get up and blend in with social groups, even if I don't say anything. At some point a conversation strikes up and you can join in. That's how she does it. Problem is. I have pretty hard social anxiety for things like that. I can easily present My projects in front of 1000's of people, but I can barely make any social interactions..

I told her that I just felt like I had 0 friends. I mean.. I barely have any. I'm always alone after school. Noone to talk to..
I just sit by myself and wait till the end of the day, sleep and have that on repeat.. 
As if lockdown hasn't ended for me..
She said that I have her, but I want a friend. Not a therapist. Not someone who checks up on me and asks if I'm okay when I feel down.. I don't wanna tell people my problems. Just someone to hang out with after school. Someone I can talk to and have fun with. And I don't have any..

She says that a key part of a friendship is that people are open and listen to each other. so I guess I'll never have any friends Because I don't want to open up to anyone, ever. I can't.. Really. Ive tried once or twice in my life, but Ive always just broken down for a minute, then turned back into a stone cold wall with no emotions..

But I just wanted to take my time with things as, well, I am a very anxious person, and change makes me very anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm sure most of you can relate. Over time, she became more distant from me, but never really addressed why; she told me she was in hospital once, and declined my offer to fly over and be with her. In hindsight, maybe she wasn't being honest. She would write me a message, I would reply, and she would disappear again, crushing my heart. On the weekend, the day after my birthday (which she forgot about), she messaged me saying she was thinking about me and sent kisses. Again, she did not respond to my reply. After quizzing her and telling her that she was breaking my heart, she told me that she moved on. She is adamant that she didn't want to, but she couldn't wait an eternity for me. But what really broke my heart is when she decided to tell me that she has a new boyfriend. She said that he is a dick a lot of the time, which made me feel that she might have been telling me because she misses me and isn't happy in her relationship, but I think that is just my brain trying to make excuses.

She broke my heart. I gave her everything I had, I really did. I just wasn't ready for anything serious. Any time she needed me, I was there, but it wasn't appreciated I don't think. I'm sure I will get over this, but its going to take a long time.

My friend was telling me what 1 of my exes said to him about me, he said ‘I wasn’t gonna go that far with her’, even though we only kissed &amp; held hands. I cant stop thinking about it. 

People think I’m unworthy of love just because I’m not the most attractive girl out there, I have an ugly face, very masculine. Guys asked me out as a dare in school.. Ive since realized I’m a lesbian, but I’m a butch, which is liberating, but not many women are into butches. 

I am made a mockery in every relationship I’m in, I always end up hurt &amp; betrayed or used. I see girls my age be in happy relationships that last years.

I wonder where I went wrong in high school, most of my friends from then got into relationships and aren't alone now. I know that dating isn't everything there is to life, but I've had ZERO experience, with any of it. When I step back though, I realize it may have had to do with my sexuality. I didn't want to post this on r/lesbian or any groups like that because everyone seems mostly happy on those groups, mostly just joking around or enjoying themselves. Being self-hating there is probably not the way to go. 

I remember only two people ever showing interest in me throughout high school (both guys), and I wanted to be interested back, but I just couldn't. Instead, I just hid my feelings toward girls and stayed in the closet. What gets me is that I had gay (or more like bi) friends who got in relationships, so it didn't have to be this way for me. I just feel stupid for not being able to accept myself and I have a lot of screwed up beliefs, like that I'm too ugly to date women and that my sexuality makes me a ""creep"".

Growing up, I was Physically abused, beaten up, verbally abused and discouraged a lot in my life. Never hsd friends, and the ones I considered friends betrayed me, never been in a relationship because no girl wanted to be with a sad and poor ugly loner like me whom his own family treats like sh--, my online relationships never worked out because they were too toxic, liars, addicts or too mysterious or we had no communication. To be honest I've always been on my own. But my heart still craves that love and attention.

I believe everybody needs somebody in this life who can be their partner in this journey of life. To care for them, love them, talk to them and treat them right. What's life when someday I'll have all the wealth in the world but nobody to love and nobody who loves me. Someone I can call my person, be there for in her good and bad days, someone I can laugh with, flirt with, watch movies with, go out on vacations, dates and long rides with. 

Someday I want a family. A family I never had, a family I always dreamed about and craved so much for. Someday I want to be a good boyfriend, then a good husband and someday even be a good father. I want it all.

I've graduated college now with a Degree in Finance and a minor in computers, started my diploma in Cloud computing today and also applied for an internship here temporarily until I'll have a strong resume to move out and ghost my Toxic Mother.

I want someone to love deeply. But I’m weird, too weird. I try not to be self-depricating. I should not be. People have noticed and I do not wish to worry them. Still though, everyone around me seems more “normal” than me. That is probably not true.

I feel so deprived of friendship and romantic relationships. I have a few friends but we do not talk much. It’s sad because I can tell one them is just like me, depressed and lonely. I try opening up to them but they will not open up to me. They have their own friends. Still though, I want to help them because I get the feeling we are both broken…

I want someone to say “I love you, so, so much. I will love you forever” to. I want someone to hug, someone to kiss tenderly, someone to make out with, someone to comfort. I can care for others, I can help people, but the problem is I’ve struggled helping myself. I have self-care problems that I need to address.

If I self-care enough, maybe I’ll attract people. That’s my problem.

I wore the same grey shirts and hoodies to school everyday, I didn’t open up to the few friends I had, and I had no respect for myself.

It’s just so hard because everyone is scared of opening up. Half my college classes are online. Why does learning matter if I’m so lonely and unhappy???

I want FRIENDS. I want a friend group who I can love. I want to hang out with people outside of school. Go to movies together, visit parks, swim…

Make memories…

That’s what I want. I want my own kin. I want to love. I am ready to love people.

I am so, so lonely. The days pass me by. August felt like nothing. It’s scary.

I want friends but some people don’t want a mental case. I want friends who I can talk about my feelings with.

I want friends. I want a romantic partner.

I think the only way I can get those, though, is if I start respecting myself more. It would be great if I had friends to comfort and validate me, but self-validation is way more difficult.

So... a random hodgepodge of information about myself that I think is relevant and hope it is lol; 

I'm a 27 year old guy, living his best attempt at emo ""lite"" (as I didn't really get to aesthetically explore growing up, between being poor, having religious parents, and having too low of self esteem) as an aesthetic, I'm somewhat of a retro gamer, I have a lot of mental health struggles but I really try my best to offer some laughs and light in contrast to my sometimes downtrodden demeanor. I dabble in anime but really don't watch much of anything, anime or not. Unless it's YouTube. I'm an electronics repair person as a job, but I have way too much free time. I enjoy talking, sometimes too much. But i promise to try my best to attempt to offer something in return for your time lol

it's been nearly a decade and I'm now under 30. the temporary unmatched excitement has left me insatiable to social adventures shared with company.

I guess i might be venting into the void with no real purpose behind this other than recording some thoughts; but if you've read this far and you're wondering 'whats the point of this' I guess i just want to hazard  anyone who may be going through a rough patch, keep true to yourself and know your boundaries. define them, stick to them, and don't compromise.

Hope you and your folks are doing well.

I am constantly been reminded by my folks and I quote. 

“ We are way more experienced in Life than you. Trust our decisions. Work Hard but accept something’s are fate. Where ever you go , your fate goes with you.” 

I get mad when they say it but I don’t have the energy to argue with them .

I think the decisions we made in past decides the present and decisions we make now will decide the future. 
We always decide what is good in present but that doesn’t always get desired/positive results in the future. 

Another thing they constantly remind me is “ Everything happens as per God’s wishes. 
No matter how much we try if god wants it in certain way, it will happen that way only”.

I am feeling so distant from them and have no one to share what I think . 
I know there are instances where my decisions were wrong but it’s not like my folks decisions are always correct either.

Something that is as simple as finding someone that **doesn't** find you appalling comes as second nature to everyone else. Why not us? Why is that we were chosen from the very beginning to be the ones cast aside? 

This doesn't seem very fair. Then again, I guess that's just par for the course seeing as life has never been fair. It would be one thing to be happy in my own skin and alone, but it's never been that way. As a man that's shorter than average, there are literally *no* women that exist that would want a shorter guy. ""Height isn't everything,"" they'll preach -- but ""they"" are usually the same women with boyfriends that are 5'10"", 6'2"", and maybe even taller. Women want a guy that'll protect them -- and I can do that... Then again I've never been able to get my foot in the door in the first place, and it's probably not solely based on my height either. 

It's a hard pill to swallow when you see everyone else happily in love. There's a guy I work with that just turned 18 less than a month ago. He not only is in his first ever relationship, but has already had sex. For a while there I didn't feel as lonely when I saw that guy and I had something in common. 

All my life I felt like there was never a place for me here. ""You'll never belong. Nobody loves you. You'll never be good enough for someone else, let alone yourself."" That little voice in my head grew louder with age, and now?

4319,ImAgilityYT,1630461564,1,"I’ve known this really special girl for a while now (I don’t talk to many people so she’s special to me) at my University. She’s perfect in my eyes and can’t believe she didn’t ignore me when I said hi. Most people write me off because I’m quiet. I do my best to hide it (I’m afraid of what she or others would think) but I have non-verbal learning disorder (along with a lot of other demons like PTSD, insomnia, self-harm and suicidal tendencies) which makes it really hard to be like everyone else, socialize and show my feelings. I run and workout daily, act and dress with confidence, but I’m probably the sad and loneliest in the entire school. I’ve been hospitalized and placed into psych wards for suicide attempts in the past and it feels weird being a guy saying this, but every night, I cry myself to sleep. Thinking about how alone I really am and how I just want someone to hold. I’ve felt like this for many years now and as time passes, the feelings get worse. They come from being mentally, physically, and sexually abused growing up (alcoholic parents and school bullies.) I don’t hold any anger and forgive everyone that’s hurt me. I just see it as something that I deserved because I was never good enough. I’m going off track, but despite all of this, when I’m with her, it’s like all of that bad mental stuff goes away. I’ve never been in a relationship before, so this is all new to me. I loved telling her jokes, all just to see her smile. We only saw each other for about an hour a day, but it meant more than she will probably ever know. I would compliment her on her talents, or her hair, or whatever, just to make her feel special. I love hearing her talk about everything, so whenever she would speak about herself, I would remember everything she said and would bring it all up in our next conversation (I’m quiet, but I’m a good listener.) We’ve gotten to the point where I was going to ask her out for coffee or just out for a long walk together, but something just didn’t feel right at the same time. This is what I noticed. She would NEVER say my real name. Just Hi or bye. (Do I mean so little?) When I made her laugh or smiled at her, she would laugh and smile at me back, but would quickly turn her head to the side and freeze. Like she wasn’t supposed to. I would catch her staring at me and if I turned to look at her, she would quickly pretend like she was on her phone. It was like she wanted to get closer or say more to me, but couldn’t. I just thought that maybe she was a little shy (like me) or that I was making it all up because I was getting outside of my comfort-zone. This feeling kept distracting me, so I decided to see if she had any socials (I don’t have any social media, which is why I didn’t check sooner) and sure enough, my feeling was right. Photos of her having the time of her life with another guy. Photo after photo. Hugging and holding, like there’s no tomorrow. I should have known. Why would a girl that pretty, ever want to be with a nobody like me. It was like my heart was ripped out and stomped on right in front of me. I’m an idiot for even thinking I had a chance. I’ve been writing this for a while now and getting sad, so I will probably go on a night walk, thinking about how the next 21 years of my lonely life will be like. I don’t want to bother her anymore so I will probably stop sitting and talking to her altogether. It makes me feel bad to just cut her out of my life, but it would upset me more to keep talking to her and remembering that no matter what, we could never be together.

The job I currently have is really almost the furthest a person could be to having a physically demanding job. But, I’ve felt myself becoming more and more physically tired at the end of the day.

I’ve never been officially diagnosed. But, I work in the mental health field. And, I feel relatively confident I would be diagnosed with depression (possibly bipolar) and anxiety.

I live by myself. I don’t really talk to my co-workers outside of work. I talk to/see members of my family maybe once or twice a month tops. And the only friend I have is someone I usually have fairly short text conversations with once or twice a week. So, I don’t really have much of a social life.

I’ve kinda been thinking that, maybe, a lot of my physical tiredness comes from my mental issues and having a fairly mentally stressful job combined with not having any outlets when it comes to talking to people, venting, or having close physical contact with.

4336,Fun_Refrigerator3712,1630453071,1,"It’s difficult to love. Love itself is adventitious I think. Similar to stalagmite formations in a dank cave or even the tumble of a bumble bee in morning pollen. It hurts so so much though when there’s no answer back in the beam of your love. Love is an effort. To love yourself and then bridge it onto other people. Shoot, even to love something be it music, film, architecture, etc etc is a perpetual effort due to how adventitious the draw of a camera shot or melody might be for you. Same goes for relationships with people. 

Because of its’ unexpectedness, I think love is ultimately an effort in venturing into the unknown and being open in the loneliness that’s prior to all love. For I think love is a formation of something between one thing and others. To be lonely is necessary for transcendence. But to be open in that void of loneliness is the true catalyst for the transformation love brings forth. At least I feel so.

All I wanted is to have the people I care about to actually care about me. And the heartbreaking reality I faced is that I feel like none of my loved ones actually cared, or worse, they really didn't. They always say ""why didn't you talk to me first?"" And my reason why is ""I've been trying to but I felt distance or disinterested energy from you."" If they actually ever ask that.

Is that why I've been purposely isolating myself lately? To embrace the solitude, as painful as it is? I've only been recently been betrayed with no remorse and I feel like everyone's against me. One friend doesn't talk to me because I have no idea. Another I recently made felt awkward one time and none of us tried to talk ever since. I have such high expectations from people because I want to have intelligent and deep conversations again. And lastly I'm sensing a weirdo who don't suggest things to me, but demand them like ""show me a picture of your home"" first of all that's sketchy as fuck. Second I don't owe you anything bitch. So I purposely ghosted after. 

Maybe, and it might be controversial because I'm posting on a forum that's suffering from loneliness and most people here are trying to get out of this lonely state. But maybe it's best to actually be alone, at least for me. I've been connecting with myself more, and without the distractions of other people, I've been finding out who I am. I'm an attractive woman who is vain towards the public, I'm a creative person who creates things with ease due to years of drawing, writing, imagining, etc. I am talented in many things, and I'm intelligent.

I feel like a lesser human being because I can't be loved like they are. I feel like their success is my failure. I KNOW I should focus on myself. Stop comparing myself to others. 

I have nobody except for family who are literally forced to like me because they raised me. The person I struggle most with envy is my best friend.  I hate how everything is so smooth sailing for her. How she can just walk into every situation and have friends and romantic partners line up, fit in seamlessly, parents who bring her everything on a silver plate and yet she complains. I keep a more optimistic attitude than her despite having a much tougher time in nearly everything. 

It's not that I want to see her fail. I want her to succeed. I want her to be happy. It just sucks to always be the person in the friend group who sits there like a loser. Less money than them. Nobody likes me for my personality, nobody has a crush on me. People just want a quick one night stand. Nobody really wants me. Makes me feel worthless. 

I never project my feelings onto others. I wish people the best. This is MY problem not theirs. But I wish I could just open up.

I know myself now, and how I am when I'm having episodes, and I think that my ""friends"" use my depression to make me think I'm just imagining things. I thought I had friends, good friends. But with the lockdown I realized even more, that people don't care at all. I live in France, we had 3 strict lockdowns the past year and a half. Each time, I'm the one who asks about people, check if they are doing OK. The thing is, I'm the one who lives alone, my family is in another continent and all my friends are either married or in a relationship and live with their partners. Yet, nobody ever asks how I'm doing. If I die, my body will be found weeks later, because the smell will bother the neighbours. One time I stopped asking, nobody talked to me for nearly 2 months. Sometimes I feel so lonely, it physically hurts. So I wonder, is it just in my head that people don't care about me?

4349,waitingforsimon,1630448750,1,"I started reddit four months ago. I was lonely back then too yes, but it was nothing like this pit of depressing blackhole I find myself drowning in right now. 

I was a very encouraging person at the start, being empathic I was always trying to be helpful and supportive to people. It was naive of me but then i realized quickly how some people take kindness for granted and that no matter how much encouragement you try to give a person, they just don't care. 

At first i was very guarded and careful. I never disclose my exact location, i never take selfies and was decided not to send my photo to anyone, and I was adamant that everything be platonic always. 

The initial shock from receiving indecent messages caused me to have panic attacks. However I learned to disassociate with my feelings later on and just block them without feeling panicky. 

The first serious connection i had was someone who needed my support (although my original post was about *me* needing support). Classic story of breakup, fallout with girlfriend -- i was there, just taking all his vents and frustrations which were basically 80% of the convos. I was always trying to steer him to a better mindset and giving advice and support. 

But his depression and suicidal tendencies just drained the life out of me. Even so I grew strangely attached to him and when he asked me to be more than friends, I accepted, only to find out later that he is in fact married and deliberately hid the truth despite knowing my trauma about a married person -  *just so i won't reject him* 

I was so much in pain over this person and when someone reached out to me to offer support i was naturally delighted. Unlike the other guy this person was very engaging, kind, super keen to get to know me and said all the right things and gave me the support i was needing. He was always asking me for photos even if i already sent him one. And i was told i was beautiful and that he sees me in my future, the works. 

But all good things come to an end. The last photo of my face i sent was apparently not beautiful enough for him to even keep me as a friend, even if my previous photo was also an unfiltered no make up image. It was awkward not getting any messages suddenly. And it hurt. 

I noticed the same thing, people see my photo and the messages quickly become unanimated or become scarce. I get ghosted even after receiving apparently half-meant compliments. 

I can't help it if I'm not beautiful enough to be someone's friend. The pain of being lied to, used as a distraction from their marriage, rejected by someone, let down - all these things made my depression worse. And I have no one to blame but myself for being so trusting. 


I feel more alone now and in a worse mental state than when I started in this platform looking for human connections. Ironic that the very people i thought would make me less lonely are the cause of a major emotional turmoil i am in now. I am not just miserably alone, but also feel unacceptable and a reject and that I will never ever belong somewhere anymore or deserve anything more than pity.

For being vulnerable, honest, trusting, loving - I'm left with nothing but pain in return. 

Now I'm back to only having myself to trust. I am more broken and ill than before, but I still have myself after all. 

Hopefully that will be an encouraging thought after I process all these and find the courage to finally rid myself of this platform once and for all.

4358,Chance-Active9119,1630443527,1,"I left high school two years ago from now.   


I always felt lonely and isolated in general, so the feeling is not unfamiliar. I never felt like my connections were strong or that I was special to someone, BUT I had at the time (high school) a very strong group of friends I thought I would carry for the rest of my life. 

A few months later, after HS had ended, the pandemic started. I got to meet my friends a couple of times during last year but our distance was growing even before that year. Some of them started to date or were dating for years already and I watched myself slowly being deprioritized of their lives. That got me mad, and I'm still a little bit angry still even knowing that's just part of life sometimes.

Thing is, I got to a point last year where I was completely isolated, emotionally, mentaly, physically. My mental health which always was shakey and fragile took a down turn. (I believe I suffer from depression, but I never was officially diagnosed). At that time I had moved out from my mother's house ( which I'm back into btw) and I lived all alone for a couple of months. I had few text messages from time to time but I was getting lonelier and lonelier.

One year later from that time and here I'm. I literally have no one in my life right now appart from my mom, and she's honestly not the best company. I'm really tired of the isolation, one that started way before covid happened, an isolation which is rooted in childhood trauma. Trauma that changed my life and how I connect to people.

I also feel like I have no strength left in my body and mind to do anything for myself. I'm currently not working so I feel pretty useless and pointless right now, like my life has no meaning and goes nowhere. Outside pressures don't help a lot too. I can barely be self-sufficient and regulate my own emotions. 

I met a guy and he brought a lot of things that were boiling up in my mind already and that and many other realizations made me write this down. I feel worthless, desinteristing as I spent half of my life in my house, with no real friends, with people that didn't even care enough; alone. All of my family neglected me, people close to me died and of that led me to be very closed off, anxious and secretly starved for affection of any kind. He's the opposite of me.

That was at 25, and now I'm 28. It feels like no one could ever want to go through the awkwardness of trying to date me now.

I really do try to keep a positive attitude and outlook, but so many lonely years have gone by, I can't see how anyone could ever be willing to go through the awkwardness of trying to date me.

No one had ever cared about me enough to see past my lack of experience.

4363,Thelithan2182,1630441399,1,"I have’t lived in New Orleans very long, but I just experienced my first hurricane. Theres no water, no electricity, a destroyed fence, and a hole in the roof, but ultimately I came out fine, especially when compared to people in other parts of Louisiana. After watching some videos of Lafitte, Im counting my blessings.

How this ties into the subreddit is this:

The few people I could call “friends” back home didn't even check up on me. Not a single fucking word except from one of them. The same people who always concern post infographics on instagram, mind.

Meanwhile, the friends I’ve met here all reached out to me and one another and offered to help, having little more (and sometimes less) than I did. I got messages from people I only met once. We’re currently at another persons house helping them get everything back up and running, picking up shingles in the yard.  

Now maybe this is “special circumstances” but I can guarantee you this wouldn't happen where I lived before, certainly not within my old circle. Doesn't matter if it was WW3 outside. 

The moral of the story? Don’t be afraid to change your environment. Maybe that doesn’t mean packing up and moving 17 hours away, but it might mean reorienting yourself in other ways. Whoever said “Wherever you go, there you are” is full of shit, our environment effects us in ways both conscious and subconscious, of course going somewhere new or surrounding yourself with new people might have an effect on your happiness.

From someone who spent a decade alone and unwanted, passed out high in front of the TV every other day, I hope this ramble meant something. I finally feel like a prt of a community.

4383,robertpaulchampagne2,1630429784,1,"Let me just start by saying that I have never been cheated on, so please don't recommend subs like r/survivinginfidelity. 

I guess I'm what you would call a ""forever alone"" type person. I'm not close with my family and I have no friends or romantic interests. When I see couples walking down the street holding hands it bums me out a little. I would love to have someone to fall asleep with and wake up to in the morning. Someone that I can cuddle up on the couch with and go on fun dates and have amazing sex. I really want intimacy but I know it's very likely I will never get it, so it really pisses me off when I see someone that's been cheated on. It takes a special kind of scum bag to betray a person's trust and break their heart to the point that they're not even the same person anymore. People get cheated on and they are so traumatised by it that they never trust anyone ever again, and they may also need to seek therapy. They get their heart broken in the worst way possible and they end up turning to drugs and alcohol to help them cope, and they may even turn to self harm and maybe even suicide.

Even if they recover from being betrayed, it's very possible that they still have self image issues and have low confidence/self esteem and they find it very hard to trust others and be intimate with them and commit to them. 

If you've cheated on someone then you're a piece of shit and you don't deserve love. They're are countless people out there that want nothing more than to fall in love and be happy, and here you are ripping out a person's heart and shitting all over it. In all seriousness, how do you sleep at night knowing that you're a piece of shit?

If anyone reading this has been cheated on, I'm so sorry you had to go through all that emotional stress and turmoil. I hope you recover and can find confidence within yourself and not let being cheated on define your worth as a person or a lover and I hope you find someone that will never betray you.
