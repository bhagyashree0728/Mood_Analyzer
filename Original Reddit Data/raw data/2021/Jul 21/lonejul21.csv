Recently I've been feeling nostalgic because of a dream I had a few nights ago. Basically it was about this old crush I had.

It's been bumming me out for the past few days because I realize I just really miss being in love, or even just liking someone, being infatuated—all those feelings that were very common in high school. Not only that, in high school it was so easy to make friends, it was easy for me to get a chance to speak to people, even with my shy personality.

Without getting too much into it, I was just overall a happier, more energetic, and more confident person back then. I want to feel that way again. Like, excited. Like I have places to be and people to run to. Now everything's just so...fuckin complicated.

I hope I meet people who can get to know the current me and we can vibe with each other. I can't really be myself around my old friends.

Anyway I hope this nostalgia goes away now that I've talked about it somewhere. Have a nice day/night, everyone.",lonely,Caught up in the past cuz the present kinda sucks,2021-07-31 23:36:35

I was able to endure when it was just family issues, and abandonment from all my friends (been trying for 8-9 years, they all gave me the same result, betrayals. There must be something wrong with me, but I can't figure out what, it's probably just my existence) but after going through my first heartbreak (been 154 days since he left too), I just can't take it anymore.

I cry all the time, my body wouldn't stop shivering and I can't eat without getting nauseous. I don't understand, he liked me first, why am I the one who's suffering? Why is it always me who has to suffer? 

Will this all go away if I'm gone? It's not like I matter anyway, I'm of no importance to anyone at all.

14,Xeno-Bound,1627732605,1,"I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. My friends all have people that they grew closer to and like better, even though they used to love me. I even had a romantic partner at one point, who was madly in love with me, and it made me so happy thinking that someone loved the fact that I exist. But they eventually lost feelings and just dropped the whole thing. Another one of my friends got mad at me for thinking I used her to get something out of her, even though I never did such thing. But she was hurt enough to go out and make better friendships with others, while I just stood there idly by as we grew apart for something I never did. One other friend has seemed to become disinterested in me. She’s not excited to see me like used to, won’t talk unless I talk to her, and usually has very mediocre reactions to anything I say. It’s lead to us fighting and now I don’t know if she even wants to be my friend.

I fucking hate this. No one ever seems to love me, and if they ever do, they’ll stop. I do my fucking best to be a good person who treats others nicely. The worst part is that I don’t have many people to talk to. There have been times I’ve been mocked and berated when I tell them I’m depressed, and they just end up saying stupid shit like “Just be happy and find new people.” I became friends with them because I wanted to be happy and meet new people, so hearing them say that feels like they’re telling me to fuck off and be someone else’s problem.

I don’t know how much more I can take. I’m tired of feeling worthless, or that I don’t have any value to anyone else. At least if I’m dead, then maybe I will be mourned.

24,CurseOfMyth,1627722037,1,"I’m currently living with my parents. My father has Alzheimer’s, so I’m here to keep an additional pair of eyes on him so that he doesn’t destroy the house.

Since I’ve been back home, I’ve barely talked to anyone. All of my friends are an entire state away, and despite the fact that I grew up my whole life in this town, I have practically no friends here.

I suffer from social anxiety, so talking to people is hard as it is. And this is also a really small town - pretty much _nothing_ happens here. Even on the odd occasion that something does happen though, I can’t start a conversation with a stranger if my life depended on it. Literally, I just can’t process how that’s supposed to work, and no matter how many times it’s explained, it never makes sense to me. Like what do you do? Just target some random person out of a crowd? Isn’t that creepy? And assume that I were to do that, what would I talk to them about to initiate a conversation that lasts more than 5 minutes? And then people at this point tell me that I’m overthinking it, but socialization isn’t as easy for me as it is for other people; for those people, it’s seemless, for me, it takes significant effort. If I just “don’t think” about it, I never end up doing anything. I _have_ to think about, I _have_ to have some idea of what I intend to do.

I have no idea how you’re supposed to make friends as an adult; every friend I currently have ( the ones that live in another state ), I became friends with through unique circumstances that can’t really be organically repeated. Every Avenue there is to meet people here is bogged down by the fact that it’s a small town, and the closest semi-big city is at least an hour away. Apps? lol, nobody uses those in this town. Clubs/classes/activity groups? What few there are, nobody goes to. Bars? Maybe, but they’re loud, full of drunks, and utterly overstimulating for me.

I just… don’t know what to do. I’ve been back home for a year and 1/2 now, and I’ve barely even spoken to anyone who isn’t my mother or a co-worker, and I was recently laid off, so I don’t even have the latter anymore. I have zero sense for how to interact with strangers, and it feels like I have practically no way to make friends here.

we all love that song right? Well, my life feels definitely like that right now 😅 but hey, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, have dark eyes/dark hair and a naive face. I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT 👨🏻‍🍳  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D 
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general, i miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. So i feel like in the song, fallen into the same old dull routine.. our marriage is having a hard time. We are working on it, still it's a challenge often. So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, idk as a friend or maybe more than just a friend? i know, sounds kinda mean.. 

I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things in my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we click!

But I can't stop this hollow feeling inside me whenever I see people my age having fun, going outside and simply living their life.


Back when I finally turned 17, I thought it would be a great year, I literally thought  I was going to be a Dancing Queen, like the ABBA song. But this year is one of the worst. From the beginning of this year, friends kept leaving me out, barely 5 people (excluding relatives) reached out to write to me this summer, and the year when I should have made the best memories is slipping away.


I can't talk to my parents about how I feel because I tried to, and they called me ungrateful... And I tried to tell myself that they're right, that family is the most important, but in 2 months I'm going to be 18 and I have almost no memory of my teenage years. Almost no friends, and the best memories are from when I went to different school-related competitions.


Partly it's my fault too. I always had a hard time keeping relationships, I don't like voice calls and I am a difficult texter. But I thought I had friends, until this summer. This country where I'm spending the summer is so foreign to me, I feel anxious about going out and I have no pleasure seeing other groups of people my age having fun. That only thing I'm doing all day is playing PC games and living my adventures through them.


I used to be such an interesting person; now I feel bland, lazy and too burned out to even try. I feel ugly, I hate that I want to post pictures of myself but I dislike each one I take, and I am mourning that I lost my chance at living my dream teenage years (next year I'll be too busy with my studies to even think about having fun). I hate that I literally have no idea what to do with my future, that what I loved doing is not what I am good at, and that I have no one to talk about it.

I would love to find someone to chat and maybe game with me? I can chat everyday as long as we have the same topics but im very flexible to new stuff if it's a bit around my current interests. 



I preferably use discord for chatting and voice chatting! My dms are open, feel free to text me and i will give u my discord name. I would love to have someone to talk to and play with. (please don't mind the username) &lt;3

——

I’m a 22 year old guy, I am extremely alone, and I feel hopeless. I’ve never been in a relationship before (I’m a virgin, never even kissed a girl before). I’ve asked a few women out before but I’ve been rejected every time, so it makes me feel like something must be wrong with me. I’m a pretty tall, slim, average looking guy so I don’t necessarily think it’s due to appearance, and I have a good tech job as well. I feel like it’s because I really don’t have much of a personality. I’m boring, awkward, and I don’t drink (Never drank before) so social situations at my age are difficult. I don’t know why I’m so socially inept, but I hate it and want to do better but just don’t know how. 

I just moved to a new city but thankfully I have a good group of friends here already, although our group doesn’t get together all that often anymore. Other than that group though, I don’t have anyone up here and my days are spent alone in my apartment after work. And even with that group, I don’t feel like I’m very close to any of them. I’ve never felt like I’ve had a best friend before - someone I could tell anything to. I don’t even tell my parents or siblings anything regarding my emotions. I’ve bottled up my sadness and loneliness for so long I feel almost numb to the world. I just wish that I could find a best friend or girlfriend who I could just cry with and express my emotions finally instead of leaving them bottled up forever. 

Right now I’m dealing with a dilemma because I’ve liked one of my friends in the previously mentioned friend group since we met 3 years ago, but timing never worked out for me to ask her out. I have maintained my feelings for her through those 3 years all the while not expressing anything to her or receiving any interest from her (that I noticed at least). I’m worried that if I ask her out and she isn’t interested, it would make our friendship awkward and hurt my friend group. On the other hand, if she was interested I’m worried she would realize how boring I am and leave, causing the same issue. But I’m just so desperate to feel something that I feel like it may be worth it to try. And if so, I would first ask a mutual friend of ours what he thinks. That would be really difficult for me though since, like I said, I really don’t express my feelings to anyone. But I do believe I could in this case probably because I feel so desperate to feel something. 

I just feel like no one cares how I feel since no one has ever really tried to get to know me. I understand that friendship is a two way street, but why can’t someone take the first step? I feel like I’d just be an annoying burden if I opened up to someone, and I don’t want to look pathetic (even though I feel that way). And I’m worried that my feelings for my friend, no matter how real they feel to me, may just be caused by my desperation to not be alone. I really don’t want to be alone forever. I want a wife and children and to be happy, but it just feels so unattainable.",lonely,Constantly lonely,2021-07-31 08:04:10

125,darkmeteo,1627671607,1,"I'm at home, I've been through a year of online college, a college I've never stepped into for my entire life, I feel terribly, terribly lonely, the friends I've had have never been farther away from me, it almost feels as if they heard something terrible about me and they want to get away from me, this is only on social media though, as I am not able to meet them because of long distances.

I've never been this lonely before, well, I have, once, but that was a terrible one off, and at least my family was *okay* back then, with no problems, now, however, its horrible, it's like a living nightmare, My mom is diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I'm not very close with my mother, and I don't feel devasted or whatever, but it's my dad I'm worried about, It's painful to watch him go through all this pain, he's on the verge of getting fired because of all this, it's a miracle he even has a job at this point, fortunately, we aren't on the verge of poverty without it either, since we're currently in our home country and we were going to settle back here anyway by this time. but either way, it's painful.

I'm running from errand to errand, every one around me is shaming me for not apparently ""caring"" about my mother, my mother's family is very religious, so they, including my mom, are pissed at me for not praying etc. how do I possibly tell them that I don't believe in their bullshit? how do I risk to break my mother's heart at this stage? the alternative(which I'm currently doing) is to lie about it perhaps, but I know my mother can see through it..

A few days ago I went on a 4 hour trip to my friend's house, now, this friend was one of the closest friends I've ever had, but when I finally visited him, it just felt.. off. I felt like I was unwelcome, like, I've never felt so alien before, it was unsettling.. I realised, after that trip, that our story was over, and that if we were to ever met again, it would be those common reunions that I've seen happen between adults all the time, ""oh we haven't seen each other in a long time! how have you been? are you married yet? what work do you do? do you have any kids? ""  
we would never have late night conversations, we would never go for a walk to the store, we would never study together, we would never ask each other intriguing questions, it was over..

Too much drama, but you get the gist. I literally have no friends right now, I have no friends from my college, the only ones I chat with don't seem interested at all, I even deleted my instagram because I couldn't handle all these people hanging out and having a great time. is it because I'm a creep? is it because I'm perceived to be offensive? am I bashful? am I rude? I don't know.. I just.. need someone to talk to, It's been so long since I enjoyed a phone call, a late night chat with someone I cared about..

139,loki_odinsotherson,1627663923,1,"I dont know how to explain it all. I have two friends that I still talk to that are clearly not my friends. I have a gf. But shes always going through something and these days I find that theres just never time for me. 

It's my fault for sure. The two friends I was closest to had a falling out with me a couple years ago over something my gf said. My gf was just about to/just had surgery when this happened, so I let those friendships go to focus on her. 

Then of course we stare to develop issues...but she was still recovering from surgery and other complications so I pushed my issues to the back and thought ""we will deal with me later, her stuff comes first"".

Stupid.

Now it's been a couple years. So of course, that much harder to bring up stuff from before, and even harder to try and get back there. 

We've talked. Told her my side, how I feel, how I see things. She says she understands and wants the same. But then nothing from her. 

It makes it harder to talk about problems when shes my only friend right now. Both in bringing up the issue because I don't want to hurt her/make things worse, and because the only other person I talk to about my problems is me, and really, I give myself shit advice. 

The other two friends I talk to really only exist to shit on me or ignore me apparently. We have done the group chat for years now but if I say/ask something they just attack or dont respond.

One was asking about a home project and about to do move some heating vents. Literally the job I was in pre-covid. I told him how to hang them back up, how much space he had to have. Hes just ""fuck that wouldnt work"". 

So whatever. I just make a joke - ""hey man I had trouble with drywall plugs earlier so maybe ask someone else.""

No follow up, no questions, no lol, nothing. Just silence. I asked the other guy a direct question about something hes doing the other day, and nothing.

It's been like this for so long, and I only hang on to them because otherwise I would talk to literally zero other people besides my gf.

Most of the time it's easy to ignore or at least hide these feelings. Just been getting to me the last little while. Feels like the more I try to reach out, the more I get turned back.

Enter my favorite RN. I typically only see her when I'm coming in or leaving work so we barely interact... maybe a wave or a quick hello. Last night, she stopped by my office to chat for about 20 minutes. 

Now, I'm not delusional enough to think she has any romantic interest in me (she's 12 years my junior and well out of my league).

144,BroZAlpha,1627661552,1,"Hey dear friends, I’m gonna vent a little bit. Sorry for the long post.

I got born with a very rare muscle-disease called „SMA Type 2“. Because of this, I get weaker and weaker ever single day. Sitting within a wheelchair my whole life. When I was five years old I received my first electric wheelchair because I’ve already been to weak to move a wheelchair manually.

It kept going downwards constantly, day for day, week for week, month for month. Everyday feels so hard, so heavy. I feel like my body weights tons. Even seemingly small things like moving my finger to write this text are more and more impossible tasks to do.

Things you could do yesterday aren’t possible tomorrow. SMA takes everything. It’s like a genetic curse, a plaque. It’s unimaginable frustrating, indescribable painful to see how I get weaker and weaker every single day until I just die because my lungs will be too weak to breathe.

Eating, drinking, breathing, even speaking. Everything feels like a insuperable hurdle. I can’t go to university anymore. Also working isn’t possible, not even part-time.

I’m caged inside my own body.
I’m just physically too weak to live a happy life. That’s the sad fact. The undeniable truth.

My social life is… Don’t know. I got some really, really good friends. I see them every week multiple times and they are definitely one of the few reasons why I didn’t go insane already. But sometimes times I feel like an absolute outsider because I can’t do many things they easily can.
I can’t just go to the club with them, I can’t go to a place where stairs are at, I can’t even go on a spontaneous trip to the beach with them.

But the real problem is my love life. I had my last girlfriend at the age of 16.
Now I’m 23. I don’t even meet girls. How should I? I don’t go to work or university. I don’t have active social hobbies. I can’t do things that healthy people do, like joining clubs to met someone. I can’t do sport, can’t go to the gym.

I would love to date someone again, kiss someone again, touch someone again. This emptiness destroys me, it really does.

I just don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. Only even more sadness and loneliness…",lonely,Feeling so lonely because of disability.,2021-07-31 02:12:32

I live in the southern us, I’m tired of the same old person who talks for a day or so then never again. I’m looking for someone who is first of all not a catfish and has the same sense of humor kinda. Clingy would be cool but also understanding that I have work and sleep and will message when I can. I’m also not into playing message tag where we just talk for like 5 minutes a day. My sense of humor is sarcastic, crude, and dry, and I’m super tired of the LOL I LOVE THE OFFICE LOOK AT OFFICE TRIVIA type people. I mostly like watching horror movies, hanging out and playing video games, reading books, making references to things no one understands, playing old school games like Super Mario World and Earthworm Jim, but I also have a switch and ps4 and I’m down to co op something like the Scott Pilgrim game, Castle Crashers, or the Nintendo online classics, I also have other games just say what you play. Pokemon is also something that I think is super cool and I like to play Pokémon go. I have a dog and a bird and they’re  pretty chill, I also like reading and knowing interesting facts about the world we live in like that humans can only see and comprehend three colors, where butterflies can see six. I also like history a lot and I doodle which is cool. I don’t have a lot of hope in this post, and I’ve been going through some stuff lately and would like someone to talk to.

I love horror movies and morbid true crime documentaries

I currently play Runescape and League of legends EUW and potentially planning to potentially play New World when that comes out

in the past I've played stuff like Monster hunter, dark souls, bloodborne, nioh, god of war, final fantasy, resident evil games, pokemon, genshin impact, etc etc to give you an idea

weirdly enough part of me wants to fail to prove that love is pure and everlasting (i know it's not in few words chemicals brain 3-4 years on average) to prove that what we had was spacial indeed and I fear that if I succeed and prove that any human heat will do it will devalue it all and will leave me just wondering in the dark from one campfire to another never to find and see the sun

I used to know her from secondary school and we were talking occasionally when I was with my girlfriend. A month ago I tried committing suicide and a few days after I got home we started talking quite frequently via Instagram. 

A week ago she confessed she had feelings for me and we started getting close and a few days later we made plans to meet up.

I arrived at 10:00 she wasn’t there. I texted her to see when she was going to arrive and she said she’s feeling sick and asked if she is ok meeting up in an hour. I said it’s fine and I begun to wait.

I waited till 13:50 (1:50pm) for her and she wouldn’t answer my texts nor my calls. I phoned my father and he drove me home. At 18:00 she texted me and apologised for not showing up and she asked if I wouldn’t mind coming to her house and I agreed to go.

I arrived at roughly 20:30 and I went up to her bedroom. We snuggled up for a little bit and about twenty minutes into my one hour visit we started kissing a little which quickly turned into full on making out and a few minutes later I pulled up her shirt, took off her bra and then begun licking and sucking her breasts. I then started rubbing her clit for a few moments before getting back to her chest. This occurred over the coarse of the next 35 minutes I was there.

I left shortly after and then I went home

About half an hour after I got home she texted me and we talked for a little while then we both went to bed.

The next week went by and my feelings for her slowly grew stronger and fiercer.

Until the 28th of July came by and I texted her at 21:00 and I asked how she was and she said she was being hit on by a guy and she was feeling pretty good. I asked who, she said someone on Xbox and the conversation ended soon after.

I’ll summarise the conversation we had the next day. This took place at 12:30 after I replied to her story which said “when you keep hinting at him to post about you but he doesn’t”

I asked “who” she said “a friend” I asked which one she said why I said curiosity. She then told me who it was and then asked why again.

I asked how he was seeing as her replies were delayed and I was getting quite suspicious. She said what I then said “I’ll leave you alone” and said she said “ok if that’s what you want” I then said goodbye which she replied with “What happened between us was a mistake” which I said “I can see that” which she replied with “I am sorry” which I replied with “no point in that. Goodbye”

It’s now the 30th and I’m furious and heartbroken. All she had to say the night after we made out was to say she thought it was a mistake and just wants to stay friends and she didn’t even have to say it out loud or pick up a pen! Just smack a screen with her thumbs!

I’m certainly not talking to her again and I definitely don’t intend on doing so. I feel like a walking sex doll. I feel emasculated.

Sorry if I sound bitter. I just wished i never spoke to her in the first place. I had my first kiss and sexual encounter taken by someone too fucking quiet to communicate

The relationship with my BF was bad from the beginning, I think thats the reason why I started feeling so bad, I think he got fed up by me just dumping all my bad emotions onto him and not really being there for him. 
The same happend with my best friend I think, since I again was only crying at her all the time, especially after the breakup, and I otherwise not really there for her.

After almost 3 years of fighting tooth and nail to make it work, facing lifelong consequences, and spoiling what should be an unbreakable bond I decided to cut my losses and bail out on our investments.  

It was a rough decision to make and not an industry you can leave without consequences. However, I truly feel it was the right decision and the adult decision to make for both myself and him. 

That being said he feels wronged,  and that feeling is valid. I made my decision to change lifestyles with both our futures in mind but it does seem/look like I screwed him over. Maybe I did in some short-term fashion.

185,noclipgate,1627631666,1,"We'll call one Dee and the other Bee. So Dee moved in in June and was hardly ever home. She would be working long hours (voluntarily) or hiking for hours or out with friends in town. I wouldn't see her often and our conversations were good but then started to turn into roommate talk like ""oh I moved this here because"" and so on. I kind of brushed it off until Bee moved in. Bee moved in about a week ago. We had one long cool conversation and the rest was just passing by.

Dee and Bee have been spending a lot of time together without me. They knew each other from before, so I understand that they had already established something. Dee invited me once to go hiking, but she already knew I don't have the shoes for it. So it was kind of an empty invite and was literally as they were about to walk out the door. I didnt think that was fair because I had not had the chance to prepare or hydrate even if I did have the shoes. I heard them talking while they were waiting for Dee's friend Bry (male) to pick them up for hiking, that Dee said Bry wanted to go to dinner after but she complained that it would be too late. Dee then whispered to Bee that he wanted to go to dinner with me. 

Dee and Bee hung out all evening today working on Dee's car and cleaning their stuff in the garage. So they were laughing and stuff and I felt left out. I heard them planning on going hiking again tomorrow  with Bry and that they might be camping the night. 

I feel really left out, and I was not invited for the camping trip. I feel like Bee wants to sidewind me with Bry too. I just feel real lonely now and I feel like if I spend the money on shoes that it wouldn't be worth it cause they would probably mostly go without me anyway. 

Bee is a middle child and seems to have that middle child syndrome as an adult. She seems to be passively hogging other people from me and she is real assertive with her placement of things in the house. For example, I have a cat who has lived here for one year with me and his hammock hangs in the window. Bee has two cats, and put her cats' hammocks right over my cat's and now my cat cannot sit up in his. She jokingly said it's a stepping stool to the other hammocks now.

188,ICanNeverBeAWoman,1627630204,1,"I had a head injury like 9 years ago in a car accident. I was always a little bit of a ""weirdo"" but a popular weirdo. Girls liked me. I had friends and stuff. I struggled to hold down a job but I still did most of the time, but I always wanted to retreat out to the country, grow all of my own food and live self-sufficiently. Sort of like a hippie. So I had that ""anti-social"" streak in me to start with, but it wasn't dominant.

Then came the injury. In the years that followed I felt like a ""false being"" was being stripped away from me. Like I'd pretended to be something I really wasn't all my life, and I could no longer pretend anymore.

The first thing to go were my male friends. I wasn't ""cool"" to them anymore and they wanted nothing to do with me. These were people I'd grown up with.

For years though I still always managed to have some girlfriends around. I had become pretty ""emotionally unavailable"" so they were never anything more than sexual relationships, but over the last few years even that has changed. 

I'm so far out of the mainstream. My views, my attitudes, my eccentricities. I'm just so different from everyone else now that I've given up on finding a girl who can relate to me (sad because I'm much more 'emotionally available"" these days.

I feel like I'm on a raft drifting out into the ocean, farther and farther from land. I can still very barely see my family and all of my own friends through the looking glass of social media but for all intents and purposes they are gone forever. I know I'll never be able to relate to them or speak to them again.

And yeah, I don't even speak to my own family anymore. I'm ""too weird"" for them. I was never all that close to them anyway.

 First one was verbally abusive, second one was manipulative, and 3rd one only lasted 5 days because we were completely different people and we both saw that. 

I have been on one date since and it went nowhere. I'm incredibly shy and introverted and its hard for me to even talk to girls. The only reason I had girlfriends before is because they asked me out.

Every single time I have tried to open up to a girl they dont respect me and it hurts. Every time I've been too emotional and touchy.

I feel like giving up on love, but I'm so touch starved I can't. 

I long for love and touch so much. I think about it every day. I want someone to hold me so much.

 I've never been a cryer. I've been so emotional today. I just feel like crying my eyes out.

I really said I feel like ending it sometimes, and no one cares enough to keep me around with comforting words or... anything reassuring? Because what? They feel uncomfortable, or they don’t know how to react? Yet if it were them, when it’s them, who feel that way, I’m always jumping and scrambling to comfort them and stay by their side for as long as they need me to. But I can never get that same effort or care for the same. And maybe.. maybe that’s because me and them, we weren’t ever on the same wave length of friendship, sure..

It hurts most when it comes from your own mother who doesn’t know how to react so she doesn’t say anything at all. I’m asking for help, yet I get ignored in response.

228,so_say_we_all75,1627603510,1,"Guys, you have the right to feel bitter and hold a great deal of resentment in feeling rather peeved when women who message, they either state they're in a relationship but are willing to provide support. 

Let's be clear, a friendship isn't enough for a lot of guys. Whether they'd no longer tolerate being a potential beta orbiter to some woman or being inadvertently led on.... how the world works now is that a relationship ultimately matters. The only option to hope to be with a girl is to play the rigged game. Friendships come and ago but relationships don't.... supposedly. 

However, this DOES NOT give you the right to insult or belittle those who offered support. You can politely reject or even not respond at all to any messages from women who are in a relationship. And no, you don't have to write a long thesis blowing up to their reply. Just leave a short message saying ""Sorry, not interested"". Be as very brief as you like. What they offer isn't enough... and if isn't enough, then it isn't. Don't accept crumbs, whatever form they may be. 

Having been in a similar position of thinking I was a romantic interest to past guys, then blindsided with the ""can we be just friends?"" after finding that girl of their choice, I understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Girls... please have the sense of awareness that a lot of guys here are single, in fact, operate under the assumption that they are romantically lonely, at least, a majority of them. How would you feel if a guy messaged you, and you were romantically lonely/depressed... but they say they're in a relationship? Big punch to the gut right? 

If you're lonely because of the absence of friends or some marital problems with bf/hubs not spending time with you etc., then feel free to post and include your general circumstance so you can messages from people who are aware and will be fine with that. If you are lonely and just want to casually meet new people to stave off the loneliness, mention it as well but be aware that other people's depth of loneliness will be bigger than yours. If you do message, do it for a good reason.

I'll be frank, these people (male or female) will have the lingering possibility that they're not a priority in your life. Why invest talking to people when they're not as committed to you? Apart from shooting the shit, venting... being non-judgmental... that's really covering the bare minimum in confiding with someone. I see this all the time

I sat down but I didn't know anyone there, I was all on my own surrounded by strangers and no one paid any attention to me.

I would just sit outside and listen to punk rock, metal, alt, rap, pop, etc and remember how I would be teased and called ""whiteboy"" when I was younger. I enjoyed anime and video games (typical nerd shit) and was called ""game freak"" for it. I've always felt ostracized by my community which resulted in me isolating myself. I ended up making 1 good friend (but we stopped communicating when we went to different colleges).

When he was released they had a get together for him. He later got 2 women from my town pregnant despite his violent history being on display.

I showered daily (or my mom would send me to the Shadow Realm) and I wasn't weird just quiet.

Everyone I’ve trusted and opened up to has left me eventually and I can’t help but feel there’s something wrong, like I’ll never be enough for anyone. I know I’ve made mistakes along the way but seeing such strong bonds that all my friends seem to have, just makes me feel envious and empty. I would never wish for them to have no one, but I just wish I had someone. I’m coming to terms with it, just sometimes it hurts a little more than other days. Living sometimes just hurts so damn much that crying seems to be the only way to find numbness to take away the pain. If anyone else even sorta relates to this, I’m sorry cause this shit hurts so much.",lonely,Everyone has someone who will always choose them and it hurts that I don’t have that.,2021-07-29 23:50:13

They love cheating and they would rather be a piece of meat to a hot confident man than be a real partner to a ugly shy man. Women destroy most relationships because they constantly believe they can do better and will always keep looking. They truly hate men who don’t fit society’s standards.

They tried to pad their decision saying its just a difference in musical tastes. I don't mind really but after that incident, they started to not do other things with me that we usually do.

Empty looks, faces, even touches. I feel like I am always reaching, trying to be a part of their world, but nobody lends the hand I need to step in. I have family, friends, a lover even, but they all feel miles away. Hopelessly, I try to get back into their world, scratching the surface, but am met with a wall. Did they put that there? Did I? So instead I further isolate myself. Slowly drifting further and further within myself, hoping for someone to reach out. For someone who truly wants to connect with me, not just a fleeting acquaintance. Am I sabotaging my existing relationships through this isolation? Perhaps. But I am just so tired of being the one putting in all of the effort, feeling like I get nothing in return. So so tired of this life in disconnect.

328,StayOrThrowAwayy,1627534348,1,"This Sunday I received a call from my brother in law that my mother had fallen, broken her leg and that the paramedics were on the way. He said that he called so that I didn’t see anything on Facebook and freak out, and then ended the call. An hour later my sister called and said which hospital my mother was going to and that she’d pick her up and would spend the night at the house with her. On the call she kept having to take breaks saying who would drive which cars and who was going to watch and feed her 6 month old baby. It turns out they were at a local the trampoline park. My mother,  nephews, sister, her husband his mother and sister were all there and I didn’t get an invite. 

I volunteered to watch my mom and my sister said that she knows I have work “and so much going on” so I should just stay home. She knew that I was off from work the following 2 days and that I literally have no life outside of work or responsibilities. They were doing all this planning to take care of my mother when I should be the obvious one to watch her. I wish that this was the first time that I’d been an outcast but the same thing happened a while ago.  

3-4 years ago I received a text from my parents while I was at work that my sister was in the ER and was going to be going into surgery soon. She had a very random health emergency that required surgery. I left work early, sped across town, get to the hospital, and find out that my sister had been in the hospital for 10 hours already; she was there before I even went to work. Both my parents said that they’d forgotten about me until they sent me the text several hours later. It’s a few years later and it still bugs me. How can they forget to text their son when they only have 2 children?
 
I already hate myself because I have no friends, and these situations where my family forgets me or leaves me out makes it even worse. I call them and stay in contact with them regularly, but it seem like they intentionally try to exclude me. I’m honestly not a bad son or brother but it seems like my family only involves me when they absolutely have to in a semi emergency. And even then they’ll replace me in a heartbeat with a last minute substitute if they can. 

Those are just 2 examples out of the many where my family has pushed me out. I know that it was a massive mistake for me to attempt suicide 2 years ago. But every since then I can’t help but briefly thinking about whenever I feel like my family has ostracized me. It immediately makes me go to a super dark place. I’m already a friendless loser, but if my family forgets about me, there really isn’t any hope for me to have any kind of a happy ending.",lonely,On top of being a friendless loser I’m again reminded that my I’m an outcast from my family,2021-07-29 14:52:28

From that time, as soon as we are alone we can’t get each others hands off the other and one time I wanted to clarify thing between us, i told her that I always liked her more than a friend because I find her attractive with a strong personality. She replied the same thing but she didn’t want to lose me as friend.

Today, we talked about the same thing and she told me that she’s always thinking about her ex and he’s still trying to take her back (even if I think that he’s a psycho and he’s just trying to keep her close). I told her that she has to let it go and open a new book but she said that she didn’t want me to suffer which I fully respect and understand.

Whenever I feel close to getting one they end up feeling either shallow, or like betrayal. At some level, I am quite comfortable by myself BUT I need to share this with someone so that I can find a way to fix myself. I have no clue as to where to start. Ive visited serveral shrinks and two of them dismissed me (they just said that I was okay to move on), and one just looked bored and unamused from my life, when actually, its been pretty interesting despite my lack of controlling my feelings. I want to be able to shift from greys and see the whole spectrum of the rainbow again. 


And just to be clear, I love my life, I just CANT STAND how sensitive I am. I just cant find how to stand up on my own and take a sense of whats happening to me. When... theres actually nothing happening and everything seems to be awesome, my heart is just broken. It always has been. I think the reason is simple: I remember being 13 and hating myself. Well, at least now (at 35) I dont feel that way. Im just exhausted of not finding solace from that and maybe finding someone who says ""You know what? You seem kinda cool, Id want to grow old with you"", and tbh, I know that sharing my life with someone wont fix it, but I think that maybe Id have someone to talk to. 


How do I heal? 

This past year I stopped smoking and drinking. I worked my ass off physically and mentally. I ran my first half marathon. I (sorta) conquered my fear of heights by jumping off a 8 meter ledge into a lake. I rappeled a cascade, swam in a completely dark cave. Rode a mountain bike down an intense mountain trail. I once more learned to horseback ride (in just 3 months) and entered a competition where I did great (jumped 90 cms). I tried very hard to eat the right things to be healthy and I DID see some improvement, but by no means did that ""eerk"" feeling leave me. I got dopamine/euphoria highs that would last until I went to bed. Woke up each morning looking for a sugar rush in fruit and the contrast in bitter coffee. But after a while, even that looses its flavor. How can I move past that to something better?

Here’s the kicker; I make 27/hr in Michigan, and just started my own home care company with two employees. I spend money recklessly so it really doesn’t matter what money I make. Im always broke anyway. 

I guess it’s a vicious cycle of not wanting to go make new friends because im so terribly ashamed of where im at today. Broke and living at my parents house with no sense of discipline. I hate feeling sorry for myself but here I am.",lonely,Reminiscing on The Good Ol’ Days,2021-07-29 11:12:16
366,Kohwann,1627520687,1,"I mean yeah title says everything

Basically i'm a 20yo man, your typical shy and normal french guy.

I entered college during covid last year, i was a bit cringy at the time but met the girl of my dream which long story short rejected me...

But i was still proud of myself for having the confidence to talk to her even tho it was kind of messy

Since then i've realised some stuff like selfcare, loving yourself and all this lovey dovey crap. (funny how you hear this stuff everywhere everytime but never really understand it until you do.)

Anyway this girl cared about me when i was in a tough spot so i was, and still am, really grateful for it. That was the first time i received some kind of emotional support from a girl i liked, you sure must know i felt damn happy about this

But i knew i would never get to go beyond friendship...
I like to think i'm not the kind of person to be that sad about love stuff. Sadly like everyone esle, i am...  Even tho, i tried to see the brightside of things and i guess i succeded 

She taught me honesty toward other but also myself and based on that i took some decisions to improve my life.

Firstly, i always hated myself for having fake friends. You know the feelings when you're a freshman in school, highschool, college or whatever and you would accept any friendship that comes to you just because you don't wanna be alone ? Yeah that was me and i'm not proud of it...

Anyway i cut ties with them cause i wasn't really intersted in them as people, but i mostly needed to take drastic actions to change my life and that was the first step.

I hated my body so i started doing sports
I hated my face so i tried to improve it
I hated the way i isolated myself so i began to go out more
I hated being broke all the time so i started working this summer

At the time of writing this, i'm proud of myself, not perfect but i have somewhat of a stable life.

I know it all sounds like a big flex but i just wanted to say that, comming from a past sad depressed ass weirdo, it's possible guys, it's doable, you can do it too.

I'm not the happiest man in the world but i'm happier than ever and that's what matters.

Please try to improve yourself !",lonely,It's getting better...,2021-07-29 11:04:47

Life never turns into that pretty picture we've fabricated. Still, we relentlessly hold onto that thought. 

We idolize things, people most of all. We think of them as angels. The few we hold dear anyway. And we miss them, and we want to be with them. But when the inadequacies of reality set in, we realize that couldn't have been the answer.

There's never some poetic narrative, some priceless values we have learnt from others. We're growing on the soil of other people's ideas, of course, but that's the end of it. 


Ideas. That's all. Our own creation, based on our own perception. Those other people, they can't do anything for us. They can't help us. As soon as there's an idea, it spreads. All we need is a spark.

And these ideals we have in mind, maybe it's best to keep them. To keep the illusion of the ideal person burning. That illusion is always falsified by memory.

379,VeganPhilosopher,1627516175,1,"I was late last night when I found myself on the Confessions Subreddit. I briefly looked through some of the posts when I read one by a young man whose girlfriend had recently committed suicide.

My heart wept for him when I read his post. He was clearly going through a lot of pain.

I communicated that I felt for his situation and was available to talk whenever he wanted to. He had a lot of commenters on his post showing support. I was surprised when a few moments later he DM'd me.

He introduced himself and started to tell me about his experience. It really was a lot to take in. I expressed my sympathies several times. I felt slightly awkward talking to a stranger about so many personal things across the small reddit direct message box. It was my first time having a serious discussion with someone on this site.

I felt more nervous the more he opened up. I realized how much weight was placed on me. He completely opened up his life/his pain to me: a complete stranger. I realized that all I had to do was say the wrong thing and I could hurt him deeply.

I did my best to mimic the speech of some counselors I had in the past. I asked him if he was feeling suicidal. If he had any friends or support in his life currently. I encouraged him to speak to the suicide hotline if he was in a dangerous situation. He told me that wasn't an issue and we continued to talk.

I told him I felt honored to be speaking with him, and I really did. He was going through real tragedy and in the face of it he continued to show a fervor for life and optimism for a happy future. He inspired me.

I stood up rather late talking to him taking in all he had to share.

Due in part to this, I slept in til about noon today. I was feeling both physically and emotionally drained. It took everything in me to complete my daily workout.

When I woke up I saw that he messaged me. Feeling tired I decided I would open it later and went about my day as usual. Around 6 pm my day started to settle down and I decided I'd respond to his message. I saw that he had deleted his account. I'm not sure why he did this.

Maybe he lost the desire to talk to strangers about his life. Perhaps he felt ashamed for posting so much personal information online.

At any rate he deleted his account, and I may never speak to him again.

I wonder if he really wanted to speak to me that moment he texted me.

I wonder if he felt I ghosted him, in the same fashion that so many people have ghosted me. No matter how many times it happens to me... It still hurts. I wondered if he was hurt that I didn't read his message sooner.

I often feel so sad that I have no friends or people who care about me. Yet, when the time comes for me to be a friend to somebody else, to show love to somebody else...

Anywho, while I was dealing with all that I stopped reaching out to friends for a brief period given if I wasn't helping my mom, I was passed out.

I have no one to hang out with (apart from girls I meet on Hinge/Bumble, but that just doesn't feel genuine), and most of my time is spent alone.

I'm a 20 years old male at the time I'm writing those lines. And the title pretty much says it all. 

I was born a handsome kid. I still am. And it gets better every year. It's not to brag. It's called the genetics lottery. Luck. I didn't really choose this. 

But as you will see, it's been quite useless to me so far. 

Except at the beginning. In elementary school, everything was great. Those were the best years of my life, hands down. I was the most popular kid. Everybody loved me, including the girls. Tons of friends. Invited to birthday parties. Having fun all the time. This kind of shit. And it's been this way for several years. 

Until high school. 

Until it all went downhill. 

The reason? 

An accident that occurred when I was...I don't know
how old I was in fact. I don't even know HOW it occured, that's to say. 

But in short, I lost a testicule, and my penis became very bent as a consequence. 

Not usual indeed. Fucking weird actually, and from there, you might wonder what it has to do with my downfall. 

Well, you see how so many guys are insecure about their penis not being large enough or whatever?

Girls? Forget about it man. You can't even have sex. They're going to laugh at your face.

Friends? Why not, but only the ""outcasts"" then. Cause if you start becoming popular, girls will be all over you, and you will have to refer to the previous rule again and again.

Telling your parents and solve the problem? No way. They don't even give a shit about you, and they never did. Look at how they failed your brother! Moreover, you are too scared to show yourself to the world...

You understand where this is going. As soon as this burden weighted on my shoulders, my life started to fall apart, and the happy kid I used to be was gone in the blink of an eye. 

I was just a shell of my former self at that point, isolating myself ON PURPOSE to avoid getting humiliated because I wasn't ""normal"". 

I know it might seem dumb. All of this for a penis problem. 

But for a guy, I'm telling you: it crushes you. 

At least it crushed me. Maybe you would have dealt with it differently, but for me, it was soul crushing. 

I became lost. My self-esteem was very low. And depression was my new friend. My only one, since nobody cared anymore. 

Girls were still coming, but they quickly moved on when they saw I wasn't interested. I WAS! I...I just couldn't do more than talking with them, and I had to fake indifference all the time. I'm sure people thought I was gay or something.

I ""dropped out"" of high school at the age of 18 years old, right before the end of it, cause I couldn't take it anymore. By dropping out, I mean stopping to intend classes. It was too much to bear. Sometimes I could find myself tearing up in class, trying to hold back as much as possible.

I still got my high school diploma, but I had nobody to share this with. Everybody was happy, celebrating with their friends. Me? I left immediately and started to walk back home. Nobody noticed it. And when they were all partying at the end of the year, I was home alone, probably crying. They sure didn't even think about me. 

(I'm French by the way. So this high school stuff might have been different for you, but whatever).

From there, I was left with nothing. I lost all my friends long ago, my future looked bleak, I was still virgin in every way, and I was asking myself what the Hell was next for me. 

This is just a fraction of the entire story. But yeah, tons of tears have been shredded, and I've went through a lot of pain.

We talked about ""luck"" early on. Damn it. God is such a joker, I swear. Making me a handsome man, but dealing me a bad hand by destroying everything that could allow me to potentially enjoy it. 

I got into self improvement during teenage years, so I wasn't your typical depressed lonely dude who can't even get himself out of bed. No, I had goals and some sort of a purpose. I wasn't completely lost, to be honest with you.

But overtime, it felt more like a way to cope with my wasted teenage years. It made me feel like I was doing something with my life, when in reality, all I ever wanted was to go out with some friends and feel loved, for once. 

And when I found myself at the end of high school, wondering what was next for me, it was in that regard. 

Like, will I ever be able to have a girlfriend? To feel intimate with somebody? To have friends again? To be happy?

All these things haven't changed, and I'm 20. 

I'm still living with my parents at the moment. No friends. The few ones I have are on the Internet. No girlfriend. No fun. Nothing. All I do is working on my goals in silence and having stupid crushes on fictional girls, cause I don't even interact with anybody anymore.

Only with my parents and brother, if I can call it ""interacting"". 

I basically stay home all day (except when I'm running) trying my best to improve my life during the day and imagining myself cuddling a cute girl in my fucking dreams, because that might be the only place I could ever do it. 

What a sad life I'm leading seriously.

And when I thought my parents and everybody else viewed me as a brilliant kid back then, thinking I would go far in life...

Little did they know I would turn that way. A fucking disappointing failure, that's all I am.

You know, I always thought my biggest fear was to not accomplish my goals. 

But it's false. My biggest fear is to accomplish my goals and still have no one to tell about it. 

Yet I keep going, staying somehow hopeful and battling my loneliness on a daily basis, cause I don't want to die either.

And when it's too much, I just cry my eyes out while hugging my teddies, just to stop feeling unloved, even for a second. 

Cause who knows if I'll ever make it...",lonely,"When you were supposed to be the ""popular kid"" but ended up being a lonely piece of sh*t.",2021-07-29 05:51:35

404,edsnake2,1627500589,1,"At the begining of June I (24M) met a really sweet girl (24F) on Hinge who I connected with on so many levels. Within the first few messages we already planned to meet which turned out to be  the best first date I’ve ever been on. We got along so well and continued to see each other until early July. One Saturday evening after I left her place everything seemed off. Her messages weren’t as flirtatious nor did she seem that interested in talking as before, up to this point there were no red flags. We went a pub the following Wednesday and right before she left for home she sat me down on a bench and said that the ‘spark’ was gone. 

I kinda saw it coming but was not expecting this answer at all. I asked her if I did anything wrong to which she replied no. She said I had been a gentleman and done everything right but that it was just gone. This made my heart physically ache since that past Saturday we had talked about our future plans for the following months and how estatic we were to have found each other. I thought she was as comitted as I was. 

That was three weeks ago and I still feel crushed by the whole experience. It’s brought about feelings of loneliness and expendibility that have never reached this level before. I hate being on my own at the moment yet even when I’m with my flatmates I still feel somewhat isolated. Yesterday when I was alone I got so worked up I started physically shaking and felt like I couldn’t breathe. I feel like it was my fault for this happening but I never got a clear answer so now I’m stuck constantly replaying everything in my head to try and figure out what went wrong. I have been through a lot of tough situations in my life which make this whole thing feel so trivial, especially for as short as it lasted, yet it seems to have broke me more than anything else.

Someone from my job hugged me a few days ago after she saw me sitting by myself and she rested her head on my shoulder.

It felt so good it made me feel so happy. Then I got back home and realized how lonely I truly am if just a simple hug which most people get dozens of weekly or even daily made me feel that good. I've been shaking and thinking of how I just want to be touched again like being addicted to something and thinking of how to just get high again.

PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE IF YOU HAVE NO PLANS OF MOVING OFF THIS APP, ARE UNDER 18, OR ARE A COUPLE 


I live in the southern us, I’m tired of the same old person who talks for a day or so then never again. I’m looking for someone who is first of all not a catfish and has the same sense of humor kinda. Clingy would be cool but also understanding that I have work and sleep and will message when I can. I’m also not into playing message tag where we just talk for like 5 minutes a day. My sense of humor is sarcastic, crude, and dry, and I’m super tired of the LOL I LOVE THE OFFICE LOOK AT OFFICE TRIVIA type people. I mostly like watching horror movies, hanging out and playing video games, reading books, making references to things no one understands, playing old school games like Super Mario World and Earthworm Jim, but I also have a switch and ps4 and I’m down to co op something like the Scott Pilgrim game, Castle Crashers, or the Nintendo online classics, I also have other games just say what you play. Pokemon is also something that I think is super cool and I like to play Pokémon go. I have a dog and a bird and they’re  pretty chill, I also like reading and knowing interesting facts about the world we live in like that humans can only see and comprehend three colors, where butterflies can see six. I also like history a lot and I doodle which is cool. I don’t have a lot of hope in this post, and I’ve been going through some stuff lately and would like someone to talk to.

I don't know which subreddit it so pardon me if I'm posting it on wrong subreddit and please recommend me the right subreddit. Thank you. And also, this is the first time I'm reaching out for help on any kind of platform or even a therapist, so please be gentle. Thank you. So, my problem started of being left out started just few months back. Since middle school I was an introvert and I never took effort in meeting people and socializing and also had social issues so I probably never had friends. So, everything that friends did like hanging out and doing all the stupid stuff was never part of my teenage life and it sometimes bothered me. But it never affected my life to such an extent. Then I entered college and classes were online due to this whole COVID situation, I started socializing a bit and made a bunch of friends, but they were like the casual friends to me and we there were times I would be just absent as I have these depressive episodes where I’m depressed. In mid-December of 2020 I met this girl with whom I established friendship and we ended up dating. Yeah, she’s my gf and also my best friend and I love her and look my future with her and she also has same level of feelings for me and it won’t be much to say that’s she’s a blessing for me. And I kid you not us dating was least expected yet we did as situations was right. So, the problem begins here where she isn’t there. Even online. She is a social bird and she has friends and healthy relationships with her family. And I’m on the other side just plain lonely. I don’t even have proper relations with my parents, I didn’t even talk to my dad for like 2 days even when we live under same roof. My depression or whatever phase I had (won’t be assuming it depression as I didn’t go under proper treatment) had made me lose interest in everything like watching movies or gaming or any form of recreation. She on the other hand has things she likes to do like watching and movies etc. When she is busy with her other stuff I get lonely and we barely meet and this frustrates me, depresses me gets me lonely feeling. And things just got worse in 3rd semester (current semester) as our academics got harder and we decided that our daily night video calls we have for 3-4 hrs have to be seized to zero and keep them limited to weekends. We live like 200km away so we can’t meet every weekend, even every month. We both understand the importance of career and I want to work on it too but I can’t I am not sane that I do weird stuff when I’m having that phase, like touching myself in such a way that it feels some other person is touching me or talking to myself. She can effortlessly continue for her career and movies and all that it feels like she isn’t even serious about me. But I know that’s not the case and its that feeling that made me fight her often times. I am dependent on her, probably a bit too much and I agree to that fact. I just want to remove this too much dependence on her I can’t deal with this constant loneliness, being left out and other the feelings I feel get and want to work on my career too. I know I’m a bit too demanding that’s why I don’t tell her to make changes, its me who wants to change things. And I tried stuff like gaming but it just couldn’t replace the feeling of talking to her or her being on video call. I still have these ghosting phases where I don’t talk to anyone but I talk to her, I just can’t keep her on the same page where I keep everyone.",lonely,I know I'm a demanding bf still I need some help,2021-07-28 21:54:15

I don’t know, I feel like even if I tell people they won’t believe me. I’ve always known I’m a loner but I thought I was alone not lonely. The realization that I’m lonely hit me recently. Everyone else when going back, usually have a final hangout with their friends and just a decent a send off. I don’t have anyone to tell I’m leaving or ones that actually care much from what I can tell. 

On top of this I’m 18 and never been in a physical relationship even though I crave that kind of intimacy. Or if I could not have a happy relationship I wish I had close friends, the sort that are there for you at the worst points in your life and celebrate your accomplishments with you, but honestly I doubt I’ll ever have those kind of friends.
My ex best friend during an argument told me I’m a loner who can’t make friends or even keep them. Honestly it’s kinda hurts but he had a point. You need to be open and honest in any kind of relationship but I have a hard time being open and sharing stuff from my life

In total, 4 of us left the larger group to a park where we were supposed to smoke. What ended up happening was that me &amp; this other guy were getting set up to get robbed. I ended up fending for myself &amp; getting away while the other guy wasn’t so lucky. Another reason which created the solid foundation of not being able to trust anyone.

468,throwaway424253,1627452567,1,"TW: Mentions of self harm

I moved cities (and schools) last year. New school, new friends, a fresh start. Kinda looked forward to it too, most of the people in my previous school were horrible. They actively made me feel bad, talking crap about me, spilling my secrets, making plans right in front of me and not include me, the works. I guess I had myself to blame too, I wasn't exactly interesting or fun like other people.

Well, fast forward a few months, I had this sudden burst of loneliness. I couldn't really understand why, I made a few friends, I was doing fine until, well, I wasn't. Heavy pain on my chest, disinterest in things I like to do, and my head fumbling with the thoughts that no one would ever want to talk to me. 

These ""bursts"" came and went. But soon, they started happening frequently. It went from three months in between, and now it feels like its always there. Whatever I do, I felt I was wrong, and people judged me for it. When it came to my social circles, everyone else all had their friend groups. I did too (with like 3 other people), but more often than not, I felt ignored. I did have friends outside this group, but others only text me when they need something like notes. No one has a casual conversation with me. Those who do have one are infrequent (I don't mind slow texts, people got crap to do, but they do have time to text others, why am I left out?), and it feels like they don't enjoy talking to me. I also feel insecure about myself, my personality, appearance, the like.

I couldn't cope with all this stress. It's my final year in school, so I also have the pressure of getting them grades. Everything feels like its collapsing on me, and I have no one to turn to. Video gaming used to be a coping method, but soon it couldn't distract me from what I was going through. I tried various coping methods, but I couldn't stop myself from cutting. The guilt from that is a whole different story.

I don't even know if any of this is a valid problem. Is this just self pity? Am I making it up all for attention? I know, it's a dumb question to ask, but honestly, I genuinely don't know what I'm feeling. Should I reach out for help. I don't want to look like (or be) an attention seeker. What if people don't even care, call this self pity, and move on?

Another Saturday night
Another fucking shitty Saturday night

I'm spinning in the next room
Slurring along to my isolation
At the top of my lungs
I'm sitting here next to you
Sore throat from jokes about all the dumbest things I've done
I don't want to be anywhere at all
Here or at my house kicking at the wall

If home is where the heart is
Then I live in my upper chest
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm gonna drink tonight until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer

The bottles are stacked like they show how we're different
And that maybe if we were sober we could explain what this all meant
But pints of Vodka don't write poetry
You can't rearrange crushed pills into melodies
But I swear to fuck;
That a brick through a broken Starbucks window means more
And I swear to fuck;
That we fight more systems when we're passed out on the floor
Than the words of Kropotkin ever could
And all the works of Karl Marx ever fucking could

I'm puking in the next room
Sorry about the carpet
Clean it up or your mom'll be mad
I'm pretending that I'm too good for you
So you can't see the worthless pathetic person I am

Better to seem like an asshole
Than what you are
The billionth teenage boy with social problems
Who plays the guitar

I'm not sure what I want you to say to me
But I know the look on your face that I want to see

If home is where the heart is
Then mine is a cigarette
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm gonna drink tonight until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm not you and that's good enough for me
The only word that I use is fuck
So you can forget the dictionary

I can't tell what question you're asking
I don't care 'cause no is my answer

Another Saturday night
Against everything on a Saturday night

I'm bleeding in the next room
Let it happen 'cause maybe the blood-loss will add to my high
I'm here beating up on you
'cause I'm just drunk enough to be sure that I'm ready to die

I don't care that you don't care that I don't care
The only card game I know is strip solitaire

If home is where the heart is
Then I got evicted this week
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer

Over the past two days on two different occasions, I've been just walking around my house. Suddenly, I've stopped in my tracks ( even when in the middle of doing something) and have felt extremely anxious. I start to rub something, the first day it was a fork, and the second it was my shirt, I rub it feverishly I assume to try and feel better. This never works and I start to feel a sense of dread overcoming me. I begin to cry for maybe 30 seconds, only a drop or two comes out, and then I eventually calm down a little bit and start to ground myself. The anxiousness and dread are still here just not as dominating. I'm scared that I might have a mental illness, my Father and all his brothers suffer from it. I just don't know what to do, I can't talk to anyone in my family because I'm too scared that it will cause it to become more real than it already is.

The first few times I was always looking to make friends, it also helped that I was still younger. But after moving a million more times and into cities where the people were much less friendly I gave up and would always just be on my own. Grades 11 and 12 I would eat lunch by myself everyday, never knowing what to do and often just sitting on the stairs on my phone or something. I'm a 5'11 female and due to my quietness people usually think I'm either intimidating or weird. I have major social anxiety and anxiety in general so that probably doesn't help. I don't get along with my family. And I don't really have aunts or uncles or grandparents who we don't have a restraining order against or who aren't dead. I graduated alone. Watching everyone else with their friend groups taking group pics was horrible. Never went to any parties. Don't even remember the last time I went to a birthday party or a stay the night type thing. I'm an introvert as well, so my routines from day to day are basically the same. I have a job, but it's at a dealership and I'm literally the youngest and only female in the shop so I can't really make friends in there other than having friendly coworker conversations with the 28 year old+ guys.

For my peace of mind I'd like to explain that I'm never rude, and I always try to show kindness to everyone I talk to.

This is my first time posting so I'm not so sure how it works, but anyway. Something happened a few weeks back that really pushed me down into the dumps again.

I work with this guy around my age who is quite extroverted and loud. He invited me to go out in the break with him, so I went with him and we talked for a bit. And then we somehow got onto the topic of friends. He asked me how many friends I have, which no one has ever bothered to ask me before. I was too afraid to say that I don't have any, so I just said I have 10 friends that I talk to every now and then. ..He laughed and told me that that is an extremely small amount of friends, and then proceeded to show all his ""friends"" in his contact list, which was about 300. He avoids me now.

It made me feel miserable and lonely again. This is why I am afraid of people, the feeling of being judged and the feeling of rejection. I truly hate this world. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear, but its not that easy. And besides, I'm learning how to draw, because that makes me happy.

Basically title. I've always been a loner and thought that it wouldn't bother me but now as i'm starting to enter adulthood, it's becoming physically painful.

I'm far from alone in the physical sense, i have family and a social group around me, but that's what hurts me the most, i do not connect deeply with people around me, i can't be completely myself around them. This led me to distance myself from people, with my parents i'm very emotionally closed off because whenever i slightly open up, it is not welcomed. And with my friends i just completely stopped hanging out with them.

I always thought ""oh happiness comes from within, you shouldn't wait for someone to come in your life and make you happy"" and while i still believe this to be true to some extent, I deeply long for someone who i can truly be myself around, and that loves for me it, and for which i do the same.

But after meeting people and never connecting with them, i'm coming to the realization that this is very unlikely to happen.

I know it was for the best because she never respected my boundaries or treated me with respect but it hurts because I don't have any other close friends. I also got dumped. He was my first love and even though the relationship wasn't the best towards the end, I thought we were working through it together because that's what he told me. In the end, he broke it off because he fell out of love months before and decided to keep it going for the sex.

Almost three months ago, I moved across the country for an internship that I feel fiercely underqualified for. I got the opportunity through a professor's recommendation but I lack experience and am extremely intimidated by my coworkers. It's to the point where I sabotage my own productivity. For example, here I am writing this post in the middle of the workday instead of working on the large assignments on my plate. Also, it's a remote position so I have not met anyone since I've been here. 

I'm so lonely that despite how he treated me, I asked my ex for a booty call earlier today. It's not because I want it, I'm just so desperate for interaction and attention from someone who at least used to care about me. He said he would think about it and get back to me.

551,CitySlick_RedNeck,1627412272,1,"So, I'm going to explain a bit first, before I get into it.

I'm 26 years old. I have chronic depression, ADD, slight trauma and ptsd from childhood, and trust issues to accompany all that.

I've only ever had 1 girlfriend, who cheated on me after 5-6 months of verbal and emotional abuse and took advantage of my kindness and desperation for affection at the time. That was 6 years ago.

Since then, I lost one potential long distance girlfriend to cancer, and every other time I've had the courage to try and open my heart to love, the girl I end up liking is either turns out to be a lesbian, or is already happily taken.

So, it's a safe bet to say, I either have 0 luck, or there just isn't anyone out there for me. (Don't say there is. I know, it just doesn't feel like it after 6 years of effort and prayer.)

But here's what has me really down today.

You see, I play a certain MMO and I've joined a really awesome group and community of people and I really have fun with them. The problem comes with a philosophy of mine and something I've been feeling more and more of.

1. Treat others the way you wish to be treated by them.
2. ADD enhanced loneliness.

You see, I make it a point to go a few friends everyday, wish them a good day or ask how they're doing. I  honestly do want them to have good or even great days. Especially if they've had it rough lately.

I am also an extremely caring person,  so I really do want to make sure my friends are feeling okay, and if not, I do my best to help them out. Even making a fool of myself just to make them laugh a bit.

But, it's been a while that I've been part of these groups and community... and I feel like no one cares enough to ask me how I'm feeling or if I'm okay. I always alternate which friends I talk to each day, making sure my friends know I care. Mostly because I know I wouldn't be able to handle them all at once.

But I have only ever gotten 1 who asked how i was, and that was when I joined...

I more than understand that everyone has a life and can't always be on the phone. But I'm just saying; is it really too much to ask that 1 or 2 of them checks up on me randomly a week. I talk to rough 40 people I can friends and help as best I can... but I don't even get ""have a good day."" In my dms or in game mail at a random time.

I'm always happy to help them with whatever they need in game, and I try my best to hang out and accept their invites when they send them. I don't ask for anything in return for my help because helping my friends makes me happy.

But is it really so much to ask 1 person to randomly say; ""Hey. How are you today?"" Or ""Hope you have a good day. Take care.""",lonely,I guess it's just too much to ask for...,2021-07-28 04:57:52

All I see is everyone elee living their lives while I have been stuck in the same position for years with no help. Whenever I see a couple togerher it really effects me because I have never had anything like that and I realized that other people do not care what you're goinf through, as long as they feel good they are content to ignore you. I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently. I watched as the years went by and everyone else in my family found a partner and got married. While other people found love I was here alone and I still am. 

This entire situation has had a terrible impact on my mental state. These days all I find myself doing is wasting the rest of my limited time and sleeping. When everyone else talks about their interests and hobbies all I can think of is oh that's nice, I wish I could afford to go out and do fun things. But since I don't have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay. 

Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there's no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I don't feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while.

You call your best friend up.. and hear.. number not in service. You forgot. Smh Then there’s no one to talk to at all. Your older than everyone around you. You still look young though. You still get carded. Can’t believe how old you are. Some say, get a pet. So you go get a ESA. Emotional Support Animal. Some, most choose a small dog. I have a cat. Around 19 years old now.

566,bleedingsoul990,1627404515,1,"Warning: Long! Sorry...

I don't exactly know where to post this so I went here. Things haven't been the same for me since she decided to end things on ""good terms"" with me 2 months ago. Means she had decided to stop texting or seeing me again. We were in a long distance friendship for 1 year and a half. Lived thousands of miles apart. I do have feelings for her but she gave me mixed signals. Got rejected a few times for a relationship.

I don't know where to start but I met this girl about a year and half ago from 7cups, an online counselling website with most users being random normal people and very little professionals. The listener/venter stuff. I was going through rough periods in my life and desperately needed someone to talk to. I went to the site and clicked a button to connect me to a random listener. I was expecting a trained professional to show up but that's not the case. Instead, this girl, let's call her Sue, answered me. I was skeptical of the whole thing but I went with the flow anyways and, for the first time in my life, opened about my life issues to a random internet stranger. I needed to vent and would love some insight on how to deal with my life problems. She tried to help me and offered an advice. At the time I was unemployed for 9 years after college and rarely went out of house, overweight, depressed and mentally ill. 

We were able to become good friends on the first day and got along well for some reason. I did not expect to be able to talk to her again on the second day. She said she look forward to chat with me again on the next day but I didn't believe that since I found myself to be a boring person and who would find me interesting? Sure enough, I came back not expecting her to show up but she did. 

We could talk for hours on end about anything. Some days we talked from night until the next morning! I don't know why but it's great to have someone out there that doesn't judge and and ""get me"". I don't really have much to offer in conversation but that's fine according to her. Tbh, I do feel lonely since I don't really go out and contact my old irl friends for a long time. But our friendship is not without it's downsides. Misunderstandings do happen, quite a lot actually. Differing views and opinions. One of us tend to leave conversations and go to bed early due to that. It's the worse when the pandemic came about, both of us were stressed out and she tend to act negative at times when she's on her period. I'm no better person and am negative. Most of them do stem from my anger issues and negativity due to my rough home life. Thinking back I regretted giving in to my emotions and lashing out too often whenever I'm annoyed at her. Plus, I'm bad at listening and I find I tend to vent a lot and talk about my sorry life more than listening to her. But she preferred to listen to me and don't really prefer sharing much about her life and get slightly annoyed at me about why I don't really listen to her or her life. But, I tried my best to help her with homework, exams and essays. Even giving her life advice. I tried to be there for her and being too helpful sometimes. 

Sometimes when I showed up late or couldn't be there for her at certain hour she would just behaved sorta like a child in an annoyed manner and sent me crying emojis. Too often it made me guilty. She tend to apologize a lot whenever she's late or can't be there for me, which I find strange. The first time it happened was when she said she would come back a moment later only to show up hours later, which annoyed me a bit but I didn't expect her to apologize.

I started to have feelings for her a few months in but didn't have the courage to confess. I find her to be not just attractive but smart. She reads a lot. She owned a copy of psychology book she read and showed it to me, to which I have nothing interesting to say about. It wasn't until she started mentioning in a worrying tone that she really likes me and started telling me what is she supposed to do about it that I started to feel different. I suffered from low self esteem nearly all my life. I thought I would never had a girlfriend and will be single until old. I started asking when was the first time she felt this way to which she said she had no idea. That made me confused and a bit annoyed.

Ever since then I find myself feeling frustrated at times in a conversation with her. I can't remember what I said but she replied ""You never asked me to be your girlfriend..."". She's right. I wasn't being direct and upfront about my feelings. I was scared of rejection. And she rejected me anyways a few times I mentioned if she's interested in a bf/gf relationship. That hurts. Not an easy pill to swallow. It lead to further misunderstanding and arguments, which mostly stems from my immaturity. Many times I threatened to leave and seek to end our friendship since I have feelings for her and I couldn't be platonic anymore. I did leave. But I came back. Each time. That was dumb. I probably look stupid to her. I just didn't know what to do anymore. It felt terrible seeing her again. But the feeling will soon fade. She was single and I was hoping for her to change her mind one day. It never happened. Whenever she excitedly told me about the stories of her talking to attractive guys where she lived and admired and sort of attracted that she sent gifts during school events, that didn't bode well with me. I felt jealous and sorta told her to not see those guys again, in a negative tone. She called me out on it, saying I was being controlling despite not being in a relationship with her. She's right. I'm really not proud of what I said or did.  

Eventually things start to change a little bit. We found ourselves in sort of weird state of friendship. I don't even know how it happened, but we started flirting. Or sexting. We talked about stuff like sex and all that. This happened for months and in-between she never wanted to be in a relationship with me whatsoever. One day I sort of get too frustrated with the whole thing and told her about it, to which she told me that she would maybe in a relationship with me perhaps years into the future unless she's not single and if I still want her. For some reason that comforted me, or maybe she said that to comfort me. Anyways, awkward situation diffused. I know what type of man she wants. 

If it wasn't for her I wouldn't even try to get myself employed. She started sending me a job vacancy ad from where I lived. I enlisted for employee support program many months before but it didn't work out due to pandemic. So I was stuck at home again and being negative like usual. But not this time, I actively job hunted despite how unpleasant it felt and found a job. Interviewed and got the job. In the long run it wasn't for me and I quit a short while. A brief free time socializing with Sue in a span of one month. I can afford to purchase a phone and we started video calling and doing phone calls. There's ""flirting"", we gave audible kisses and competed to be the last one to say ""good night"" and ""bye"" before ending our calls each night. But life got in the way unfortunately. She needed to focus on her studies and focus on her final exam. Gave her too much anxiety. She told me that we both shouldn't talk again. Her parents pressured her to study and do well. I was disappointed and told her we should talk still but not much anymore to which she agreed. 

Meanwhile I got called for another interview and got an okay job. But I felt lonelier since because Sue was too busy to even reply to my ""hi"" message. I just wanted to know how she was doing and she didn't have time to type a few words to reply back. Months later her finals were over and I couldn't be happier. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. I'm not proud of how needy I was during this time when she barely messaged me back. One time I kept messaging and calling her when she doesn't reply at all other than ""hi"". To the point of harassing... which I didn't mean to. I believe she was recovering from the finals and needed time to relax. But I failed to understand that. I should have let her do what she wants, letting her play with her phone, or watch youtube, instead making it all about texting me, like before. Things change, people change and I didn't realize that back then. She's annoyed and overwhelmed. That's not the only thing she's overwhelmed with. She's overwhelmed with my neediness, in terms of relationship. Whenever I talked about my possible future with her, it made her frustrated. She pointed out how overwhelmed she felt. I honestly couldn't stand myself when I think back. I regretted it so much now. I tend to get upset whenever she claimed she doesn't see a future with me and doesn't aspire to be my girlfriend. My response was usually to remind her about the ""she would maybe in a relationship with me perhaps years into the future unless she's not single"" to diffuse the conflict, or agree to disagree tsk tsk \*shakes head\*

Anyways, fast forward to end of April and I started noticing she hasn't messaged me for a day or two. Messaged her to which she replied one word or two. Long silence. Messaged her again, a lot of times since she ignored them. Finally, she said she was anxious due to covid casual contact after coming back from a mall with her friends. I comforted her saying it happened here to one relative of mine and she turned out okay. So, I said she will be fine dont worry. She replied gratefully with tears of relief. But that's about the conversation of the day. I have my own things to do instead of messaging her, but something's seems lacking. Last year, I remember I kept feeling bad whenever I have my own stuff to do and kept seeing her so late at night to which she complained I should have come earlier since bed time's near.

It doesn't get any better the following week. I couldn't stand my manual labor job and decided to quit after 7 months while at the same time I haven't seen Sue for 3 days. Took me days to sign the papers, depressed about quitting, and eventually I decided to message her days after. To my shock and disappointment, she met a new guy which is her boyfriend. She hold off from telling me because she knew it would break my heart and hurt me. She would have ghosted me. My reaction wasn't that great, I was continuously upset messaging her and kept asking about her boyfriend. How they met and who he is. She was reluctant at first, but gave in and told me. However, I didn't pressure her to tell me anything personal about him.

I went the crazy route and started mumbling whatever messaging to her. To which she doesn't reply. Told her I love her so much and if only she would have chose me. I told her many times before back in the day that I loved her but she doesn't believe that. Said how can I love her if she doesn't even love herself (insecurities). And too often we argue that she doesn't think so. We had a big fight one time, which sorta made me not love her anymore, but that was the middle of last year and times went by. 

It's weird, but I implied to her I can find someone else to fill the void, lashed out at her (me being asshole) and stopped seeing her for a month. I came back, knowing there's nothing I could do, she met a real boyfriend, not a virtual person like me. I texted her to which she replied and told me to wait for a while. Then she said wanted a call, a long one if can. She wanted to give me an opportunity to have ""closure"", such as asking about her boyfriend but nothing personal. I asked for a bit, and apologized for my immature behavior, and how toxic I was before. I told her how thoughtful of her to sent me a birthday card and a video of her singing happy birthday to me when none of the people in my real life would celebrate it. It didn't help that she was having stomach cramps and being upset at me for no reason during her birthday last year... even though I wanted to do something fun on that day with her. I reacted poorly to her attitude and apologised to her about that.

She told me the reason she wanted to call was so I could gain a closure. And from then on when we're both done, we should both part ways, wishing me all the best in life and not see each other again. She would see me as a speck of memories she made in one part of her life, and to end things with me on good terms. That was one of the most heartbreaking thing I've ever heard in my life. I was sorta in a state of panic and told her that's not a good idea. She's having none of it and apologised and told me this is the end of our thing. Before I was about to say something, the phone call was cut. Called her, to which she answered and she told me she didn't end the call. I told her, after everything we been through, why did she had to end our thing this way? I remember back in the day she told me I meant a lot to her in tears when I left her chat out of frustration and came back, and another time she said ""what would I do without you...""

She replied ""my boyfriend isn't happy about this..."" ...and I said maybe... we should talk but not everyday? She said she can't do that. ""I'm sorry"". That's the last thing I heard from her. The last thing she heard from me is ""Um...""  I was trying to be ""diplomatic"" instead of asking for ""why"", much to my regret. The phone call ended. Went to message her only for her last reply and last message to me to be ""Goodbye"". At this point, I can't deny her justification of blocking me from all of her social media, to which she did.

I spent the next day feeling too depressed, doing alcohol and crying. Still not getting over it. It felt too lonely. I miss her too much. I doubt seeing new people and making new friends will help with that.

I don't even know why I'm typing all this. What's the point? I failed to ask her for the reasons she wanted to end things with me. I would never get that chance again. I would never get any real closure doing this other than getting it off my chest. I said a lot about my shitty behavior in this post just to come to the conclusion that I'm the problem. Overanalyzing and all. Maybe I've answered my own questions. In the last phone call she said she felt ""mixed signals"" about me, told me how drained she felt talking with me at the end of the day on some days, when I shared too much about my life's problems, even problems from work. She opened up about how upset she felt when she encouraged or push me to do certain things to improve my life, but I never tried to do it. Figures. \*shrugs\*

I know staying friends or still talking with her in the long run never helps, in fact it will hurt as much probably, but for some reason I thought it's the lesser of two evils. 

Here's a confession. I admit, I had difficulty letting her go when she's supposed to sleep early at night or needing her beauty sleep. It ended up with her feeling upset and told me she needed sleep repeatedly. Again, I'm not proud of myself. I was shitty. I'm disgusted at that part of me. Just needy. Tbh, I felt bad making her sleep late that time, but I still lacked respect by not addressing her need to sleep by ending the chat immediately. She doesn't deserve that. No one does.

I learned that we can all give ourselves closure as a way to move on. For some reason it's her birthday and I did the opposite and I felt the need to say something here and still looking for that closure to gain a peace of mind. 

Looking back, she was my best friend in the whole world. I was never able to connect so much to another person in an emotional level like I did with her, especially online. We could discuss about complex stuff all day long and have intellectual conversation. I never did that to my closest irl friends. During tough times we both tried to offer emotional support. I tried my best to be understanding of her. I still love her and miss her so much.

The problem is, he has a cousin who is same age with us and when three of us hangout, i suddenly feel like thirdwheel friend. They grow up together, have lots of memories with each other and thats normal. But all they do is talking about that memories whic is not includes me. They sometimes forget about me and keep talking each other about what they did and how fun it was for hours. My friends cousin keeps saying me how he and my friend is very close and they basicly complete each other. I feel very lonely even when i am with them, but i have no other friends. The other problem is, even tough when his cousin isn't with us, my friend still talks about him and their memories. He keep saying me how did they do this and that, but its never me. Its like he has no memories about me but only about his cousin. And thats makes me feel really bad and unimportant. I even sometimes dont want to talk with him just because of this.

596,a__lonely__child,1627381772,1,"So, she () and I () have been talking for a decent amount of time now, and over the course of the last two weeks, I've developed a greater and greater crush on her. Like, an ""I'd literally do anything just to be able to love and care for you"" kind of crush. She's so sweet, bubbly, and just has cute mannerisms, and hearing the small little things about her day that she shares with me before her shyness takes over genuinely makes my day. I know I love this girl, there's no doubt in my mind. And that's only the first of my problems regarding this complication.

Love, in any form, is a foreign emotion to me. My whole life has been one of defaulting to numbness to avoid being hurt by those who are supposed to love me. When I was diagnosed with Asperger's, I was consequently treated not like a human, but like a project; by my entire family. I haven't been hugged in any way since I was a baby, and nobody but my alcoholic mother tries to touch me (she tries to put her hands on me), and so I've seen my self as an unlovable abomination for my entire existence (I'm now calling it that rather than ""my life"" because ultimately, I don't feel that I am living). And then this girl comes along. And for the first time in my entire life, I, for some reason, felt like I amounted to something.

She, from the beginning, genuinely seemed like she cared, and while I was hesitant initially, I, out of deprivation, opened up to her rather quickly. She doesn't know much of my past, only the pain I feel in the present, and I don't know how much I want her to know of my past besides none of it. Disregarding that, she just has that personality that screams ""cuddle me"", her happiness is intoxicating, and her eyes are the most soulful, sweet, and endearing that I've ever seen. I've liked her for a long while now, but only recently have I known that I love her.

I told her how I felt about half a week ago now, and for most of the time we've shared since then, she never addressed it directly. When I thought my stomach, chest tension, appetite, manifesting thoughts, and headache couldn't get any worse, the anticipation settled it, and showed me that I couldn't have been more wrong. I've been trying desperately to do as much as I can to stop thinking about her for even a moment, but I've found no success. As a matter of fact, it continued to get worse. And so this morning, I decided to bring it up again.

I told her (with greater elaboration, obviously) that I'm down bad, and that there's nothing more in the world that I'd rather have than the privilege of loving her. I then asked her to, in the most upfront way she could, tell me whether or not she likes me back. I knew the answer before I even told her the first time, but reading that text brought me back to reality, this time with that crush still. For those of you that need it spelled out, she said that she doesn't feel the same. More specifically, she says she likes someone else, and while I want to stand behind her, I don't at the same time. I feel so selfish for wanting to be hers. But selfishness still isn't at the top of my list of concerns here.

I haven't wanted a single meal that I've eaten in the last week. I haven't wanted most things I've taken part in last week. I've slept for a total of ten hours over the last week. I've even vomited once in the past week. Courtesy of the numbness I mentioned earlier, I've never been as stimulated by anything but stress, anxiety, or hate, and even hate is less potent than this. Hate at least doesn't break your every fiber when it manifests in your heart. But I don't want to hate. I still want to love, and because she's the first one I've ever had, rejection in this sense was just as foreign as my still deep-rooted crush. I've been shaking and combating physical pain since she told me ""no"" exactly one hour before writing this very sentence. I also know exactly who the guy she does like is, even though I don't have a single one of his handles. I'm so undeniably jealous of him that it's almost humorous. But nothing but that ""no"" being revoked could make me laugh right now. I'm not angry at or with her at all because I have no reason to be. I obviously don't have control over who I like or who I don't like, and so I don't expect her to, either, and even if she did, it'd still be unfair to make her pick me on the basis of my feelings for her. Of course I wish it were fair, but it's not. Jealousy is proving to be nearly as taxing as everything else nonetheless.

I've been desperate for love my entire life becauseI've been starved of it my entire life, and I think I'd love almost anybody that loves me, but quite frankly, nobody's going to tell me first even if they do like me, although it's probable nobody will. However, I loved this girl first, and I still do love this girl, but I'm not finding the reciprocation I hunger and desire so animalistically. Almost everything else has been good in my life. If I can say anything positive about myself, it's that I'm smart, not sick, and capable of prosperity. But I don't feel as though I can be loved. I want to be, but I don't think anybody would want to love me. Thanks for reading this far if you did.",lonely,I didn't think having a crush would be this painful.,2021-07-27 20:29:32

On one side I don't really care because I like to be alone. I fucking hate people, I hate putting on with their bullshit and I've never liked to interact with them, but on the other hand it feels weird that I will likely never meet people who genuinely likes me and wants to spend time with me, have a group of friends and things like that, which will lead me to spend the rest of my life completely alone.

When I was a kid, I was socially ostracized by my peers for being a hyperactive and violent lil shit who would end up in the time out closet for hours nearly every day. Became addicted to all kinds of shit because of how lonely i felt. video games, food, and later drugs and alcohol. My parents enabled me and never really stopped me or did anything about it and it had done so much damage i am recovering from. I've stopped all the addictions and have found my inner peace with my isolation and sobriety. 

I have always been alone emotionally, diagnosed with autism when I was a toddler and adhd in middle school. I often wonder how nice it must feel to find someone you can relate to and love and create with because I rarely find anyone like that, when I do it never gets anywhere or there's no spark.

There are many things about relationships and love I don't understand, in psychology it's usually the parents who influence their child's desire in a mate, but neither of my parents ever dated anyone before meeting each other in their early 20s, so neither have ever developed openly expressive romantic qualities to pass on to me. Everything they discuss is too genuine and they talk everything through and work like a team, been married 30 years and they are fighting more and more lately and it scares me, especially for my little sister.

I just hope I can find someone one day. I don't want to grow old and alone. Sometimes when I think about it, this feeling wrenches up in my gut and I feel sick. I don't like the thought that I will never experience young love or anything like that because from this point on I am only getting older. Something clicked inside of me this month, facial hair appearing more rapidly, I feel something has died inside? is the youth gone? I mean, im only 23

Hello everyone, I'm turning 17 in a few days and I haven't been feeling any good lately, there's a lot of stuff  that I want to get out of my chest right now.
I'm gonna get straight to the point here, all I want is a girlfriend and due to my ugliness I don't see it happening any soon or maybe never.
No girl has ever flirted with me or ever showed a sign of attraction towards me, I've only been called ugly my whole life, I dont blame them for not liking me, Im not an incel and I think they can choose whoever they wanna be with, but what's the point of living if no girl will ever be attracted to me??
I feel that if I had a gf I would be the happiest guy on earth, knowing that there's a girl out there that wants to be with me all the time and who is attracted to me, I wonder if that's ever gonna happen, for now I can only dream.
I would be a really good boyfriend honestly, I'm good at listening and comprehending people, I would also help her with anything she needs, it's a shame I was born with this ugly ass face.
Everyday is just pain, the first thing I think about when I wake up is taking a walk to the supermarket and approach some random girl and try to be friendly and inviting her to go and drink something, then I go to the mirror and look at myself and I lose all remaining hopes. The rest of the day is just crying and doing face exercises hoping for it to get better.
I have no motivation to do anything, working out, videogames, listening to music, watching movies and, I'm really sorry if it sounds nasty but I can't even watch porn, everything makes me depressed and reminds me of my loneliness.
I've heard and read people saying that everyone will find someone at some point, but I've also read and heard that if you're not phisically attractive, love was not meant for you, I dont even know what to believe anymore and idk if I should give up or keep trying.

I had a great group of friends and was generally popular in my school. Over lockdown, my parents moved us to a different city, and a lot of things changed. 

It's been a year since my move, and not seeing my friends in over a year now has made me lose touch with a lot of them. My main friend group is gone, and I really only have 1 or 2 close friends and a few who are not as close. 

Making new friends in person is out of the question, my city's lockdown rules are extremely strict, so I only spent a total of 4 weeks in school for the entire year, with classes of 20 people all 2 metres away from each other, and completely silent classes. The only class I've made friends in was my weights class, which was only temporary, because of my class rotations.

675,kellyguidance,1627341751,1,"Hi all, I have been skimming through this Reddit page and resonating with a lot of you. 

There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.

After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3

* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.
* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.
* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. What's the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.
* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.
* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that's okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time. 
* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.
* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I'm so ugly"" or ""I'm so fat"" or ""I'm so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they aren't and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you're having a bad day and know that it will get better.

These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3 

TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat."" 

You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time.",lonely,Friendly Suggestions for all who Feel Alone &lt;3,2021-07-27 09:22:31

You may be confused, you may wonder what you did or said that went wrong, you may analyze every little detail wondering how you could have changed things, you feel upset, you feel hated by the ghoster.  

But all of this is part of life unfortunately.  If you’re going to be dead in someone else’s mind, might as well pull vice versa and realize that if your absence doesn’t affect them then your presence never mattered.

Fuck being patient thinking they’ll come around, fuck giving space, fuck trusting the process, fuck giving the benefit of the doubt…especially when you see how active they are with others on social media. Using their “depression” and “anxiety” for disappearing after a long period of time is 100% bullshit because if they wanted to care, they would.  They should tell you ahead of time that they need time to get in the right headspace. (Yet the worst part is that even if they say that, they’re still all fine and dandy with others on social media so they’re lying pieces of shit.)

Possible abuse tw? (Forced isolation by egg donor)


I am a 17 year old male, with no friends. Not even one. I dropped out of middle school because of all the bullying, from teachers/staff and other students. 

I've always been an outcast, too weird, fat, ugly, stupid, etc, to hang out with. I was forcibly isolated all my life, never allowed to have friends but this is hitting me hard right now
The only ""friends"" i have are online acquaintances... They're all going out with their real friends, or graduating, while i just sit here. Alone. Inside. I hate myself for being jealous but I've been forcibly isolated for so long that it's started really taking a toll on me. 

Any friends i had when i was younger either moved away, or i moved away, or, egg donor (don't call her my ""mom"") scared them off purposefully... 
Hell, egg donor gives me bullshit reasons as to why i can't make friends.
""Your PTSD is why nobody likes you"" is something she's actually said. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD at 13. 
The town i live in only has 1000 people and none of them are close to my age

For about a week and a half now I've been falling asleep holding a radio because I'm so lonely, i can't go anywhere without it, i feel like that kid from kindergarten that dragged his blanket everywhere, except that blanket is an old 80s radio, and that kindergartner is a 17 year old with a job.

Speaking of jobs... Everyone at work is mean, or just weird. We train horses and teach people to ride, and everyone's been telling me to just be friends with the literal children that are students there. No, wtf, that's weird, they're 10-12 year olds...
 I've been told to ""just make friends"" or the extremely unhelpful ""when you're 18 blah blah fucking blah"". It goes in one ear and out the other.

Something always happens that gets in the way of me having friends... Like work, or people claiming i did something horrible that i never did do. 

Here's some examples of what happens:

My last friend ""will"", egg donor was hitting on his dad. His stepmom took it out on me and pushed me to have a severe flashback. His sister claimed I touched her inappropriately when i didn't... I  would have no reason to, I'm gay, and was only 13 ffs

When i went to school, these kids said i threatened to shoot up the school. I didn't. 2 hours of illegal questioning and a patdown that was extremely inappropriate.

I can't get a GED because i have dyscalculia, and i refuse to go back to school.",lonely,17m. No friends for 4 years. So lonely i sleep with a radio.,2021-07-27 06:46:19

707,Otabao,1627330270,1,"It's been about 9 weeks now since my relationship of 4 years ended. It wasn't a great relationship, we had so many arguments and disagreements over the years but...it was something y'know? When we weren't arguing we did actually get on I suppose, and we mostly did everything together. I saw this person basically everyday, spoke to them throughout the day. From daily chores to after work to fun days out. It was all together. It's over now, and while I feel very sad about how it all went I don't want her back (she left me for someone else). We didn't work, I know that and I don't really miss her specifically, I miss the company.


These past few weeks I tried to be better for a while, I tried seeing friends as often as possible, I tried doing things whenever I could. I tried to improve myself but it all just feels pointless. I don't like being alone, I like having a companion there to communicate with about everything, to accompany me in activities, to have physical affection with when I feel down.


I live with my family now. We don't really ""hang out"" as we're all busy with our own lives. All my friends are busy often and it's not that easy to just meet up with them. It happens but it's much less frequent than I'd like. I don't blame any of these people for being busy because I was like that too, when I had a gf I was often busy.

I just feel so lonely and like I don't really have anyone in my life who actually is interested in how I'm doing or what I'm upto. You know when you have a partner they're always going to be around for you, to check in or to have a cuddle or whatever. I'm pretty much just ranting at this point I don't know where this is going. I'm just so god damn lonely. I want a hug, I want to go to sleep cuddling someone and have someone check up on me throughout the day. I want someone to spend my days off doing fun activities with. I feel like I can't be bothered with anything anymore, like no one is going to love me. I'm too miserable, too boring, too negative.

708,CellistFamiliar,1627329253,1,"First of all, I want to mention that this is my first reddit post ever, and that I'm not a native English speaker.
I guess that I've been alone all my life, but I started to worry about this aspect maybe a few years back when I realised the only 2 friends I had started to develop their own social life and leave me behind, but I learned to accept it and go on. 
Lately I started to have some sort of pressure on my chest, especially at night when I would think about my social life. The research that I've done told me that it is possible that I have anxiety but I don't want to self-diagnose and I don't have money for a therapist or psychologist appointment either.
The last 2 or 3 days have been so bad that this pressure on my chest doesn't even let me sleep, I just pass out and wake up a few hours later, and this process goes on and on.
I don't know what to do, my parents seem worried about this but i just tell that I'm only tired or borred, my birthday is in a few days and I don't feel like partying or anything at all, not even playing my guitar or watching movies or, in general, activities that I enjoyed. 
I'm afraid that my future would be this bleak, gray, empty space.
If you'd be kind enough to suggest what I should do or give me some advice I would apreciate it beyond words.

711,gabeybaby323,1627328810,1,"So, a month or so back my partner (30f) broke up with me (25m). It hurt so much because I feel like I rarely get a good connection and when I do, I jump to quick into it. (I've only known her for 6 months total.) But she had a lot of stuff I wanted. Yet, she had a lot of things I didn't. For instance, the things I did like were that we could be intimate. I could tell her a lot of what's on my mind (which should obviously should be in any relationship.) But it felt like I could talk to her about pretty much anything and we could always challenge and question each other. She was also smart and talented. Shes a dancer, actor, and really into psychology. However, there were things that I really didn't like. Like how she believed ADHD wasn't real and was based solely off past trauma. She would get mad when I would try to bring it up to her. She also was a little judgemental against everyone I know because of her own trauma, which she is self aware about. She is also a huge germaphobe and would sanitize everything and get irked out when I was a little sweaty. That's not even the big part though. She moved in with me because she needed a place to stay temporarily because she wasn't feel comfortable with her friends that she was staying with. Living with her definitely sped up the dating process a lot. That's when I got to see her in all of her lights. She comes from a ridged house hold where they made fun of people behind their back so she grew up with a lot of insecurities and they were all about ""dignity"". She cut them out 5 years ago and never talks to them now and the remnants effected her greatly. Got some reason though I feel like I'm really attracted to her. When ever I think about her I get an overwhelming sensation of sadness and loneliness and it hurts a lot.

Where to start...
For a year now ive had a bad case of depression, since my then gf basically told me that i was kind of a placeholder since she felt bad during vacation with family and she needed someone to tell her shes loved. I, beeing truly in move with her , was on cloud 7 and couldnt picture anything that would have made me happier than beeing with her. Since she revealed that to me ive had serious depression and attempted suicide. The numerous attempts at dating also made it worse, seeing as how i either got no answers , or didnt even got someone to start talking (Online dating since Corona started) 

All i want is someone to come home to, who likes me for who i am and who makes me as happy as i want to make them. That isnt too hard or too much to ask for is it?

Guess beein not goodlooking is the main reason, which is why im starting to work on that. Also if anyone worries, the depression isnt as bad as it was before, now its just waves of sadness and loneliness every once in a while

sometimes i'd like someone to talk to, someome that understands me and cares about me and loves me, just us two, we could sing together, watch movies, to on dates, play online games, start watching series, talk about what we like and dislike, we could do so much

i wish i could wake up with various messages from someone just, excited to tell me something...while everyone else they just...they have that, all of them, they do, and they dont care, and it just makes me angry

they live the life i wish i could live, and they treat it like its nothing, they dont care, they never did, it makes me furious

instead, im just here, taking care of people that made avoidable mistakes, feeling like shit every single fucking day, not being able to go out or have fun, just...being stuck in a room, alone, having to study all day and all night

feeling horrible every day its shitty by itself, but i think its worse when you dont have anyone that cares, everyone's busy, no one understands you, there's no one that will come to you to get you to be a little bit happy again, no one to talk to, no one to hug, no one to distract yourself, its just you, you and the feeling of emptiness and panicking because you're stuck in your room, alone, in a house full of crazy people, and the only thing you have is homework, exams, university, and you cant even go out or speak to people because you have to think about your family, and you're so fucking alone and paranoid, and this isnt the fucking life you were supposed to have, you we supposed to be happy and be better, you were gonna finally find someone last year and be able to be fucking happy again, you were gonna have a birthday where it wasnt just you and your family, you were gonna bring him and his family for a new year's party, you were finally going to have a romantic valentine's day...all the things you've ever wished were gonna come true

you were so close...i was so fucking close

i was finally going to be happy again...i wouldnt be alone anymore...i was so close to making it

i just...know it, someone was finally going to love me too, i wouldnt come home anymore and think that life is worthless, i would've been happy, i could've been happy

just imagine me, having someone to lie on the floor with and listen to music like nothing else mattered

someone to make gifts to, to make surprises to, to go on double dates with...it could've been so amazing

i guess, since i was a child, i've been alone, i've always looked at everyone else, they had happy families, they had partners, they were happy with their lives
and the short moment i was like them it just...it felt like i was on top of the world, i felt like the luckiest guy in the universe, i felt like everything had more colour, everything was a little better, i was happier, i had a reason to wake up every morning and go to school and do my best, i had a reason to just wake up

and then he said he regretted it

but i fixed my problem...then, why cant i find someone again? everyone else did it, they found someone, they made it, why cant i too?

I broke up with my girlfriend last week, all my friends are somewhere far away enjoying the sea with other people, we often have calls, but it's not the same as having them here. I'm stuck in my town, getting bored all day (I don't have any brothers or sisters, my father died 3 years ago, my mom hasn't got much money and knows few people). I mean, I excercise every day at the park, but then? I'm left with nothing to do all day. Due to the pandemic, there aren't any summer activities in my city and it's also pretty empty, we don't have much tourists or attractions to keep people here. I'm extraverted, I don't have problems knowing new people but I really can't find them, I need a friends group to spend time together, otherwise I'm gonna fall into depression very soon.

2) I live in Italy; a place where I have a very boring personality since I can’t express myself properly.

787,macaexm,1627278716,1,"I'm a shy, reserved person who doesn't know how to do the surface friendliness thing people do to initially make friends. I technically have three friends - one where we just ask each other for help in class (A), one I've had since sixth grade who has similar interests (B), and one I've had on-and-off since fourth grade who I have really great conversations with and is probably my closest friend (C). In ninth grade, I joined several clubs and tried talking to students who came from the other middle school, but I couldn't make any new friends. C just moved a few weeks ago and B will have at most two of the same classes as me since she doesn't load up on all the AP classes. There were three specific incidences this past year that made me realize how much I might hate senior year:

* In December, C asked me if I wanted to join a group chat with my classmates. I felt physically anxious when she told me that people were voting to let me in because I thought everyone hated me considering they never acknowledge me and have even forgotten I'm in the classroom at times. A few people were welcoming me but I felt overwhelmed given that so many people were in the chat and right after I typed ""hi"" as per my friend's suggestion I closed the tab because I felt like throwing up.
* In May, I had an honor society induction ceremony where I thought I wouldn't just stand alone because A was going to be there, even though we don't really talk about non-academic things. She barely acknowledged me, just chatted with two of her other friends, and after the ceremony when I tagged along behind them one of her friends asked me to take a photo of them, which I did before leaving and walking past all the people who have been in classes with me since middle school while they chatted and took photos with their friends.
* In June, I found the IG profile of my school's 2021 valedictorian. On one of his posts, people were congratulating him on being val and getting into an Ivy. My guidance counselor informed me this past year that I'm salutatorian, and given my grades this past year I could be valedictorian once class rank is recalculated in September. I realized my classmates would not be congratulating me on my class rank or encouraging me before I give my speech at graduation.

I thought I could at least spend time with my friends outside of school. I invited both of my friends to a concert next year, but B flat out refused and C initially accepted but then said she couldn't make it so I'll probably just go with my mom. I've never been to a school dance so I mentioned to B that we should go to homecoming this year and she said something about how she would rather stay inside and play video games. B and I attended a virtual anime con this spring (which consisted of us cosplaying and hanging out at her house) and I suggested to her that we cosplay again this summer and she said she realized she didn't like cosplaying after that first time. C sometimes takes a while to text back and atm she hasn't replied in a week and I actually cried the other day at the idea of losing her too considering two of my closest friends in middle school did the same thing where they just stopped replying to me and I really click with her. Is wanting to have people in my life I like interacting with who spend time with me really too much to ask for?  My entire life, either I moved, my friends moved, my friends ghosted me (and the ones who did these were typically the ones who I thought I really connected with), or I haven't returned initiatives to reconnect because the relationship I had with them wasn't one where I could actually be myself and talk about anything.

I want to lead a fulfilling life. I want to work in renewable energy, join the Peace Corps, teach in Asia, do my master's abroad, and travel the world. I'm an only child with two cousins with significant age differences who doesn't know how to socialize and always loses her friends.

This was hands down the best relationship I’ve ever been in—my boyfriend was gainfully employed, emotionally available, and very caring apart from the last of it. He just dumped me abruptly for someone else, two weeks into my recovery from a major surgery. I had been hoping we could take things to the next level, but he’s not interested in that. Now that I’ve returned to online dating, I feel like I got dropped in the middle of the dating gold rush and everyone is looking to hook up and nothing more. Where are the real men who don’t abandon women during the hard times? Where are the men who pick up the emotional labor sometimes? I have several medical conditions that may compromise my fertility, but I won’t know until I start trying to have a kid (which is not something I’ve ever done).

The last time I “celebrated” a birthday was over 10 years ago and the last time anyone even remembered was probably 7 or 8 years ago. 

Ive heard the usual advice of “If they dont care then why are they your friends” etc but if I “cut them off” I will literally be alone. Id rather have people who only message me when they need stuff because at least then I will still get messages. Since I finished school over 7 years ago I have been alone with no real friends.

A river of tears need not be so my beloved. Hurt can weigh on our hearts…more heavy than a thousand stones. Our deepest heartbreaks sympathies with our pain. Hurt is the wounded side of our healing process. Though heavy may be the pain. The bruised and most damaged parts of any heart can be healed. By love so sweet. As it guards the heart. And becomes it’s very own shield. The heart deserves to be loved. Protected and safe. It is only when we feel that genuine love. We thought was so bitter sweet. That we find our happiness…our rest and our peace. In the heart of another. Your tears are never missed. Your pain is never looked over in the eyes of a loving heart that’s true. ♥️

The relationship was good for so long but as it came closer to us being together for a year cracks began to show. She wasn't happy that I hung out with certain friends or talked to certain people, but I was willing to leave that all aside as I enjoyed being with her so much.

I ended up going to a party at someone's house that she hated. It was a special event and I felt like I had every right to be there, a large portion of my year from high school and my friend group were there. Once she found out I was there she got really mad with me, she said some nasty things but then apologised not too long after. I was so drunk and upset about the situation that I told her we were done over text. I woke up the next morning ready to make amends and hopefully move on.

However, before I did that I talked to a lot of the people that I'd been at the party with, the people she didn't like and warned me about, and they said to break it off with her. I was so confused and unsure what to do, but they said it was best for me. 

I ended up breaking things off with her, I thought I was doing the right thing. It was such a horrible breakup, the worst experience of my life, just lots of crying and screaming. 

I felt better after a few days though, I thought that I might actually be alright. But for the last month all I've felt is regret and sadness.

And all it would take for that to be cured (or at least relieved a bit) would be to come across eachother while on a walk at the park, or while buying groceries, on a bike ride, or while browsing for books in the library, while buying buying vinyls in a record store, while taking out the trash, on the way home from school or work, when going out for a run or while sitting at a bench, admiring the sun, the rain or the snow.

Which goes to show how well we tend to hide. The question is, do we truly want to be found? Are we worth finding? And once we are, what then? How long would it last? And so on. I don't know. It's all so complicated. Living almost doesn't feel natural at times. Is this all gibberish? Don't answer that.

I have experienced normal social crisis situations. My parents have recently separated, I had some problems at university, I lost a friend to suicide.
And so on.

But the worst hit was something that most people never get to experience. To be an ugly girl and to be treated like crap just for being ugly.
Being the ugly girl comes with a level of alienation that only other fellow ugly girls / women might understand.
If you are extremly intelligent or talented, you might actually compensate and people will treat you well. This also is because of the confidence that comes with that.

But being ugly and mediocre at everything, basically makes you invisible for people.
Literally.
Or, worse : men show it in your face that they dislike you. Happened a lot during my teens - my sole mistake was my ugliness, I was always kind to everyone who spoke to me -.... Life is so infair to ugly women, it's really hard.
The only good thing is that it made me think and feel like a man xD to a certain degree.
Actually I doubt any of the spoiled boys I see everyday could imagine the torture I went through.

I going to go?  I’ve been suicidally depressed since Feb.  I’ve done TMS, Ketamine, neurofeedback, group and individual therapy, micro dose, maxed two anti depressants and all I’ve thought about today was how to cut myself.  I don’t want to be here and what’s so wrong w that?  My friends will be sad and by the end of the year I will mostly be forgotten because TikTok will have a new feature or something.

I couldn’t get a date to save my fucking life…guys only want to fuck me.  A guy I met at my depression clinic acted like he loved me, wanted me to tell him my whole past, we had this super intense relationship and then he dropped me once I left treatment…like I was nothing

The anxiety I get in social situations is unbearable and debilitating,  yet I know I still need and crave human relationships/interaction. Is this how celebs must feel at times? Never truly seen for the person underneath it all? 
Recently I did start an OF page but that isnt the meaning of this post. It's a form of interaction that I hope to be some passive income as well as somewhere safe I can visit anytime and leave easily.  I post what I control and I'm able to have my boundaries respected, which isnt the easiest to do outside of a screen or website that I run.
I like to chat, converse, be in good company, and hear how respectful people hang out again that dont mistreat each other. Lifes too short to waste being damaged and not making progress. 
Maybe this isnt going to offer me the fastest, best type of healing there is but I
that might not be what I'm going for rn. Its satisfying, secret, safe, some of its  monetized, and makes me feel like I might be offering comfort and companionship as creator to fan. I appreciate any support I get. I have a link on my profile if anyone's interested in subbing for free and being a part of my online community, but i respect anyone who doesnt want to also. Everyone has different interests and ways of socializing and we arent in any position to judge another person. That's definitely not our job or our place. 
If anyone has personal experience themselves with healing and what they did that helped them get over anxiety and participate in some kind of social activity, please share. 
I've done a lots of self work that can be done alone and even had a few therapy sessions, though I haven't finished 6 months of sessions....is it even possible to have a good therapist when you're poor? I didnt feel understood or any healing. 
What do you do when your own family doesn't seem to believe your abuse or doesnt understand what that really entails? That's the kicker. Yes I'm a grown adult, but it seemed to make my feelings of loneliness skyrocket and consume my way of life. Now I'm pushing them away tho they're nice, well liked people in our community.

848,anonymousK73000,1627253382,1,"    As you read in the title, my 21st birthday is in a week. I can’t stand the fact that this is the age where everyone is living their best lives, making memories with people they love, and I am all alone, and can count all my friends with one hand. Sometimes I even question how good of friends we are because I am always the one to initiate plans or make any sort of moves. 
    My days consist of going to work (I work a decent job), and then coming home with some free time which is mostly spent alone doing useless shit. Many people are content with isolation but I just can’t stand being lonely, but don’t know where to start. I stay in good shape, have decent looks but I feel like I’m wasting my 20s away just being useless. I do the same shit everyday. 
    I think about suicide all the time. I can go from being incredibly hyper and in a great mood to depressed in a matter of minutes. Like I’d be happy with life for one moment but once my mind reminds me of all my problems with loneliness then my mood shifts instantly, and it’s noticeable. I don’t ever feel the urge to follow through on these actions but most of the time I’d just rather be dead. Nobody knows about this except for me. I have a mom, dad, and 2 younger brothers (19 and 8 y/o) and I need to live for them. It’s just so fucking difficult.
    About my love life, as expected it’s just shitty, I’m still a virgin. I’ve had chances to lose it a few times but I wasn’t interested in the girls offering it, and honestly didn’t wanna lose it a random girl I don’t care about. I loved a girl once in my senior year of high school, and I fucked it up but that’s just a long story. I get matches on tinder but honestly all of it just feels so fake. I don’t know what to do.

To give an example, I saw this one particular girl that was all by herself in the middle of the crowd, much like me, and I wanted to go over and say SOMETHING, even if just to strike up a conversation, but the fear is so palpable of any response different than the best case scenario, because I don't have a clever response.
 
To make things worse, I guess her date showed up later, and for some unexpainable reason I was stricken with this soul-crushing emptiness at the sight that felt worse than anything I'd felt up until that point.

I know getting these things takes a combination of hard work and luck (mostly luck) but every now and then, I like daydream about this exact scenario, about everything falling to place like it's a fucking movie.

I've never been in relationship and likely never will, because I'm literally too afraid of having my heart broken, the risk just doesn't seem worth it.

I'm tired of keeping people's hopes up as if I'm a good friend. I've ignored everyone for weeks now. Living with just loneliness and movies.

To go back into the darkness... I'm sick of it. I'm sick of depending on a degree that was built from my own room only... let alone the privilege of even having my own personal space, compared to many others that don't. I feel ungrateful to take the next steps and I feel I don't deserve this degree anymore.

I can't even plan where my life goes. I know this is so dramatic... but its really hit me in the head; my days are meaningless now. I can't bring any meaning to it because nothing satisfies or keeps me energized anymore.

Tired of this lockdown. Tired of people being anti-vax. Tired or my pointless government. Tired of corrupted politicians. But... I'm just a lonely young adult guy, who feels like he's growing backwards. I'm tired of picking myself up. Tired of reconnecting with people. Tired of trying to even be better.

I just wanna be neutral. Unaffect the world. Disappear from people's view towards me. I want this nightmare to end.",lonely,Tired of COVID and my life right now,2021-07-26 07:29:24

I find it really hard to focus on some things like: school, studying and basically anything else.

I feel really tired even though when sometimes I get good amounts of sleep.

My appetite is sometimes bad and sometimes I just eat too much.

I shift through my emotions really quickly, sometimes I don't even know how I feel.

My friends are getting further and further away from me, I feel unwanted here, I see them hanging out almost every day, but they never invite me.

My family and relatives make fun of me, especially my weight, I am a bit overweight for my height.

I tried working out in past, and eating more healthy, but I can't help but feel like shit, I'm not worth this.

I never really reached out to anyone for help, I was trying to give some hints to my best friend, in a jokingly manner, but I don't think he really picked it up 

But I'm most afraid to vent to people because of my age, whenever I say something that bothers me, people automatically assume that I'm just being edgy and craving for attention.

I don't really want attention but at the same time I do.

I had nobody else than myself, life is shit and meaningless.

It’s like I have a tattoo on my forehead that says “DON’T BEFRIEND ME” but I’m unaware of it. All I do is put my best foot forward, treat everyone with respect, be kind and inviting but not pushy, yet all I get in return is disregard. All I get is the “we should hang sometime!” But then dead silence forever. I have lived here for three! Whole! Years! And I STILL have not found one single dependable friend. At this very moment, I could die and my body would rot here for weeks before anyone even knew I was gone. THAT is how insignificant I am. I don’t even have an acquaintance that I can turn into a friend. Not even someone that I vaguely connected with. Not a single soul is aware of my existence outside the manager at my job.

I work at a job where I see 300+ people daily yet I have not one single person I can fucking talk to. The pain of doing everything alone is getting to me. How can I live in such a city and feel so alone? Ive been feeling lonely for years but it’s never been this bad. Ive lost all hope in making friends, it’s like there’s an invisible barrier between me and others, something that’s keeping people from caring about my existence.

I would make it a point to talk to everyone in the class. soon I became ""kind"" of friends with everyone and decided on the main group as well

at least I thought we were close? I don't really know.

basically sometimes before assembly or pe when everyone had to leave the classroom sometimes i would drink water or be doing some work and that's when you realize how truly alone you are

how are you supposed to be fun when there'so one waiting for you at the door?

no one to tell you that hey dude ur late for class hurry up

no one to wait for you to tie your shoelaces

because all of them have their friends and I'm just the third one walking alongside them in a narrow path

when i see people feeling like this and i happen to notice it, i always help include them but would anyone else do it for me?

that classroom door is terrifying

i still remember running  to the bathroom and crying because the reality of it all was too crushing for me

no one cares and I'm stuck in the empty classroom

lmao this one time this main group of mine just straight up stopped saying hi to me in the mornings

and i could jus feel the tears rolling and needed to go the bathroom right that instant when a teacher caught me and asked me whats wrong and i broke down completely, yknow she laughed when i said it was because they didn't say hi but her face fell when i said i feel alone in a class of 40 students and abandoned. i hate myself. 

another fun fact was when my grades were dropping and i told my parents it was because i dont have any friends so i always felt like talking to people because what if they lose interest me? make more friends make as many friends as possible then no one will leave if one leaves there will more talk to more people more more more more more 

was my thought process

my parents compared instead of idfk hugging me told me yeah okay we had it harder deal with it. dont you love that parental support !!!

anyway lmao so

quarantine in retrospect was amazing for me

 i dont need to find out if they care about me or not !!! and i found a friend who knows what this feels like and actually told me i was valid and not invisible!! so quarantine, at least the beginning has helped me in that way. i feel a bit stifled now but goddamn i dont wanna return to that time ever again. top 10 worst time of my life.

When he was still alive, he told me that I'm not alone and said ""I'm here"". I believed in his words and trusted him so much. He let me cry during the call and the silence was so comforting. I knew he was there for me and I felt so safe with him. 

During that time, I didn't know who to go to. I called my dad in a panic hoping and thinking that he would be an emotional support. I was wrong. He yelled at me, said he didn't care about my best friend, and hung up on me. I took a week off work, but still, no one could understand. I spoke with my best friend's mum and she told me to take care and stay safe. I don't even know what to say to her since she knew him and I spent the entire day together with another friend of his before he went missing the next day. 

I reached out and re-connected with a friend who I had a falling out with. I relied on him for his support, became dependent, and he comforted me like no one else did. We were really glad to be back in each other's lives. At this point, my feelings for him came back and I fell hard (again). He never gave me an answer or a reply back, but he did say he really liked me too. I fell in love with him, yet only for him to tell me to ""please don't message me again"" which isn't the second time he's said that to me before. The first time his words were ""never message me again"". 

Why is it so cruel for people to leave us in our lives? Whether that be friends or someone who we are romantically interested in. I know that death is inevitable, but my best friend didn't want to live anymore. He was only 25 years old. He told me about his dreams and aspirations. We even wished for each other to live a long and healthy life. We promised to be friends and friends who would game together for years. His mum said it would be great for me to visit them one day and I promised him that I would, no matter how long it takes me to. 

I will be turning 25 this October and it's also the one year anniversary of his death. I am so fucking scared. Last year, I forced myself to go play badminton in public with random strangers just so I wouldn't have to be alone. I still felt so miserable and so numb, even though I was surrounded by people. I thought to myself and asked myself about why was I even there. I won't have the friend who support me when I needed someone to talk to. Heck, I don't even know if he's even alive since he told me not to message his friends about him either. I'm so tired of caring for someone who could care less about me.

Hey there!

I am looking for lonely people around my age with whom I can chat with.  In the last few years of my life I’ve felt so depressed because even though I have everything I still feel quite lonely … especially when it comes to my friends. I do have a small group of friends who I know since middle school and they are actually really nice to me but I’ve realize that I just don’t really click with them and I feel like I have no connection towards them at all… I sometimes feel ashamed of not being able to make friends and complaining about “just” being lonely but this community really helped me cope with it.

I was thinking to open up a discord server and create a group with other teens (16-19), where we can just randomly have discussion about different topics, chat about our struggles, our happy moments or just our daily life in general. It would be so cool if (after this pandemic) we could meet each other one day in real life!

I am  and will graduate next year from high school. In my freetime I like to listen to music (Kpop or pop in general), read any types of books and watch a ton of YouTube videos … yeah that’s it. You could say that I am the biggest failure to any average person: I have no talent, no passion, I’m introverted,socially awkward and of course I’m pretty lonely. 

I don’t care from which country you are, what your sexual orientation or your beliefs are but it really matters for me that you’re not some creepy person who has other weird and disgusting intentions, that you’re not faking about yourself … I do believe that friendships over the internet can be possible :) .

Theres this one friend i talk to most of the time. I have fun talking with him. He's a nice guy. But everytime the conversation ends i worry about why the conversation ended so quickly, and why that happpened.

Lately, he hasnt been online. By that i mean he doesnt respond. I send him messages, i see that he is online, then later he goes offline, not even a reply to me.

He told me before that he has been thinking about life and all that stuff. Maybe i could only relate then maybe we could strike up a convo. Maybe i do but, i just dont realize it.

Because of all this, ive been really lonely. Ive been venting, tweeting my feelings out, and spending so much time on social media.

935,bbbubblebitchhh,1627195932,1,"Just a heads up: I’ve been bottling this up for a year and a half because I didn’t feel comfortable telling my best friends so this going to be long. 

I used to know someone very well. We were in a club together and he had always been really nice to me even though I was awful to him since I had always found him to be a bother. We ended up spending a lot of time together between practice, competition, and traveling so we talked a lot and slowly became friends. About 10 seconds after I had realized I found a new friend, I completely forgot about the boundaries I had set up and looked at him in a romantic light. 

Eventually a mutual friend (we’re no longer friends because she was toxic and pushy) that I happened to be very close with at the time stepped in and told me to tell him even though I didn’t want to act on my feelings at all. A few weeks later, I got his number and a month and a half later, we had our first real conversation (via text) on my Birthday and continued to do so every other day until I mid May. 

In that time, I learned about his stories, secrets, habits, and favorite things. I had never been so close to someone so similar to me and it felt wonderful so I didn’t even care when every few weeks he’d say all he was interested in was a friendship. The problem is that he didn’t treat me like a friend. So it always got worse. 

As it progressed, my mutual friend got more and more intertwined and everything got very complicated. They were speaking about me and my feelings on my behalf and behind my back. I was being told things by my friend that he would swear weren’t true and everything felt like he was just lying to my face. Soon enough, I hear from my friend that I’m too fat for him. He says I’m pretty but he’s not ready for a relationship. She says he’s obviously interested and he treats me like more than a friend and that cycle repeats 3 more times. He actually told me that the only reason that he indulged my feelings was because he was desperate for validation and trying to feed his inferiority complex.

Eventually we slowly stop talking and he doesn’t respond for a while and I give up. Reading the messages were so painful that I deleted his number and blocked him then I blocked the friend and I hid away in my room and had awful breakdown for months. I haven’t trusted anyone the same way again.

Every once in a while when I’m desperate I go through my phones blocked contact list and try to guess his number but I never text. Until yesterday when I looked up every area code in my state and unblocked them all hoping fate would conspire to bring him back to me. I still cry at our favorite songs and think about him everyday. The last time I fell this much, I didn’t get over the guy for four years. I have never felt so empty. I kept it from my best friends because I wanted it be a secret so I could surprise them and show them I’m capable of being loved my someone and now I’ll never be able to explain how absolutely hollow I feel. I just told them I wouldn’t even think about dating someone again for a year and that year is almost up. I don’t know how to explain I that I can’t do this anymore. 

I had been putting myself back together brick by brick and then he did so much damage that it all had to be torn down and I never want I rebuild again.

He probably doesn’t even remember me.

As far back as I can recall, I felt that people we demanding things, expecting me to do things without asking what I wanted.

My upbringing was harshly judgmental with occasional bursts of violence from my poor damaged parents, who were being overworked in their jobs. (Things are different now).

And when I tried to make friends, it was like talking to aliens--they had their own culture and ways of expressing themselves that I couldn't understand. My clothes were wrong, my jokes were wrong, my faith was wrong. I tried to fit in, tried to have fun and only ended up hurting innocent people. There were a few people who were good to me, but I was never able to speak to them properly. Everyone always seemed so much more mature than I was.

I tried to imitate the TV in my social and personal life, and that just wrecked the relationship between myself and my sister.

I read all the time. The world seemed like a harsh and glaring place and the images books placed helped me escape. Teachers and students alike would single me out in class for mockery, and when the teachers took away my books and tried to *force* me to be social with people who treated me badly, I stood up to them, and eventually got put in a class with actual violent and unstable kids that teachers didn't want to deal with.

In high school, I was a wreck who slept in all my classes, and still had all the social problems I did growing up. I was just burned out. And even when they stuck me with a counselor I couldn't say anything. I knew no one could fix me. I never learned to drive or do *anything* because I would start panicking that I would screw up and hurt someone.

By college, I realized that I was too damaged to make anyone happy, and I was more cordial and polite, and even tried to be helpful but I couldn't talk to people. They had lives, and friends, and lovers and I was just a pathetic wreck, still.

I wanted to create wonderful things so I studied art. I realized I'd never create anything wonderful and after I graduated I put it away and got a crap job.

The job made me hate everything except my co-workers. I couldn't make enough to leave my parents' house, and I still couldn't drive from panic attacks.

The only thing, *the only thing* that kept me going all those years was believing that something would change. That maybe I'd understand everything. Some moment, some person, some thing that would make everything worth it.

I told myself that someday I'd be able to live peacefully, without anyone demanding anything I couldn't provide. I'd fine some way to make money I didn't hate, I'd be independent and free.

Someday I'd meet a girl who could accept me for all my flaws, and I'd have a family and get out of my parents house. Maybe having someone to work for would've made things better.

It would be worth it.

Long story short, my body betrayed me and I learned I had cancer as well as pneumonia and a sac crushing my heart (talk about metaphors).

They told me there was a drug for it, and I thought about how much my family loved me even if I couldn't return their love properly, so I said yes.

It's been three years. 

I get roughly 720 bucks a month, less my insurance, for disability. Some things I have to save up for, but I can eventually buy a great deal of things. I have time. I have a good TV, a good computer, tons of books I haven't read. I have a roof over my head thanks to the largesse of my father.

I know that cancer aside people have it worse than me.

No one asks me for anything except occasional chores. I can sleep anytime I want unless I have an appointment.

My father makes a good substantive meal every day for myself and my mother (who has dementia), so I don't even have to worry about buying my own food.

I've always known that some people had it worse than me. I try to donate to charity when I can.

None of it means anything. I don't *enjoy* anything. 

I don't have anyone to *talk* to. 

My parents can't help me. My therapist and psychiatrist can't help me. I keep trying to follow their advice and think positively, or find something fun to do. Nothing's fun, nothing's interesting nothing appeals to me.

I've tried talking to my sister who comes by every so often, but she ends up sniping at us about politics and screaming clickbait nonsense at my parents and me before storming away. 

I just feel so empty and stretched-out worthless. What was any of it for? Why am I still here? And what am I supposed to do?",lonely,Everything's all wrong.,2021-07-25 15:25:12

I try to be nice and talk, but I'm too different. I'm ugly, slow, quiet, and always miserable looking. Who would want to hang out with such a guy huh?

I've become inhumane the way I see everything. The only thing that keeps me happy and living are my video games. Hell I don't even care about being rich or having a family, or any other normal goals. I just want to be alone the rest of my life and be in other realities where I'm not an outcast. 

I gave up on life. I gave up trying to be normal. I've fully lost my connection to people. I love being alone in my home where everyone's evil tormenting faces and red eyes don't reach me. After all this typing, I don't see the point in putting this out here. What is anyone gonna say to make me feel better? It's all pointless. Idek who I am anymore...

Nothing I’m passionate about I can fashion into a self-sustaining career, and the idea of compromising is something I’m finally succumbing to by banking on something reliable I can get into with relative speed and it makes me violently ill just to think about my true dreams deteriorating. 

All my life I’ve related more to say teachers that come and go than people my own age. A modern day, consummate stranger in a strange land, that’s what I am. The only friends I have are online and I can’t even do friendly video calls with them because I’m all but stunted in that I’m basically a teenager who has no privacy, which I wouldn’t even need if I had freedom from judgment about being such a social recluse my only friends are virtual.

I still think about him all the time two and a half years later because I’m so damn pathetic in my shoddy hopeless romanticism.

I am tired of being alone, but I just can't meet new people..   
You've probably heard it all before, and I know I am not the only one struggling with this. 

I have lived most of my life with depression combined with social anxiety. 

In theory I do know that it's my anxiety that takes over whenever a social situation turns sour.   
Most likely the other people are having an alright time even with me there, but somehow my brain just switches it over to: ""Nah, they despise you- you've bothered them enough by now."" 

When I see people today (no interactions) in for example a store, I immediately feel looked down upon. Like I am in their way. 

I have fallen so far down, that I don't think I can recover.   
No matter how hard I try- I can't look positive on things. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat good- even just for 10 minutes- is the random events where for example a stranger randomly talks to you with a smile or similar.. I guess the most important thing is their smile, that is when I don't see the false hatred I usually do. 

How is this related to being lonely? Well, it was more of a background piece. More on topic though, I *want* to be with people. I live alone, and have no friends to hang out with. I miss the times when I did have friends, I even once had a really good friend from a online game. We were planning on meeting up, but my social anxiety took over one evening and I responded to her as if I hated her... I didn't mean to, but that destroyed the friendship completely. 

Other friends were lost of more natural causes, different interests as we grew up. 

Why can't I recover? Well, again- I don't see a light in the tunnel even the slightest. It's an uphill battle I can't see the top of. I tried talking to a psychologist about it- but I ended up being told ""I couldn't get help, because I didn't truly want help."". That was a hard truth- I ended up cancelling all appointments after that. 

I've heard most tips from people. ""It will get better with time"", but I mean come on- we all know the only true solution is manning up and go meet people right? ... Well, I just can't... 

**Here's something I absolutely hate about myself, even though people claim it's normal.**

Even at the age of 23, I still have it easier to want to befriend females over males. I don't quite get it as I have met way more friendly males than females- but that could be because they think ""I want to date them"" (the females that is). It does bother me that my brain has that initial thought when meeting a new person. 

**What does the future hold?**

Let's be real. Once all hope and will is gone, there isn't much one can do. Life doesn't randomly fix itself. I don't think I will live life to it's full potential. 

**But there has to be something positive in your life right?**

True, and I can share a bit of that too. I like movies and games with a deep story focus- preferably dark themed. If the movie is good enough I can sort of immerse myself into it and forget all that's bad, even just for the duration of the movie.

988,JumpSleep123,1627173146,1,"I've struggled with friendships for over a decade now. Especially feeling like I have to worry about the true nature of who I meet and about what they're doing/talking behind my back. I usually have no social capital or w/e compared to everyone else anyway.

At 24 years old, that's not the mindset I hoped to have. I was betrayed once in childhood and that blew my brain up for good. Never truly trusted anyone else after that. Not for long. I still have the tendency to lash out as a result of my fears (something which I only recently recognized).

My fears were also validated when I was in toxic environments, even in college, so I don't think I *can* break away from them really. I learned that petty behavior doesn't stay in childhood for some and, considering I'm often too naive, I can never let my guard down about it.

On the other hand, now that I realize that all I've felt for people was most likely never matched, I'm struggling to find a purpose for my efforts. Why should I start conversations and all that when nobody does the same for me? What does it really accomplish? Why should I keep enduring the pain of rejection without gaining the slightest thing in return?

And what does this say about all the moral dilemmas I keep hitting myself with? 

Should I apologize to an ex-friend I thought I mistreated a lot - and who I REALLY MISS - when they didn't seem to feel anything in the end? When they probably pretended to feel strongly about me, in fact? They sure sounded like one of those ""overly emotional"" fakers.

Should I stay in touch with a friend, when they have others who are most likely more relevant to him and I was only contacted by him like two times in the last month (and certainly not to check up on me)?

Here is the story of what happened. Long story short I met a girl online years ago that I fell in love with. She really cared about me too. No girl has ever cared as much as she did. She would spend hours to help me with my problems and talk me out of suicide. 

I wanted to be more than friends but she had a boyfriend. I loved her and for a while it seemed like she had feelings for me too. She always told me daily she’d never leave me and that she’ll always be with me for life But I blew it by being constantly abusive and even giving death threats to her because of stress and insecurity.

She was the best thing that happened to me. Years ago because of the death threats and abuse she left. After she left I found out she had an instagram account where she was taking pics of herself (which I never seen her do) and talking to new people. Like I never even mattered. 

When I tried to contact her friend her friend said: “You’re a fucking creep, she will never come back to you. She’s being fucked by her boyfriend” I was traumatized that her friend actually said all this to me. Even after that she remained friends with that girl. Never contacted me again for over 3 years. 

She has new friends on Instagram now and acts like I never existed. A lot of people are dismissive of my problems and say I deserve this because of how I acted. Yes I made mistakes but I’ve learned from this and changed. Others don’t take me seriously and don’t understand that it’s not easy for me to “just move on”.

I finaly got the balls to try out tinder and got few chats but nothing solid. Suddenly i match with this girl I see around in our small town that i always had a crush on. She turned out to be everthing i would ever look in a partner. We had the same hobbies, interests, liked the same movies and shows, had the same taste for food and we both hated socializing and we're a bit awkward, we were basicaly both gamer nerds... 


We had an amaizing first date, we went for few drinks but stayed there for 8 hours just talking and laughing... I never talked with anyone for that long without loosing interest in the conversation.... We were complementing each others looks and being a little flirty... She said she wont use i tinder anymore and i said the same. I walked her home we hugged and both agreed we should go out again. 


Then she got distant while texting... I felt something was off but there were days she was really chatty which made me feel confused. I tried for 3 weeks to ask her out for a coffee or a walk but there was always something  and she couldn't make time...I was patient and giving her space but when i asked her out again she said that she has some past issues she's still struggling with and that it would be bad if i got attached to her and that i was great and it's not my fault...


I replied that i respect that and understand, i told her i think she's beautiful and interesting and that i wish her good luck and she knows how to reach me if she changes her mind. 


I can't stop thinking about her.... We were so compatible... We could have enjoyed so many things together that we both like.... She was 10/10 perfect for me.... But i realise that i may have not been what SHE was looking for... I know that i will never find someone like her... I didn't even know someone like her could exist... In my head i am convinced that she was the one and this thinking is not letting me move on and heal as what is there to heal for, i just lost all hope for finding a connection like this again.

1045,Adventurous-March762,1627144641,1,"when i was in school i was bullied and sexually harrassed by fellow classmates for 5 straight years. but didn't tell anyone and i will tell the reason later. what i learned during that period was that if i make my presence felt like i don't exist, i will not be bullied. and it worked too. other way was making them feel like i was an innocent victim and they will pity on me and will not attack me. that worked too. but ofcourse every now and then everything was back to what it used to be. because of me overdoing acting like a victim and keeping myself invisible i became socially awkward. now i didn't know how to talk to people normally, me interacting with girls of my class was negligible. most girls didn't even know i even exist and most boys were too cool and socially fluent for me. later in my last years of schooling just before the final exams(which are very important to get admission in college) all of that was still happening. had reduced by a huge margin because even my bullies were busy preparing for the test. but when those things were happening now, i had to either do something about it or risk spoiling my test. so i complained to the teacher i liked and respected the most. i respected her so much because she had always helped me and was never wierded out by my socially awkward behaviour. she listened to my complain and asked some of my bulies to stay after the class. i was relieved that finally it has ended and now i can focus on my studies. 2 days later i got to know from one of the bully that she and the rest of the bullies were laughing about it. thankfully i didn't believe him because she was so highly respectable teacher who i knew can never do this. thankfully because that thought helped me study and those kids were not attacking me anymore too. so i passed that test with great score to get an admission in some college in the city(which is a big deal) just because of that thought. few years later a bully met me on train(now reformed) and told me they actually were laughing. this is why i was not telling anyone about my condition to anyone. 

so after the school it was time for college but my father wanted me to drop college to go for chartered accountancy course. this course if the biggest accounting course in india but the course is so vast that you will have to drop the college. so i took admission in open university(college at home), and started going for classes of chartered accountancy(CA). this meant that i will be staying at home for most of the days in a year and will be going to classes of CA for 4 months in whole year. now in that 4 months students interact with each other and make study partners with whom they spend the rest of the year preparing, but my social awkward behaviour didn't like to talk people. it was not like people didn't appraoch me, but i bored them away or tried to not interact with them at all. did i tell you i hated accountancy and my father pushed me in this course because his nephew had cleared it and was just jealous of him? i didn't clear the first stage of the course, which meant i'm going to stay at home for whole year and not taking any classes. didn't have courage the next year because my preparation was not top notch and i felt wierd leaving home. like i started feeling staying at home is the most normal thing. thus now was stuck at home another whole year. next year came the lockdown which messed up with my brain so much i was depressed all the time. and then came the infamous 2021 pandemic in india. good thing is me and my family has decided that i'm not made for CA so will trying to take up some other course. but at this point i have no idea what talking to people feels like. and i'm sure talking to a girl is never happening. i had a phone which had atmost 15 contacts which were mostly of my family, but had 0 caller history other than me conversing with my parents ofcourse. please don't feel bad for me, i want to get rid of that victim trait from me. but i also know it is going to be like this for few more years.

few things i forgot to mention above.   
1. because of what all happened with me in school, i hate touch of another person. be it through the cloth or direct skin contact. i was not shaking hands even before corona hit us

2. i'm a 6ft guy which in india is a whole feet taller than the average. girls were attracted to me in my CA classes and have flirted with me several times. but i either bored them away or told them that i was not interested because i was much more worried about the exam. thus gained a lot of weight to avoid all of those small talks and flirtings. later i was so much addicted to sugar that i couldn't stop gaining weight. and now i can't even think i used to look like that younger self of me.",lonely,i just want to be heard,2021-07-25 02:37:21

I first had some farely attractive girls try to engage in conversation with me but i failed to keep the converasation going so they ditched me for the hotest guys in camp. 

The next few days were pretty chill while i was setting my target, i ended up noticing a short girl with black hair and a stunning face and body, but the best part is that she was shy(well at least i thought so:)), wich meant no one would be trying to hit on her other than me. I kept looking at her through out the week trying to establish eye contact until thursday i decided i would go up there and invite her to the prom. 

Meanwhile my friends already knew that i wanted to invite her, and she probs did too because rumors spread fast.

* **Here is my short story:** 22M, two years ago I went through extreme depression and anxiety. My grades in college plummeted and I started to lose friends. I seriously doubted whether I would be able to graduate from college. I started drinking and decided to end it all, fortunately, that didn't happen. Some turn of events made me just hang in there and then pandemic happened. It gave me a lot of time to rethink and made me stronger. I graduated with a Computer Science degree recently.
* **Met amazing people online also some bad fruits too:** Recently I've been meeting a lot of people online some good and some bad, the thing is you cant distinguish bad from the good bunch. so today I had an idea, a spark to do something for my fellow humans who have nothing but a good heart.
* **The** ***spark:*** The idea is to start a discord server, away from all the social media clutter where you join the amazing community of people who have faced similar things that you have in your life, ***people who you can relate to***, but also people who are incredibly diverse in their hobbies, lifestyle, careers, sexuality, away from all the politics and social clutter, a place where people meet people.
* **The process:**

1. comment on this post with your discord username and I'll add you.
2. If you are a racist and sexist person please don't join.
3. It will be no place to date, or to hit on.. only for friendship and open-minded people.

We both realized that we had some feelings, but she has a bf. They were on a break and we decided to give it a try. It took a while, but we both realized that it was mostly based off sex. She decided that call it quits, but she said that we would stay friends. My mouth said yes, but my heart said something else.

I became very rude, needy, vindictive and insecure. I feel like I mentally abused her. I was extremely toxic. Because in my mind, I was the only one hurting. So I needed for her to “feel” something. I know right, I’m a piece of shit for that. You can call me one all you want. I was just so disgusted by myself. Even though about suicide. I’ve spent most of 2019 and a little bit of 20 self reflecting/growing. I don’t think I’m a bad person, I’m just no good for anybody. She deserves that guy she’s with and better friends. 

I have friends/acquaintances but nobody that I would call a best friend. Even though, I have a lot of affection for them. I’m a little afraid to show it because of this. I hang out with them almost never. I barely talk to them. We’re all busy and I feel like I’m imposing. It’s hard making new connections too. 

I think that I’ve forgiven myself for it, but now I don’t think that I’m unworthy of friendship. I’ve lost that privilege because of my own immaturity. I get it. This is karma and I have to take my consequences.",lonely,I feel like I don’t deserve any friendships,2021-07-24 19:32:04

I lived as a shadow of my past life.

Tears of the father, blood of the son
Through years of dishonor, come undone
So I'll armor myself with this knowledge
And I'll match my speed to the wind
I'll journey away, far from this place
and pray, none will know me as a """"friend""""

By moonlight and starlight
Those shadows let me astray
Take comfort in darkness
Hide me away from the light

Her hand gripped mine
I went with an open mind
But the light she shined on me
It burned me deep down to my bones,
And I promised I would never
Allow myself to feel the light again
Through the flesh that sloughed from the bone
Was blackened and diseased
That flash was not my flesh
That blood was not my blood
Yet still in the shadow I hide
Drag me back into the grave
And let me die

Cling to comfort child, no longer
Suffer with pride
The pain: Healing
Wait not, for time will surely
Not wait for thee
Is that the ticking of the clock
Or the beating of your weakening heart?

My loneliness is actually humiliating because I'm literally just go sit in town desperately hoping someone will talk to me (more so if I've been drinking).

i date.  or at least try.  i try to hang out with friends when possible (but this is a little hard due to distance).  i've recently cancelled some things with friends because i'm depressed.

i just turned 47.  the options i have to address these symptoms and issues: therapy and drugs.  i've done both quite extensively with varying degrees of success in the past.  i still need to get a job.  i'm running out of money.

i wake up everyday feeling dreadful and want to die.  it's the most awful experience when waking up.  i've never gone through anything like this before in my life.  i've had the ""oh, i have to get up and go do work"" shitty attitude.  but this is different.

i'm by myself all day.  nights are horrendous.  i breakdown every day.

every experience i have is utterly dreadful.  washing dishes.  exercising.  eating.  i cried in the shower today.  past hobbies feel like work?

this moment in my life is the lowest of my lows.  and i've been depressed for years at a time in the past.

this train of thought is constant.  i have no relief.  my fear again when taking prescription drugs (mainly SSRIs, i probably need to try an SNRI) are the results and side effects.  i'm done with SSRIs.  they've never worked for me.  coming off of them is absolutely horrendous (for me).

The fight... I think myself of melancholic person. It seems harder and harder to be happy. There are moments where I am. Rare moments. 
Yet so many hurtful things I have suffered throughout the years. The fight is trying to not lose what I have left of myself. Not get stuck in the dark. 
I try so hard to find the good things in life, of course I am grateful for what I have, but shit always happens. I've gotten use to this, but holy crap, there's always somewhere that just really feels like a dagger sinking into your heart. 
Today was my final straw at having faith in what I thought was love. 
It sucks to have failed relationships, especially the ones that makes you want to literally tear your heart out (because of betrayal, because you thought the other person was feeling the same, etc.) 
Today though I finally saw that trying to have a forever loving partner is like trying to live a fairytale. It doesn't exist. 
At first I felt like crap but I accepted it. Life is shitty. And we as people hold on so tight to what we believe is love. Or happiness but in the end it's not what it is. 
Like in the book The Outsiders, when Ponyboy recited that poem by Robert Frost. Those words that stayed and will keep staying with me until the die I die are true. 
Nothing gold can stay.

PS. Even though I feel this way it doesn't mean I wish others happiness, success. Health. True pure love. I really do because it sucks to live like this.

My dad and mom divorced when i was 3 or 4 so i wasn't old enough to go through it. My mom got with an abusive guy for several years who would hit me, my little brother, and my older sister. He was on drugs constantly and it made my life so much worse. He would steal from family to buy meth, pot, and coke. We ended up being evicted from our house so we would end up living in hotels for weeks on end. I have always had a bad experience with school also. If it was as simple as throwing away my work or as bad stealing stuff from my bag or moving my chair. I've had a pencil be stuck out of my hand straight through to the other side. I ended up dropping out of hs and going to get my GED instead. My mom and uncle are constantly working so they are never at the house. My sister and brother both have gf's and they are always at the house. My only friend i had moved away last august before school started again so I can't hang out with them either. It is jaust sometimes I feel like im useless and have no purpose and other times i can get my mind off of it by playin on my xbox but that only works for a small amount of time. When it ends it all just comes rushing back like a wave of depression running over me and I can't escape my head. I've thought of suicide but I don't wanna put my family in the same headspace im in. ive cut my wrists but im immune to that. I don't do drugs to help clear my mind.

Friendship and authentic emotional connection seem to come so naturally to everyone else around me and I'm here in my mid twenties begging the magicians to tell me what the trick is. I am a locked room trapped inside of myself with no way in or out. Is it even possible to feel fully understood and accepted by another person? Maybe everyone is trapped in their own locked rooms but they've figured out a way to be content with that. It makes me feel claustrophobic, like the walls are closing in to crush me. I feel so disconnected from my hobbies, my personality, the things I like and hate.

1121,Jack24526,1627099653,1,"It's really cliché but it's my luck with women. My first real relationship outside of High school was with my best friends ex. I really cared about her at the time and I went about it the wrong way and lost both of my best friends because of it. 2 and 1/2 years later and a horribly toxic relationship, I lost her too. She went back to my ex best friend and I don't blame her as they still cared for each other. She filed a police report on me over some bs (falsified report but she didn't press charges as I had evidence against her as opposed to her word) and ditched me to pay the full rent. I fully expected this to happen and was prepared so it didn't set me back. After a really rough mental time, I moved on to a girl that I didn't date in high school. Way too soon and due to the trauma of said relationship and maturity, I wasn't the same person and wasn't good at expressing myself nor handling the situation. She left me because I didn't give her enough attention because I was working to support both of us in a moderately expensive apartment while simultaneously going to college. She proceeded to get a boyfriend who lived at least an hour away so the reason felt stupid to me but I realize that was just the easiest thing for her to say. Fast forward 2 years and countless number of talks through dating apps and talking to people. I've had 1 date that went alright but ultimately didn't lead anywhere. I decided this weekend to give up on dating apps and things as all it really does is depress me that my attempts are so futile. This weekend gave me hope once again. The girl that I had a thing for broke up with the only boyfriend she's ever had. While I know it's probably terrible, I do care about her and she's been genuinely nice to me, as she is to everyone from what I've seen. I really enjoy talking to her. However I don't feel as it will go anywhere because our schedules don't really work out and I don't have the confidence to really manage to get closer to her. I'm a little bummed over that but it's not the end of the world. It got one upped. For this one I need to back up a bit, When I got with my toxic ex (the first real relationship) I was talking to this girl. We became friends over xbox ( she does live in another country) and some drama happened in my friend group pertaining to this but I kept talking to her as we got along great. We started relying on each other for a while as mental health buddies and maybe that's where my feelings started. Having someone care and that I meant something to, where she actually made sure I knew that she was there because she wanted to be for me. My gf at the time got jealous and was really harsh to both of us and being young and stupid, I stopped talking to her for that time. The day me and my ex broke up, I immediately messaged her. She was my first thought. The person I wanted to talk to more than anyone. Once again, she was there for me. Immediately. It hit me again. The feelings came back. Catch 22. I was the only person who thought she was great, she was now engaged. We talked anyway (appropriately) and became pretty good friends again. Fast forward to this previous weekend after we haven't talked for a little while. She tells me her and her fiancé broke up. I saw this as an opportunity and confessed to her my feelings. I found out they were mutual and have been for the decade or so we've known each other. It meant the world to me. And then things went back to the way they were. We've been talking and I've been casually flirting with her but nothing really comes of it and it feels like we never even had the talk we did. Everything in me knows this is just one of those, I should talk to her so that's not a worry.

I guess I just kinda wanted to throw my hat in the ring and vent whats on my mind. It kinda just helped to be able to write it all down.",lonely,I think I'm just tired of having hopes,2021-07-24 14:07:33

I would just like to put out there that it does feel quite a bit intense when alone and the nighttime crosses. I am sure a lot of us do and some of us can't bare the pain or feeling of that so we dive into various forms of the void we might say.

I think there is so much unresolved in our world and so little direct outlets to confront this often makes us feel so horrible throughout the day... esp at night.

If anyone might be interested in talking along these lines or just hanging out, being with ea other no matter our gender... I think that would be special.

I long for friends that are open to talking about anything and accepting each other no matter how different we may be from ea other.

Sometimes I can be really deep but I also like dialing it down a bit or finding some dark humor in something....

I don't really have friends that I consecutively talk to and ideally I bet for all of us that would be cool to have a few or just one... but the real world is often not so easy-going as we may wish.... maybe kind is a better word...

I didn't know I was depressed until this lockdown thing started happening, I've never been so consistently down before this, but I just have to accept that that's what I'm going through right now, people are moving forward with their lives and I'm being left behind again. People tend to leave me behind, I don't blame them, I'd probably leave me behind too.

You know what's the fucked up thing about taking your own life? It's that people are sad when you're dead, but they're not sad when you're dying in front of them. Like you have to live through this for them, even if they don't understand your pain. They don't want to understand, they just want to be comfortable at your expense. They say taking your life is selfish, what's selfish is wanting someone to live when they have nothing to live for.

I don't know what I want out of life anymore, I know what I have to do to fix this, I just don't know if I have the strength to do it.",lonely,It always rains here,2021-07-24 09:12:57

That I chose to be a person who helps others is because of someone else's smile giving by sometimes strength to keep getting on my feet.
But it comes at a heavy price, That you will never really be able to deal with your demons, because you always put it aside and over time the demons get stronger and you stay the same, so probably when you choose to try to deal with them you will lose everything.
But I will always make that choice, I prefer to put them aside, and make someone else smile.

1169,WhateverItWasILostIt,1627075367,1,"I’ve always issues with comparing myself to others, and feeling inferior, ever since I was young, but now I’m 18, it’s a lot worse. I used to count down the years until I turned 18, I couldn’t wait for it, but now that I’ve reached some level of adulthood, I feel it’s a bit overrated. At this age, people around me including my family and such, start to put pressure on you to have a certain life. Like I’m just about to start my first job at 18, which I guess it’s kinda old for some, I haven’t even taken my first driving lesson yet because the lockdowns in my country screwed all of that up, and I’ve heard of some my age getting their own apartments. My salary would barely cover rent and all other amenities myself, and to be honest I don’t think I’d like living on my own yet. 

Relationship wise, I’ve been doing long distance since I was 14, I see my boyfriend a few times every year, and I’m supposed to be moving to his country hopefully next year, but who the fuck knows. So I guess I’m not alone all the time, but considering a lot of folks my age get to see each other daily, it sucks a bit. Again, I made my bed, I choose to do this, it’s just not easy. My boyfriend’s friend is getting married soon, and that has made me feel all kinds of jealousy. They have their own house at 20, cars, and getting married. I know I’m only 18 and not long out of school, but gee, makes me feel like a fucking failure as I am no where close to that reality. 

I don’t have any friends. I do everything on my own, I went to a restaurant solo yesterday, and i saw lots of couples and tables full of friends sharing drinks and laughter. I’m not much of a social butterfly, I hate alcohol and I don’t know, I just feel super out of place doing the sort of things a lot of young people do. I feel like I live in my own fantasy land half the time, I’ve watched the movie Clueless I don’t know how many times, wishing my life was like that, then again who wouldn’t. 

I just feel I should have a lot more achieved and gained by now, I’ve been feeling like a loser for a long time. I don’t know how to stop comparing myself, it ruins everything. Everyone my age I see seems to have more going for themselves, getting married, moving in with their partner to a new place, buying cars, and I have nothing.",lonely,"“I’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me”",2021-07-24 07:22:47

All I can think about is what it's like to have someone in your life that genuinely cares about you and desires you, not just in a sexual way, but in a way where they genuinely enjoy being in your presence and they feel like you add something to their life. I can't even begin to fathom what it'd be like, having someone text you saying they can't wait to see you, to tell you how attracted to you they are, to be willing to have sex with you, to cuddle with you, to look to you for comfort and protection, to rely on you to make them laugh until they feel like they might pee themselves, to know that when you're in their presence they know everything will be ok. 

When I think about sex nowadays, it's not about the physical side of it and feeling good and get my rocks off, it's about having a connection with someone and knowing that that person truly cares for and desires you on a deeper level, and the best way they can express their feelings is by being intimate with you. It also brings me down because I know that I'll never have that, and the closest I will get to it is by staring into space and fantasizing about something so unrealistic that it may as well be in a Tolkien book.

Every day I feel like I am wasting my limited time trapped in a life and a place I have no desire to be in. I have been treated so poorly by other people that it makes me never want to interact or be around people here. And there's no sympathy for my situation, everyone ignores the pain and suffering that I experience every day. I don't see a point of continuing to live in a world where people are so narcissistic. Every day I feel deep pain inside, all I get to see is other people living their lives while I'm trapped here and my situation gets worse every day. Other people get to actually do things while I'm stuck here. I have missed out on so many things. I have seen how much people do not care about what others are going through. 

I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship. This breaks my heart every day and there's nothing that can distract me anymore. I am tired of living and tired of being alone. There is not any good in this world, there are only millions of people being manipulated, exploited, and socially controlled. And so many try to act like they aren't taking advantage of others. I'm sick of people and their pathetic petty games. They think they are being so clever but in reality they're just as idiotic as everyone else. I'm sick and tired of all the fake people who complain about how nothing is real or genuine. I'm sick of all the spoiled, entitled, narcissistic people who have never had to experience real struggle in their lives. I'm sick of hearing other humans talk, I'm tired of others trying to control how I think and getting me to live in their worlds. I'm tired of being stuck in the same place where every day is like groundhog day. 

Everyone else gets to live their lives, do things, and meet new people, meanwhile I have been stuck in this purgatory for years. And the more time goes by the worse my situation gets. For a long time I was expected to pretend like everything was fine but I don't even bother with that anymore. I know that no one cares about what I'm going through and what I had been going through for over 12 years now. The heartless and cold attitudes of others shocks me, especially when you thought you had people that cared about you. Once they meet someone else they pretty much leave you behind. People have become even more twisted and evil than they already were. These types of behaviors and attitudes will only make our society worse.

I (23M) have been having a bad case of depression lately and honestly it feels like I've been having moments of clarity thanks to it. Sorry, I'd like to post a list to at least be able to speak my mind.

1. Throughout my whole school life, I have never once been able to get into a relationship. Nor did I get any sort of attention, and you know? It hurts me a lot. Not because I think of long term, but it makes me really sad to know that I missed out a bit on the adventures of school. 
2. It doesn't help that I got many life factors that work against me too. I'm a short guy, so most of my dream jobs have been affected by it (Military, MMA, Security, etc). 
3. Man, I hated school. It was so incredibly easy to get picked on because again, my height. I'd get called nicknames for it and although I had to put a strong face for it, I couldn't get the help I needed after that. It wasn't until High School where I had to resort to bully and harass (And I am so so sorry for the people that I made their life horrible.) others in order to fly under the radar of being bullied myself.
4. My family life is not good at all. I have a brother who I never really 'met' because when I was younger, he was already moving on to having a family on his own (Around a 10 year difference.) My brother is years older than me and even has kids of his own. Kids i'd love to one day be proud of me as an uncle and maybe look up to me. Problem is, the life choices my brother has done in his life in comparison to mine are completely opposite of each other. We see things differently and although I tried my best to be the best brother I could be, he usually begins to berate on how different and good my life is in comparison to his. Why? I never asked him to leave. I never told him to have a family. I just wanted to have a brother. A brother I can rely on, speak to, have fun with and instead all I get is crap after crap because i'm such a ""Pussy"" in his words. It makes me feel horribly, horribly alone.

I fear I may never be able to find joy in my life. All the joyous and happy moments I had were in regards to my friends, parents and even strangers success. When I really think about it, I don't have any history that could make anybody remember me in the future. I'm just that guy that no one bothered to have a second thought of.

Monologue by Loxe77

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

P-please like me. Please *want* me. I-I promise I’m fun, look! I can be funny! I can not be bad like you think I am deep down. You-you’re my best friends so please don’t leave. I-if you give me another chance, I won’t be the one that- that bothers you all the time. Just promise you won’t leave me behind.

NO! Please! I’m good! I’m your best friend, I’ve always been! I’m funny! I am! Just don’t go! Don’t make me be alone again!

…

I’m bad, aren’t I? Bad in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, one way or another, your friends have left you. They don’t like you, never needed you, and no matter how much you try to hide it, the fact is that you are alone. All because of things that you did, they’ve decided that the truth is, you aren’t a friend. The truth is, you aren’t necessary. And it’s all your fault.

Maybe they cut you off completely, maybe they let you still be around. But they don’t talk to you, you talk to them. Every word they say to you is short and to the point, like it’s to talk to you as little as possible. You feel inside that they don’t quite know what to do with you. And then, when their real friends come, it’s so different- there are inside jokes and seamless laughter that you wish you were a part of, pleasure and joy that, when you’re around, doesn’t happen. Any smile to you is subtly forced.

But of course, you knew this. You knew for a long time that you were the odd one out. They’ve been having fun without you for a long time, because they know that you always make things worse by what you say or how you come off. You didn’t want to, didn’t mean to, but you scared them away. You’re just not good enough of a friend, and never were. You’re never fun to be around. You are bad and you deserve to be alone.

…that’s not what hurts the most. It’s not just the obvious things, not just that you’ve spent so much time trying to rebuild what you never actually had with them that the rejection doesn’t surprise you anymore. It’s not even just that you can do nothing to fix it. It’s the realization that they want to be without you. Without you, they get all the valuable time with the people they actually value without the chance of it being messed up by you. Even if they don’t admit it outright, they truly are happier without you, and you know it, too. They never ask you to be a part of things anymore because they know what that brings. It brings you. You aren’t just unwanted, you’re the one who people talk about when they need to cut people out of their lives, the one who hurts you, irks you, creeps you out. You are the one who can’t make them happy. It’s better for everyone that you leave and never come back. And that is what will always hurt the most.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, you do. You move on. But not really. It still hurts, even after months or years. It feels like an eternal scar, and every now and then even in spite of trying to be fun, trying to be what someone wants, you feel it again, experience the loss all over. And that’s when you’ll know, when you’ll feel inside, that a part of you will always be the unnecessary one, no matter how hard you try.

They do want a strong and attractive man who will take control of the relationship. They don’t want “men” like me who are shy and submissive and worthless.

Ever since I graduated high school in May I very quickly realized that I have no real friends. The only friends I did have are online friends that I met through connections in school who never call or text me. And all the other friends I had have never even called me a friend. I was always classmate that they just so happen to go to school with even though we spent a lot of time together.
The only friend group I do have is one that I do not fit into at all and every time I talk to them I feel more alone than when I'm by myself.
I even tried using Tinder to try and find people to talk too and came up with nothing. So I've just kind of made the conclusion that I won't be finding anyone any time soon.

On top of this, I've been trying to publish some of my literary work for over a year now but have only amassed nothing but rejections. I've reached out to some of the people I know that claim to write if they would be willing yo read and criticize my work only for them to say yes and then never answering me again.
And it's like, man, if you're not going to do what you said  you would then don't say you're gonna do it to begin with. And it doesn't help that nobody seems to believe that I can accomplish my dreams. Every time I say I want to become a big time author people jus laugh at me and never take me seriously. I feel like I can't connect with anyone.

And to top all of this of. Apparently some old demons creeped up on my parents and after a huge fight it seems they're going to be separating.

So to sum it all, I have no friends, my writing career is a disaster, and my parents are getting a divorce. All of this while having no one to talk to and practically having to deal with all the fleeting emotions on my own. Which I'm usually good at doing, but things have just been a bit much lately.

I don’t really have a whole lot of friends.  I’ve been neglecting a lot of my relationships during covid.  But now that I see things reopening and people out and about with their friends and partners I’m feeling so aggressively alone.  I work outside so I’m all over town everyday and everywhere I go I see mobs of people roaming.  I see my peers posting on their ig stories at parties and stuff or out at the park.  I hear people having fun outside my window all evening.

It’s starting to really bother me.  I feel disgusted when I see these people, not just with myself but at them.  My thoughts are bullshit like “these animals just couldn't wait to flock outside could they”.  I even find myself wishing people would put their masks back on, like having that layer of separation will help restore the distance between everyone I’ve grown accustomed to.  Like if everyone is isolated and lonely then I'm not.

I don’t want to think these things.  I want to be happy for people who can lead normal social lives again but I just don’t have the energy to do that myself.  It especially bothers me that I’m out here working while mfs who have it easier are just having fun.  It makes me so much more aware of my place in this life.

1294,juliusthehorse,1626990051,1,"normal people talking about ""loneliness"" is misleading or make-believe.
For them loneliness is something they feel late at night when their friends/partner are asleep, when they're completely alone with their thoughts or when they're going through a heartbreak, it's temporary.
Real loneliness isn't temporary or maybe it is (I don't really know), it starts when you were just a kid (in my case)and you had no one to play or grow up with.
As you grow up, the friends you made only communicates when they need something and you decide to keep them anyway because they're the only communication you've. It gets fucked up when your so called ""childhood friends"" decide to have a reunion but you aren't invited or been told by any of your ""friend"" and you see their stories, you feel bad, angry and call them and none of them bothers to pick up because you're so irrelevant. You ditch them or probably they ditched you a long time ago. Now you are totally numb to your own emotions, you don't even know what to do or what to feel, you grow tired. You feel sorry that you don't have enough life experiences to share(because you never had friends to make ""memories""  with)
the only thing you've is this loneliness which imo majority of people don't wanna deal with and I don't blame them either cause it's something they would never understand or have to deal with because they've people around them, close friends to support them (i never had a best friend/close friend).
Even if you manage to share with someone they advise to brush it off like it is nothing, like it's something that'd disappear in a month or two.

Let me tell you something, even if you've a single close person around you who is there for you, i think you're blessed because people like me don't have that kind of privilege.

Loneliness according to me;
It is when you are unable to share your very best and worst moments.

It is when you're the very last person people talk to even tho you try hard to communicate or form a connection.

It is when you don't have enough life experiences because you never got a chance to get some (I'm not saying i don't want, i never have had the privilege)

It is when you don't know what its like to have someone who shows genuine love and support.

It is when you are the unwanted one even when you are out with a group.

It is when all of your relationships failed because you were too needy and too lonely.",lonely,People don't know what true loneliness is,2021-07-23 07:40:51

But life showed its tough side to me quite early on, so I became more introverted. Still had some friends. Not the supportive friends I would have loved to have, but I still had friends who'm I consider having been important people in my life. I had someone in my family who was a solid rock in my life. Always there for me. That person has died a few years ago and the void... it's really prominent. I have nobody left. Gradually people have fallen out of my life for reasons that have not always been mine. They have moved elsewhere. Something has gone wrong. We've drifted apart. All kinds of things. Then my relationship ended and it should have way before. I do consider that relationship to have contributed to the solitude that I now live with. It was a toxic relationship and it isolated me quite much. Now, I don't look forward to holidays or vacations anymore because I know I'll just be alone and not be invited to anything. Whenever I'm invited to something, it feels like christmas or some other huge thing, like 'omg, I'm going out to do something with someone. It's amazing. I'm looking so much forward to it' and it makes me feel so vulnerable. Like I really need things to happen, need to see people, go places, experience things and it only worsens. The solitude, it just gets worse. I feel like I'm stuck in a town where everybody I know has moved away from while everyone else has landed in a place where everything just comes together, friends, family, etc. I don't even see my family anymore, because my family dynamic is narcissistic. I'm going towards 40 years og age and people, if you are young, you have do everything in your power, to make sure that you have a social life when your're in your 30s.

It's really sunny outside and I feel guilty for spending my time indoors on such a day that i have off. gonna go to the beach and piss on a crab or something idk, maybe do loops around seagulls in my car and confuse them and round them up like the idiot cattle they are

I watched a man shoot his face off with a 12 gauge. A child being mutilated by a mob of machete-wielding men. I watched a doomed man with a crushed in face suffocate and die on his own blood while screaming, his right cheekbone crushed upwards into his eye and collapsing his eye socket.

Ice cream makes all the worries go away. It reminds me of how alone im not when I have food. Comfort. Simutaneous Disgust.

Do you ever feel like a teenager in an adult's body? or is it just me? probably autism

I chose to isolate myself at an early age i guess, it's in my nature. My genes. So many people in my past were like this, but none had such technology and culture to this degree. No wonder so many people are alone and miserable, its our lifestyle.

So many animals never leave you if you respect and love them. Endless company in the presence of other beings, entities who experience this world in such a drastically different light than us humans.

Being lonely leads to long posts like this one. Being isolated can drive people crazy and starved.

I’m here making this post hoping I can maybe find someone who can be interesting and fun to talk to or someone who can keep a good convo going with me or someone who I can be silly with or someone who shares similar interests with me and wants to talk about anything or just all of this in one. I love talking about anything and everything, I enjoy meeting new people, I wanna meet you.

Maybe I should talk about myself a bit, I’m a 19 year old male who’s loving, caring, kind, sarcastic, outgoing, goofy, sorta boring at times, sometimes anxious and really funny, wow this sounds like a PR piece except I’m the company. Well let me tell ya, everything I just said is true, but I don’t wanna just tell you that, I wanna show it and prove it to you, so you should totally become my friend.

I’m the sort of friend who will send good morning and good night texts, who’ll talk to you for 14 hours a day, who’ll give you constant compliments, who’ll watch movies with you or play games or send you memes or call you randomly, who’ll try to be a great friend who’s loyal and trustworthy, who’ll have your back always.

My hobbies include gaming, drawing, working out, working, walking/running, listening to music, telling bad jokes, trying to self improve, collecting, spending money, etc.

There’s a lot of pros with becoming friends with me but ultimately it’s your choice. All I want in a friend is someone who’s similar to me in ways I described above and someone who’s as interested and passionate as me who also doesn’t ghost. Someone who’ll initiate like I do, someone who’s excited to talk to me and shows that excitement, someone who’s just a fun person to be around and to talk to.

1326,Necessary_Willow4237,1626970978,1,"I'm so, very lonely and depressed. Have been for a LONG time...my first memory of feeling this way was when I was about 7. I decided I would run away because my family would be better off without me. I didn't want to die; I'm not even sure I even realized death was an option then. All I knew was that I was a burden and I just needed to not be around. So I tried to tie up a blanket with a few things around a stick, cartoon style. It was my main point of reference for packing and being out in the world. What ended up stopping me was that I couldn't tie the bag correctly.

I remember all through childhood thinking that the only reason people had children was to do chores and help around the house. My mom was young when she had me and had to grow up quickly and she never let me forget it. It wasn't a ""we're in this together"" type thing, it was more like my purpose was to help her -- I cooked (my mom hated to cook so I did it), I got up early on weekends to take care of my baby brother, I cleaned up around the house. Sometimes I did get to go to my friend's house for sleepovers and it was so drastically different go over there and I wished I had a close family like theirs. A family that at least acted like they loved each other.

When I got to middle school, I remember crying in my room feeling less than, like I didn't matter. I felt like I could vanish and I wouldn't be missed. I spent some time at my dad's and there was a party for me, he lived in a difference state so maybe the party was to see everyone (family and some of my dad's close friends I've known for a while, no other kids) one last time before I went home after the summer. I don't remember exactly. What I do remember is leaving the party and going upstairs to watch TV. I got through 2-3 episodes of whatever show was on before anyone came to look for me.

When I was in high school, we moved to a smaller town. My sister was born right before when I was still in middle school. My mom went back to school and my sister became my responsibility. I wasn't allowed to join school teams - Why would I want to do track when I run funny? Why would I want to be a cheerleader if I can't do flips? Why should I do volley ball if I'm not athletic? Maybe I never would have made it anyway....

When I turned 18, I didn't spend it with friends because I was with my grandmother that day in a state above the one I lived in. We didn't do much and it was fine. I was with family I didn't get to see often. I waited all day to hear from my parents. Nothing. At some point, I believe my grandmother called my dad, her son, to tell him to call me. He called around 9 pm that night and we talked for a short time. I do believe I was forgotten.

Now, as I enter 31 (spent the day alone), I'm still depressed. I'm still trying to figure out why I should even be alive. The few joys I've had in my life are gone. I used to live in a state that all through my childhood I worked towards moving to. I used to have a job that I tailored my work experience towards and loved, even on bad days. But I married someone who told me their mom was sick and might not have much longer. They are super close and that's great. So we moved to a state I had never been to and was states and states away from the place I loved and gave up my job. I made these choices and I understand that. Turns out, the mom wasn't sick. True, she was taking chemo pills but had stopped about a year before we moved. She brags about how healthy she is. I feel fooled and manipulated. To make matters worse, every time we go over, I'm ignored or asked if I want to go to someone else's house who lives nearby. What's the point of my going over? I had a suicide plan in place for years. I had decided on pills and going to sleep. I always scared myself thinking about it and never did it. When we moved was when it stopped scaring me. I still never tried anything but heavily considered it.

When I'm at home, my spouse lives for their phone. I feel lonely every day and like I live alone or with a room mate. When we watch movies, my spouse can't seem to take eyes away from the phone and asks me what just happened or what the character said. Why even pick a movie with you then? I might as well just watch what I want whether you would like it or not. Weekends, my spouse is always ""tired."" Not regular tired but stays in the bedroom all day napping. Or not napping, i really don't know. I just know that I am once again alone. I don't even feel like I can clean the house in fear of waking my spouse if they are really in need of sleep. I definitely can't put clothes away. I tend to spend way too much time on the couch. I've tried to mention it but told that it isn't true - ""Whatever, I'm not on my phone that much.""

On my 30th birthday, a milestone birthday, and happened to be on a holiday 3 day weekend. My dad sent me a text, my mom called me around 5 or 6, and my spouse worked. I spent the day alone and tried not to cry. So I went to the mall and walked around just to get out (this was pre-covid). I was hoping to go out for dinner that night. Even looked up a place I wanted to check out. My spouse wanted to make sandwiches for dinner that night..didn't even ask me what I wanted to do. I had to practically beg to please let's go out, and then I drove us there.

I don't have many friends anymore. Most days I do not even really hear another human voice, unless podcasts count. I've moved a few times and lost friends each time, just fell out of touch, no big deal. I tried therapy twice but neither time I felt like it helped. I was just recapping my day most of the time. It felt like a waste of time and money. I don't have much of an income these days so I can't even afford it anyway. All I want is a reason to exist. How can I justify it if I am just a burden, an annoyance, not worth being around? I've even stopped ""performing"" and actively trying to get attention. Never worked anyway. No more ""look at me's,"" just fading into the black where I seem to belong.",lonely,Forever Lonely and Depressed,2021-07-23 02:22:58

Before I left my friends were praising me wishing me luck and claiming to talk to me once I had the chance. Finished boot camp and MCT and awaiting school house training. I've made it blatantly clear that I'm available but nobody ever texts, calls, asks me how I'm doing.

 I texted a friend I used to work with and I said I was looking to catch up. He asked me who I was as I got a new number. Told him my name and have never received a response. 

Another instance. I called a friend in my contacts and we chatted for a bit. He said he was busy and that he would call me the following day. That was a month ago. Still nothing. Friends never text me asking me how I'm doing and the fact of the matter is I'm doing terrible. I'm in the lowest part of my life with no one in my corner. 

I haven't gotten boot leave because of covid. By the time I do get my leave, I would've been away from home for 10 months. I was so excited to go back home and see friends but it's clear to me they want nothing to do with me. I haven't done anything to wrong them. They just don't want anything to do with me.

I don't get it, is it because I still love him and the hell am I supposed to do with that, even though he ended it I was thinking about doing the same so I was slightly happy that I won't have to pull that pain lever but even so I still loved him and maybe still do 

can I love anyone else, he was the first human being I felt anything towards in all of my 21y of life he can't be the last or can he 

I know I have to just let go but is it so fucking hard we can't be together that much has been established 

curious does he think in a similar way or has he managed to let go already is was about a week 24h+- curious what will I feel if I find out 

I was hoping that he would say something and was thinking about saying something myself especially about one provocative thing I saw but concluded that it would be the best to just disappear from his life sense we can't be together and I'm incapable of maintaining friendships trying to keep in touch will probably only cause him pain 

the reason for the breakup was really dumb in my eyes but that was my reason to want to end it if is ready to give up after this... na fuck this shit I'm out

it's just so hard to accept, he wasn't really my taste, but he made my dreams come true once in my life I really felt like I'm not alone I will never forget it, the way the pain in my chest was replaced with pleasant warmth the way I could look in his eyes he made all my past dreams come true 

and then gave up on it...... at this point I realized that I was complaining allot about him but just saying the once who will dare to talk down on no longer my bunnycorn will have to spend the weekend trying to pull out my army boot out of their ass

1338,throwaway_14091995,1626965607,1,"My online fwb ghosted me mid-conversation, cold turkey after one month of doing things together.


I was emotionally invested because he told me he wanted an emotional connection, told me that it was a safe space, that honesty was integral for the both of us. 


I was also given the assurance that I wouldn't be ghosted, that I deserved much better than the randos who ghost after getting what they want.


He ghosted a few times but always came around, apologetic. I had and still have zero expectation of how I'd be treated, and I knew he needed space so I was never upset.


And I always, always told him he could end it whenever he wanted that he never owed me an explanation because we weren't in a relationship.


I guess a little shred of me always knew he'd come back. So when he didn't come back two weeks ago, my mind started racing.


See his sweet talking didn't hurt me, the way he validated me didn't hurt me - it was what he promised me, that he wouldn't ghost me. And now he's gone.


I know how stupid it sounds but I'm honestly just so sick and tired of doing this over and over again. I texted him, pouring my heart out but I guess how I feel doesn't matter one bit to him. He got what he wanted, he sees me as nothing but body parts and he's gone. I'm the idiot here.


I trusted him I guess, not to ghost me. I will never know now what I did wrong. It hurts so much. I thought I did everything right. All I needed was a ""I can't do this anymore"" and we'd be good but it seems I don't even deserve that.

1391,sondermori,1626924500,1,"\*Here we go..\*

Lately, I've been feeling like I want to get away from it all, hiding in my apartment. But these walls can't even prevent the noise from my neighbor's apartment from seeping, let alone all my \*\*existential problems\*\*.

Do you guys ever think about how stupid some of this shit is though? LIKE SERIOUSLY?? We have this beautiful world, with so many interesting things to explore.. But as humans, you’re lucky to work a 9-5 and spend forty hours of your week shoving your face into work, and probably like a solid 8 hours commuting. Is this the American dream they were talking about. OHHH BOY can’t wait to work my entire life so I have just enough money to enjoy my final years, when I’m old and my health is in decline and like half my peers are dead anyways. Then I die. Ugh.

I suppose I’m a bit bitter still, I’ve not come to terms with my newly discovered nihilism. I’ve recently exited the bubble of college, and discovered the wall of never ending work ahead of me. And, yikes. It really terrifies me, like it’d be one thing if I knew what work I loved doing..but I don’t. Truly finding work you love seems like a mystical idea anyways, like its gotta be right up there with finding ‘true love’ or in reality- someone you’re just really compatible with. CHANCES ARE SLIM TO NONE. And honestly, I’m looking in the mirror and I don’t have a lot to offer anyways.

I just wish things were more equally distributed, like you could actually make things from passion jobs in the arts, or well. For a while I wanted to become an occupational therapist, but I’ve gotta piss myself into debt for a Master’s degree..which they’re upgrading to a doctorate requirement..to yes work a fulfilling job. But barely make like 60k from it? Which isn’t bad..if you don’t consider you’ve gone to school for 6+ years and are now carrying around that burden of debt, so you’re pressured to stay in work you don’t want to do to keep paying the bills. I mean ffs. I wish college in America wasn’t so trash.. AND YET. There’s so many stupid jobs these days that are requiring higher degree qualifications, or requiring a four year degree for work that definitely doesn’t need a four year and doesn’t pay like one either. Blah blah blah capitalism, but it feels like the job market is getting worse and worse. It’s so hard to find a job that just gives 9-5 hours these days that covers your needs.. And there’s only certain industries that make you decent wages, because at the end of the day our entire fucking lives and economic seem to revolve around chasing the bag and staying afloat. We made this shit waay too complicated, and there’s not many winners.

But I guess work isn’t everything. Ugh. I’m beginning to really dislike people. Not that it's any of your fault, I’m sure it’s not. Just peeling back the layers.. So difficult. And us humans love to obsess over things that don’t really matter, I won’t disagree with this. Most of us are the center of our universe, when we are in reality cosmic space crumbs among billions of other crumbs, living on a pebble among infinite amounts of pebbles. We aren’t shit, and we shouldn’t take things so seriously, yet we draw up these dumb fucking social norms acting like something is normal and something isn’t. No you just made this thing up in your mind, what is culturally acceptable changes with place and time, morals will change as things pass and one day we’ll be looked back on like we look at boomers. It all feels like a sick twisted game you have to play to get to some sort of meaningful human interaction. Like stepping around eggshells. It feels like we need to be extra careful these days, hide our true feelings from others because oooh oooh what if that’s not socially acceptable, like why does it feel like there’s some sort of unspoken time to disclose personal information?? I just want to get into the juicy shit, I just want to be myself. I fear words so much too, but I recognize they don’t matter that much and I want them to matter less. Yet, we’re all so lonely and depressed. People have never been more isolated when the potential for connection is there. I’ve started tossing myself out into the social sphere, and IT IS STILL SO HARD. We all crave and want acceptance from others, yet people are so quick to hurt each other. Because we’re the most important ones right, but when you think for yourself too much more than other people, then you’re just gonna end up alone in the end anyways. And I think this is where we out, too many people on autopilot just winging it.

Ha, that’s not even touching on all the needless human suffering, the oncoming climate disaster, I don’t even think the world is going to end. It’s just going to become more and more of a dumpster fire. But sometimes I feel like my mind is what traps me the most. I’m diagnosed autistic and socially anxious, basically. Everything terrifies me. If I want to take a risk, go approach a stranger! Talk to them!! Well then I’m going to get this immense pressure in my stomach and hesitate, I’ve always had this happen and it’s starved me of human connection for so long. But at the same time, my brain is so fucking stupid and I miss cues with the people I have cared about and then they end up leaving or becoming emotionally distant. I just feel like the limitations of my biology have held me back from so much, and I’m scared out of my mind I’ll never be able to face them fully. I know things aren’t that deep, I just want to have a good time at least, but it’s like my body resists it with everything. I’m so lazy and my social battery runs out faster than a triple A in an arctic chill. I wish I could be more helpful to others, but I can only do so much before I can’t even keep myself going. If it could, my inner monkey brain would have me sitting around all day watching youtube videos, sitting in bed, doing absolutely nothing and going nowhere. Just wasting time as father time slowly slides me on a conveyor belt towards my own mortality. I just feel trapped in my mind surrounded by chaos where everything requires so much effort and has so much risk. 

I guess I still have to try though you know, but lately I don’t know anymore. I’m not suicidal, but living just feels so pointless. It feels more and more like hunter gatherer life was the shit. I mean I don’t fancy myself becoming a primordial baguette, but the other stuff! If my whole life was just going out and hunting something, or gathering berries and herbs, then I can come back and spend my days with my family and friends just having a good time. Simple living seems so nice, but alas. Healthcare. I’m not trying to glorify it that much though, there’s always cons to something. But I just long for the times before we made things so tediously overly complicated, when we were actually connected with the world and the people around us. Recently, I quit my job, and I want to roll my dice again.. See where I end up. Maybe it’ll be better, probably not. I do think the world has so much potential though, why are we even here? Like this place is beautiful, our numbing lives distract us from it. And at our core, humans can be too, if only we were nicer to each other.. Anyways, if anyones made this deep, I apologize but appreciate it. Wow you’ve got some endurance friends, I’d love to hear you share anything you’re going through in the comments.. Or just send something funny because things are depressing enough already. But really. I’m open.",lonely,"The world is so big and overwhelming, and I feel so tired.",2021-07-22 13:28:20

Most of us around 26 (my age), another good chunk is around 20 and other are around 30. Almost All of the cousins I am close with are in committed relationships. The ones that currently aren't have at least introduced a BF/GF to the family. I have never had any type of relationship. Most of the time when I hang out with my family I find myself 3rd (5th, 7th, 9th etc) wheeling. IM thinking of moving out of state because I feel like I need a new start, also the state i am thinking of has a lot of opportunities for my job. A big reason I feel like is due to how I feel like everyone around me is making their lives and Im just here by myself doing nothing. I know my family loves me and they keep me included in everything but it's getting to the point where I feel like it's a matter of time before everybody goes their own way due to them having families, or moving out of town, etc. One of my cousin  (one of the 26 year olds) had a daughter 2 years ago and moved to a better town. Another of my cousins just found out they are having twins(one of the 30 year olds), and now I just found out another cousin of mine is having a baby (the youngest cousin who is 20). Another cousin lives with his GF and is talking about buying a house next year, another cousin is already so committed he has stayed overnight at his GF's house in her room and she still lives with her parents and their parents were the ones who encouraged it, just to show how committed they are. 

I have another group of cousins who we are not very close with because they live in a different state and they are all around 40. One of them also has never been in a relationship (to the family's knowledge) and we love him and respect him but it has somewhat become a joke within the family (especially between the uncles) that he dates nobody. Im afraid this is where I am headed. 

My one fear is that I may be alone in this new state, more alone than I feel now. I've always been clsoe to family and don't know how I would deal with it if i moved and was alone., I've asked my job for a transfer and they told me to apply to the position I want. There is one I want in the state I want to move to, but the fear of possibly being alone is preventing me from clicking submit on the application.

I just don’t want to be a virgin when I go into college, even though I know that wouldn’t be the end of the world. I guess just social pressure and for lack of a better word society make me feel like a loser because I’ve never been kissed at almost 17. I guess Reddit is the virgin utopia so asking for advice on dating isn’t the best idea.

Love can be so hard to see. Especially when you are in pain. When your heart feels it’s been pulled…hurt and strained. He used all the arrows against me. And every one of them so strong. But the pain was a reminder to keep going. To Always be strong. Sometimes we don’t always feel that strength. But it’s there if you look again🥰💕. I want you to be brave. To be strong. Even if you need a hand💕. Many times we have suffered. It feels almost unreal. But love is there to comfort us. To help us grow and to heal. If you’ve never felt that love. That’s ok too😊💕. If you ever need that loving heart? Call on me and I will be there for you. A girl like me? Chooses to believe💕. No matter the painful experiences received. I have known many. Lots of you have too. But know that a caring heart exists. 🥰and this one will always be there for you.

During that month (January 2021) I was going through really negative emotions. I was feeling really sad and really lonely. I cried quite often, too. So I joined this subreddit Discord's server in hope to find someone who was super nice to me and comforted me. The greeting message said something like ""Welcome \[username\]. You're not lonely anymore"" and to be honest I was super happy of that greeting message! Then I tried to make some friends there and didn't go well. I complained that I was feeling lonely and that I needed comfort and I wanted someone to send me hug GIF's then people started getting really angry at me, ignoring me, then eventually I got banned. And I'm still banned.  


I just wanted to tell you, I don't care about this anymore, LOL! I feel better now. But this is because I tried to improve myself and my emotional needs as much as I could. I have realized eventually that even on the places on the Internet that tell you they will comfort you from your sadness and loneliness... it's not true at all. It's a harsh world that we live in and the vast majority of people will not comfort you. Sad but true. There's no server or anywhere on the Internet or even in real life where people will comfort you from your loneliness or be really sweet and nice to you like that. It would be beautiful if it existed but it doesn't exist. And I have learned that myself after I got banned from the Discord server and didn't get comforted at all!

Do you know how special you are?  You're probably saying ""I'm not that special - I'm nobody""

So let me tell you exactly how special you are.

All the people in this group are people who struggle with a certain difficulty every day,
They go through really dark moments in their lives, and sometimes it seems to them that they no longer have the strength to keep fighting.
But as soon as they read a post by another member of the group that shares how hard it is for him and how much he no longer has the strength for anything.
So they stop everything, and send him messages, and try to support him, and send him some strength to keep getting back on his feet.
They would support him, and try to be there for him until they knew he was feeling a little better.
Do you know how strong a person needs to be to be able to do that?
You know how special it is that you choose to respond and support and not stand aside?
you!
Special, strong, and a good, caring person!

Yes you!

I know that sometimes it is difficult for us to see ourselves in a positive light so we as people who are deep in the dark, can think positively about someone else who needs help.

Then you will know that we are all together.

We will always support you in the best way you can

And will make you realize that you need to stay alive.
Because not everyone will say the encouraging words you say,
Because not everyone is willing to put all their pain aside just to make someone else feel good,

Because a person like you has only one!

You are special in your own way, and there is no one like you in your personality, and in the light you bring to this world.

So keep fighting, Good days will come, when they come you will feel it was worth not giving up!

You are capable of it!

You're the best!

I'm so proud of you, how strong you become day after day!",lonely,To all the people in this group! Listen to me!,2021-07-22 03:55:27

We would always flirt back and forth but nothing really happened between us and I eventually got over it, knowing she was interested in other guys. 

Just recently we went on a trip together, just the two of us. Spending all that time together caused the feelings to come back even stronger than before for me.  I know she's not interested because the day after we got back we were hanging out with a group and she was all over this other guy that I knew she had been talking to for a bit already.  I guess the one upside for me is that day with that group of her friends I met another girl who I really enjoyed hanging out with that day and felt a bit of a connection with her.  

I know that I can get over the feelings I had for my friend because I already accepted that she wouldn't be good for me to date, but the concept of it all bothers me.  I tried really hard to get her to like me, but she was always interested in other guys.  I can't help but feel like she keeps me around as a friend only as a backup plan if things don't work out with other guys, and that's why she always flirted with me just enough to keep me interested.

I'm only bummed out because she is the first girl I have felt any kind of feelings toward in about 2 years since the end of my last relationship.  I don't resent her for being interested in other guys, I just really wish that someone would be interested in me, and I tried as hard as I could with her.

Before you give up
Look at yourself in the mirror without the illusion of time
Look at the distance between us
Could be counted in fading scars 
Not seconds 
Before you abandon hope
Remember that  being enough
Has less to do with who you are 
And more with who you could be
Before you give in to the voices in your head 
I need to tell you that your ideas will never silence 
So try to reshape them 
Let them radiate through you 
Before you become Better with people
Understand that loneliness is Nothing compared to unshared happiness 
The world is full of beautiful people
In the most unexpected ways
So learn to trust them 
Sometimes I wish you could see yourself Through my eyes
And that I realize that you will 
For now 
Stare into the mirror in front of you 
As if you can realize that imperfection  is another human construct 
And if you still want to give up
nd if you still want to give in to those voices 
If you are still going to bed hoping that you will never wake up
Place your hand on your heart 
And feel the blood inside of us 
Let each breath carry you into that future 
Until you become one

It gets better

She was cool, energetic, and incredibly pretty so naturally I had an enormous crush on her. She ended up moving away in HS and I thought I'd missed my chance until she came back into my friend group tbis discord last year. One thing led to another and she decided to come visit for a few weeks and I decided I'd tell her how I felt then. Proceeded to do so, and found that she has a similar interest in me, so we decided to try to find time for a date next time she was in town. Fast forward 6 months, with some talking and letter writing involved, and I'm incredibly excited to see her again. She flies in and stays with another friend, and when I get there we're all hanging out as a gang of friends. All is cool and well right? A couple days go by and I can't get a read on the situation so I ask her and she says that ""the spark that was there, isn't anymore. Sorry."" Naturally, I'm pretty crushed considering I'd spent the last 6 months daydreaming about how great it'd be. Obviously, none of my expectations or daydreams are her responsibility to fulfill, but I'm still pretty upset and a little bit angry for having been lead on and strung along, even unintentionally. The other side of my (rapidly deteriorating) mental state is that I haven't had a partner in more than 7 years, although I've had several rejections, several standing ups, and dozens of ghostings in that time. Long story short, I'm pretty hopeless right now and kinda just wishing the ""dying alone"" part could happen a little quicker. Not suicidal or anything, just kinda done with living.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to difficult childhood with no father and not really caring mother, in poverty, I ended up being an IT in big company. Sounds nice is it not?  Ye, but the corp work gets as toxic as it can sometimes, and I'm not a predator like other ones, so I left. I started my own IT company, moved out and that's it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well no, while I was in corporation I hit my lowest point, since I was alone, and still am. I decided to do the most stupid thing in my life. I took a bunch of loans from bank for about 50 000 euro total. It was supposed to be my golden days, make memories, spend it all, don't look back, end it all later. I lived with this idea, with the date in the calendar marked as death day. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, life pulled a prank on me, or more like my brain pulled a prank on me. More close to date, the life got better somehow. I had a change in mind, reconnected with some old friends, quit this toxic job, made company that pays less than old job, but it's something. Renegotiated my loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And now I sit here, 40 000 euro in debt, my shit old car recently broke, and I don't have extra money to fix it, I can't drive to clients, so I don't earn as much. It's slowly going down again, maybe it's downhill that will later go up, or maybe it's the end of the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes cannot sleep for days and when I do, I've got nightmares.

I'm always awake at night, which I'm used to by now. But I'm still not used to the loneliness. I feel too guilty to wake people up, but I just lay here for hours remembering awful shit that happened to me. My subconscious remembers for my and I just have to deal with it.

I often wish I had someone who was enamored with me. Awake with me here, keeping me company because they want to talk with me. Maybe we would talk about the nightmares, and they would listen, just to do it, or because they want to be around me. I want them to text me first, to ask me how I'm doing without making me worry that I'm intrusive. It's an awful thought, but I want to be wanted and thought about just to know that I am capable of being wanted and desired. The possibility of truly being loved without strings attached is too unthinkable. I'll take infatuation for now.

And worst of all, I don't really understand why.. we are both very very polite, well mannered, quite funny when we are in groups, we seem to get on with people, but nobody ever wants to talk once the group disperses, I have not had one message during covid to check im doing okay, infact I probably have not had a message asking how I am in 10 years, except from my family! 

I am very good at 'takint things on the chin' but it's really starting to get me down that I am likely to die without any freinds, and I don't really like the idea of having no friends, I like being social.

That process wreaked havoc on my body and still is, so I’ve been very emotional and it’s hitting me that I need to really live my life right now. I love my boyfriend and it was the hardest decision either of us have ever made, we were not ready to handle a pregnancy let alone becoming parents.

I don’t really know where to find new friends and I’m not good at maintaining relationships but just some people to do fun shit with a few times a week?? I love my 3 best friends but two of them are a self absorbed train wrecks and the other is my best best friend in the world and she has no interest in being more social.

I graduated right when the pandemic started. I never got a full time job because of the Covid-19 situation as no companies were hiring. 

I decided to do unpaid internship for 1.5 years. While I was in my last internship my CEO told  me he would hire me after 3 months. After the 3 months and completing my 3 months of internship another delta variant outbreak happened. When I asked him when will I become full time and start getting paid he said not sure. 

During my internship time I was doing odd jobs just to survive. I would work as a waiter at various events, work as a uber eats deliver guy and do any odd jobs to pay the bill. I never wanted to put pressure on my parents to send me money. 

I also tried to follow that one thing I was passionate about which was being a DJ but the pandemic situation again stopped me.

That’s when I started accepting offers on my LinkedIn there was recruiter who messaged me from WPP (AKQA Media). 

I did my first interview with them got through the next round and then in the final round they asked me to do a presentation for of their clients told me it was an assignment I did a whole website audit spent a 3 to 4 whole days behind the presentation. Went through the final round this is where I got a congratulations email “congratulations on your offer” I was so happy I called my parents and then I made a mistake by updating my LinkedIn. That’s how my the other company where I was interning found out I was applying for other jobs. So they removed from their company’s internal messaging system Slack. 

Two days later I found out WPP (AKQA Media) wouldn’t hire me because of my visa conditions I currently have a year left on my visa and to apply for an extension I need to be working in my field for at lest year (paid job). 

Today, my girlfriend with whom I was in a long distance (USA) relationship for 3 years broke up with me.  We met when she came here on exchange, we stayed with each other physically for a year and then 2 years of long distance. I was going to ask her to marry me after I got my offer from WPP (AKQA media).

I feel like I have lost in life and I have nothing to look forward to. I feel like life gives me good things in life but they some defects like I had my girlfriend but she wasn’t there with me physically, I had a job but it was an unpaid internship and then I got a job offer but it was withdrawn.

1514,the-unseen-mirror,1626840568,1,"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I didn't know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...

I don't think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems thats a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that didn't require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. 

ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story doesn't sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I don't have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I don't have a circle of friends thats interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I don't promote? 

Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it's quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like thats a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. 

I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I don't really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. 

End: I really don't like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I can't see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

The thing about Real love? Is that it can never hurt. Only our bad experiences…our worst trials. Make love sometimes appear the worst. Love was never meant to be a game. Never supposed to make us cry. But when one abuses our love and betrays us? Our hearts want to give up the fight. When love is abused…and trust is broken like a seal. It is the pain that blinds us. And make us wonder if true love is even real. When our love for the one in the past was only left to wither….it is the rejection we feel that makes us cold and bitter. But the one that chooses to look past the heart in the very face of pain? Is indeed the one who knows love is true. And this truth is how we begin again.😊💕💕Don’t ever think that love is the reason for your pain. Love will never hurt us. It was never meant to be a game. 



As a female…I know sometimes it feels that every man will hurt you. And no man will treasure your heart. But I believe that not all men are the same .😊💕 Men have been hurt by women too. Not all women will break your heart. A soul that will cherish your heart no matter what. This is the love I wish for. And you wish for it too.🥰",lonely,🥰🥰,2021-07-21 13:25:09

(Really, I realized I was the only one tending to/caring for the friendships, and stopped talking to these people and haven’t heard from them since.) I have had to work full time, sometimes at 2 jobs at a time, since college. I don’t enjoy drinking like my friends do, because I no longer get drunk due to have built a tolerance. Friends never care for me in the same way I do them. I do have one best friend, but she moved an hour away, and I can’t just come to her place to hang out after work anymore. 

I spent the last year of my life in a relationship with the guy I really thought I’d marry. He left me in April and it’s 3 months later and I’m still so broken. I do not miss HIM, as he was toxic. But damn, I miss that feeling of always having someone to talk to. I miss having someone to hold. I’ve been calling my mother often just to have someone to talk to, but I know she’s growing tired of tending to me. I want to be a child again, and have someone to hold me when I cry. I miss my mom and dad and wish I could just go home.",lonely,21 in college and no friends to show for it,2021-07-21 13:00:00

As everyone who knows me personally knows full well I have struggled with mental health difficulties since I was a child. It's how I'm described, whether people mean it or not. ""Oh, that's so and so, she struggles with her nerves."" or ""I don't know what else to mention about you. You're not working or studying."" And you know what, maybe they are right. I haven't been able to hold a job since, well, since I started working at 18. Every time I feel overwhelming panic and begin to cry. You can guess what happens during studying too. The exact same. I feel like a coward. I can slowly feel myself getting ill again and I don't know where to turn to. Losing sense of reality. Feeling like I'm too damaged for my own good. I don't know if I'm capable of feeling love anymore or giving it out, atleast properly. As my mother once called it I am ""delusional"". I get like this which frankly is a pain for everyone involved but it is something I have not learnt to switch off nor deal with. I don't even know if I want to deal with it anymore. The amount of therapists I have seen, the antidepressants I have took, hypnotherapy classes, exercise, you name it. It all comes back to me somehow. Although, there is one thing that just about helps and that's writing. I'd say talking too but I'm not much of a talker. I much prefer to write about the way I'm feeling which leads me here.

1529,EyeNeedUnban,1626832675,1,"First time posting, been lurking for almost 1.5 year or so. Why is it so hard to meet anyone online or irl and be able to talk to them? No one seems to care at all about anyone these days. All these people tend to have certain friend groups they are already in and so they don't need new people in their lives. I have been bullied since I was 5 (currently am 20) and have always been a outcast I haven no siblings nor family I can talk to. So growing up I literally had no interaction with anyone and this has caused me to become a very social awkward human till around age of 13 after that I started to just go around trying to fit in with people and adjust to them but I never was like really friends with anyone I was just that invisible guy in the back who you only notice if  you accidentally walked up against him. Since I have been adjusting to others I no longer no how to act and be myself towards anyone. I don't know what I like or hate! This seems to be a very big issue for others around my age they don't like someone who doesn't know what he really likes. So I decided to figure out what I like and tried to improving myself.  But doing this I noticed nothing will really change. My life will stay the same even f I improve for myself sure it will increase quality of life but the craving for human interaction will  always still remain. I have been trying my best to get rid of craving for human interaction with others but I just can't do it. It always comes back this empty hole inside of me starts to become bigger and bigger day by day. 7 Billion other humans on this earth and yet no one is willing to talk to me. What am I doing wrong T\_T?   
How can I interact with other humans while not creeping them out? Because telling someone I  am a loner and don't really know how to interact with you and being honest seems to scare people off!

Does it stay the same? Am i destined to be alone? Is this my fate? Only time can tell   
If you would like to be friends with me and teach me how to interact, please dm me! I have literally no one besides my parents who don't understand why I am a failure.

1531,so_say_we_all75,1626831678,1," I don't have anyone that would care for me in the sense of being regularly checked on, had former friends betray my trust on them a while back

Been used to get one's rocks off, played for suckers in terms of being emotionally invested in past relationships and being too clingy and emotionally dependent in a relationship

I struggle being alone, and I've developed trust issues with guys recently, feeling emotionally withdrawn. People say you have to learn to be alone... well I have.... for 12 years. I've learned the feeling and it has only made me feel worse.

Looking for a patient, understanding guy to be my confidante. Know all sides about me when I feel the desire to be emotionally vulnerable

As strange as it sounds, I feel more comfortable talking to someone who's also had the short stick in life, no matter how screwed.

I can't feel comfortable being around people who pretend everything is alright and to perpetually strive for toxic positivity.... love yourself or whatever it means.

Everyday I do feel the urge to sleep all day and not want to wake up.

Sometimes I think why I should care for other people when no one came to me when I was at rock bottom... *sigh.*.. just a mess overall in terms of dealing with trust issues with people.

I don't enjoy meeting new people and preferably would want to only stick with one person whom I want to place my unconditional trust in.

Someone who is receptive to my clinginess if you will.... I'm not interested in anyone with a low threshold of tolerance of clinginess. I got my trust issues and have my reasons for it.

Also I'm looking for someone who can do frequent *(ideally everyday)* voice calls through Discord. **This is probably non-negotiable.**

\-----------------------------------------

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:**

\- Age Range: **17-37**

\- Young guy who aligns with more traditional/conservative-minded values. Is family-oriented

\- Dominant in personality, very masculine, assertive, kind, empathetic, likes to lead and be in charge in a friendship... being very proactive and wanting to in starting regular voice calls, feeling that I greatly matter in their life.

\- Has a strong moral compass and have a personal code of integrity, honesty, honor and respect *(very important to me)*

\- Calm and collected

\- Physically Affectionate

\------------------------------------------

**INTERESTS/HOBBIES:**

\- Doing a Masters in International Relations -&gt; heading into politics/govt/security/defence; plan to do some private sector work

\- Reading *(towards non-fiction/autobiographies; also on US Navy Naval Warfare and prior battles of the Marine Corps)*

\- Drawing *(military sketches usually)*

\- Watching archived news coverage of events, military combat footage/combat marksmanship training/training exercise vids

\- Emergency services/siren enthusiast

\- Aviation *(including watching flight sim vids)*

\- **Gaming:** State of Decay 2, Skyrim, Just Cause 2, Mass Effect, American Truck Simulator, GTA V LSPDFR *(law enforcement mod)*",lonely,22 MtF Australia/US - I'm not a priority to anyone and probably settling for a friendship because of people,2021-07-21 11:41:18

Even though I don’t love her, I’m desperate to forgive her. I suspect she is also a damaged product of bad parenting. Even believing that, even wanting to forgive, I struggle to deny the anger inside me at my misshapen life.

I explained and they said I was on drugs, I said that's technically true but they were smoking weed (I smoke too) so I figured this is something in common we have. I said what drugs I have and they wanted some of them, I said yeah okay (I was a dealer and still dabble hope y'all don't [or do, your choice] judge me I gotta make some money somehow), then it turned, they said I look like I have leprosy or aids and to not come near them but go home and lie down. Or I should call an ambulance I'll take care of your bike. (first said just hand us the drugs you have, I was like no I've seen no payment, were in plain view etc).  
  
Ended with the black guy just yelling at me like mate just get the fuck out of here! I said but I do poi here like 4 hours a day I wanna do poi and he just yelled mate I don't give a shit what the fuck is wrong with you, what the fuck is your hair (then shared that with his friends). I said I'm autistic and can't pick up on facial or vibe cues well, and they just started laughing saying yeah I bet mate your so fucked up!  
  
I get on my bike and go to another dark area (not as dark but still can see the LEDs) and they followed me, kept yelling that I should get out the park and coz I just so happened to be near children (the slides/swings are quite close but not close enough to talk to anyone) started warning the parents that I was a psycho and would hurt them, then that I was a pedo, also to avoid my 'weapons'. Then they threatened to call the police due to the drugs (I only had my scripted meds on me), but eventually they got bored and left (I was wearing earbuds and doing poi the whole time).  
  
But as best as I could to ignore the whole thing I could feel it messing with my flow, my day really, like I'm still thinking about it now. So I started to pack up when someone else came over, I thought they were another c*nt and was already crying so just stared him right in the eye. He just asked if I was okay and if they were bullying me, and to tell them to fuck off in the future, that he liked my poi and saw it a lot. I said oh no it's all fine, but he kept saying fuck em and if they were around when he was just look for him. We fistbumped I cried some more then left.  
  
I feel like shit, initially I thought it was a possible quick friendship (has happened before, I know most people who walk dogs etc there) but it turned into an absolute nightmare. I really want to go out and do poi but I don't want to see them again and it's pretty obvious in the dark. I feel like shit",lonely,I feel like shit,2021-07-21 07:03:22

Flash forward to a couple of years later, now it seems they all have closer, nicer friends -- which is totally normal and understandable. Of course, life goes on. Of course, our high school friend group is no longer. Of course, they make meet new people and make new friends, and post all about it on their little Instagram stories. 

But... not me. Even though I also have new people around me, I'm not really as close with them. And they have better friends of their own, anyway.

I'd still consider my old friends to be my best friends, despite the fact that we text only once in a while, maybe exchange a dm or two on Instagram, and never have any proper conversations anymore. Our group chat on iMessage is so dead, and if I send something, the fastest response I get is the next day, or maybe get left on read: no one really cares. When I do talk with one of my old friends, she keeps bringing up her new friends she met in college. And maybe I'm just sensitive and selfish, but I really really really hate it when people talk to me about their friends I don't know. If you prefer them so much and can't resist mentioning them every couple of minutes, then why don't you go hang out with them instead of me? I just get more miserable by the second.

I feel so stupid and hopeless for hanging on to my old friendships while not being able to move on and create new relationships like they all obviously did. I know that they definitely don't think of me as their close friend anymore. I know they don't really think of me anymore. 

They all have their new flashy friends they hang out with, confide in, whatever. Meanwhile when I arrange a netflix watchparty with an old friend, I get cancelled on. We kept rearranging the date. She cancelled on me five times without a proper apology. 

You know what the worst thing is? She keeps posting on instagram about having movie nights with her college pals. All the time. Even on that weekend we were supposed to be having OUR watchparty.

I took this time to focus on myself so I said goodbye to all those toxic people and basically glowed up very much to the point where I'm unrecognizable.

I'm so fed up of seeing the same recycled, bullshit advice coming from ""normies"". People are always quick to blame/judge a person because they have no friends. It's fucking bullshit. How am I to blame for being raised in a toxic household where I experienced abuse and neglect which resulted in me not being able to trust anyone? How am I to blame for people deciding to ghost me and turn their back on me? How am I to blame for having social anxiety due to dealing with shitty people? Why am I seen as a creep or some sort of threat to society because I'm a quiet and reserved person? Just because I'm not a loud, obnoxious asshole, doesn't mean I'm a menace. 

People always say that if you want to make friends then you have to put yourself out there, but the thing is is that nobody wants to be friends with someone that doesn't have any friends. Shocking, I know. What am I supposed to do, just walk up to a random group of people and insert myself into their conversation? If I did that I would be labelled as a creep. Let's say that I magically find someone that wants to be my friend, we all know the moment they find out that they are my only friend, they will drop me like a bad habit. So is there even a point in trying?

I'm sick and tired of people saying that if a person has little to no friends they're a ""ReD FlAg"". When people say shit like this, all they're doing is making it harder for people like us to actually put ourselves in a vulnerable position where we are asking for friendship. These type of people wouldn't last a day in our shoes. These people can't even go 24 hours without talking to their abundance of perfect friends.

1607,sinner16,1626791809,1,"There are some things that give people a feeling of shame like drug addiction, unemployment, obesity..to name a few.

There's something about being an ""alone"" person that belongs in its own category. When I started my new job, I realized that I would be asked twice about my weekend. First, if I had any plans for the weekend and then what I did ever the weekend. Before starting work, I spent a few weeks trying to formulate a response. I tried to think of something that was a lie but could never be discovered or even suspected of being one. I gave up and then had to settle for ""taking it easy"" as my response. It's embarrassing.  After several weeks of this, the questions stopped. It was clear what my life amounted to and I just had to accept it, that my boss knew.

I suppose if you just moved to a new location, you can even say to people that you don't have any friends. You can even lie and say you have friends back home, and no one will know.  Or else you might make a lot of money and can say that you work so much that it's hard to keep up with friends.

But I am in middle age and find that I have to keep my life as an alone person as secret as possible, which means I cannot talk about myself very much. I have to be vague in the hope that there's enough uncertainty about me that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Maybe I have a girlfriend, maybe not. If I did, I wouldn't be the type to talk about it.  

But it doesn't work. If you talk to people at work and never say ""oh I have a friend who works in publishing, and he/she told me ...."" or ""you wouldn't believe what happened last week, I was out with a few friends and ..."" it becomes clear that you probably don't have any friends and don't do anything.

I suppose if you have an outgoing personality and a good sense of humor, people will like you and not think about your social life. But it's rare to be that type of person and be alone without doing it on purpose.

My point is, that if you have to keep quiet about your lonely life to others, that it's almost impossible to make any friends. The only way forward is to luck out and meet people that share a hobby or interest, who are also looking to connect. 

But making friends takes a lot of time, and if you have a job, the free time is limited. If you are past your mid-30s, it's even harder as people pair up and hang out with other couples. By that time, most people already have a group of friends and don't have any desire to make new ones, unless they find instant chemistry with someone new.

As a guy, it's hard for me to imagine calling up another guy and seeing if he wants to meet for lunch. There has to be something that brings us together. I just don't have a lot of hobbies or interests that I can create a friendship around, and frankly I don't believe that's a basis for friendship anyway. 

You can't make friends without being open about your life. There's just no way around it. There is so much shame around being alone - I'd much rather reveal to someone that I shoot heroin or haven't worked in three years than say that I don't hang out or talk to any friends. I can't think of anything more embarrassing.",lonely,It's hard making friends...especially when you're alone,2021-07-21 00:36:49

1619,Leo-III-,1626783649,1,"22M, depressed and massively anxious

I was bullied and had a crappy school life, blah blah, the usual, and after school I completely broke contact with whoever I could. Then came college, same shit again, and I broke contact with everyone there too. That leaves me completely alone and somehow also feeling justified in complaining about it as though it isn't my fault entirely. I had most of a year living NEET and I guess mentally preparing myself for having to get a job. I got lucky and managed to land an apprenticeship at 18 and have been working at the same place ever since. That's roughly where my success ends.

Me being the anxious mess that I am, I struggled to interact properly with my colleagues and even over four years later, I'm just known as that quiet guy who doesn't talk and basically has no personality. I try to smile and be easy to work with, and never really had any problems with anyone and the boss seems to like me, so I guess I'm fine sitting at this desk forever. Whenever I get invited to company events, I always have some shit half-baked excuse because I'm too much of a mess to go to something like that.

After a while of having just one online friend to talk to, my mental state really started to slip downhill and I got desperate, and ended up joining a discord server for people in a similar situation. I met a few cool people there and it was all looking up for a couple months, but then I started to get too comfortable with sharing my problems and going on and on about being depressed and my anxiety, and just about anything I could think of to bitch about, even if it's just randomly feeling like shit every other night.

At this point, everyone I've ever been online friends with has had to deal with me going on and on about some random bullshit at some point, and I really do feel sorry for them. There's odds that some of them will see this, so, uh... I'm really sorry. I can't offer much more than an apology and to get out of your hair. I love you all, I just wish I was a better friend to you. I think... I just need some other way to deal with my feelings that I can keep away from the people I care about. Maybe venting on a throwaway reddit account...

Everything wrong with my life is my fault. School contacts, gone. College, gone. I might as well have not existed for the first 18 years of my life. They probably think I'm dead or something. I was (kinda embarassingly) on google+ for a while too, that's gone. Any friends I had from back then are gone, one of which no longer with us and I should have done more to help. Now this server, I just bitch and moan all day. I want to say ""it's just not fair!"" but I did it all to myself.

I should just stay alone all my life and then rot quietly. I can't apologize enough to the people I've needlessly burdened.",lonely,I am the sole cause of all of my problems but I can't stop fucking everything up for myself,2021-07-20 22:20:49

I feel like I have to open this up, somewhere I could. Today, I feel like I wish I am in an accountability group or friends where we could freely talk about things that would contribute for my progress and perspective, and I hope to contribute in return.

I moved in a different country last 7 months, I don't have friends, I didn't decide to go at a college because I feel like I don't have a reason to anyway at this moment. I have friends from the country I used to live, but now, I feel like I'm the only one reaching out to them, I'm not complaining about this one, I just see that my friends are on their own paths, and it made them unreachable for me.

So now, that I wrote this far, I realize I might not actually need friends, because to make friends is actually a sort of process and consideration of connecting with an individual, I feel like I just need someone reachable and genuine.

1625,Suicide-girl1,1626772494,1,"I discovered something that probably hurts more from moment to moment, pain releasing people you really love is just pain.
The memories they left behind, the moments they gave a smile especially for you, the moment they said they would not go, but everyone goes in the end.
You are left with questions and they are no longer there to give you answers, you do not understand the value of the relationship with the person until you lose it, And I understand this value, I give from my heart, and I am torn every time again, and broken into pieces, asking with it is better already to go back, to feel nothing.
It will not hurt like that, but I know it will hurt me more when I go there, I am like a fool going into the darkness, so that others will be good, trying to sing a part of me, that they will at least remember me, because I can not forget them.
I remember every moment every second every time the special smile popped up and surprised me, I remember the loving look, I remember the feeling of the soft kiss, I do not want to forget, I prefer it to hurt me for the rest of my life instead of forgetting.
I will just remember, thank you to everyone who chose to go, thank you for the moments you give me, they will remember forever, every special place, every important minute, I will just place it on my heart, let it be full of memories, scars, pain, and horror, I will not forget  , I'm not that kind of person, I'm just going to continue to absorb pain, I wonder how long this will hold me alive.
But as long as I live I will burn memories, thank you for the smile you only dedicated to me, it gave me a scar that will never go away, thank you...
I'm used to being the last one left behind to absorb the pain at the end ... I'm just used to ... so don't think about me, move on..think positive, always give a smile, create a good life, that's my advice, because I'm already lost.  From the moment I was born ....
Just smile and I will remember it, this happiness, I will remember the special laugh, I will remember every important minute ... it's just who I am ...

I think I have less than 50 picture of total of me with any friends from 1st grade to senior year of high-school. And I usually took them to be included in them. So I fear I will always be looked at as different and never have anybody, and not have a diagnoses for anything other than people don't like me. There has to be a reason I am the way I am. I don't smell, because for some odd reason that's something people bring up all the time when I ask on forums. No I take showers regularly and am very aware of how I spell because I'm super sensitive to smells. Unfortunately I might think it has to do with how I look... being a black women.

I’ve always taken care of my parents. My husband is avoidant and our love is ritual, not felt, and I can’t help but dream about real love through stupid Limerence. I’m often away from my kids, and they are almost full grown. I suck at my jobs, definitely not a work smarter type of person. Might be too smart to see the simple solution.  I have much to be grateful for, and this helps to find possibility, but I feel like I will always be a burden. 

I work so hard to please others that I lost myself, and I realized no one could really love me since in a lot of ways, I don’t love or care for myself. I denied it when people brought it up, and people try to be kind to me since I’m nice, but at a point, I can’t be helped. 

You can care so much for others, be so cable of loving and wanting to see them happy, the worst feeling in the world is realizing they might be happier without you. It’s a paradox. You can’t be full of love and not love yourself, because then you can’t really love others if you don’t love yourself, because deep down, they always know.

1683,wertyb,1626741716,1,"When someone asks what do you want out of life, do you respond with qualitative or quantitative objectives? What really brings happiness? What the hell is happiness? Each individual perceives what it is differently, your perfect day might be someone's everyday. ""Normal""is different for each and every person. Achieving happiness is a daunting task, it is fleeting for many. Sustaining happiness shouldn't be so difficult, but it is. You being here as a human being is a miraculous thing in itself. You are astonishing. No one knows what you've gone through to get where you are at besides you! You cannot put your happiness in someone else's hands. Go out and get your mind right. Do whatever calms you. Do whatever makes your heart beat a little faster. Make time for you. Do not give in to toxicity. Take a chance on yourself, because no one else will. You have to stand up for anything you want and grab it, hold on to it and cherish the hell out of it. In my 28 years on this earth I've only scratched the surface of what I can fail at, achieve or overcome. I've been lucky enough to have some great role models. I've also been lucky enough to meet people that I wouldn't want to meet again. I embrace these interactions, then I use them to educate myself and move on. I practice patience to the fullest extent, it can be difficult yes, but what does an emotional response really help? Whatever it is that's bothering you will not matter in a year. Things can always be worse. Go out and do things, become better for yourself. No matter how much you think you can't, you can. You've got this. You'll find people along the way that want to bring you down. You'll also find the ones that want to cheer for you and those are the ones. Those are the ones that you should open up to, find out their passions, cheer for them too. So many people are so lonely and dont want to admit it. Even the ones who are showered with attention and social butterfly's, have feelings of loneliness, yet no one addresses this. It gets swept under a rug. For this reason I challenge each and every person who reads this, to go out and ask someone how they're really doing. You'll be surprised at the responses, regardless of it being positive or negative, be accepting and understanding. You could change their perception of happiness. One little domino could start the chain reaction of a new life, or a different path to their happiness. I'm not sure why I felt the need to write this. I know what I've experienced throughout life thus far. I see life as a mountain, a challenge to get to the astonishing view at the peak. Embrace the climb, take a break to enjoy how far you've come already, sure look ahead to see where your going, but also look at where you are, retain everything you are able to.

Feeling like you don’t matter. Treating the heart with little care. Wishing your only parent could love you. Breathing in the spoiled air. My heart was born to love someone. It has much love to give.

1692,guygoingthroughlife,1626737746,1,"I’m looking for any books/anime/series/movies/podcasts/music/artists literally anything at this point - that I can essentially possibly connect to, feel something when I indulge in whatever such thing is. 
Here’s some context : 

I’m extremely depressed, I don’t exactly know what point I’m at - it’s probably extremely bad. I literally feel nothing. Anything I watch, listen to, read, hear or see just doesn’t do anything to or for me. You know how some people have a song that really motivates them or have read a book they cherish as they can relate to - a movie they re-watch as it has had some sort of impact for them emotionally or just holds a special place in their life - a song/artist that resonates with them and maybe they play such song or such artist’s music regularly or whenever they need to re-adjust or to have something that keeps them sane, has some sort of IMPACT for them. You know when you hear the start of your favourite song and you just FEEL something. Yeah I have nothing. The old things I used to like - just don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even tell you what my favourite colour is these days. I feel if I had something that actually leaves some sort of emotional impact on me - it could be the first steps of me digging out of this hole I’ve so deeply fallen into.

This may seem like I’m asking for too much but this is what I think I’m looking for: in regards to books/anime or overall context for any suggestions- I don’t want any cliches - so something like - I’ll use anime as a prime example - a storyline like such:  ‘sad lonely guy meets girl fall in love and happy now’. With books I tend to see they actually directly talk about depression as in the book itself is catered in overcoming depression if this makes any sense - for example, the book would consist of things such as ‘you’re depressed? it sucks! you should do X Y and Z to feel better’ 

I’m looking for a story - that’s depressing or just addresses depression differently or an overall theme of sadness in-explicitly - there’s no direction mention of depression but you can feel such aura from whatever material it is. The overall tone of such material is bleak - uncomfortable - clearly implementing a feeling of sadness and depression but not directly mentioned. 

Take this song for example: https://youtu.be/_iE2yFJ-8GA

In this song - you don’t hear anything like ‘I was a mess, I was depressed’ to be honest -  I have no clue what is even being said but there’s no doubt it’s a bleak sad depressing song. She refers to a lonely owl as herself such subtle things is what I’m looking for. Compared to an Artist like Phora who would directly speak about his depression - sadness from a blatant perspective.

The same can be applied for Podcast - I don’t want to hear conversations about people feeling depressed or how to overcome it. ‘Hey guys so today we’re talking about depression and how we kicked it’s butt! I overcame my depression by...’
Hopefully you get the idea 
I would rather them explain it through a fictional perspective but still have the overall theme of sadness and depression.

Reasoning is simple I can’t just jump from being depressed to happy. I need something I can connect with even at my worst. If I you can help in anyway will be much appreciated and feel free to ask any questions for more context!

I'm a 14 year old boy who's had enough.
Both my parents are dead my dad being the most recent and everything just seems empty. My dad was always there for me and at the time I took it for granted but now I realized how much I relyied on him for love and just generally a shoulder to cry on. I try and look for someone or something that brings me an equal amount of joy and I just can't find it.
Except I think I have.
There's this girl called Lilly who I'm great friends with and I know I'm 14 but I think I can say I love her. What makes her unique is the fact that she cares about me which is all I want. We both haven't had it the easiest and it's brought us closer. But the truth is that I know it could never work, because the thing about being good friends is that they tell you everything even who they like and it's not me. Even as friends she has been a shoulder to cry on and I've can help but feel like a burden and that I bring her down. So there's the part of me who wants to be happy and wants to be loved that says I should persist for her and then there's the part of me that tells me I'm a burden and that I'll bring her down and that if I really love her I should just let her go but it's difficult. I just want to die, I want to be with my dad again when times were certain and it wasn't this difficult and the fact that I know that a person as perfect as lilly doesn't come around often I know I'm going to be forever alone just like the rest of you and I'm just trying to make peace with it

She liked to say we balanced each other out but I felt like I was always making compromises so she felt that way. She would scream at me for things like planning a time for us to go somewhere or honestly anything if she wasn’t in a good mood (she yelled a week ago bc I said I had to stop at the atm and me saying that made her anxious). She broke up with me at 6am this morning because she didn’t think I was “capable of loving her”. This seemed to spring up as soon as my 1 year old has been in and out of the hospital with breathing issues.

1734,codecrunchie,1626716888,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

1738,Lusus_Naturae_,1626714186,1,"All my life I've only wanted two things. A partner who loved touching and being touched as much as me. I never thought that was too much to ask right? Everyone loves touch it's a basic human need. 

And the second was a partner who was dominant and enjoyed a female led relationship/lifestyle. I'm not talking about being a slave or anything but I like role reversal. I'm a sensitive guy and I like being protected and desired and someone being possessive of me. Someone taller than me but I'm a guy so that's not really important I'm almost six foot I know it's unlikely. 

I finally meet a girl and she doesn't like being touched. She's not very affectionate in general she's introverted and she has a sensory disorder. It's a struggle just to hug her sometimes we can go for days without anything and she's fine. I wish I could say the same. 

She told me she liked that lifestyle the same as I wanted and I was excited for that. But all she does is tell me to do chores that's her idea of this. Otherwise she talks like a baby and acts like a child. Even when we do lay together finally it's difficult to do any of things I crave or want because she's so small. 

Don't get me wrong I love her. But it's hard when none of my needs are being met. I just wish for once she would initiate something at least but it's up to me to tell her every single time that I'd like some physical attention and even then I have to describe and tell her exactly how I'd like it even though I tell her the same things every single time. 

I've spent my life neglected and alone. All I've ever wanted was someone to hold me and make me feel safe. I've had nightmares every day for over a week I didn't want to sleep the other day. I was having a depressive breakdown the other day. I was just left to deal with it. I know she's not my therapist but not even like a pat on the back or a hug or anything? I don't know.

1741,pineapple_butt13,1626712000,1," \*This is a crosspost since I just want to hear as many insights as possible to see what I can do\*

I know this story may sound cliche and basically the same as everybody else with MDD, but it still hurts and I want to get this out there.

I (22M) have been broken up with twice in the past three months, have absolutely NO friends outside of my parents and aunt, am an only child, and won't start nursing school until October of this year. I have had no guy friends for the past 3-4 years, I'm still trying to find a church that I like (no luck so far), and the only non-familial social interaction I get is when I work at the nearby nursing home as a CNA (and I've gotten no luck on making friends on that end as well).

With both of my breakups, each girl said that I am an ""amazing person"" who deserves someone ""just as wonderful as I am"" and they didn't have a whole lot of constructive criticisms to say about me. The only one that came up was that I'm a bit too clingy. And I can see that. My SO would literally be my only friend and I get very emotionally attached very quickly. I have a very romantic personality and am somewhat of a sensitive type of guy. So clinginess is pretty much within my nature and it's hard for me to shake that off (I'm dying to get a clingy SO, to be honest with you). Unfortunately, that can be a turn-off for most women and I feel like I'm denying myself if I'm not ""clingy"" (which feels like a catch-22).

Now as you can see, rejection and loneliness have been pretty close friends of mine for a long time. I desire to have a SO more than a friend, but I know that may not seem plausible or healthy (depends on where you're coming from). I've been on countless dating apps and my last two relationships came from them. I don't know if that means anything, it's just an observation. Just anything to make the rejection and loneliness go away.

And to give some additional context, I'm moderately on the spectrum, but not so much that most people notice (some people are surprised when I tell them). I tend to view the world as black-and-white more than the average person, and sometimes that can be hard to deal with (whether you're me, or a friend/SO of me). I've always been a little socially awkward, but I'd like to think that's gotten better over the years. So why do I have no friends? Maybe I don't put myself out there as much, or I'm more socially awkward than I'm aware, or I'm just in a cycle of bad luck. Who knows.

And what do I do to help soothe myself? Either drink, do pot, or go back onto dating apps. Drinking and doing pot are honestly the only two substances that help make the bad feelings go away, and I can see why people go to it so often. Its destructive physiological consequences become irrelevant in your mind when all you want is to just feel better. It doesn't help that I search out my exes' social media profiles and look at them moving on with their lives and dating adventures, but it's hard to stop for some reason.

I know all of this might sound old and hackneyed since I'm posting on this subreddit, but I honestly don't what else to do. Am I desperate? Of course I am! Mainly for a SO, but a solid group of friends is definitely something I wouldn't turn down. I guess this is what MDD does to you. Personal support, comfort, or advice would greatly be appreciated (maybe even a DM if you're up for it). Hope this makes sense.

1743,LamentableHuman,1626710142,1,"Hi. I don’t really have any friends and have never had any sort of romantic relationship in my 30 years of life. I feel like I completely wasted my youth and never got to experience a lot of things young people do. I’m pretty sure that if I actually went to see a doctor, I would be diagnosed with depression. 

There are some days I just can’t do anything, when I just sit around feeling sorry for myself, wishing I had someone to hang out with and talk to. But I think I’ve started to cope a bit better the last year or so. I’ve started to keep a journal to vent and get my thoughts down on paper. I try not to wallow in there and try to think about how I’m feeling and why I feel this way. 

I’ve been meditating every day for the past month or so and I think it really helps me. It calms me down before I go to work and before bed, and reminds me to be mindful throughout my day. I’m finally losing weight after years of trying. I’ve lost about 50lbs in the last year or so. I still have a ways to go til I’m happy with my weight, but I don’t hate the person I see in the mirror anymore. 

I’ve stopped comparing myself to everyone else. Yeah I’m not anywhere near where other people my age are in life, but I’ll just go at my own pace. I make a to-do list every night before bed for the next day. They don’t have to be big jobs, but it gives me some sense of accomplishment on my days off work. 

So yeah. I think I’m learning how to live with my loneliness. I still feel bad from time to time. I still get that lonely ache in my chest. But I think things are starting to get a bit better. Maybe just accepting the loneliness has helped. The next step is to get out the house more and learn to do things on my own. Just things like going to get something to eat or going to the cinema alone. Maybe I’ll make a post on one of the friendship subreddits and try to find an online friend.",lonely,Think I’m starting to cope a bit,2021-07-20 01:55:42

Like everyone here, I’ve made mistakes. 
I’ve made mistakes against people. 
I have never physically hurt anyone. 

I was mean with words and lost a lot of friends and family. I said hurtful, insensitive things.  These people all left me. They didn’t try to talk to me or reason with me or explain that I had hurt them.  They just walked out of my life. 

I got depressed when I noticed most of my friends and family were gone. 
I became suicidal. 

I was so low and sad and I told my remaining friends and family that I wanted to die. I was looking for sympathy, empathy and understanding. But instead these friends and family also walked out of my life. 

So now I’ve lost 3/4 of my friends and family because of my ignorant attitude, and I lost the other 1/4 when I got depressed about it. 

I have been working on being a better person for months and years,  but now I’m all alone and nobody knows that I’ve improved. My friends and family won’t even return my calls.

I spend every single moment alone, except when I go to work and am excluded by everyone there as well. I try to find a woman to love and can’t find someone in person or online. I’m just not having luck in making people enjoy my company. 

 I am so unpopular in life and on social media, or online, and I need a friend before I lose my shit. I need someone to tell me what I’m doing wrong. I really don’t know why everyone seems to hate me. 

TL;DR

I lost some friends and became depressed and then lost the rest of my friends. I am single and live alone. I work near others but I work alone. Nobody calls me. Nobody engages my posts on Instagram or Facebook. I am entirely alone and trying to become a better person but the loneliness is hurting and I’m afraid I’ll become depressed again.",lonely,Unforgiving and lonely,2021-07-19 22:08:23

1766,ConsiderationOk7330,1626693056,1,"&gt;!TLDR AT THE BOTTOM.!&lt;

I am a **lonely**, **asocial**, **autistic** and borderline **sociopathic** bastard.

A testament to this is the fact that in my **18 years of existence** I haven't made one friend and I'm here venting on a post on reddit instead of venting to a friend (like *normal* people).

I right now live with my little brother and parents.

In 2 months, I have exam that will get me admission in a MEDICAL college. My admission will probably be 2 months after the exam so that is 4 months from now.

AND AFTER THAT I'LL NEVER MEET MY FAMILY. Let me explain,

1. After that I'll go to the hostel and come home to meet my family only once in 6 months (rules dictate that).
2. Medical college is around 12 years ( MBBS + MCh , at least I hope I get to do this). I'll be 30 then when I finally go back home.. 
3. Meanwhile **my younger brother (my only friend)**, who likes computer sciences will probably go for Software engineering. So **7 years from now** he will have completed college and will look for a job. At this point he'll be in **mid 20s**, with a **high salary** and a lot of time so like *normal* people, **he'll marry** someone, in the following **5 years.**
4. So, **12 years from today**, my brother will be **starting a family**, my parents on a Euro trip ( their dream) and I'll be looking for a Hospital to work in.
5. Around **15 years from that (i.e. 25 - 30 years from today)** my parents will kick the bucket. And in these 15 years my brother will be **busy raising his family**.
6. And being the asocial bastard I am, I'll never marry so in these 15 years I'll probably be too buried in my work.
7. Being so **distant from** ***normal*** **people** and with my parents gone, I won't take care of myself and **no one will take care of me**. And finally pass away in about **5 years** from my parents death.

**This is 30-35 years from now.**

Please help me, I don't want to live miserably and die alone. Also I don't want to be so distant from my family (especially my brother) in the next 35 years.

**TLDR:** After 4 months from today, I won't meet my family (only on occasional holidays I'll meet them). I 'm sure I'll never find someone special, and finally after **35 years of loneliness**, I'll die alone.",lonely,My life is going to be miserable and lonely... please help.

1773,hopelessromantic53,1626684127,1,"I'm 28 years old and have never had a girlfriend before. Ever since I hit puberty around 15 years ago I have been obsessed with romance stories in anime and manga. At first it was more of an innocent attraction, but as the year went by, I began connecting the relationships to my own real world life, and began to feel like my personal life felt lacking, and empty somehow by comparison.

I tried talking to women over the years, but was never really able to get anything to click. Whether it be my shyness, social anxiety, or other circumstances, things just haven't really come together nicely for me. So instead, I turn to my romance stories for comfort. I get lost in the stories and characters, binge watching/reading them for hours and days on end, sometimes even losing sleep, or forgetting to eat.

Then, once I'm done, I feel unimaginable heartache, and pain. I will cry while reading the stories, and even continue to cry afterward. I am incredibly sentimental and emotional. I get so deeply attached to the fictional relationships. I also have a vivid imagination myself, and spend a large portion of my time creating imaginary fantasies and storylines in my head. Some of them I have even taken the time to write into full stories.

For some reason, though, I can't quite say this feeling is just ""happiness"". It feels very painful, and depressing even. When I am addictively engrossed in my romance stories, I forget myself, lose myself, and become one with the fiction. Every time I snap back to reality, I feel the sadness and despair take me over, and I don't even want to live my life anymore. I lay in bed, doing nothing for hours or days or weeks or even months, just wanting to forget I'm here, not wanting to acknowledge my own existence, wishing I could just live in my imagination, where I can pretend I'm experiencing the love I've always craved but know I won't ever experience in reality.

I just wanted to vent this out. I don't expect any responses. I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way. Other people have legitimate problems in life, and everything else in life has been handed to me. I've had such an easy, privileged life, blessed with a loving family and wonderful talent. Yet, I still am taken over by this melancholic stupor and emptiness, every day, for the past 15 years. I know I don't have the right to complain or feel sad when I have so many good things going for me, and yet I can't help the way I feel. I hate myself for it, deeply. I know I don't even deserve the love I desire, which is why I will never experience it. It's a never ending loop.

Even right now, I'm reading another romantic comedy manga. I've been reading it for hours, almost 110 chapters in a row without stopping. I laughed and cried while reading it, and now that I've taken a break, I'm sitting here in a daze, feeling like my heart will snap in two. Please, just let me keep living in my fantasy world.

- I'm still in some clubs, but I can't seem to get closer to any of the other members. We usually have a good time together but that's it. I've tried to ask some people if they want to hang out afterwards but nope, everyone is always busy.

- I went to concerts, conventions and courses but same thing there, I try to talk to people that look like they're there by themselves too, but I only ever get that look of ""why is this weirdo talking to me"" and some polite conversations because they obviously don't want to be rude.

- Friendship modes on dating apps are worthless. I tried bumble bff and the like but in my experience that was mostly just filled with gay/bi guys looking for something more than just friends.

- meetup apps are basically dead where I live (Switzerland) and most of the people are twice my age. And I'm not comfortable with that. I guess maybe I shouldn't be so ageist and give them a chance, but I would like to have friends in my age range, you know? (I'm 25)

- bars / clubs aren't my type of environment at all. I tried going to some but honestly I don't like talking to inebriated people and since I don't drink alcohol at all, i really feel out of place there.

- meeting people off Reddit hasn't worked out either. There aren't too many swiss people on Reddit and even fewer that want to meet up or that i have things in common with.

- online friendships are the only types of friendships I've achieved so far. It does not fulfill my need for friendship though, it feels as if I'm just talking to a super advanced AI and not really a real physical person.

I'm realizing that I've spent almost my whole life supporting others in any way that I can and I enjoy it but recently I've just been getting tired of it. Most of the time my friends are busy so they don't talk to me all that much while at the same time I'm under pressure from my parents to find a girlfriend and to get an education. My dad's work requires him to leave for extended periods of time so often I have to be the ""man of house"" and take care of my mother and sisters. And I've tried so many times to start a relationship with someone only to get friend zoned or completely ignored.

What I'm trying to say is I'm tired of supporting others while not getting much support in return. It'd be nice to have someone to talk to at the end of the day or just a hug or something you know?",lonely,Supporting role,2021-07-19 15:24:25

I used to do yoga... key word USED to. It was a yoga class I took on campus but once the campus closed, I stopped doing it. I genuinely enjoyed yoga, but now I lack the motivation to do that. I've probably only done yoga twice this whole pandemic.

I’m 27 from US. I love music and I love playing games with friends. Only problem is that I don’t have friends so I do everything alone, and being alone sucks for me. You’d think with my social anxiety I’d be fine without people around, but that’s the complete opposite. I can’t function on my own. I have trouble talking to people, yet I still crave it. I stutter sometimes, I’ll stop in the middle of a sentence and say “nevermind” a lot. If the spotlight is on me in front of a crowd, odds are I’ll probably have a panic attack (this never happened luckily but I imagine that’s what would happen). I refuse to play games alone, if I do, i won’t make it very far without getting bored, even if it was a very good game. I can’t play solo player games by my self. Although I like solo player games, just only if it’s something I’d do with a friend. Same goes for movies/tv shows. I can’t be alone or I don’t sit through it. 

I just can’t function on my own, but I’m always alone. But I prefer to be alone because of my social anxiety. But my social anxiety makes it so I crave human interaction. But I struggle when I’m with people. The few people I meet end up leaving me because of the way I am. And then I’m back in this position, Lonely and depressed. 

I wish I wasn’t so difficult. I wish I could function without people around me. Not just a stranger, but a friend. Someone who would be there through my ups and downs. I need this in my life but finding it is near impossible, definitely since I don’t get out of the house ever. It’s just a giant mess. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Just when you *think* you're just starting to get your shit together it always has a habit of falling apart.

It's weird realising that whilst you do at least have a couple friends, you can't speak to them about very much and as much as you like them, they understandably wouldn't view you as a ""best-friend"". So you're just doomed to wander around, going from one distraction to the next to push away the ever present (and now deafening) thought that not only are you quite close to being worthless, but that if you dropped off the face of the earth the very next day, nobody would notice, and if they did, they would feel as though very little has been lost from their life.",lonely,Replaceable,2021-07-19 09:26:35

I've been doing this a lot for years and have built this as a routine anytime there's a good person person at my doorsteps. I feel this is the best I can do and to point them to the right direction, I want them to help them find friends who aren't unstable &amp; mentally ill. I'm incapable of accepting anything good, it's an involuntary reaction of me to push them away or always assume everything they say is deception. Based on my persona there's no admirable qualities, I'm more of a liability in a shameful state of mental instability.

I'm in my 30s my friends work normal hours, my sister anti social ones but luckily she lives round the corner from me so I see her once a week. I've been dating but it's so hard not to become attached too quickly. I want something serious but I think it's unhealthy to go straight into something expecting that straight away. The girl I'm dating We're only seeing each other as we're cautious of Covid but she's never dated anyone before (just out) and bloody hell do I feel LONELY.

I feel so much worse now that I've been home. Like nobody cares for me. And my brain and body go into full panic mode when I know I'm facing so many days where I'll be alone and lonely. 

I know it's silly and I'll settle and I'll feel ok in a few days but it's like when my routine of being alone is interrupted and I hang out with people in a homey setting or with people I know who are all going home to be with other people partners or family or whatever I feel so ready to unalive.

Not because I want to be alone, I just don’t want to feel like a burden. Which I guess is on me because it’s my perspective of myself. Anyway. I know I’m not supposed to be lonely, I’m married, and I guess I have friends… but my friends consist of his friends, and people who have moved away. A different state away. I don’t have any who are just mine. I tried a few years ago and the people I did connect with, the people I did start to get comfortable with, we’ll they moved… to another state. So I just stopped trying. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t know how to make new friends, or how to maintain a friendship. So when I try explaining why I feel so lonely it’s usually accompanied with guilt. *I’ve done this to myself so I have no right to complain. I should be happy with the friendships I do have, even though they’d drop me the second I wasn’t with my husband (not that I see that happening any time soon). It feels like they’re friendships of convenience and/or obligation. I should be content with my husband’s company and that should be enough.* When I was little everyone said I was a “social butterfly” that I made friends easily. But I didn’t, I was just so keen to please others and needed people to like me that I mirrored who I thought I was supposed to be. Then when I grew out of that, I found I really didn’t understand people. I started to be more authentic but then I was “weird” (turns out that was just the undiagnosed adhd). So, I went back to people pleasing. Then 8 years in one really bad relationship later, I feel like I don’t really deserve to not be lonely. I feel like I’m not enough. Not a good enough friend because I don’t text enough to maintain a connection. I don’t know how to really let people in so it’s all superficial. I’m afraid to really because I truly believe as soon as I do, they’ll leave. Or change their mind about me. 
And it’s so frustrating because I’m all of this, I know I’m an interesting person. I’m capable of great insight, I’m pretty good at deep conversation, I’m open minded which makes me good at changing perspectives, I’m kind of funny, I have hobbies. I try to be kind and compassionate. Point being: I know I have good quantities and I’m not a garbage person.
I just can’t help feeling unseen. And I feel stuck. I feel like… maybe some people are just meant to be alone, to feel alone.

1890,anonymousreddit35,1626621070,1,"Hey guys, so just wanted to say a little bit about my situation and what’s going on for me before anything else so you can decide for yourself if you want to keep  reading or not. Please take the time to read this and voice your opinion or advice. I will try to not blabber to much haha. 

So I’m a straight 20 yr old Male and only ever had one relationship which ended around 3 years ago now, I’ve been struggling with social anxiety over the last 2 years and leave the house around 1 time a week for a couple hours to see other family members, other than that I’m always at home. 

Life kind of went down hill when my relationship ended, I left school, quit my job and slowly cut down my friend numbers over time. I struggle talking to anyone even in messages, I used to be a very affectionate person but even hugs from my parents nearly makes my skin crawl now. 

I’m scared I will never find love again and everything that comes with that, I am a virgin and have never seen my myself being a one night stand type of guy. 

My girlfriend and I were together for around 2 and a half years starting when we were around 15, we met whilst going to the same high school and being in the same classes. Things were great for like a year but we were both pretty immature when it came to each other talking to people of the opposite gender and what not, she had a girl best friend that I was also friends with but I didn’t talk to that often or anything.

But at one point I was messaging her friend just as friends nothing else and were just talking to her just chatting and then it started being about mine and my girlfriends relationship and some details that didn’t really need to be talked about on my part ie. things we had done (sexually) which I understand is completely nuts and out of order but it happened and I apologised and stopped talking to that chick even tho there was no ill intention there at all. 

From then on she started having minor trust issues every once in a while and I could not talk or even look at other women which I conceded to but being in high school it wasn’t always possible in terms of projects and what not. She would get antsy and pissy and either questioning me about it or giving me the cold shoulder afterwards if she saw or heard that I had contact with other women. But everything was still good and we were together for another year before things started getting to hard with us just being young and immature and the trust issues being a real problem. 

She ended up wanting to take a break for awhile to see if she still wanted to be with me and just take time away from each other, which I agreed to and as hard as it was I tried to oblige to her rules during that time. I would try to message her because I missed her and wanted to chat and half the time she would ignore me or say she didn’t wanna talk (fair enough). It was coming up on 2 weeks and I couldn’t wait for an answer on the future anymore (at the time I wasn’t attending school because things were to hard and weird as we were in a lot of the same classes) so I asked what the go was and she replied she didn’t know yet and didn’t have an answer. 

This is where it fully came to an end, we had a minor argument about the fact that I thought she would have wanted to talk or come back to me if she still loved me and had intentions of getting back together. So this is where it ended and for me at least things went down hill, she was my whole world, I stopped hanging out and talking to friends as I enjoyed my time and wanted to spend my time with her over anything else. Then weeks after we had stopped talking at all she sent me a snap or two from school hanging out with a guy that had liked her while we were together previously and just was sending little comments. So I had to block her on all social media and ended up having to move states as I wasn’t leaving my room and was becoming depressed. 

It has now been years and I was never really good at chatting up women and have always been the kind of awkward type. I never leave my house or intend to and have severe social anxiety to the point I sweat when I’m around even people I know. 

Basically I’m scared I will never find anyone again and if I am to how do i? I am a virgin but my previous girlfriend and I came close many times but just didn’t happen for various reasons. I think I am kind and considerate, im active, funny, friendly and very loving.

1892,elfa2601,1626620271,1,"I'm an 18 year old student living in London, and here is how rejection plays a huge part in my life. For as far as I can remember, I've always been the second option, or sometimes I'm not even thought of to begin with. When I was in school, I switched friend groups three times a year, and the one person that I thought was my friend just decided to stop talking to me. None of my friendships have lasted more than 7 months, and during these 7 months, it was always uncertain whether they really cared or they just found me entertaining. It doesn't just end at friendships though, even girls reject me for some reason. I know the saying 'nice guys finish last' is true because being a genuinely caring and loving person made them reject me. I have tried asking out 4 girls in the past 3 years, but of course, all of them said no. Even when I moved here, it's the same situation. I made around 8 online friends in London before I moved (I was previously living in Sudan btw), but when I brought up moving to London and meeting up with them, some ghosted and some slowly started fading away, leaving me to come here all alone in a city of 9 million people. I tried apps like Yubo and Bumble to make new friends, but that also failed. I met up with one girl, and she even came over and I decided to keep it nonsexual to not make her uncomfortable, and we watched a movie and listened to some music instead. The next day when I tried to message her, I realized she blocked me without saying anything. I'm not a creep, I'm not a pervert, I'm not an asshole, I simply want to have someone or some people that care about me as much as I care about them, but instead, I keep getting rejected by everyone.",lonely,Rejection is my best friend,2021-07-19 00:57:51

I didn't respond like I should because I thought he was joking, he probably thought I want nothing to do with him so he stopped giving effort, which is a completely normal thing for him to do. 

 I still can't get this person out of my mind, I feel like it was my only chance when I actually felt something for someone, I don't fall in love easily and need so much time to get over a person... It's stupid to think about a crush which is long gone. 

 My life is pretty okay in other areas and in the last couple of years I managed to strengthen my friendships and don't have long-lasting depressive episodes anymore... But I'm not really happy. I miss something I never had, just briefly experienced it, so I know I'm missing out on quite a lot. I'm quite introverted, I don't like much attention, I like my own space but I'm still a social being, I would love to give and receive a hug, I'd love to build a future with someone. I have no problem going places on my own, but I'd love to experience something WITH someone. It's a completely different thing. 

 I try to avoid this topic with my friends because they usually talk about how their relationships suck so I should be happy single, I should enjoy the freedom... I don't see it that way, a good relationship shouldn't feel like a jail.

I'm actually quite hopeful that I'll find love because I don't imagine living without it. Not that it's not possible, not that life without a romantic partner it's not worth living, it's just something I want to experience, something that's really high on my priority list... But it never looked like it. I always thought I was a disgusting, unworthy person and even now, when I finally started to feel better, I can't get rid of this feeling completely. It's affecting everything... And I know I won't get completely rid of it until I actually get into a relationship one day. I can try to believe I'm worthy etc all day but if nothing ever happens it feels like a lie.

I'm afraid how this romantic loneliness is affecting me. I don't know how to act. I'm afraid I'll become really depressed because of it and so boring that nobody would want to spend even a minute with me.",lonely,"Got so used to being alone that when there actually was a chance, I blew it.

My only friend and I, who have been friends for almost 8 years, just got into a pretty big argument. He told me that being a man is hard and that you can’t stop men from basically undressing women with their eyes in public. He says it’s not a mans fault for staring if the woman is “half naked”. To me that had the same vibe as saying “She was practically asking for it with what she had on” in terms of you know what. I then told him that if he thought men can’t control their actions when it comes to women, then he’s an idiot and I didn’t want to talk to him. In response, he told me that I was sensitive and that’s why we can’t have these conversations, and that I’m not a real man anyways. That last part really hurt my feelings because I’m a pre-T trans guy and I have a hard time getting people to see me as a male. After that I told him to go fuck himself and I hung up on him. I know what he said was wrong but he’s my only friend and I can’t help but feel like I ruined everything.",lonely,Might have lost my only friend,2021-07-18 17:56:55

1929,notsolipsistic,1626593785,1,"I (m24) will be 25 by the years end and I’ve never been on a real 2nd date.

Obviously that means I’ve never had any sort of relationship. I’ve had sex about a dozen times in my life, but still consider myself wildly inexperienced. Several of the girls that I have been intimate with were even “way out of my league” in my opinion and were great confidence boosts at the time. And almost none of my sexual experiences are particularly regrettable/traumatic.

But it’s not just about sex.

I have never been on a second date. And by that I mean a date where it is obvious to both people that it is a date. I’ve been in a few situations over there years where I probably have been on 2 or more dates, but either I just assumed we were friends hanging out or I thought that they thought that. I hope all of that makes sense.

I have immense feelings of loneliness because of this. I have no idea how to break this curse.

I am so grateful to say that I have a lot of friends, and some of those are very deep, connected friendships that I wouldn’t trade for the world. This gives me much relief knowing that I am at the very least likable to many people, but at times it gives me so much confusion as to why that can’t translate into anything romantic.

I am extremely anxious talking to people when I meet them, but the second I can get past that, I think I’m great at making friends, hence why friendships aren’t really my problem. With that said, I am great at making close friendships with girls, but it almost never becomes even slightly romantic. 

I am aware how terrible I am at flirting. I’ve had my moments, but in general I either have no idea how to initiate it, what to say when it is happening, and most of the time someone flirts with me, it goes right over my head.

I’m certain a lot of that has to do with low self confidence. The idea that a girl that I am attracted to would wanna flirt with me is incomprehensible to me, even though I have had moments of success with girls previously who I thought (and still think!) are extremely pretty.

There’s a lot of things I don’t like about me, and a lot of that has to do with body image, but I don’t think that’s the main problem. I’m thankful to be healthy, and in good shape. I’m in a good place in my life in regards to friends, house, job, finances, etc. I’ve even had a lot of success and recognition in my artistic endeavors over the last few years. Yet this topic weighs me down way more than any of those things can lift me up. I don’t have a fear of rejection, I’m just tired of it.

My friends tell me that I need to be less passive, go out on more limbs, etc...

Some problems with that include:

1. I’ve never drank or done drugs (can’t for medical purposes) so that regularly gets in the way of a lot of social situations (even though I’m used to and don’t mind being around other people doing those things).

2. A general lack of any opportunity

^I rarely get matches on dating app that I am actually interested in (I don’t even use the apps that much tbh) and even then I don’t know how to talk to people on those things. 

Another reason I suck at flirting is because the last thing I’d ever want to do is make a girl feel uncomfortable. Almost every time I’ve even kissed a girl before, I’ve explicitly asked permission for me to kiss them, or several times they’ve jumped on me because they were tired of me waiting to make a move. So when my friends tell me to be a bit more aggressive in those regards, I don’t know how, or if I even want to.

Over time that devolved into someone I could call a best friend

And now, it’s just a want for someone, anyone who cares.

Sure, I have friends but they don’t really ever reach out and talk to me without me initiating in some way. They’re great whenever we talk but it just stings a bit y’know? And hell I even confessed to the girl I like how I felt about her, around Valentines Day. It seemed appropriate. But she respectfully turned me down. To be honest, I went in expecting that so atleast it softened the blow a little. 

And then my birthday happened. Ever since I got social media I made a quick little post to tell people it was my birthday and of course got comments congratulating me and what not. This year I wondered “What would happen if I didn’t make a post this year?”

Perhaps the worst mistake of my life.

Not a single message. Nothing. Not even from my friends I mentioned before. (Don’t comment any happy birthdays or anything, I get that you wanna try to help but my brain is gonna think of it as patronizing or fake, plus it’s already been a while since then). I had to remind them to make them congratulate me, even then I waited until the end of the day to see if they’d remember. So I asked them what the hell happened, and was met with answers I didn’t want. The worst part is pretty much everyone in the group has their birthday celebrated essentially the second the day becomes their birthday, so the people that remember theirs you’d expect would remember mine. But no, just nothing, like always.

1942,nyx_moonlight_,1626589781,2,"Sorry this will probably be long, I just need to vent really badly. 

My circle has always been small and after covid got even smaller. I stopped being friends with someone that I was really close to, after they became someone I really didn't recognize anymore. They basically dropped me as a friend when I let them know how they treated me and others in their life were not OK. But that's a story for a different time. 

This person meant a great deal to me. From the moment I met her, I just wanted to protect her and know more about her but she could only be a friend to me when she didn't have a relationship. 

And oh, relationships. I've been single a long time, and before that, many connections were long distance, online, short-lived or one-sided. I've never had a long term, serious relationship. Moving to a new state right before the pandemic compounded the loneliness tenfold. 

I don't seem to have similar interests with many people in my area. I'm not sure if anyone else experiences this but after so much heartache and depression, it creates walls that not even chemistry or an attraction can break through easily. I have to feel it very strongly to even bother. In which case, the other person often isn't looking for anything serious. 

So lonely days become months and years. The friend I cut ties with was one of two who I spoke with regularly. Leaving one other single friend to relate to. She has since found love and I am so happy for her. But I don't want to make her take time away from her new bf and busy schedule to listen to me talk about how lonely I am. I am honestly sick of talking about it. 

About how I became obsessed with boys at a young age after my ""friends"" pushed me into ""dating"" one one of their older brothers who was 13 when I was only 8. It was really wrong and shouldn't have happened to me. . I had already been m*lested a few times before this ""boyfriend"". From then on I became known as the girl who did things with boys. My parents were always fighting with each other or getting high so they didn't care. Being away from them and fooling around meant affection, attention and avoiding their violence. But the vibe never stopped hanging over me and I never learned how to say no even when I wanted to. Sometimes a ""no"" was mustered up but ignored. My body count is high. I don't have that gf/wife vibe about me. Idk if its because in the past I was so hypersexual for so long, I'd put out right away. They'd lose interest. The few times that wasn't the case, I usually sabotaged it. 

It all has led to me being alone and alone and alone. Fleeting experiences that have left my soul empty. Being stashed. Being the side chick and not knowing it. Being ignored or rejected. 

So yeah I'm trying to improve myself and love myself and heal and blah blah blah. I am happy for others when they find love. I tell myself I am fine on my own. I am better at this than most people right? Since I spent so many days of my childhood in my room alone. But instead of building resistance, I just feel worn thin. I am a single Mom now, to a beautiful, perfect little girl. I have money in my bank account. I live in a beautiful home on a nice street, with a decent roommate. I've made it out of a lot of bad situations and gotten away from a lot of bad people. I have an abundance of things to be grateful for and I am. 

But. I cry almost every night from this loneliness that just suffocates me. I'm horny. I don't want to hook up. I know it would be a band-aid on a gushing wound. I accepted it in the past when there was nothing else to grasp onto. ""When love is not spoon fed to you, you will lick it off of knives""

After the last time I nearly attempted suicide, I went for inpatient treatment and discovered I have sex and love addict tendencies. Every other vice or maladjustment that plagues me can usually be traced there. Just feeling so unfulfilled. 

And trust me I try. I go on the dating apps. I swipe right but like I said I feel so depressed like I have to be really attracted to someone to even feel like swiping right. Which is rare. I rarely match with anyone. When I do, they are usually partnered and looking for an additional partner or just seeking hookups. If they seem like a great guy, who's genuinely looking for a relationship, and I swipe right, I almost never get a swipe back. 

I am bisexual but something about an actual relationship with a woman terrifies me. I was abused and bullied by girls and women growing up a lot and it just always feels like they're judging me. A few female friends who I deeply loved turned out to secretly harbor resentments towards me which ended our friendships so that makes me even more hesitant. 

I know I can contact my one friend and talk to her. She will listen because she genuinely loves me and I genuinely love her. But she deserves to fucking be happy with her bf and not worry about me. I am not close to most of my family. The ones I am close to, have known about these struggles for years and have voiced in the past how sick they are of hearing about it. I take antidepressants and am trying to get back into therapy right now. I'm just trying to do the best I can. But this heaviness that sits on my chest. This urge to cry as night draws near. This feeling like I just want to sink into the Earth, be swallowed and stay there. It all stems from how badly I want love but love doesn't seem to want me.

I’m so tired of feeling alone like this. I got my shit together this year. I’m making good money, I’m pretty attractive, I’m quiet but once I break out of my shell i think I’m pretty funny. What can I do to escape this hell? Why can’t I even begin to find a date, much less a gf? Part of me thinks I deserve this because I don’t enjoy going out a lot and I can be on edge in social situations, which comes off bad. On the other hand I love who I am and wouldn’t wanna change it. Why hasn’t someone come into my life the way I am? Feels cursed man.",lonely,I feel like a ghost,2021-07-18 15:39:15

1953,NatureMiserable,1626585411,1,"First where we are at:
Focused on what others can do to me
Focused on others thoughts on me
Focused on what they can take from me
Focused on what I don’t know
It’s fear: the unknowns that also pose a threat to something important to us. 

Fear maybe makes you isolate. It’s understandable. If you isolate, and stay to yourself, maybe you also struggle with the thoughts that you aren’t important to others or even wanted. It may be natural to go to, but its destructive, because it’s a symptom that feeds the sickness. There is a deeper meaning. Isolation is protection from fear.

Social anxiety is a burden. It weighs down on you. Plus, you are cut off from people, so it can be hard to find relief when there aren’t a lot of people close enough to you to see the struggle.

We now understand what it is, and we know it’s not good, many people like us struggle out there. So now let’s think of the opposite, not fear but love.

I know this might be hard, because maybe if I love someone, when they leave it hurts more. Connection is important to me, and I don’t want to lose it when it’s that close to me. But I don’t think we need that scarcity mentality. I think, to have the connection we want to consume, we should make it ourselves. Be the manufacturer of love, whether deep family, to light friendly, if we make it, we ourselves will have plenty.

So now our mindset is on others, but why? Well, we know how it feels, and others suffer like we do. We can become the person we never had. We are capable of drawing out the deep things from others. We understand them. Are you aware that most people struggle from social anxiety to some degree? Everyone is afraid, even the loud and obnoxious people we tend to avoid. Listen, people NEED you. You come with a unique life. Unique set of gifts, talents, perspectives, and experiences. You can go after connection, and it can be deep, or it can be chill or it can be fun. You want to make a connection that leaves you both feeling like someone saw you today.

With humility, others are more important compared to yourself. You put it there, not them. Allow you to change your mindset to focus on yourself and how you may look to them. Be there for them the way you wanted for you. Know what you wanted, what you looked for.

The characteristics of love are patience and kindness, no envy, nor boastful, nor arrogance, nor rude, nor self-seeking, nor irritable, nor grudges. Walk into a social situation convinced that you are kind and patient as others may also feel out of place. Your not there to build yourself up or make an image for yourself. Be prepared to count others as more important, giving them the focus and not the focus on how they experience you.

I already love you guys, we are alike. I give this out of love. My teacher definitely did, and he taught me well. He said you can’t add moments to your lifespan by worrying. He said don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of it’s own.

When I try to open up I get called insane or when I try to help I get ignored. The ONE thing I like about myself is how hard I try to be compassionate, empathetic, and supportive. But I never get that back. Not from the majority of my family and certainly not from anyone else.

In my current situation I have ONE friend and we have been calling each other our ""besties/best friends"" for a few weeks. She vents to me constantly. I always listen, give my support, and give her the benefit of the doubt so she doesn't feel invalidated. I CONSTANTLY go out of my way to do these things for her. When people call out of work and she needs help closing, I am there. When she needs someone to talk to, I am there. I genuinely love to support her and see her as the best friend I've had. She's made it clear that she appreciates everything I do, and she makes me want to be better.

But a few problems keep popping up that I have seen before. I never am asked how I am doing despite breaking down every. Single. Night. I am never offered help or opportunities to vent. She very rarely initiates conversations with me. And, since she is my only friend (and one of the only people in my life I actually talk to because of my lack of decent family), I constantly am stressed and paranoid when they don't respond or don't talk to me. I feel like I am smothering and I don't want to be.

But god damnit. I want someone to talk to other than myself. I want someone to show care and compassion towards ME for once. I want to feel cared about not just because I have things to offer.

Like I'm making these decisions with no endpoint, shits pointless. I have MD and Anxiety which places my life on hold a lot. In the middle of my senior year. I was already depressed at school, my mom was unemployed and was struggling with her health severely, college plans were coming up, i was getting into fights with my parent constantly, especially my dad, about college, he wanted me to go to the community, my dumbass wanted a college experience.

when quarantine hit in the middle of our senior year, i slowly cut off all of my friends. with all of the anti police protests, i found myself not trusting my friends, to sum it up, i went to a predominantly white school, so when I explained to my white friends my issues with racism being one of the FEW black people at my hs, i felt misunderstood, coupled with all of my issues at home, none of them were giving me the support i thought i needed. I felt dismissed had no motivation to talk to truly anyone. I was alone and isolated. I didnt not see them until graduation, and after that, we all went our separate ways. regarding college, my dad threw me between a rock and a hard place, the week before commitment day stating I had to stay home for the first year. to give context i was 17 at the time. I wasn't going to community so we decided that if i chose uni, i had to commute, I was fine with that until i got into a really bad accident two weeks before the semester. I had just gotten back from being kicked out. i was also doing an EMT summer class ( which went to waste because I still haven't taken the NREMT - any advice on taking it a year later haha \*side eye\*), which was paid for through my volunteer organization. with the weight of my homelife and lack of sleep because of the classes, i  got t boned HARD, and almost had plastic lodged into me. the mechanic at the auto shop was surprised i came out unscaved, except a fractured rib or two. It kinda screwed me up for a min, couldn't drive for months and I was struggling with the memories of it all and the consequences that came after.

no car meant i was remote, when college started it didnt even phase me, it felt like just another day, I was so emotionally depleted from everything and found myself again relying on drinking and smoking to get through the day and night. I couldn't make friends, i was failing all of my classes isolated, I failed out of university and lost my FA because I let my mental health get the best of me and couldn't swallow my pride to take a medical withdrawal for the spring semester.  I take full responsibility for that. i loosely my school psychologist and dean talked about reinstation, I was only allowed to be reinstated if I transferred to an IOP program 3 days a week for 6 hours. I would be paying out of pocket for these sessions. But coupled with the accident last August, I needed work and save for a car. I didn't want to worry my parents about how low my mental health was and all the money they've put in wasted. I just would have been another disappointment. I realized I'm only 2 semesters in with almost 30k worth of loans so I chose work over my mental health again.

Now all i do is work, i don't hang out with anyone other regarding my car situation i can only take my siblings from point a-b, work and back. My dad sees anything else as useless driving so i rarely leave the house for fun

My best friend of almost 7 years was also going through it in her life, she was often getting into fights with her parents and was homeless the summer after graduation up until our fall semester where she moved on campus.  I blamed all the bad things happening in my life for my neglect of her to focus on my own feelings, even when we were in hs. I apologized to her in that summer of july or august for not being as supportive as i could. but she had already gotten a boyfriend found new friends and started her life. I had we both chose the same college but i rarely got to see her, even up till now. Over the summer she spent most of her time with her boyfriend and his friends. There were no visitors allowed in the dorms, she didn't have access to her car at the time, so she could only uber with whatever little money she had. On breaks and throughout the spring, she stayed with a kid 17 yo hs dropout who had substance issues of his own. in oct she began to binge on xans, her roommates were tired of picking up after her and they had a big fall out. she medically withdrew and hasn't returned since.

I blamed myself for so long, but here i stand conflicted, in hs (i hate to be the one lmaoo) i had brought up the fact that i thought our friendship was one sided, she at times she acted like she did not care for my stories about my other friends at the time or my plans or endeavurs. She at times she seemed aloof, she would stop responding to texts or it felt like she dismissed me. she would skip around details as if i never said them. This still continues but at this point she is the only person i have, yet i feel she doesn't value me. i don't know why I still hold on when at times she makes me hurt.

I have so much love for her but i never feel it reciprocated. when we were in uni together, she rarely visited me, she would agree then bail on me last minute or stop responding to me when i followed up. I would clean, buy food, to sum it up, prepare, but I guess she was never obligated to show up. when i called her to be a shoulder she would always answer with a text, ""you called?"" and i never wanted to respond when she said that. I said nvm and held it in. that. maybe its me over analyzing, i would get upset then get distant, then she would loop me in with something along the lines of ""i don't know who to talk to"" whenever she had an issue, and they were pretty valid but when i needed a hand she was often nowhere to be found. the responses i got were short, ""it will get better"" nothing with substance.

Nowadays we see each other once a month maybe twice if I'm lucky to do our nails or go to the mall, she would pick me up, them immediately drop me home to hang out with other people. she lives between her boyfriend (parents) house and her parents, she has her car back, but just never wants to make the time. i would ask if she wanted to watch movies and smoke or go to an amusement park, you know do things, but now she would never commit or even try to reschedule, she always prioritized other people. it just feels unless its serving to her, that's when she is engaged. when i hang out with her those are the only times i leave the house to hang out with a friend. I feel so used but i understand nothing is ever one sided.

Ive told her how lonely i felt. i always support her, even when i don't have the strength, i never get a check up text. maybe she just sees me as a friend but she burdens me with all of her shit, i don't know anymore.

I find myself in a lot of these relationships where people expect me to be this rock for them but can never reciprocate. I bottle everything to the point where i don't know how to talk about my feelings, i just bottle everything. i feel that people don't know me but still hold these expectations from me. i am alone like nobody hits up my phone except the news app lonely.

I'm beginning to think that i don't deserve love, because it always hurts me. I have no one except my family, i have tried to turn to my parents but they don't understand, i am the eldest, so i cant burden my feelings on my younger siblings, i m supposed to be strong for them yet at times i want to end it all. I haven't even have been in a real relationship yet ( sad :( i know) i don't know how to love properly, when intamicy is given to me i run away. I feel like i am never enough for people.

It seems that tonight you are the only ones who I can share my feelings with. 

I'm 27 old man with good career and partner that I love, tomorrow we will marry. I didn't wanted any ceremony or party at all because from my perspective it's just a ridiculous waste of money, time and nerves. So we've came to compromise - small ceremony with family only.

The problem is I don't have a family. My mom died from cancer when I was 7 and my dad never lived with me. My uncle, who I lived with after mother died has died, and my grandma who I lived with after my uncle died has died, and the last person who I lived with until I finished school and went to university is my sister in law who actually a criminal and horrible person. As for friends - I've lost close contact with all of them after a years of hard working in a big city.


So tomorrow my dad and his daughter from other marriage with her family will come to my wedding, just because I should invite someone. And I am angry, lonely and angry because of stupidity of the situation.

aaah hey everyone, 
i’ve been a bit down lately especially after this weird ass year lmao, and i’d really love to make some new friends. i’m 19 and from the uk, just finished my first year at uni studying film. i’m pretty introverted and suffer from a little bit of anxiety but i love chatting to people online and having those deep late night convos 😤. if we have some shared interests that would be evennnn better: films, tv shows (game of thrones, dark and avatar last airbender are my absolute favs), anime (attack on titan and jojo), gaming (mostly league of legends, love pokemon and death stranding atm too). Music is a h u g e part of my life as well, i’m into most genres especially indie/alt rock, lofi and folk. making playlists for each other would be soso nice as well! here’s my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/joekenward66?si=Uk3Sd9-aQSuUMhdk1rud8Q&amp;dl_branch=1

i also love nature and spending time outside, especially walking my doggo (if you have one your legally obliged to send me pics heheheh). i’m also super interested in art even tho i don’t do much myself, but id really like to get into doing some digital stuff.

And then, one day, something just changed. I can't really explain it but suddenly I've became confident, stopped giving a shit about what others think, I almost got rid of stuttering when saying! Hell, even sweating when talking in certain situations seems to be gone. I stopped giving a damn about what happens in the future.

Today is probably my breaking point. I’ve been “going crazy” since last month but every day just seems to be worse than the other and there’s no way of stopping this.

At least i had friends before i moved. Right now i have no one. Not a single person that i know in this fucking country.

Seeing as how guys around me are having a lot of success and I haven't been loved not even once it just furthers my insecurities.

I'm confident in my body as I have been working out and I honestly don't think I'm that physically unattracive (I guess I'm worse than average but it's still not that bad lol) so I can't imagine how guys that are much worse off than me (disabilities, very short, etc) are faring. I'm not short, 6', and whenever I hear stories about guys that are much shorter than me my heart just breaks, because there's no way to fix it. And it's not the women's fault anyway, most aren't attracted to shorter guys and they are not to blame. These are just their preferences.

The worst part about it is that when discussing all of this, the general media tends to mock these male issues and call us incels and virgins, shaming us for being socially inept. And those that empathize with our situation don't actually give good genuine advice. I have been myself for my entire life and it's clearly not working lol. Many times that's just code for ""I don't know what to say and I want to continue with my life without sounding like a douche"". 

At this point I'm starting to think I'm just a terrible human being. That's the only answer I can find. Perhaps I just scare women away. And I realize I do have a ton to work on but still everyday I hear stories around my social circles about dudes cheating on their gfs and still getting women interested in them despite clearly being bad people. I just don't get it.

I don't want to fall into incel forums or pick up artists because 99% of the time they are misogynist pricks that degrade women and that's just not me. I want to face my problems and fix them so I can love and be loved, I want someone that sincerely likes me for who I am, not a sex doll. It just seems like there are really few forums or whatever in which these issues can be discussed without treating women badly but also without being mocked ourselves.

I've been going through a rough time lately. And keep running out of people to talk to. I had a bunch of girls talking to me on here, up until about yesterday. When suddenly they all appearently decided that they had enough of me. They didn't know eachother either so that was a pretty weird coincedense. 

That being said, I would like to meet some new people to chat with. I like to chat on a daily basis, and I tend to talk a lot on most days. So if you want a talkative friend, here I am I guess. 

I do have a job that I'm currently at 3 days a week. Would have been 4 normally, but I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, which I'm in EMDR for. EMDR can be pretty rough, so I had to drop down a day of work to recover mentally each week until it's done. I live alone, so I get lonely pretty easily and frequently. 

I'm a 28 year old man myself. But would prefere to talk to a girl/woman. Although, beggers can't be choosers so I'll pretty much anything. I'm looking for an online friendship kinda thing if that makes sense, asuming not many of you would live near me (The Netherlands).

Met a girl who showed interest in me but I didn't until 2 months after. We used to hang out. We have our memorable deeds and inside jokes. She had broken up quite recently during that time, so the wounds were still fresh. On the other hand, I was suffering from anxiety. Being older than her, I decided to not date at this time when we both have to go through some shit and figure out what we want and she was fine with it I guess. I went back to my home city for 5 months to finish my college. By God's grace, I got a job in the city. I was looking forward to meeting her again and taking things forward. I had all of it planned in my head. 

Fast forward to now. She's back with her ex. I don't get the same vibes from her as I used to an year ago. My dreams are shattered. I had so much planned for her (dates, picnic, day outs/visits, etc.).
This is the nth time this is happening. I don't know why nobody wants to be with me. Is it too much to ask for to be dating someone, to feel loved, to be heard, to want support when you feel low, etc. 

Idk, I think it's better to give up. This has been happening with every girl I try with, in the end I get nothing as outcome, always end up being lonely. 

Bottom line, I don't think I'll ever find someone. 

I'll probably leave reddit after this. I'm done. I can't fake being motivated and positive anymore.

I find it so hard to talk to people my age. My humor, due to my experiences, has become very dark or self-deprecating at times. I've gotten over most of the things teenagers usually care about, like relationships, memes, video games, so there's nothing much to talk about. Whether it be irl or online, I have never found anyone my age I had fun talking to except my girlfriend. I've had better chemistry with a 35 year old woman that I played games with.

2085,CrikeyCameron,1626513198,1,"A personal little vent.

I got in an argument with a friend. Now I thought I was very close with this friend, but when I met them I knew they were much more private than me.

I put a lot of effort and patience into the friendship anyway, not expecting them to be as open as I would ideally hope from people, or as people I knew years ago had been. Yes, once years ago I did have friends who were very open about aspects of their life, and shared their friends with me, and taught me more. I felt like they wanted to include me in their life and really share themselves with me, which I miss horribly.

The friend I just argued with is not like that. For a while I appreciated the difference, and getting to know someone more like that. I know this person is generally very private with everyone, not just me.

After arguments in the recent weeks I don’t think I’m close to this person at all anymore. But the last argument was the worst. When I bought up how I see the difference and feel disconnected, this person said “I don’t know why it matters” [why I feel I share so much, and he isn’t willing to]. I honestly feel so done, and I’m incredibly dumbfounded. I don’t feel that anyone wants me, and I now know this friend is not willing to put anywhere near the same level of effort in. Frankly, I think this friend is thick given some of his responses to me. Whenever we disagreed, until recently, I really tried to compromise because I thought it was better for both of us. Whenever he disagreed with me I got some reply like “no, sorry”. It feels like this person doesn’t want me in their life, they say things about how they’re sorry and appreciated my effort but I honestly don’t feel I got anything in return when I now realise how little effort they put in by comparison, how they aren’t willing to really pull through difficult things with me but just continue shitposting etc, and I feel overly blamed for other issues.",lonely,“I don’t know why it matters”,2021-07-17 19:13:18
2086,perpetuallethargy,1626513093,1,"For several months starting towards the end of last year up until a couple months ago I was in a really bad place emotionally in our relationship. I felt really self conscious about my looks and really worried about things I never cared about before (I gained almost 50 lbs since covid lockdown began) and it was taking a huge toll on my self esteem and emotional/mental well being. During that time I basically had no interest in being sexual with my partner whatsoever because of how down I was feeling about myself. 

Obviously this became a big problem after a while because it's definitely not easy to be in a relationship and have no intimacy. I understood that completely and I did the absolute best I could to try to communicate that to my partner and help him understand that it wasn't because he wasn't attractive to me anymore or that there was someone else. No matter what I said or did the other only thing he would believe is that it was his fault. That he wasn't good enough for me. To him I'm not supposed to care about how I feel about myself because his opinion of me is supposed to be all that matters (according to him). So for me to tell him I felt ugly/fat/gross etc etc that was all a bunch of bullshit excuses in his eyes since he says ""I'm beautiful no matter what"".

Fast forward to now and I'm starting to finally feel better and get a hold of my health and turn it around (I lost at least 20 lbs and an still working on it) but here I am in what feels like the same situation except I'm on the other side of it now. I throw myself all over him and nothing. I try kissing him and touching him and nothing. Even when he does have sex with me I feel lonely and hollow because I think he just gives up trying to hold back and I don't feel like he's actually enjoying it no matter what I do.

I have no clue how to remedy this situation and I feel like I have only myself to blame. All of this is happening because of me and it makes me sick to my stomach. I feel so alone. I love this person and I have no where to put the love I have for him because he doesn't seem to want it anymore but he won't leave me.

I don't really expect anyone to reply or give me some sort of magic fix. I just wanted to put this out there so I can vent and maybe not feel so lonely.

And after 3 months in the ICU we were able to get her back home. She lost her mobility and her vocals but we were just glad to have her back home. 7 years down the line, she's still the same but a lot of things changed in this time. My mom left us cause she was sick of taking care of my sister, my dad started drinking heavily and our finances were miserable. I've had to look after my dad and my sister for the better part of 4 years now, from feeding her to cleaning her I've done everything. I'm only 23 and I've had to run the whole family. I'm exhausted.

Even when CPS got involved nothing happened. Had I not ran away I would probably be dead right now. My grandma took my brother away from the abuse but left me. When I was 12 I asked my dad if I could live with him and he said no and I never heard from him again. I probably hate my brother the most because he knew everything that was going on to an extent but I got treated way worse.

Ive never had an issue making friends or meeting women, the problem is the friendships aren't real and despite falling in love, no one has ever loved me.

My big problem is all my friends, all my relationships always seem to be surface connections, I'm never anyone's "" best"" friend, never the boyfriend they fell in love with.

He has his girlfriend and a mutual friend and her boyfriend also visit regularly. To add some complexity, both couples are open with each other, so they'll ""swap"" partners. Meanwhile, I'm single, lonely, and so socially awkward everyone within a mile of me can feel it and vacate the area.

I want to be happy with just being me. By myself. But I can't. I've tried for years. The only time in my entire life that I've truly felt happy was when I was in a relationship. This includes prepubescence, before I could feel a biological need for companionship (I think?). 

I avoid movies, TV shows, books, etc that might have romance because it just hurts. I've tried getting into a new relationship. I lived fairly well avoiding everything. 

But now that my home is a source of pain, I feel trapped. I don't know what to do. Do I move out? Ban mutual friends from coming over (I think a bad idea)? Try to explain to my best friend why I can't handle PDA again?

2121,Hashtag_buttstuff,1626495085,1,"I'm 35/m and single. Been single for a long time. Almost 15 years now since my last ""real"" relationship. I've dated around plenty but nothing ever stuck more than a few months. 

I think I missed the boat on the family life, Here's why: for most of my 20s and up until about a year ago, I was extremely overweight. I was a non-traditional college student and attended when I wasin my mid-20s. Right when people are meeting those s/o they end up marrying. Even after graduation in my late 20s and early 30s, I was huge and bitter at the world for my shortcomings. I put myself fully into my job and was successful, but feel like my size made me unlovable. I got a dream job 2 years ago, which necessitated a move to the middle of nowhere (WV) which hasn't helped my dating prospects at all. 

I lost 100 lbs in the last year. At my biggest I was nearly 400 pounds. I'm a little bit under 300 now so still big, but not off-puttingly big, but now I'm 35, in a very small town, not knowing anyone, with no social connections outside of my job, just coming out of the covid year of no social life. My job is very lonely in itself. I'm a college sports coach, so 95% of my interactions are college students, almost half my age, so I'm definitely not interested in pursuing any dating in that arena. 

I feel like I just missed my chance. At the time when everyone was meeting their future spouse, I was 375 pounds and not taking care of myself at all. 

The weird part is I'm not bitter. I'm not really even all that sad about it. I love my job. I don't mind doing stuff alone. But it still gets me every so often. I still wish I had someone at times.

2123,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1626495017,1,"Well, I will quickly get the basic out of the way: I am a 32 Male from the Midwest (US) I'm a full-time student and I work as a program administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work and teach.  *If you'd like to know what I look like, check it my Reddit history! 

Before the pandemic, I had a moderately sociable daily life. Because of the sort of work I do, my pool of new people to hangout with was constantly renewed every few months even if some of it was just for work. But, now it seems that virtuous cycle has been broken. I haven't been around anyone except close family and a few colleagues, even with things getting back to some semblance of normalcy. However, I'm still feeling starved for connection that is more than just the superficialities. It has actually began to affect me in many ways. I have a nagging, incessant restlessness in the last few months that I can't seem to shake; sometimes I drive aimlessly for hours in my city almost wishfully, hoping that someone would call or text to meet-up like earlier days. But of course, wishful thinking never makes things materialize.

I can't seen to muster the motivation to do the usual things I enjoy either, like writing music and recording (I'm a guitarist), reading ( I'm pretty voracious), writing, and other projects that keep me busy. I just pine for that kind of connection with somebody that has casual depth; that is to say, being able to fluidly shift between the banal, hum-drum things to even deeper topics, ideas, and feelings-- and back again. Well, without getting too neurotic, message me if you think this might be what you're seeking too! 

I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

I don't know how to develop a conversation beyond small talk. When I was 20, my ex cheated admitted to cheating on me for almost two years. We were in a long distance relationship (met on an online game called Runescape in 2009), and she was my first girlfriend. She lived about two hours from me, so I would drive to her nearly every weekend of those two years. I was going to surprise her by telling her that I got approved for a transfer from work, and that we could move in together, and she came clean right then and there, saying that she's been with her boss since before we started dating. That pretty much derailed everything for me. I didn't want to get in another relationship for years. I know that the vast minority of women are like her, and I don't blame anyone else for her actions. The downside is that, by the time I wanted to start dating again, the entire climate had changed. I wasn't even familiar with the previous dating climate, and now I DEFINITELY don't understand it. As I stated at the beginning, I don't know how to talk to women anymore. I'm constantly aware of how others perceive me, almost narcissistically, but I don't attempt to change their perception of me, so idk if you'd call it narcissism. It makes it very hard to have a conversation with someone when you're ""focused on the fact that you're attracted to them, and you don't know if you have anything in common with them, and you don't know their interests"", etc... I can't have a conversation because I'm thinking about the conversation.

I have plenty of friends, but I have a hard time hanging out with them because literally every one of them is either in a relationship, or has a family. I instantly become aware of my shortcomings and it changes the mood for the worse. It's slowly souring my relationship with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My father left when I was 3, and I've had no contact with him since. I imagine that's where my social issues started. My mother raised me by herself, but made no attempt to prepare me for the real world. Instead she taught me to heavily value what others thought of me and how to be incredibly selfish, things that I had to spend my entire adulthood undoing. For the first few years of adulthood, it made me feel like I was being perceptive of others needs, but as my inner-dialogue changed to more a self-deprecating tone over the years, that ""perceptive"" thinking also became deprecating. I'm convinced that I hold no value to anyone, and that I only drag people down. I'm convinced that everything that has happened to me, was my own doing and that I deserve it.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you do to improve your own self value? I've tried everything. I say nice things about myself throughout the day, but the problem is that I don't believe them myself.

How does one accept and embrace the notion of utter solitude? It is said no man is an island, yet I feel I am the exception to this metaphor.

2187,Koooshal,1626451565,1,"I have been very lonely for months, and my anxiety makes it worse for me. 

I have had severe anxiety ever since I was in 5th grade. It feels like I was robbed of a happy childhood because of my anxiety.

What's worse is that my family has always seen this as a joke. My anxiety has been mocked by them in-front of my friends and extended family at multiple occasions. 

But I was finally able to *overcome my anxiety* after my high school was over. I was so happy during the first semester of my college and I was really living the life I thought my anxiety would never let me have.

Then I fell in love with a girl. I have absolutely no idea if she ever actually loved me back or not. What I do know for sure is that I actually pictured my whole life with her, my first love. 

But as the relationship moved forward in time, I started having my anxiety back. I used to blame everything but her for my anxiety, but now I know that it was because of the way I was getting treated in the relationship. 

I never really wanted a relationship, very early into the relationship I even told her that it will be better if we go separate ways because I was well aware that my mental health wouldn't be able to handle a breakup (the chances of a breakup a few months down were very likely because she was probably going to get a college very far away)

She cried and made me feel so loved that night, it made me sick that I was thinking about parting ways with such a beautiful human. That night a promise was made by her that she would do anything to be with me and would never break my heart.

A sensible person would know that this is a promise that will definitely be bullshit in the long run, but love makes us oblivious of all this.

Then 2 months into the relationship, she decides to breakup with me on a random movie night. I didn't handle it well mentally. I constantly begged her to save this relationship. After a week we were back to better terms.

But what happend after this brought my anxiety back for good.

1) I always had a sword dangling over my head that if I say anything she doesn't want to hear, she would break up with me.

2) I was ghosted quite often and was never provided a reason why she didn't contact me at all.

3) She was always talking about her exes.

4) She was on Bumble App and used to keep me updated about the people she matched with. This made me very insecure.

5) She never agreed to meet me and most of her talks were about breaking my heart.

I'd like to clarify that it wasn't always bad. She used to make me feel very loved on random days. Over the months I only kept falling for her more and more. 

She used to lead me, then leave me.

On a festive night after having a wonderful day, she broke up with me. I had my anxiety back till then.

It has been months since our breakup. I still get severe panic attacks when anything reminds me of her.

What I have realised over this course of time is that I don't get anxious because I was obsessed with her, but because I really cared about her. I don't have the strength to accept the fact that I can't be of any help to her anymore, I felt like all she is left with is a toxic family and friends who are nothing but a bad influence.

I might have made some mistakes too, I'm not a perfect human. But I swear I just had her best interests in my heart, just to see her happy was the definition of success to me.

I don't blame anybody except myself for my anxiety relapse because I could have just for once decided to love myself more than I loved her. Nothing should have been more important to me than my mental health.

I often see here people saying under posts similar to this one that they need to get out there, work on themselves and all of that stuff but the thing is I'm confident, got a good self esteem and I'm ""out there"". I don't understand what is wrong with me. I mean I don't think I'm ugly, Im nice to everyone, I have friends including guy friends, but unfortunately no one has ever been interested in me. All of my friends get compliments from guys, get dm's, and they don't even need to search for a boyfriend since they all come to them. Sometimes a guy will be talking to me and my friends and compliment all of them except for me. 
Even the extremely desperate guys don't even look at me even though I treat them well unlike all the other girls ( sorry if this sound mean) 
I'm unloveable, and this is really making me question my worth. I have been feeling so lonely and sad about it and even though I'm still very young I do wonder if I will ever be loved.",lonely,Feeling like I can't be loved,2021-07-17 01:31:34

Music is a h u g e part of my life as well, i’m into most genres especially indie/alt rock, lofi and folk. making playlists for each other would be soso nice as well! here’s my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/joekenward66?si=Uk3Sd9-aQSuUMhdk1rud8Q&amp;dl_branch=1

i also love nature and spending time outside, especially walking my doggo (if you have one your legally obliged to send me pics heheheh). i’m also super interested in art even tho i don’t do much myself, but id really like to get into doing some digital stuff.

All I read here is how someone cheated on you, told you off, hurt you, you got too invested and nothing materialized, how they don't invite you anywhere, etc. Being alone means I get to save my time, my sanity, I get to do the things I want instead of adjusting to someone else, I get to study, learn, read, watch movies and have discussions of them online, I don't need to shave everyday, I don't need to dress up in good clothes because my s.o. is coming over, I save money, etc. Sure sometimes it would be nice to get a hug or a cuddle, but if I put it all on a ... whats that balancy thingy called, like a see-saw, but it was used for measuring weight... whatever, if I put it on that, the goods still outweighs the bads for me.

2203,TonyXanza,1626439194,1,"I don't know how to truly pen my issues at this point. So with that in mind, let me at least confess that I am blessed to have these kinds of issues, in the sense that they are the issues that come with a lifestyle from working hard, making decent money for one's age (22), being well-connected with my folks, abstaining from sex and being single for a long time, and being focused upon my future with investments and a pursuit of an education (paid out of my own pocket by working 60+ hours.)

Truly I say to you all, I am a blessed young man as I pursue to lay a great groundwork for my future. But although I have the support of God's Grace and Mercy through my Faith in Christ to sustain me, though I have the best parents in the world, though I have great friends (whom I can't see as often due to my work/study life), and though my boss and I actually get along very well, I can't help but shake my loneliness.

I feel guilty about this sense of isolation and loneliness. There are those in this world with much less (I am not rich, borderline lower-middle class family in a crummy city,) than I who find more reasons to be joyful in their circumstance OR suffering in situations for which are far worst than what I go through. And truly I say to you all, I am very happy with my little possessions, my small, home, my family, my friends, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, my everything. 

I don't know if it's all because of just being single for so long, that maybe it's like a fear of missing out? But then again, I'm not the kind of guy to just fling or hookup. I want to commit and actually be responsible in said relationship. But at the same time, I have this fear of starting with someone while working on my future.

Like I said, I don't know how to truly pen my issues at this point. I could tell you of the wracking in my head over how the Hell did my Uncle die last month with no issues currently resolved. I could account for how I feel alone and under surveillance of some foreign entity for which I cannot see nor examine or even truly know if it's even really out to get me. Perhaps I could even describe the struggle internally for fulfilling a sexual desire while ensuring I keep such desires for when the time is right, rather than to cheapen out on a one-time only experience. Maybe I could even layout the framework for a dead-man's switch should suicide somehow resurface as a final sol- (well, actually no. Suicide will never be an answer, no matter how dim things get.)

In the end, I have come to learn a few things in life. But perhaps that of the mantra in the Title is what best serves for human advice to those of any background;

2269,iHasMagyk,1626424629,1,"Happened like three weeks ago but didn’t know where to go. 

I posted an edgy meme in my friend group’s Discord server and made an edgy joke to go along with it. No one was uncomfortable as far as I could tell, and certainly no one said anything about it. Day later I get banned with the joke as the reason. Only two people after that were willing to talk to me, and that only lasted for like two days. I tried messaging other people but they didn’t want to talk to me, with many saying that I was completely at fault and deserved to be banned. One of them told me that people had been uncomfortable with my humor for a while. No one ever told me anything about that, I had no idea. Another person told me that I needed to get help and seriously change. Three weeks before this happened, I had been in the mental hospital for over 3 months. One person claimed that I was attention seeking when I told someone else that I was feeling suicidal.

It’s been about two weeks since I tried to make any contact. No one’s reached out or said anything. They’ve all acted like I never existed, and like I murdered someone. 

This happened before too. Almost two years ago pretty much the same sequence of events happened. My first former group of friends ended up being abusive and left me with PTSD. Now I feel like it’s going the same way here. They’re probably stalking my Reddit account now. That’s what happened last time. Fuck it. I don’t care.",lonely,I lost all my friends.

2270,bearsintheairplane,1626424192,1,"i don’t know. when i look at who i want to be in the future, i always picture it by myself. and it’s kind of bittersweet because i do enjoy being around people sometimes, but in the long run i’m happier on my own. i think at least? 

when i’m by myself there is absolutely no room for anyone else to judge how i do things. and with that i have more time to focus on hobbies that excite me without having to be guided by someone else. god, this probably isn’t making any sense. 

i’m very peculiar with my interests and like to have ownership over them, if that makes sense? i like to find things on my own without someone else pushing me to it, it feels so much less personal. for example, i hate when people are the ones to show me something like a show that they’re really deep into, because it feels like i’m invading on something that’s /theirs/ and it makes me uncomfortable to also get deep into it. it makes it feel like i’m not being genuine. and i know it’s kind of stupid, but being in fandoms have been a very big part of my life. like i’m watching an anime i’ve never seen with a friend and she’s already deep into the fandom, her favorite character also happens to be mine but i feel like i’m not allowed to like him or kin him because she beat me to it. so fucking childish, i know. 

when i’m around other people i tend to lose myself as well. i’m pretty good at lying and morph myself into someone else in order to fit my friends’ personalities. no one really really knows me. 

my best friend wants to move to japan eventually and part of me feels like she’s expects me to come? but that’s her dream, that’s not even something i’m interested in outside of a hypothetical. it makes me sick when i agree to it as well, because there i go again, lying about everything. but at the same time, how can she just expect me to be a follower forever? it’s her dream, not mine. it hurts. 

i think eventually i want to live alone. i keep thinking that this time next year i’ll be in a completely different place, i’ll be a different person. i want to go to paris or rome, somewhere in europe. but idk if that’ll happen. i’m also fine with just getting out of state. but i think i wanna be by myself.

They reached out to me first online when I was sharing dark humor on a Instagram post that said drop you best dark joke in the comments. A guy who we’ll call “Max” dm-ed me and said he thought my joke was great! He saw I had a few posts about video games on my profile and we got into a friendly discussion about games we like and stuff of that nature. He told me he was only a year older than me and can relate to me a lot. After talking for a while he asked me if I had a girlfriend and I said something like no lol, I’ve never even kissed a girl I mean look at my profile pic no girls wants to wake up next to that every morning haha! And then Max said, you know it’s not your fault. Women, if they know it or not engage in hypergamy. I didn’t know what that was and so he explained the 80/20 rule to me and told me that’s why I’ll never get a match on tinder or get a girlfriend. I felt really bad after hearing that. So I said something like then how did people in the past always find love I mean everyone got married when my grandparents were young. And he told me that the sexual revolution, feminism and hookup culture destroyed any chance the bottom 80 percent of men have at finding a girl. He then said a woman would now rather die alone than lower her standards or date an ugly man. That one really hurt. He sent me a YouTube video that was like feminist sjw cringe compilation and I thought it was kinda funny. As we talked more and he sent more video I became convinced that women were stupid and dishonest and feminism destroyed any chance I had a finding love. I’ll try to speed this part up cause I realize I’ve written too much. Anyways, he introduced me to his friends on discord and we talked about video games and stupid stuff like that. As they got more comfortable with me they started to tell me that women are evil, Jews run the world and ship immigrants to Europe and America, race mixing is wrong and designed to wipe out white people and stuff like that. They also talked about how the n@zi party eliminated poverty and starvation in Germany. And how n@zi principals can save society and return us to a golden age in America. They constantly send videos and stuff showing how virtues fascism is and how awful liberalism is and how empathy is for the weak.

And maybe because of it, since I was a young boy, I remember talking to myself, like having a conversation, sometimes without words, while other times, I will say things out loud, which freaked out some people along the way. Maybe it was a weird coping mechanism for me to find a way to keep myself talking, or maybe I was a very imaginative child, or maybe, just maybe, I was doing it to not feel lonely?

Now, as a man in his 30's, I still find it difficult to find friends, and I noticed how I would spend more time talking to ""myself"", but to the characters and the personalities I've created inside my head, so I wouldn't feel left out...

I used to struggle socially a lot when I was a teenager so I really do feel lucky to be able to have a exciting social life and good social skills. I don't want to undermine all the work I did on myself to get to that point but if I'm honest I don't feel that different from how I did when I was really anti-social. It just feels like no one has ever really understood me (edgy and angsty ik) enough for me to allow myself to feel truly comfortable around them but i don't know whether that's some kind of weird narcissism or maybe some kind of imposter syndrome, I often feel like people support me and show me love out of some feeling of obligation rather then just liking me for me. I had one person a few years ago who I fell in love with and that was the closest I felt to being understood, I remember completely falling apart in tears after the first time she said she was proud of me but then after a year of being together I got depressed and she couldn't understand it so she left. I am super lucky to have a good amount of close friends and family that I cherish and love, all of whom offer me support in one way or another but I just don't feel able to accept it, I'll act like I've accepted it but it just doesn't go in. I've had people give me really lovely and sincere compliments but they also just don't go in, part of me feels like they don't know me enough to judge my character and that if they truly knew me they wouldn't want to compliment me.

2364,fluffybangtan,1626373288,1,"I don't even know how to express in words the overwhelming feeling. My mind stays alright when I'm distracted and obsessing over other activities, it's just as people suggest ""focus on yourself/love yourself/etc"" and that's exactly what I do. Those moments feel exhilarating BUT when I relax and look for a second, I see how I'm just a person that only ""exists"" for most people. I have a loving family - that is my dad and aunt. But I think all of us wish for friends that would care for what's going on with us. Or check up on us... 

My bestfriend does that sometimes or replies to my statuses and I'm grateful for that, I do the same. We don't have very much to talk about because although we grew up together, our interests tastes or feelings are very different so ""deep talk"" is something that never happens between us. But apart from that... I don't think I can say I have any close friends anymore. I use my hobbies as a coping mechanism to escape the fact that I don't have friends who actually care for me. 

And tbh, the only time some people do ""care"" is when I act like how they want me to act - being a good listener, asking questions, being support system or something. But they'd never do the same or be there for me.

The only good friend I made in college and thought he understood me, he's ignoring me even though he's online the whole day. He's actually very self-centered and all he does is talk about him, his interests, or simply answer questions. And never about me. But he's the only good friend I managed to make in college who would sometimes check up on me when I was MIA... The others don't quite care, they're closer to others and even he's getting closer to someone else and I'm just here... Looking at a college life of being just ""oh yeah she was in my class"". 

No one in my class really cares or tries to be friends with me. I am sorry for ranting. It's just, I feel very pathetic and lonely and it's eating at me. I try to ignore these because it really gets to me and upsets me... But sometimes it's unavoidable when realising I have no one who would check up on me. Just makes me feel meaningless.

I was always the quiet girl in the back of the classroom. I never stood out. I was pretty good at most of the sports I was in but I never fit in with that crowd. Each year I’d have a group of 1-4 friends. That’s how it’s always been since elementary school. But, now I’m in college with friends I feel like arent even truly friends. I have a boyfriend but it’s toxic. I feel like I don’t understand what a boyfriend or having a friend really means. I feel so alone. 

Once I make friends I become so clingy and attached because I’m scared of being alone. I thought that the two friends I made were my “best friend”. That’s what they told me at least. I’ll try to make plans with them and they’ll blow me off and hang out with each other. I try talking to other people but once you get in college it’s difficult to make friends. My boyfriend is the only one I talk to on a daily basis but because it’s growing more and more toxic I want to be alone, but at the same time I don’t want to. Is that weird? I try so hard to make friends but I’m just not unique or different. I’m too shy to go up to people and start a conversation. I spend everyday in my apartment watching Netflix.

2370,AughtBeing,1626367925,1,"I've never had problems making friends. Once upon a time I had plenty of female friends infact. They would shower with me platitudes such as ""yer a great guy, any girl would be lucky to be with you"", ""you are husband material"" right before they chased other guys and got boyfriends. Of course I was never the one good enough to be their partner.

Recently, I was talking to my only female friend left, lets call her A. A always complains about being ""ugly"" and ""undesirable"", but get this. She somehow has a new boyfriend every month. Frankly she uses me as an emotional tampon, always going on and on about her relationship problems. Not that she would ever consider me as a potential partner mind you.

Anyway, A said she felt bad for me and that she knew a girl who might be interested in dating. Let's call her M. A said that M is looking for true love, that she always got rejected by guys. I told A that always getting rejected was taking a toll on me too. A then assured me M would ""accept anyone at this point.""

A then should me a picture of her. She was chubby ( I am a gym rat), religious (wore a hijab, Im very anti-religion due to abuse in my upbringing) and missing two of her front teeth. Despite all these, I told A that I was willing to see out if we could have something.

A then setup up a call with M and me. I tried to have a conversation, asking about what she likes, what she was looking for in a guy etc etc. M only responded in grunts, and not even 2 minutes into the call she hung up. M then later texted A that she wasnt interested.

The last few weeks all I have ever been doing is laying on my bed dreaming about is kissing, holding hands and cuddling. Frankly, the pandemic has been a real curse; since my office is closed I cant even get to be a corporate slave and work myself to death.

So yup. I got rejected by someone who would ""accept anyone."" Amazing isn't it. A feat only achieved by u/AughtBeing. How the hell am I supposed to get a relationship and get married if I cant even get someone who gets rejected alot to accept me? I'm done. I'm done. I'm nothing. I'm nothing. I am, an aught being.

2371,ShoddyLychee9451,1626366415,1,"Hi everyone, I just joined this sub to get some perspective on my situation. I love my personal space way too much. It isn't the case that I don't enjoy being out with friends, travelling or enjoying life. I just don't want a woman in my life, or at least that is what I tell myself.

I am posting anonymously so I cannot brag here about being the person I am, which is the only reason I'm openly saying this. I am a fairly attractive guy, tall, dark, wide shoulders, attractive eyes (that is a compliment I have received way too many times). Moreover, I belong to a fairly wealthy family, not too rich, not poor, but above average. To top that off, my grades are simply distinct. I do study and have secured a world rank in my edexcel A-Level exams which seems to be a big deal to my friends and to be honest it is a big deal to me as well. But it gets me unwanted attention.

Enough about all that! Just wanted to lay out that my problem is something else, something I can't identity. The problem is not getting women. I don't approach women. I'm fairly confident and straightforward in my daily affairs and am quite funny apparently, which is a thing us guys just have to be (jk). I'm passionate about chess, collecting fragrances, solving the rubik's cube, watching tv series and football. I take my fashion seriously and combine mascule yet classy outfits with great fragrances to be attractive. See that's the problem. I don't want anyone but i don't know why I still do all these things. I have got offers from girls in my college and classes, girls who all the other guys dream about. I feel that I am a good catch which is why the girls aren't into me for who I am on the inside, but on the outside, because I never gave them the opportunity to know me from the inside.

Now, I am not bi neither gay. I am sexually attracted to girls. I've noticed that my standards are incredibly high which makes it difficult for me to like girls I see on a day to day basis. I'm a sensitive guy on the inside and am an incredibly good listener as well. Back in my teens I used to study female psychology extensively so I can pick up easily if a girl is interested in me or what makes girls interested in the first place. The problem is I do all these things to stay fit, look good, in the subconscious hope of attracting potential mates when in the first place i don't want anyone to invade my personal space, whom I'll have to text regularly or buy gifts knowing that one day we both will be bored considering the generation of today, filled with cheaters. The only reason i see to getting a woman is fulfilling my physical desire, and possibly having a child who'll have their mother, in the future. For context, I'm 21. 

So I'm very confused. I have this delusional masculine energy feeling ""oh i don't need to attract anyone they like me already"" and this is dangerous and at times really untrue. The thing is I'm not overconfident at all, but I'm a confident guy for sure. In real life I'm a very humble person. I believe in helping those in need and showing them kindness. 

I've never opened up this much because it makes me feel grossed out about myself, as all of this, if i heard from some else,  I would think they are the cockiest person on earth. The anonymity gave me the courage to share this, i would like to know if there's someone else who is an attractive man and actively avoids relationships as they prefer their personal space. I want to know their long term plans in life regarding marriage and how they think of going on that path, if ever.

I've been on this wild ride everyone calls life for a short period of time, but I feel like Im 1000 years old and that Ive been alone for far too long.


It started first when I met a girl in HS that seemed nice, cute, all the stuff.  It lasted 3 weeks, cause she was with me 'due to me being in sports team and she liked the attention'. Lesson learned. 

Fastforward few years, Ive met with a girl that, all in all, turned out to already  be with someone, even though they supposedly ""broken up"". Story that revolves around that subject is long, but it was the first time Ive actually had someone that understood me well. I escaped the relationship after I found out she had someone.

Then there was another one, that I thought to be the perfect match. 
But I felt it was for the best to end it, since I was moving cities, and pretty far aswell. Didnt want her to suffer, I guess.


And its been 4 long years. Seemingly, its not much.. But it feels like a life time. Four years since I've given myself a chance to try, but in the back of my mind I still feel like a... Betrayer, of sorts. 
 I still feel unworthy, even though I had attempted to try to get into another relationship, I feel like I dont deserve happines and in the end I fuck it up. Always.

I feel so tired.

So alone.

I've battled with my own mind for years, and it seems Im reaching a breaking point.

But the downside is his friendship brings with it a tiring sense of needing to baby him when he becomes depressed…which is quite often. It hurts to distance myself from him, but I refuse to let myself coddle him anymore. He doesnt realize that him not getting help is hurting more than just himself, and I dont know how to tell him that. So….today marks the first day in 4 months we haven’t spoken. I feel like shit. I feel incredibly lonely, knowing nobody else would send more than a few words to me if I tried to strike a conversation. And I feel sad, knowing he wont think about my side of things when it comes to me giving him the silent treatment.

If anyone feels like texting me, you may hear me ramble on about one of two things- my shitty friendship with my ex, or how I hate my life. Unless you bring up a different topic haha.",lonely,I’m distancing myself from the last person that would talk to me,2021-07-15 13:51:42

2435,Critical-Reasoning,1626319244,1,"I'm feeling particularly lonely today because it's my birthday today, so I decided to post here for the first time and maybe hopefully feel a tiny bit less lonely today.

Nothing is happening today, no celebration, it's another uneventful day. I've grown apart with most of my friends over the years; I've never been a very social type of guy, and the pandemic lockdowns have made things even worse. I do have family that I can spend some time with, but I'm not that close with them either. I've been single for a while, and my dating life is non-existent these days, which doesn't help. I used to go out quite often to try to socialize and make new friends (which obviously isn't possible these days), but it rarely progress further into something more meaningful, most of the time it felt it's still at a superficial level.

I don't know if others here felt the same way, sometimes I get the feeling of loneliness even when I'm not alone, even when surrounded by people, because no one has penetrated that barrier. I don't even remember when was the last time I felt a deep connection with someone; not even with girls that I've dated. What's worse is that melancholy is sapping my motivation to reach out to try to make new close friends or find a relationship partner.

I'm thankful that my life have little drama, unlike some of the people I know. But at the same time it feels too peaceful, I don't feel like anyone in the world truly cares about me. A lot of people I've met in the past were too absorbed in their own world, too inconsiderate, maybe even somewhat selfish, like they want something out from me first. I feel like no one in the world will reach out to me to try to create something more meaningful. Although I understand that I need to be proactive, that it's on me to change my own situation, I understand that concept. It just feels too hard sometimes, when you have little motivation, when you feel lonely.

Just wanted to get some of it off my chest. Thanks for listening.",lonely,Loneliness on my birthday,2021-07-15 13:20:44
2436,SomeForgettableGuy,1626318717,1,"It hurts. I'm 22 years old now and I've still never been in a relationship. Nobody has ever wanted me, and nobody ever wants to spend time with me. I've spend every Saturday for the past 12 years alone with nothing to do except either sit at home or something spontaneous like seeing a movie by myself, or ordering myself a pizza, or grocery shopping 😞.

Life is pain when you have no friends, nobody to relate to, nobody to share your love with. 

I'm not going to say id be better off dead, but if I were to die the world around me would keep on going. Nobody lives would change much, except my family, but unfortunately their sadness would be more about losing a family than of losing u/SomeForgettableGuy. Nobody knows me, and nobody has ever cared to try to know me. 

I was just thinking a while ago how great it would be to have someone actually want to spend time with me. Imagine how great it would be to hear someone happily say your name, or do be greeted with a smile. To just have someone be there, someone you feel you can be honest with, someone you feel safe with. That's heaven right there. I don't know if I'll ever get to experience that joy. I just want to be loved like everyone else, but we can't all be winners I guess. 

It doesn't even make any sense, there is no reason that people shouldn't like me. If you told my colleagues or my family that I was a lonely depressed virgin who's never felt love before they'd all be shocked. To everyone else I seem like I've got my shit together, but nobody cares about me, and it stings every single day.

2457,JumpSleep123,1626312114,1,"....or so it seems.

Your friend's kind actions towards you? They don't matter. Common interests don't matter either. You shouldn't listen to what people tell you about yourself. They just have an idealized version of you in their heads. Later on, you'll see them changing their minds about you just as fast and realize that all that you two did together meant nothing. The other person was just looking for some entertainment and they don't need it anymore.

You're putting too much effort into the friendship. The other person does not care about you that much. Again, I don't care what that person said. They are on a ""lovers high"" of sort, it's not the truth and it will go away. People *can* live without you. They will gladly move on.

You don't understand why someone is acting a certain way aabout you and you're giving them the benefit of the doubt? Seriously, you're so stupid, you're wasting your time thinking of complex reasons for why that's happening when it *is* that simple: they don't care about you. They would've done the effort, if they really wanted. Notice how they haven't apologized, even when they have no reason to (you know, like nice and polite people always do to ensure that no feelings are hurt unnecessarily).

Don't buy into their politeness or nice behaviour. People never tell you their true feelings. Communication is a farce: when the relationship is on a tough part, no one actually bothers to communicate. It's just a buzzword people use nowadays.

Friends are meant to be used for our own purposes. That person needed your help at some point and, now that they don't, they have no reason to keep the friendship going. Because no matter what they made you believe - or what effort you put into you and them  - you were always a passing thought to them, nothing more.

Funnily enough though, you'll always see the same people together for the rest of their lives. Old high school colleagues always talking to one another. College friends remaining friends after college. But yes, the loneliness that you're experiencing is totally normal, don't sorry.

Trust me: It doesn't matter. Nothing does. Accept the truth so you know what to expect and it doesn't hurt as bad.

A few years ago I was in your shoes. I was struggling with diagnosed schizophrenia and had daily thoughts of suicide. It pained me to live, eat, socialize, work and everything under the sun. LIVING FUCKING SUCKED. One morning while on a annual family hunting trip, I couldn’t take it anymore and put the barrel where the bright tunnel was and prayed that I be given a second chance. And like that, a fucking deer stepped on leaves near my deer stand. It was literally at that moment that I realized that I had a second chance in life to change who I was. I turned my life around from that day on and have been a selfless (not really, just honest person) ever since. But that wasn’t the end of it. I still feel depressed and lonely sometimes and find solace in my hobbies and the soothing things my imagination comes up with. But for others, that second chance wasn’t an easy life.

Before we met, my boyfriend who was struggling with an abusive ex swallowed a large quantity of ibuprofen and alcohol in hopes of taking that path. He had second thoughts when he started throwing up blood. His roommate found out what was happening and rushed him to the ER. His stomach was pumped and he was in the hospital for two weeks. Due to that permanent scarring, he can no longer eat acidic and spicy foods. He took it as a sign to lose weight and ultimately leave his ex.

There’s many stories like his and my own. But know that if you even think about it, it consumes you. When you are on the cutting board, your plans after the first cut change immediately. Your decision to change your life starts with you. Become a doctor, police officer, soldier, farmer, anything.

So obviously with all this I have no friends. I mean, I don’t blame people. On top of all this I am socially inept. A conversation with me is like playing ping pong with a four year old. Half the time responding to the shit I say is impossible.

I crave intimacy. Emotional intimacy. To be understood. But it feels like such a reach for someone like me.

I see other people and get envious. I know not to express it but its a strong feeling.

All of this makes me embarrassed and ashamed. I tried therapy and couldnt find anyone decent. A lot of awkward silence or pushing of lexapro. I tried lexapro. Just gave me weird ass dreams and made me feel nothing.

I desperately want change. If someone gave me some sort of guide with a promise of feeling/being better I’d follow it religiously. There is a fire within me, this desire to be better is overbearing - but I have no idea where to start. I am clueless. I don’t follow instructions well.

I have been journaling for 8 monthes and one thing I got from it was my speech is sporadic, emotional, and often contradicts itself. I use language as an aesthetic. I’m not even sure if that makes sense.

So in case you don't know. ""Live dealer"" is the concept of playing blackjack, baccarat roulette etc but instead of just a computer program, it's live and an actual dealer is doing the job.

One of the largest supplier of this also has a pretty popular and well used ""Chat"" feature. Basically you can chat with the dealer and other players although its quite primitive, it works.

So i have been working from home since march back when covid first happened. After a couple of months i started to gather some money due to no commute, no expensive lunches etc. And i didn't really know what to do with it. So i thought why not gamble it? (not the smartest financial choice but whatever it was just fun money anyway, I'm pretty financially stable)

I joined and i really saw how popular it was to talk to the dealers. People were talking about relationships, cars, the weather, parties, you name it, everything! Especially at the baccarat tables since they have a lot of downtime. I joined in and it was pretty pleasant. Just small talk.

But then i found this one dealer, we just clicked immediately. She was same age as me, had the exact same humor as me, funny, wits, she roasted me, i roasted her, she told me stories, i told her stories she talked about her life, i talked about my life. We talked about literally everything. It was just amazing talking to her, u never knew what the conversation would lead to. Or what u would talk about. It was an adventure every single time. And she was funny as hell.

Eventually i just joined her table, not to gamble, but to just talk. I just flat-betted the minimum bet from time to time just to avoid the system auto kicking me for AFK.

Now it wasn't like i just followed her around and bombarded the chat, she was the one who asked most of the questions, she was the one who screamed my name every time i joined the table, she was the one who got ""upset"" if i didn't join one day. So i kept joining ofc.

And this continued ... for months. I believe we have been doing this for almost a year now. First thing i would check in the morning was if she was online. She worked 2-3 times a week, 8h shifts, and when she worked, i was there almost the entire time. I felt great and my mood was better then it has ever been and working from home was sooo much easier now.

And then recently she told me she wasn't going to be a dealer anymore and do something else within the company, which i totally understand, the job is well....repetitive to say the least and the turnover rate is huge for a reason.

Her last day was horrible. She cried during her final table, and me to. And she stood up and left, and she was gone, forever 😢 Like saying goodbye to someone at the airport knowing u will never talk or see them ever again

I cryptically tried to give her my insta and i think she got it, but it's very much against the rules to talk to players outside of the casino so i don't think she's gonna do anything with that since she still works there, that or she looked at my profile and was just ""no thanks"". 

After this, i have been really depressed. Depressed because i miss a person i haven't met in real life, a person that hasn't even seen me irl. Depressed because i felt like i could vent with her and now i cant anymore, depressed because i realize how lonely i am and that i have nobody i can talk to. Depressed because i have been checking out my Instagram like an insane person the last couple of days to no avail. Just, nothing. 

And finally, depressed because i literally had to pay money to have someone talk to me.

I'm Spending more time with my family and gaming alone or with my brother now. So I'm not bothered that I'm alone most of the time. 

But I found out this last week that no one really text me to ask if I'm ok or how i'm doing. There where two who rarely asked me something and I do reply. Some of my friends ask if I want to hang out I said sure, but never told me where and when like how am I supposed to know when to come.
And one other just ask me things sometimes and out of nowhere she stops replying and just ignores my texts even tho she can reply later either way I got used to this but it still bothers me 

So yeah no one text me this week so I decided two days back to delete my account on sunday unless they send me one message asking me if I am doing fine. Sometimes I just wish that someone could reach out to me for once. 

I'm probably in the wrong here and I'm not blaming anyone for this. I mean why wait if you can do the same thing in return, but it's kind of a sad feeling that no one bats an eye to me. Atleast not that I know

How I grew into this loneliness is something that I guess I've had since I was a child? I honestly don't know!! I feel stupid for feeling like this. I have never really been able to keep a girlfriend ever since I first started dating. I'm a Pieces. I fall in love so fast then I smother these poor girls. I was married at the age of 23 to a lovely young girl she was 18. She was never able to have children. That's all she ever wanted. She had several miscarriages and initially we had support, but she never regained a healthy body with surgeries roughly every six months and we wound up getting a divorce. To this day I still have a love for her. What's crazy is every woman who broke up with me n broke my heart, I always thought that we would be together for a lifetime no matter who she was but the relationships always ended and I would be alone again. I know that I had codependency issues but have basically lied about them. Today I am still in love with a woman who left me over 8 years ago and my daughter says that this woman ruined her father. I haven't been the same since. That is absolutely true!! Sad but true!! I met a woman just 2 weeks ago and it turns out that she knows the girl I dated pre covid n the girl is throwing a cock block so the other girl won't break that female bond n I really liked the mew girl. She actually listens to the same radio station that I do. I bought concert tickets and spent a ton of money and I don't have a date as of yet but I have until November 12th to get one. Years ago I had the same scenario when I bought Neil Diamond tickets with the expectancy of getting a date by the time the concert came. Such was not the case. I wound up depressed, didn't even go to the concert or even trying to sell the tickets. I feel as though history may be repeating itself. The depression is real. My love is real.

2541,LLancee,1626259445,1,"So hello everyone. I’m gonna be talking about my high school experience, more specifically, my social experience in high school. I did pretty well academically, got good grades and the teachers thought I was a good student, but on the making friends part of high school was where the problems were. I think that experience had a lasting impact on me and I wonder if on this subreddit there are people currently going through a similar thing. It’s a bit sad sometimes, but I know people have gone through much worse. I thankfully wasn’t exactly bullied constantly for example. But without further ado, this is my social high school story. 

So in my country, you have multiple high school levels. You had a few that were from 7th till 10th grade, you had ones from 7th till 11th grade and you had higher levels that were from 7th till 12th grade. If you finished one of these levels, you could go to a higher high school for another 2 years to get to a better college or university, or you could go to college or, if you did one of the 7-12 grade courses, university. So considering I had been diagnosed with DCD/dyspraxia(Developmental coordination disorder)and sometimes lived in my own world, all while having trouble doing technical things practically and even had trouble learning with some subjects, I did a theoretically based high school from 7th-10th grade.

Academically this went very well. I found the right way to learn and barely got any insufficient grades. But on the social side of things, this is where it kinda began to shift. You see, i had the same class from 1st grade all the way until 6th grade, so I knew all of my classmates very well and got along fine with most of them. My friend groups were never all that big, but I figured if I was myself, I would have no trouble making friends in high school. I was wrong.

In 7th grade I got into a class with quite a few unmotivated people who would do nothing all day and talk through the teacher’s explanations and had the most childish humor possible. I tried to be myself, but apparently that wasn’t good enough for them. They thought I was lame, stupid and weird and called me hurtful things like ‘autistic’ or ‘bellend’ or ‘fucking idiot’ because they knew I wouldn’t doing anything about it. After all, I didn’t have any friends, it was me against them every time such an argument started. 

As a result of that, I tried to be more like them. I was a lot more rude to people and became a lot less enthusiastic in everything I did, but this only made it worse. As a result of that, I socially had a 7th grade to forget about. It was only halfway through 8th grade that I did a bit more school things with people in other classes because we had some entertainment programs that you must follow. Some where cooking, some where acting, some where design etc. And this was done between all 4 8th grades, so I got to meet new people who were nice and I thought: ‘you can be yourself if you believe in yourself, what am I doing?’. This is when I started to be myself again and it paid off.

In 9th grade I got into a completely new class with people who either came from other schools or other classes, this is where I met my friend who I’ll call Mike(not his real name of course). I met Mike on one of the first days at school in 9th grade. I went to the cafeteria during lunch break and sat on my usual bench. Mike then came up to me and said: “Is this where you sit everyday, alone? Why?” I answered back: “Yes, because I don’t have any friends” and he just sat down next to me. Ever since that day, I sat with him during lunch break until the end of 9th grade.

But even then, I still have mixed feelings about him. When we were on a school trip in 9th grade, he met some new people he liked. I also liked them and we hung out a lot during that trip. But after that, Mike started making the same jokes as the guys in 7th grade did to me and also became a bit more rude towards me. And come 10th grade, he went to a different class and he barely ever sat with me. I made some different friends in 10th grade, but they were more ‘fake friends’ to me. I thought they were my friends, but I don’t think the considered me as a friend. And at the end of 10th grade, I went to sit with them during lunch break and they asked me: “Why do you always sit with us? Do you think we’re your friends or something?” And then they laughed. Later that day, I laid on my bed and cried. 

I graduated a month later and now study Hospitality management with people who accept me for who I am and the same goes for the people I work with at my internship. I hope that when the you-know-what virus is over, I can do something fun with my classmates.

I will get something in my head that has been bugging me for a while, or that I’m concerned about, and I will dwell on it and dwell on it until I physically feel sick and start panicking. My life is not too bad right now. I have a great dad who’s supportive and listens, pets I love dearly, a fiancé, even though he’s thousands of miles away, and a prospective new job. Yet still, even the good things bring worry. I worry about when I’ll see my fiancé again, due to all these restrictions that never seem to end, even though I am lucky I’ve just spent the last six weeks with him, but now he’s gone and I can’t stop feeling empty and alone. I worry about my visa to move over to him, will it get rejected, when will I finally make it there, will I miss everything here. 

I have no idea when I’m starting my new job, could be any day, could be next week, and that also worries me a lot, even though it’s not a big deal. I’m worried that I’m not doing enough for my rabbits, while at the same time I spend most of my time being with them, buying things for them, thinking about them.

Sometimes it all gets too much. I just want to stop worrying, I’m so tired of it. I want a friend. Someone who gets it, who understands. I’ve had friends in the past, but they always revealed themselves to be not who I thought they were, never felt comfortable around them, just wish I could find someone I genuinely enjoy talking to.

People tell me social anxiety is nothing, you'll get over it by time as you talk to ppl more but in reality, no lol talking to people seems like such a hard task, it's exhausting and if I ever try I just become socially awkward and do something rude(unintentionally) or unusual and get embarrassed and back out from talking to ppl again.

Feel the 'negative' energy and welcome it with open arms. Let it stay as long as it wants, It doesn't harm you, but you harm yourself trying to get rid of it.

If there are times when negative thoughts of interactions flood your mind accept that your harsh judgement could be correct. You might have done something stupid. You may have been awkward. It only matters if you say it does. Without your consent, nobody can define what is 'good' in your existence. That's your power.

When you depend on others for your image and worth, you have to constantly change yourself to fit their definition of good. You trade your life for the affection of another and they have no idea what they're doing here. It becomes the blind leading the blind.

Spend time with yourself. Not watching tv or reading a book. Stand up and slowly move your toes, bend your knees slightly and flex your lower body. Feel what it's like to let your muscles take the pressure off your bones. Turn on some music and allow the connection between sound and touch to go unfiltered. Make up your own vocals. Let the blood and oxygen flow and your nerves come alive. Hear what they say.

Many abuse their bodies, treating it like a slave to their will. It's a foundational part of existence. Spend time with it and it will enhance your experience. When lying in bed, shut everything off and slowly curly your hands and toes. Tense them in the motion. Feel each movement.

This is it. This is your experience of existence. Grab each second of it and appreciate it. If you believe you could create a better one, you have the power to do so. The rules of meaning and purpose are all written in your mind. If it's difficult, use that knowledge to empathize with existence. It's malleable, but it's not going to shape itself to your will. You need to connect with it. Not with the voices of others, with yourself. You. You exist. You're incredible.

I can't rely on friends, because I have none. And good luck making friends when you're miserable and lonely. 

I can't rely on family because my mother is abusive, and my dad is very sick with cancer. I was taken from my family when I was a kid by my mom, so I'm not close to my dad or his side of the family, and my mom's only family is her own crazy mother so I have no family I can find solace in.

I can't find a girlfriend because no woman wants to be with a guy who not only has absolutely zero dating experience but also has no future and is depressed and alone. 

I'm just screwed because in order to find any form of love in this world you have to first already be loved by  either friends/family, so what are you supposed to do when you were never shown that love? When you're completely alone and miserable? When you hate everyday and just want to die? The only thing you can do is continue to suffer day after day because until you somehow magically stop being depressed and lonely nobody will ever want anything to do with you.

I still remember being in the kitchen at my moms house and hearing a scream…the type of scream that never bears good news. The type of scream where your heart drops and you know something terrible has happened to someone you love and you just have to brace yourself to find out who it is. I would have never guessed in a million years that your name would be the name spoken over the phone that day. I’ve never felt so empty and useless until that day, because I realized how final death is. Is he in jail? I can bail him out… is he stranded somewhere? I can find a way to get him home… need a kidney? I’ll be a donor… but death? Death is final. There’s nothing that I can do to change or fix that. You literally have to accept it but yet and still I struggle with letting you go. I’m not used to doing this thing we call life without you. Thru ups and downs, from boys to men, the good days and bad days, you were always by my side. I’m still adjusting to the fact that you are never coming back and I have to figure this crazy world out without you. I still cry when I think of jokes that I know you would find funny. When a song that you’d like plays. When I think of memories we had. I don’t know if I’ll ever find someone more worthy to be my best man at my wedding one day. You set a high standard for what a brother and friend should be, so much so that it’s not even realistic to think that I’ll find another friend like you in this lifetime.

My family never bother to visit, and my few friends rarely have the time. I have been trying dating apps and going to parties, but I let my body go during my marriage and I feel like I'm just a drunken mistake for most of the people I meet. I met someone at the weekend and we initially hit it off, but they haven't been in touch since and I think they regret how far things went. I think it's the fact that it was with me that they regret.

I was totally fine initially, I was finishing my Master's degree, which I aced, but since then (January), I've had nothing productive to do. I've begun drinking more and feeling depressed. I have a very specific job which means I can't seek help for it, as it would be my colleagues who become aware of it. My job is to help people fix their lives, but mine is in shambles.

I just can't deal with it any more. I've stopped using dating apps and I'm struggling to have the positive energy to sort my weight out. I think it's the biggest barrier in how women see me, or at least I think it's part of it because of how I see myself. Exercise is difficult as I have a back injury, so it's intermittent at best.

Im just lonely, overweight, and struggling. I hate the silence of my home and I crave human contact. I even joined a discord server just to talk to people, but I feel out of place.

2632,kingvrage,1626211951,1,"The best catch you could imagine, you'll never meet. You've probably ghosted them already. 

We aren't home every night, every week or every month. 

We have tons of resources and expendable income but no one to share any of our achievements with. 

We keep the lights on, we keep supplies moving, without us you'd freeze to death, starve, die of untreated illnesses, etc. 

Texting like this can be a burden. Most people can't be bothered to talk on the phone anymore so there's a lack of connection. We can't be bothered with people like that. 

We've all risked our lives to have the things we have some of us have almost died more than a few times, some of us have seen friends and coworkers die lives ultimately changed by severe injury. 

In a modern dating world it seems nobody understands that these kind of people still exist. 

We don't get to go out, we don't get to just make plans to see each other next week. 

When someone asks me where I live and I try to explain to them that I live everywhere they don't get it. 

I've long forgone a home base because I have nothing to go home to anyway. I have nobody. So I just stay out here and continue to generate an income. 

And what's worse is when I have someone in my life for a little while and I show them what I'm able to do and I offered to teach them and allow them to be part of it so we can more than double our productivity and have something and keep her from having to work at waffle House or IHOP, they'd rather sit at home and hunt for a boyfriend that's home every night even if it means he's jobless or a dead end. 

I've had potential S/O one after the other no that they could come out here with me and travel and see the country, get nice cabins or hotel rooms in our off time or hold down the fort and help me build things up there while I'm gone, and have no interest in any of it. 

I don't know what it is you ladies want, but I've got news for you... There's almost no future in jobs that have you home every night. 

You expect your man to get you that big house, the swimming pool, the big Christmas every year, a new car, brand new appliances and extra spending money? 

This is what it takes. 

That little boyfriend barista you have that works at Starbucks and is still going to college in his late twenties to mid 30s is not going to provide you with any of that. 

That guy you've been seeing off and on the last few months that works in IT probably makes closer to 12 to $15 an hour... 

But I often wonder if this is  a codependent personality type... 

I have various women tell me very often that I'm ""looking in the wrong places"" or I need to be ""content alone before I can be with anybody""

These people have no idea what goes on in this world or what it takes to keep the ball rolling. 

I don't know what places they assume I'm looking in and they have no idea what it's like to be this alone for this long. 

Modern dating leaves no room for sacrifices. Going places I've never been before and making the impossible happen everyday is in my blood. 

That's not what modern dating expectations want. 

It's preferable to struggle in poverty together so at least you guys get to see each other every night and hold hands on the hand-me-down couch you got at the yard sale while you stay stressed with one another and your current situation because neither of you can make the rent. 

The last man on the wall gets no consideration. To be clear I am not even remotely talking about military men. I never was part of that fraternity on government assistance. 

There are tons of us that are everywhere and nowhere everyday. And we stay that way because we have no one to go to. 

I get ghosted a lot and I believe it's partially due to the fact that they can't understand where I'm coming from. No I don't live anywhere in particular, but if it was worth it if there was a connection I could come to you or bring you to me. 

Too many people are brainwashed into the 9 to 5 house with a picket fence or an apartment and home every night all the time. 

And in their mind if they can't have that with you you are less than. 

I know a lot of you are lonely, but until you eat sleep work and enjoy off time completely in seclusion, with no friends or family or acquaintances to share anything with for months and years at a time then you can't understand. 

I don't don't understand how everyone's first go to is ""you're looking in the wrong places""

I don't get that if every place I've tried every avenue I've experimented with I get zero response nine times out of 10 and when I do get a response I get ghosted. I even get ghosted by people I wouldn't settle for. 

I see men like myself often get dropped for obvious red flag no future deadbeats. 

If you still have to rub shoulders with people at work, would you at least see your neighbors as you head home, you've got no clue what it's like to be this forgotten.

I've been forgotten because I'm out here keeping the lights on.",lonely,Lonely for the backbone,2021-07-14 07:32:31

Alone

You should have seen him, the kid who never frowned

He didn’t know there could be downs

Wherever he went, he made friends

Kindhearted would be an understatement

Departed, though his feelings went

A new time, picked up new rhymes

Now on his own he goes

Traveling alone, into the unknown

To seek the throne

Unknowingly making himself alone

He realizes now, it’s too late

He took lifes bait

And now he asks himself

To what is this throne, 

If I am to be alone.",lonely,"Alone, A poem by me",2021-07-14 07:23:44

We dated for about 3 months before she started getting odd, I would invite her over to my house and she would come over. The thing is, the only thing she would do was face time her other ""friends"" Now I had told her that it made me feel bad when she did this, but she continued to do this. She would make offensive jokes about things she knew I was insecure about. One day, a day where I relasped into self harm, it was a very bad day. That day I decided I was gonna fucking accuse her ass. I sent a long ass message telling her about how uncomfortable I was about her talking to her friends all the time when I am trying to hang out with her. The thing is, I panicked after I sent the message. I started to have a panick attack, I blocked her without even thinking of what I was supposed to do. Me and her have multiple platforms we talk on, I just blocked her on our main platform. So she contacted me on discord about a week later she was confused. I told her about everything and she was mad. Whenever I tried to talk she would just reply with ""yes"" ""Okay"" ""I didn't know"" So I just fucking closed discord. About a week later I was in the tub bleeding, I was lightheaded, because I had lost a lot of blood. I ended up texting her, but she had just left she told me ""Why shouldn't I block you"" And I mean, she should have. I was being a stupid bitch, but when I tried to tell her I thought I was gonna die. She had blocked me. I'm okay now, but that day I passed out in the tub for about 6 hours, but I was okay.

Life is just very unfulfilling. I’ve actually read the other day the reason guys typically invest their time into video games is because of the reward it offers. You get success, visible signs of progression, routine, and if you screw up the game allows for another attempt. It’s forgiving and rewards the player for their efforts.

I can’t find that level of satisfaction irl. Every attempt that goes bad only drags you further down, progression is much more difficult to find aside from your account balance, support system is dubious and tiresome.

Now, I transferred to a new school just at the start of the pandemic(for class 11 and 12) and things have progressively gotten worse.

I've realized I probably have no close friend. Some of the friends I had transferred to different schools, and I don't know... We just stopped talking. The few I have are just for fun. I have made 0 new friends.

Even worse my dad passes away due to covid at the end of April. It just feels empty and odd. I talk to my mom a lot. But sometimes I just feel if I had someone to talk to, like extremely openly, things would be much better.

So I try to go to twitter, etc. But I make accounts with inauthentic names so no one I know recognizes me. Then I go to approach some random person. But everyone seems so shallow. Then I think about what I'm doing, desperately trying to find friends and think that it's pathetic. So I deactivate all my accounts. I go to random sites to anonymously chat, but again, I don't really have anyone to open up to there either. It just feels bad.

Most probably my ego is the problem, maybe it's my insecurity, I don't know... I don't want to go to social sites to make friends... I don't wanna be desperate. But I guess I am.

I really never had any friends because no one wants to bother when they have alternatives, and also my country(Saudi Arabia) provides poor accessibility which definitely didn't help. Wanting to have friends was one of my goals going to university; I got to my ideal weight, bought different clothes and was really excited and open to have new friends, but, as expected, no one wanted to associate with me... They either just want me to solve their homework, or casual talking while they are waiting for their classes.

I tried to make friends in Reddit, and none got anywhere(probably because most are introverts).

Except the truth is - no ones coming to save you, that’s being extremely hopeful/dependent because at the end of the day you only have yourself. So then how do you find comfort in this loneliness? Or get out of this cold, abandoned place in your mind?",lonely,"Loneliness, my old dark friend",2021-07-14 00:45:24
2671,Random_humanx,1626186515,1,"TW: Mention of Suicide.

We’re “One Text Away” and this is what we mean by this : More than 700 000 people die by suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. So, what can we do to prevent suicide? This is a question I myself have pondered on for a while now. After some research, I came to a conclusion that the saying “Prevention is better than cure” holds true here too. We believe that suicide isn’t a phenomenon that happens in a day, although the act takes only a couple of minutes, the motive behind that act is caused my many small sad moments bottled up over a period of time which don’t seem like a big deal then, but can have long-term effects on our mental health. So, to answer the question, we can prevent suicides in a more effective way by acting early! By not letting the person reach the extreme stage where they think it is the only option left.

Now coming to what we here at One Text Away can do? A little context about us: we are young students, and all the members in my team will be around my age too. This clearly tells you that we are not  trained professionals to treat you. Then why are we here? We’re here to listen to you! We know you’ve had a long day and if  you’re not sure whom to talk to, then lay it on us! We're here for you! Is there anything that you’ve been holding back for a while and not sure whom to tell? Don't worry we’re for you! Or do you just feel lonely and need someone to talk to about random stuff? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered as well! In short : If in any situation you feel the need to talk to anyone, we’re here for you! or to quote Charlie Puth “Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love... No matter where you go, know you're not alone I'm only one call away..I'll be there to save the day” (yeah I’m kinda obsessed with this song).  

Now what can you do to reach us? Just shoot us a text, on [instagram](https://instagram.com/x.onetextaway.x?utm_medium=copy_link) (x.onetextaway.x), and we will write back to you as soon as possible! Thank you for your attention, beautiful people. Have a great day ahead ✨

2672,ChiisaiChinpo,1626186286,1,"Some days ago I decided to stop masturbating and watching porn because I think I was addicted to it, after that I sleep better, I have more energy and more of those ""positive things"", but I just realized, what have changed since I stopped? nothing, I'm lonely, I'm miserable and I'm still a worthless piece of shit. There's no woman in the earth that would love me, so there's any benefit in stop masturbating? I'm just stopped having that self pleasure and that false feeling of having a loot of partners to fuck, maybe I'm a little more healthier now, but not more happy so what's the point?
Maybe I should keep watching porn, anyway It's impossible for me to even talk to a girl, and after all the porn I have watched I don't think I can even be satisfied with a normal relationship because I was into hardcore stuff.

And I don’t blame her at all, I was never good at understanding or comprehending feelings because I had no emotional bond with anyone growing up, I’m not trying to make excuses but maybe that played a part? Is being callous a result of that?
I had a big apology wrote out in advance and it was about how I felt about her and even I was shocked that I could come up with something that heartfelt and meaningful.
But at the end of the day I’m willing to recognise that it was my fault, And I guess I deserve it.

2678,TheHungryBard,1626183119,1,"I'm not sure if it's because I had to stop talking with my therapist or if I'm just going through another wave of feeling down but things are getting worse. Everyday I wake up alone, go to work, try to be nice and act as jolly as I can, come home and sit by myself. I'm so detached I have started to have dreams where I am friends with online personalities I've never met because they are the only people I've formed an attachment to. I'm more connected to video game characters than my own family. I've tried to play online games but I don't know how to talk to people or make friends.

 I used to go to a brewery every weekend and have a few pints. I knew the owners and all of the staff. I talked with them for hours and tried to be friendly with the other patrons. Now most of the staff I knew are gone and I am finding it harder to go out and talk to people. I always had social anxiety but I think it's become worse since the pandemic.

My cats are the only things that keep me company now. I love them with all of my being. But sometimes there are moments when I think to myself that they only care about the food I give them. The old man cat has started to crawl under my bed. I don't want to think that it's because he is getting close to his time to go but I know it is a possibility. I'm just worried the bed might collapse on him. The frame has already fallen apart once. He is also the one I have the strongest attachment to. He used to spend all day sitting in my lap or draped over my arm while we sat in my chair. He is a big boy and great to cuddle with. So having him spending his time hiding away makes me feel sad. I don't want to force him to sit with me, I'm just worried about his change in behavior.

It also seems like I am being constantly reminded that I've never had any sort of partner. There was one video where a woman treated the viewer as the subject of the video. She was saying how ""you"" are the reason that they left. How ""you"" didn't try hard enough and other things like that. I realized that she was describing how some people feel when things like that happen and I know it was about a breakup. But it reminded me about how badly I want to be with someone. Someone who I can support and who will support me. Someone who makes me feel content just by being in the same room as me. Someone who I deeply love. But I tell myself things like that all the time. I'm not good enough, it's my fault no one wants to be with me, I don't deserve to be in a relationship.

Well I've about run out of steam. If you took the time to read all of this then thank you. You and I both know you didn't have to. I hope you are able to go about your day without to many issues. If you were here, and you wanted one, I'd hug you. Remember that everyone lives a life just as complex and full as your own and try to be kind.

I’m currently on summer break and for most of the time, I’m just staying at home and watching my grandpa. He’s diabetic and has other medical problems so I have to watch his health at all times. My mom is at work all day for most of the time so I’m the one responsible to take care of him. I’m an only child with mo other extended family living near me so I’m the only person that has to help my grandpa.

I have to take his blood sugar, give him insulin, watch his diet, etc.etc. In addition, I have errands to do and cleaning while my mom is gone. And people are so proud of me because I am able to do those things around my age. And that’s where I get so fed up.

Like do they even realize that now I’m staying home watching him for MOST of the time? Do they even know that I’m just getting isolated from my friends even more?

I have only 1-2 friends that I talk to and I always have to be the initiator. And I’m so introverted and quiet myself that I get so drained from doing it

Do they know that I can’t even find a job to support my family and myself?

The list just goes on. 

When people admire me for that, I just want to shut their mouths for that. Unfortunately I’ll just come off as selfish and saying thank you is the only good and right answer

2684,Waiting-For-October,1626177597,1,"I was excited to meet my fiance’s friends girlfriends on July 4th BBQ but they ignored me and clearly didn’t want me there. My fiance treats me like a piggy bank and snaps at me all the time. He is all I have. My fb has pictures of us together smiling because I have no one else. I have been treated badly and been depressed my whole life. I had friends here and there throughout the years but not anymore. 

What really cemented my situation was a nude pic of me taken when i was 20 was stolen from me and has been posted online with my first and last name and sent to all my friends coworkers and family by someone unknown to me over and over since 2008. It happens over and over and now 13 years later I am totally isolated because of it. So many times I would start getting to know a coworker only for them to tell me a fake profile sent them my nude. How embarrassing to suddenly know this person saw me naked. So many times acquaintances would call or show up at my work or house and say I need to tell you something and tell me someone sent them my pic. This happened so many times that at this point everyone i went to school with or worked with or dated has seen my pic.

It isn’t very flattering either, I look trashy laying on the couch topless and it was never meant for anyone to see. Nobody respects me and no one talks to me. No one cares that I say the pic was stolen, they just see me as trashy. It is just sad that a pic taken in 2008 on an old digital camera has controlled my life. 13 years later i still deal with it. I do not know who stole it or who constantly posts it. It is not an ex I know, just a troll of some kind who has taunted me for years. Maybe i knew them personally at one point and maybe not, I dont know. I have gone to cops, hired a private detective, everything. All for nothing, because no one advocates for me.

The sad truth is, no one cares and just blames me and disrespects me. How awful it was to sit with cops while they looked at my picture and told me with disgust to color my hair and change my name if I cared so much. Today I no longer can accept friend requests from coworkers or befriend even my fiancé’s sister because sooner or later someone will send them my pic.  

After being judged and disrespected by absolutely everyone who knows about the pic, I am discouraged to even make friends because I know from experience that if they knew about the pic, they wouldn’t like me anymore. I kind of lost faith in human kindness when I have been treated like trash for taking a topless pic of myself 13 years ago that I never meant for anyone to see. Plus, someone out there has gone out of their way to keep posting and sending the pic around just to hurt me. Did I mention they went on my grandmothers public online obituary and uploaded the pic of me? How can someone be so cruel to me? 

I have no friends and I am 33 years old and in the city I was born in. I am isolated and lonely. I am scared to even try. I live alone because my fiance ditched me to spend the summer with his friends growing pot. I work from home. I have no friends.

I’ve had so many mental Heath diagnosis from MDD, to BPD, PTSD, OCD, GAD,  Bipolar II. I see a counselor and I’m on psych meds.  The meds are a band aide, but they don’t fix the issue.  They don’t fix the “broken” part inside of me.

The last year he has drastically changed his habits and doesn’t watch porn (I think…).  The other day I found boner pills which is something he commonly used when he was addicted to porn. He said the pills were for his ED due to a severe tooth infection (2 months ago), but I don’t buy it. I mean, his dentist did say the infection could cause heart problems, but idk. Anyway he had his tooth pulled and his ED went away (went away because of the pills or because of the tooth surgery… we will never know). Anyway… so he works out of town and I just can’t bare it any longer.

It affects my trust, triggers insecurities, and I cry every night. It feels like my heart is being ripped out, by how lonely and depressed I feel. The thing is, is that when I pretend I’m single, focus on me and the kids and don’t talk to him, I start to feel better.  Like the only way I can cope is by pretending he doesn’t exist.

At home, I'm stressing over quite a bit as well.  I'm seeing a shrink in a few days.  I have a neighbor that I have problems with.  She doesn't have a job or anything going on in her life, but she thinks I like her.  Her brothers/cousins always stir the pot and my potential mental disorder isn't helping either.  It's like they piss me off for their entertainment.  I have no friends to hang out with on the weekend.  It's mainly because the friends I have want to spend money (casino, adult arcades, etc.).  The only thing I do is drive around aimlessly.  I'm starting to gain a lot of weight due to depression.  I feel trapped.  My car is my only escape from this place and I just got it repaired due to an accident.  I was in an area that I wasn't supposed to be in.

At times, I want to have a girlfriend.  The problem is that the town I live in doesn't have women that has anything going for them.  They all want to become a CNA, RN, or receptionist.  I want someone who makes as much as me, has a respectable job that not everyone works, and that's fun to be around.  Of course, I can go outside and find someone but where?  I'm socially awkward, I'm kinda ugly, and getting chubby.  It sucks.  I wish that I can look back at this post in the future where my life possibly gets better and say, ""Lol, what a loser.""",lonely,I hate my life again,2021-07-13 10:21:35

2753,Mercymagic100,1626135181,1,"Pain is no happiness. Pain knows only fear. Pain can control every aspect of our life for years and years. Pain comes in a package. And usually with heartbreak. We try to sleep and sleep but it never seems to go away. Pain can have us followed. As it’s always partnered with fear. And fear taunts us…makes us afraid until our hearts are even filled with tears. A man may fear to ever love again. As well as a woman too. Their hearts may have been shattered and mistreated….even abused too. It’s ok to be afraid to love again. As the heart says it’s afraid. But every mite of pain we touch can keep us in our darkest days. It all may seem scary right now. But I promise you there is another side. If you could just get past seeing these clouds…you will finally see the light. Heartbreak has come but true love in the end has the win. Remember that heartbreak does not last…but love goes on forever. Through time and time again. Romance may seem pointless now to those who hearts have been too misused. But if you want to finally be happy? You must stop believing in every negative thing too. Being the one that chooses to sit in the darkness will make you sad. You will only waste away your life and feel so much worse by choosing to believe in all that’s bad. My heart has been through a River of tears. A pain that no one can tell. But even so I still believe in the real love that I will receive well. Not all men are the same. And neither are all women too. Our hearts can love no matter what. And we can protect them too. We should never give up believing in a love that is very real no matter what. But the pain discourages overtime…and leaves us with a bitter cup. If all the arrows are always against me. The arrows of the pain I’ve suffered. No matter what I will encourage true love. The heart of this woman is not Afraid to love another. The heart needs healing and time once it’s been afraid. But please don’t ever be scared to love again. True love can never darken your days. I want you to be brave. I want you to be strong and to believe in the Real love that’s true😊💕. And know that no matter how deep your fear, your days of darkness are already through. Just believe 💕

2756,cretinousgeorge,1626133760,1,"I hate feeling this. I spend too much time fantasizing about the different maybes and it's not helping. I just get caught up so easily thinking how different and how nice some things might have been if things were different. I know that if I was honest about how I feel to the people in question now I'd seem weird for holding onto these feelings for so long but that's just how I am, I find it very difficult to move on when there is even a little ambiguity or uncertainty left.

Daydreaming or fantasizing about this just gives me a short moment to just try to imagine what it would feel like if things just worked out or went well but then there will be some reminder that would ground me back to reality, the reality where such things won't happen.

I'm scared that if such an opportunity were to arise that I'd be too scared or mess up quickly. I don't have the highest of self esteems and I often don't know what to feel when something happens.

I've heard things to the effect of ""don't worry, it'll get better"" or ""you have to move on/distract yourself"" several times and not once has it been proven.

I hate these unconditional and unrequited feelings, I hate trying to distract myself every day and night, I hate having these negative things happening in my life. I know not everyone thinks I deserve better and I can understand why.

i hope i wont mess this up somehow hehe. Im an 18 years old, (well... in a month 18 👀) guy from Germany and unfortunately im very lonely. I thought that this subreddit could be perfect to look for other people like me. ^o^    Due to the fact that im from Germany, it would be preferable if you are European, so that we dont have no huge differences in time zones. 😅 Also, its a lot more common for me to be friends with females, because i simply cant get comfy with a guy when talking about deep topics and stuff like that. Please note that id like to keep things SFW. 😊

A little about me: I love history and i spend a lot of time with it. I just love to learn more and more details i didnt even know about some historical event or period 😍 Also i enjoy traveling a lot. Especially now when i turn 18 im looking forward to go to many places to see how the people live there and do a lot of sightseeing. Especially historical sights of course 🤭. Also im interested in gaming since i was a little kid, i was even lucky enough to get an ps5 from the first drop. If youre also on PS im sure we can play something together ^o^  A good series or book is also on my to do list when i aint doing something else.

2765,BringBackTheOffice,1626127285,1,"I turned 22 years old back in January. When we're going to college (or just grow through the years, for those who don't go to school), when we're in the late teens through our 20s, we're expected to ""get out there"" and have fun. Date. Have sex. Find someone who accepts the real ""you"" and the personality that goes along with it. But for me, and many of you as well, it's complete bullshit.

I'm a very lonely person in real life. I don't really talk to people. I never feel welcome by others. These sentences are vague, so I'll be more clear since we sometimes say things without providing examples. I work at a job where there's constant gossip. There's friendships between some of the guys and girls. Obviously not including me. I am jealous of the guys; the girls talk to them and they look better than me (yes looks determine how you are liked). These guys gossip behind their backs about sexual details, and still they have friends because they're ""outgoing"" and social. They brag about everything and become conceited about it. Yet it's ""attractive"". Meanwhile I am never spoken to, but I'm aware that I've been made fun of for how I look or how quiet I am. Why the fuck is it that I need to act like some piece of crap to fit in?

I've had 1 (semi-) sexual experience to date, which is what I've mainly been gossiped about. Even before this, when I say hi or even say a sentence to people, it's met with hesitance and awkwardness. I've asked people (guys only because an unattractive guy talking to a girl = creep) for snapchats but I never get messaged back. Yet people say ""confidence"" is the answer, that I need to approach people and talk. Clearly it doesn't work that way.

Talking to girls is an even bigger challenge. I notice the way that people approach each other, whether it's at work or just regular interactions wherever I go. I have never been approached in a manner that makes me feel accepted for who I am. I'm very scared of sex, and I know I've been made fun of how I look. I'm really sensitive and I always try my best not to show it. It's hard looking at these taller, better looking people with people that ""care"" about them. Even though it's superficial attention, I wish I experienced it.

Being quiet is who I am, and I refuse to act like crap to be more likable. As though it would work anyways because I'm not conventionally attractive. I'm currently dieting and plan to go to the gym to work out soon as I hope that dropping the extra weight and building muscle will lead to girls liking me and people in general wanting to be my friend without any feeling of embarrassment.

Anyone have any answers or want to elaborate and somehow prove my thoughts wrong? Please prove me wrong. I don't want to be a 23 year old, a year older with an increasing lack of interaction in life.",lonely,Pretty long but I really want to vent. Sorry but it's emotional,2021-07-13 08:01:25

2785,loner_n,1626114340,1,"There is this story that I read when I was young. The story goes like this,

&amp;#x200B;

A man had a dog and a donkey. His donkey used to help him move his cart and everything for his business. The donkey loved the man very much and helped him with anything. The donkey was tied up by the man outside his home in a place made for the doneky. And his dog was his pet who loved him very much and he also love the dog very much. The dog spends all his time inside the home with him.

&amp;#x200B;

This donkey kept on watching how the dog would jump over the man and lick himwhen he goes home after work. The man would give his love back to the dog. This donkey longed so much for the man’s love but the man would always tie the donkey up and go home to his dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day the man forgets to tie the donkey. The donkey sees this as an opputunity to seek the man’s love. The donkey runs inside the home and jumps on the man and licks him and shows how much he love him and would do anything for him. The man get furious and iritated by the donkey. He could not the stand the smell of the donkey inside his home. He takes a big stick and hits the donkey and ties him up in a place, more distant than the last one. The donkey did not even have a shelter there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of the story: no matter how much someone means to you if they see as a donkey and not as a dog, they wont let you in. They will always put you in your place.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to be the dog to some people but I always ended up being the donkey. I was hurting to be pit in my place. But atleast now I realise that I am a donkey and stop trying to be the dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats forever alone I guess. No one will ever accept me for who I am. Instead of trying to copy the dog I decide to run away from everything and everyone and live in peace.

She's the pretty, popular type and she has too many friends for me to count while I have maybe three or four (including our mutuals). It's never really bothered me because I was her best friend and we spend most of our days together, back when we were in schòol we sat next to each other, went home together and when we got home, we'd call each other into the night and do our homework together. Her friends were just... her friends, I knew of them, some knew me, we were all casual with each other if we ever did meet and even as she found a new ""going out together"" friend when I couldn't which became her close friend and replaced me for a bit, it didn't bother me that much because we still texted and called a lot and she kept me updated with her life and stuff.

But ever since she got her boyfriend a year ago, it feels like she's just disinterested in me. I gave it awhile because I assumed it was a new relationship and new relationships were always like that at the start but it's been a year and it feels like we're really distant? I know she calls her boyfriend every night, something we did before, and that's fine because they're in a relationship but while we used to text a lot, it's been watered down to two to five texts a day, unless she has issues she wants to rant about. She used to tell me funny stuff or stuff in general that happened throughout her day but now when I text first, she just replies with text on laughter and that's it. I know she's probably not doing this deliberately but I really miss it back when it was us who were close.

Her boyfriend is OK, I don't hate him but I miss spending time with her and texting shitpost worthy stuff with her and it kinda feels like he's sapping everything away. It's their relationship, so whatever but it just sucks sometimes.

2794,17rainbows,1626110320,1,"Preface: I’m 28, I don’t have friends I hang out with, I never have plans, I’m always at home. The last time I hung out with someone outside of my family was probably like 2 years ago. And no, that’s not because of the pandemic.

My old coworker/friend moved about 2 hours away, and I haven’t seen her in about 9 months. We keep up on social media mostly. She texted me a little over a week ago about going to her favorite bakery together, and I was so excited! I texted her last night about where she wanted to meet up in the morning and if she wanted to come to my house first to see my pets. And...she canceled.

She said it was because she was waiting on a check and couldn’t afford the gas for a 2 hour drive, and I felt really bad. I would’ve offered to pay, but I know she wouldn’t go for that, so I told her it was no problem. She said we can go another time and even invited me to come with her to hang out with the rest of our old coworkers sometime soon. All good.

But then I found out that she already made the 2 hour drive last night. She’s staying with another coworker about 20 minutes away from me. 

And the worst part is, I knew it was gonna happen. Everyone always cancels on me, even my family members. It always ends with me texting them about how excited I am, and then they tell me they can’t go. I’ve even had times where we’ve made plans to go to concerts, I paid for the tickets, I’ll pick them up and drive there, all they have to do is enjoy, and they cancel the day before. And then I go alone. And if I can’t sell their ticket with so little notice, then that’s wasted too. 

I just don’t know why I bother anymore. I get my hopes up that people like me and want to hang out with me, and it’s never true. Something better comes along, someone fun comes along. I know I’m boring, I’m not exciting, I don’t have fun stories because I don’t go anywhere and do anything. But like, don’t make plans with me then. And if you decide to cancel, don’t lie to me about money problems. 

I would’ve paid your gas both ways, paid for whatever you wanted at the bakery, paid for lunch. I’ve done all that before with friends in college: driven them around for free, paid for everything. Paid for friendship. Because even if I know in my heart that you’re using me, I can still convince myself that I have friends. I can tell people that I have plans hanging out with my friends, and it makes me feel less like a loser. Fuck, even my grandma was trying to give me money to pay for both of our stuff at the bakery because she was so happy that I actually had a friend to hang out with. 

And despite all this, if she wants to make plans with me again, I’ll accept. Because I’m desperate for friendship. I’ve been lonely for over 15 years, and honestly, I’ll take what I can get.",lonely,Canceling plans...and lying about it,2021-07-13 03:18:40

Just another night of thoughts consuming my mind; of unnecessary worries, thoughts, hopes for a better day, despair from the past; a chaotic mess of thoughts really.

I try to console myself; telling myself that there’s others out there who thinks the same, who feels the same, who may be in the exact same situation.

Perhaps I was the one that dug my own grave, being too shy and introvert to have a heart to heart talk with others? Heck, I can’t even remember the last time I talked about relationships/serious conversation about life with anyone at all.

Relationships with others is such as beautiful curse; it can be as bright as a sunny day, yet dark, sharp and a weighted poison that consumes the mind for worse when negativity creeps in. The future seems so fun, bright, optimistic and happy. But at the same time, it’s scary, sinister, unforgiving. There’s only one chance, one route that can be made when playing the game of life. And, mistakes are surely to be hard. It’s always easier to say “I’ll learn from my mistakes so the same thing won’t happen again in the future” than to actually apply it; the weight of emotional baggage dragging behind my back gets heavier and heavier as life chugs along.

I also try and avoid people who are only looking for something casual since I am looking for something long-term.

Almost everyone I’ve gone on a first date with has not wanted to go on a second date or has straight-up said they wanted to be friends but not more. In some of these cases we kissed, so lacking physical attraction did not seem to be the main reason for these guys.

Wondering what it is that I exude that puts people off. Yeah, it’s complex, but I’m asking myself what might have been wrong on my side because the people rejecting me were all very different. I also felt like they were way more excited on Tinder than after having actually met me. My photos are all recent and realistic, with no filters or makeup or anything like that. I shower and brush my teeth and think I smell ok, so I don’t think it’s bad hygiene either.

I’m 29 and have only been in one short relationship in my life. I was willing to go on second dates with a handful of these people, even if I didn’t know (how could I, at that point) where exactly things would lead. So I don’t think I’m particularly picky. But I’m clearly doing something wrong.

I’m also not going to go back to these people whining and ask them what they didn’t like or what was missing. That seems desperate, and if I think of whenever I want to be ‘just friends’ with a person, it’s just due to a (perceived) fundamental incompatibility or lack of attraction, sometimes both, but not in a way that I could tell them this in a polite and constructive way.

I (27m) am feeling conflicted and lonely. I am in alot of ways a person of solitude. I don't push people away, but I do not go out of my way to make new relationships. I have had a couple long term relationships, and a small group of best friends that I can count on no matter the situation. Recently my two best friends have found the love of their lives and started moving forward. I have not and its honestly what I've dreamed of since I was young. But everytime I think I find someone who has that small spark of electricity, they quickly leave. And this is by no means a poor me post but I guess in some way it is... maybe I'm trying to express that I feel sorry for myself and don't want others to feel sorry for me. 
My whole love life has always been the same story and it's frustrating. I consistently feel the ""I love you so much that it is almost enough."" With all romantic partners.

Maybe I'm too picky or possibly I'm meeting these people at the improper times in our lives... but for once I would love to find that partner who sticks with me in the tough times and allows me to do the same. Because in the end it's not the lack of intimacy of the silence I come home to daily... its the feeling of no matter how hard life gets or what challenges I go through, I'm completely alone while I face them head on. 

But in the end this could be me just wishing for something I'm not ready for. I could be just wanting to jump ahead in the story... I also could be someone who won't find this exact love. I'm happy with who I am and successful in many ways, but I do live a life of life of solitude and to quote Edgar Allen Poe ""I crave solitude but fear loneliness.""

I like catching up with them from time to time even if it takes them a long time to respond. Back then I used to have this thought of 'if I don't reach out to them, we won't talk to one another."" I resolved this by being the one to initiate the conversations despite being an introvert. At first, the people I reached out to responded to me and I even told them what I felt, that I felt lonely and felt as if I was just the only reaching out to people and thinking of talking to them. Most of them understood me and said they'd try their best to reach back every once in a while... but the thing is, they never did. They'd go for days, weeks without talking to me and I would think that why aren't they reaching out as they said. I understand that they might be busy but most of them that said they'd reach out haven't even did even once in months. That's why these days, despite still trying my best to reach out to some of them, I'm starting to feel like I should just go on my own and be a loner and mind my own business without thinking of them. Just try to distract myself with games and watching things I like. I think of  them from time to time, wondering how they're doing and thinking of messaging them, but I tend to think twice as most of them don't even reply or it takes them days to reply.",lonely,trying my best to stay connected with people but...,2021-07-12 19:43:36

Music is a h u g e part of my life as well, i’m into most genres especially indie/alt rock, lofi and folk. making playlists for each other would be soso nice as well! here’s my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/joekenward66?si=Uk3Sd9-aQSuUMhdk1rud8Q&amp;dl_branch=1

i also love nature and spending time outside, especially walking my doggo (if you have one your legally obliged to send me pics heheheh). i’m also super interested in art even tho i don’t do much myself, but id really like to get into doing some digital stuff.

I'm 20 years old and I got laid off from work about a month ago. At first I thought it'd be a positive thing. I figured I would have time to pursue hobbies, be with friends and family, and enjoy some time off until I found another job. But instead, I've fallen into a deep depression. My friends have left me behind for various reasons, my mom and I are struggling to pay bills, and my car has broken down, so I haven't even been able to leave the house. I've put in so many applications at so many different places and haven't heard a single thing back. It's getting to the point where I'm dissociating constantly and distancing myself from the few friends I still talk to. I don't even know why I'm doing it, I genuinely don't want to, but every conversation leaves me feeling so drained and exhausted that it's just easier not to talk to anybody. My mom keeps up a smile and tells me we will get through it together, but I can tell it's weighing on her too. I feel so horrible and guilty that I'm not helping with bills and I'm trying everything I can to get back to a place where I'm able to, but nothing is working.

2864,lindsayleonaa,1626068227,1,", female, I graduated high school just over a week ago. 
i’m very shy and keep to myself most of the time. It wasn’t always this way, I had lots of friends growing up. 

But then I dated a boy for 2 years from grade 9-11 and that was a big mistake. he was quite controlling and didn’t like me hanging out with friends and he didn’t have many friends himself. people knew both of us but we only really hung out with each other.

A day before our 2 year anniversary, he broke up with me in school because he met some guys who basically told him he had to break up with me to be friends with them. I know, childish. I’m over that now but, I had lost all my friends while in the relationship so I was left with nobody. I made a couple friends after a few months but they didn’t last long. I believe I was depressed when covid was big, and me and the friends I had just lost touch and we don’t really talk anymore. 

i’m in a new relationship now, almost 1 year, and i’m very happy. He has a lot of friends but he spends almost every day with me. he is my actual only friend. people always say “well you must have at least one other” 

no. I don’t. 

I’ve noticed whenever he does hang out with his friends, I get extremely sad. and almost jealous that he can do fun things with people and I just sit at home alone. I know it’s my fault because I never put in much effort to keep the friendships I had. but now high school is over and I don’t know how to make friends now. 

I feel so alone when i’m not with my boyfriend, I barely use social media because I don’t know anybody on there, and I make my boyfriend feel bad for having fun with his friends and I don’t wanna do that to him. 

Any advice on how I could make some friends and why I feel the need to push away everyone that comes close to being a friend? I should also mention i’m taking a year off to work before going to university 

TL;DR: I haven’t had solid friends since the beginning of high school, right now my one and only friend is my boyfriend of one year. i’m very shy and kept to myself so I don’t know how to make friends now that i’m graduated.

2871,Kingsin_uuu,1626066332,1,"I have no idea where to start. It’s been a hell of a ride with my mental health and now I’m at the biggest crossroads of my life .
For starters I met my last girlfriend at the worst point of my life. She reminded me what happiness could be. In a world where I surrounded myself with walls, cut off relationships with friends, lied because I was scared of people being close, and a general numbness to everything and everyone around me, she got through. My god how great it was for my biggest worry to be when I was going to see her. 
After we broke up I got worse, luckily it was only a year of numbness and another year of drinking to get over my feelings for her. Someone I was only with for a month.
 In the end I realized I never loved her I was just so in love with the idea that maybe I could be the same as everyone else without all the purpose I put behind what my life is supposed to be. I got through my trust issues and at the young age of 18 I decided to stop drinking. Not because I had a problem but to avoid one I went five months sober and was healthy again. It was a long road of letters I never sent, old wounds I had to experience again to let heal, and demons I had to forgive. Now I’m back home ready to be with someone but I swipe and match and can’t get myself past let’s meet up. I’ve ghosted people and backed out of relationships that might have meant something. I don’t know why. I keep hoping maybe the right person approaches me in life but she’s never around. The girl In my dreams isn’t there when I wake up and no ones around for me to dedicate what I have in my heart to. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it’s gods plan, maybe it’s this self pity and stupid obsession with not thinking I deserve to be someone’s source of happiness. 

Anyways I can at least tell people my real name and my birthdate now without being scared of getting hurt.

I’ll drink to that

I would describe this feeling as a combination of awe, melancholy, calmness and peacefulness. I'm not the best at describing it- but I believe you already understand what I mean. This feeling is only peculiar to these nights and I guess I wanted to talk about it.

I feel lonely almost all the time- On these nights though, I either notice it less or it simply doesn't bother me. These are perhaps my favorite times of life, the peacefulness I feel is something I wish was with me all the time.  

Sometimes, I wish I could just observe the world. I don't want to have to worry about life. I just want to see the trees blowing in the wind and the sun setting. Why can't everything just be peaceful? ""I can't wait to grow up"" I used to tell myself.. ""I want to be young again"" I now tell myself.. Oh how things change.. I guess everything changes.  

Do you ever just reach a point in your sadness, where you feel at peace? like nothing can hurt you more than you’ve already felt, it can’t get worse, so it has to get better, right?

I was barely able to afford college with a great scholarship, part time jobs and a bit of support from my parents. For a while I was interested in grad school but decided it wasn't worth the financial burden and time commitment.

And now that I've finally entered the workforce... I wonder what I've been working towards all this time.

I just feel like life comes so easily for some people. Making friends and forming relationships seems like a piece of cake for them. My problem is likely that I don’t put myself out there. I go to work and keep to myself with my hobbies when I’m home. I’m extremely insecure.I honestly can’t imagine someone wanting to date me. I think I’m ugly and don’t know why a guy would be attracted to me. I don’t know how to feel worthy enough to even muster the courage to form a dating profile online. I have bad body dysmorphia and hate my looks. Think I’m fat even though I’m told I’m not. I hate my face.

2895,johsygomez,1626055926,1,"So, I am a gay male (23) and have a great husband (25). We do pretty much everything together, and it’s amazing.
The issue, though, is that I have no one outside of him. When we first moved in together, I moved to his area. As I result I left behind friends, family, and all other things I was familiar with. Whenever anything exciting is done in my life it is alongside my husband. If it isn’t just the two of us, then one of his friends is along for the ride. I like his friends, and I get the impression that they like me too, but if my husband isn’t around then we just don’t click. So really his friends aren’t really my friends if he isn’t around. Even when I try texting them to try and get to know them they just don’t make an effort to respond or click with me. 
When we aren’t doing anything, my husband texts his friends and seems to have fun. Over the years the distance has made it hard for all my old friends to stay in contact. I talk to them occasionally, but nothing ever lasts more than just a few minutes. But I can tell the distance has put a big disconnect between my old friends and me.
There have been multiple times when my husband will go out to hang out with his friends. I can tell that the intention was most likely for it to be just him and his friends, but he’s way too sweet and caring to leave me left out and always takes me along. All those times always ends up with him and his friends reminiscing and having fun while I just play on my phone in the background.
I’ve tried making new friends, but I just can’t find any way to find new friends. I’ve tried some apps and websites, but they all end up just connecting me with people whose ultimate goal is something sexual. At work I am by far the youngest person. Every single one of my coworkers has mentioned that they “have a kid my age”. The few times I’ve attempted to have a friendship with them outside of work they have just laughed and brushed it off as if I was simply joking.

I love my husband and the life we have grown together, but I can’t even talk to him about this. I’m afraid it will either sound like I don’t like his friends, or like I don’t think he’s enough.

2912,realhacker6993,1626047980,1,"You know what kind of movies and shows I'm talking about. Stand By Me, Stranger Things, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Breakfast Club, etc. Plots about a group of close friends getting into hijinks together with a romantic subplot where one or many of them like the same girl (or guy). I know life doesn't play out like a movie but the essence of these films: the friendship, the heartbreak, the bonding, the etc, I never had that.

The closest thing I've ever had to real friends was in elementary school but that's it. From middle school all the way to now, a college graduate, I was alone. I wasn't bullied really at all, thankfully, but I never had friends of any kind and just kept to myself. And it was all for really one main reason, if I had to give one: I was afraid. All the time I was afraid, and still am really at my core. I never really asked anyone to be my friend or if I could hang out with others. I would go in to school every day, sit in class, sit alone at lunch, then go home and do it all again the next day. The internet was my world that occupied my boring life and still does.

Of course this also meant I failed at something else: girls. I've yet to even kiss a girl. Big accomplishment, I know /s. Again, I was always too afraid to even ask out anyone. The only time I ever really mustered up the courage was around prom when I asked one of the prettiest girls in my class and of course she rejected me (gently though, thankfully).

College wasn't much better either. Sure I had my independence away from my parents. But what really did me in was laziness. I hated a lot of my classes and skipped regularly, which resulted in declining grades. Somehow though I got my degree five years later (switched my major too late) and here I am telling you my pity party story.

Go ahead and make fun all you want. I stopped caring about life a long time ago. And now I'm also mourning the loss of a close family member, my uncle, on top of everything else in my life. But going all the way back to the beginning, when I watch these shows and movies, the thing I'm constantly reminding myself of involuntarily is ""I never had that"" and continuously put myself down like always. I don't plan on ending myself anytime soon. But the weight of my laundry list of regrets is a heavy load I still carry with me every single day.

Half a year ago i had no experiences with woman and felt constantly lonely and sometimes very depressed. Then i met a girl whilst drinking and we got together... for 3 months, my first real kiss and my first relationship if you want to call it that way.

Then after a while i started going more to parties, (or more like meeting people in the park and excessively drink with them) and i talked to girls, kissed again with a other girl and made out with her (first time)

Sometime later, the other day i met a girl at a friends birthday party, i saw the last time a year ago but already liked her back then, talked with her, then we kissed and ended up at hers (literally first time).

What i want to say is i always thought this first times somehow where going to change everything and yes i dont feel this much unwanted anymore, the feeling of beeing not enough for anyone isnt this strong anymore, but i still feel very lonely all the time, with my friends and family dont beeing a real help.

I start to believe, it has nothing to do with the circumstances around me, its an inner unrest and can only be treated by a therapist or something, think im going to search for one after years of knowing i should visit one.

2923,InterferenceRed,1626043808,1,"I’m 30 and soon to be a full time student again. Currently unemployed and just waiting for the semester to start. All I really do lately is sleep. When I’m awake I just feel so much emotional pain. I have friends but they all have their own careers, families, partners etc. I feel kind of alienated by them. They care about me but at the end of the day, they have their own lives and I don’t feel like I should bother them with my problems. But even having friends doesn’t stop the pain. Because what I truly want is a romantic partner. Someone that I can love and nourish and be nourished by. I often feel starved for physical affection. I’m queer and the place I’ll be living at for the next 3-4 years isn’t the best for dating. Most people are only interested in hookups and honestly a lot of people here just aren’t interesting. The problem I have is that I’m actually sort of seeing someone, but he’s in a poly relationship and it gets complicated. I barely see or hear from him, and a lot of times I feel he isn’t as serious about me. So all I do now is spend lots of time alone and sleep for many hours during the day. I feel like I sleep to avoid the pain and emptiness of being alone, but to also make time pass by faster. If I sleep for a few hours , maybe I’ll wake up to a text from him. But I rarely do. If I’m lucky I’ll get 1-2 texts a week and see him one day a week. That’s if im lucky. Most of the time he’s been busy so it hasn’t been uncommon to not see him for 2 weeks. It hurts because I’ve developed really strong feelings for him and I can’t even tell him for fear of driving him away. The other issue is that he’ll likely move 3 hours away in a year or so. So our time is already limited. I think about what my life will be like after he leaves and it seems so miserable. He’s the only person I’ve really felt something for in the past few years.

2931,InterestingVanilla6,1626040262,1,"I already apologize for the long and (somewhat) disorganized rant I'm going to be making.

So, hi everyone, I hope you're doing good.  
Honesly, I haven't been in a good mood for the most part of the last.. well, almost 3 years actually, when my last (Now ex) girlfriend broke up with me. I'm going to explain it later, don't worry.  
So, as I suggested in the title, I'm very petite for a white guy, for any guy actually, but still.   
I'm just 157cm (5'2"") x 47 kg (103.6 lbs) and, even though I'm not underweight, I look skinnier than I actually am.  
Unfortunately, I live in Europe, so the difference between me and the average guy is quite significant.

Before going on, just to be absolutely clear, I'm honestly okay with the way I look, it's other people who have a problem with it.  
Also, it's naive to think that ""Self-Confidence"", or whatever, would change a thing about how people perceive my size.

As you might have guessed, my love life has been incredibly shitty.  
I can't recall a single rejection that hasn't been because of my height, be it IRL (before covid, don't worry) or Online.   
In fact, I've even had girls that I wasn't interested in, going out their way just to tell me, here I quote: ""I wouldn't want to date you, you're too much of a midget for me"" or ""I find short guys disgusting"" or something along those lines.   
Hell, even one of my grandma's friend called me aside just to ask me, here I quote again: ""You are going to grow, right? Surely you're not ending up as a little dwarf like your father, right?"".  By the way, me and my father are the same height.

Despite all the humilation, bullying and ""friends"" I've had to cut out of my life, I managed to find 2 girlfriends in my life and surprise surpise, neither of them loved me.  
The first one was pretty open about it since every once in a while would say shit like ""I wish you were taller"". She ended up cheating on me. Also, she never wanted go past kissing with me.  
Yes, I know, I should've dumped her way before that but I was desperate at the time  
The second (and last girlfriend) was ok at first but after a while, it was clear she wasn't that much into me. I honestly don't know if it was because of my height or not, she didn't want to tell me why she broke up with me, even after 1.5 years of being together.  
Though, I believe that her friends (Particularly her best friend, who didn't like me because of my stature) had something to do with it. Still, even after 1.5 years, she also never wanted to have sex with me.  
I would like to clarify that: No, I'm not asexual and no, I don't want a relationship SOLELY for sex.

Honestly, this is so incredibly demotivating.  
I don't know what to do, I feel helpless and hopeless.   
It Doesn't matter what I do or what I can offer in a relationship, my height (Ironically) is too big of an issue.  
The cherry on top is that I'm also introverted and childfree, like my dating pool wasn't small enough.

2937,Otabao,1626037288,1,"7 weeks ago me (29M) and my ex (25F) broke up after 4 years together because she was interested in another guy.

We didn't have the best relationship, she was kind of abusive in an emotional/verbal way and there were probably more bad than good times over the 4 years. But one thing we did have going is that we spent A LOT of time together. We did mostly everything together, so being apart now after 4 years joined at the hip with someone just feels...unbearable?

I'm living with my family currently, I have 2 siblings and a dad and as much as I love them as family my siblings are around my age and have their own lives so we don't exactly hang out all the time. My dad and I don't really get along socially, we argue too much so we tend to avoid each other.

I have friends, a handful of long term friends I've known for about 10-15 years. We do talk often and we try to hang out as much as possible (usually once or twice a month). But similar to my siblings they're all around my age and they have lives, jobs, partners, families, so no one is ever really free on a moment's notice to just ""hang out"", it's always got to be something planned in advance, like some kind of event.

I don't begrudge these people for not being there exactly when I need them, I understand everyone is busy dealing with their own things. But in these past 7 weeks of loneliness my anxiety and depression and spiked hugely and I just feel so down and lethargic. Nothing is enjoyable to me. I go to work, I come home, eat, shower, maybe play some video games, and then go to sleep. Repeat.

When I have days off I always want to do something, anything, with anyone, but it's rarely possible. I've been trying to work on myself to feel happier but my motivation has declined as the weeks since the break up have gone by. I find myself just sitting here for extended periods of time, zoned out, just thinking about how bored and lonely I feel. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I obviously have issues with codependency because now that I'm alone I feel like everything is pointless and nothing is enjoyable without someone to share it with. 

I just feel sad and I miss affection of a person who loves me (whether my ex really did is debatable, but the illusion of love was enough at the time).

I've thought about dating and I constantly wish I had a partner again but I know that's not right. I'm definitely not ready for that, I don't want to be hurt again.

How do people cope with life really, how do people just get on with it everyday and feel happy?

I'm reliable in only what I'm able to do. I'm a yes man, within reason. If I physically can't do it, I won't, and I feel that that would be a majority of the relationship. I don't have the money right now to do alot of things for a girl. 

A girl on reddit told me, a girl will leave me if I dont buy her gifts and stuff. So I feel I have to work towards that.

2943,DoctorSpaghettiSauce,1626035240,1,"\- do a self diagnostic. if you have things you need to take care of in yourself- tell that person, and even if they are okay with it, don't try anything with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

dont try anything with anyone until you are 100% sure it can work. even when that person wants to help you, YOU are the one who has to solve the issues going on inside you. that person is so nice to you because they like you and want you to succeed- great, but that doesnt change the fact that YOU have shit you gotta iron out. 

if you just go make out and fuck her- or how about this scenario - what if you cant fuck her? what if the reality catches up to you and reminds you that you have no power as a man yet? well thats why you self diagnose. if you have a problem you need taken care of personally - inadequacy, job problem, family problem, stress, emotional trouble, YOU gotta fix all of that first.",lonely,if you find an amazing girl (or guy) take this advice.,2021-07-12 06:27:20

I feel better with myself, and I have gain so much confidence these last months so I'm stronger than ever. But with covid and the break up I had to get back to my hometown close to my family. My mother is bipolar and she is stable now but she is extremely possessive and she still has some changing behaviours that I didn't miss.
She used to make suicidal attempt all the time when I was young. My brother will go to jail soon and they are talking about that all the time and I'm just fed up with this fucking dysfunctional family. I had no choice to get back here from some time because of the breakup with my ex boyfriend who was a real manipulative person. I'm following a therapy and my therapist has said so many things that I didn't realize before. She changed my life. Since I was used to be ""controlled"" all my life, I thought it was ""normal"" so I let people putting me down. I believed every horrible things they said to me. And now, I can say that I'm finally myself, I like myself and I'm proud of who I am, and I become assertive. I won't let anyone putting me down anymore. I have a lot of desires, I'm a passionate, curious person. But I'm here in this small hometown, I have my own appartement, at least, but I'm fed up with being here, close to my family. And I don't want to go back to the city where I used to live for 6 years. I'm a bit bored, and I have always wanted to move to an another city, or country, and live my life, for so long...But they were telling me how much I will not be able to do that, I'm a weak person....
But in reality, I'm not, and I have forgotten myself too much for them. My therapist is really supportive about that. My friends are too, even if they are maybe a bit sad. If there was no pandemic, I will be already gone! I love to meet new people, discover new cultures. I'm feeling so strong and confident now. But sometimes I cry after I see my family. But what can I do? I'm so exhausted to wait and it's really lonely there. I have no problem with being alone, but I want to see new places, new faces, and live my life without these leeches.

I felt very lonely before the breakup and now I don't know how I feel. I guess I am still getting used to having my one confidant being gone. In the past, stuff like this would would feel emotionally excruciating due to my abandonment issues. Perhaps I feel somewhat ok since I have began to work on my abandonment issues and anger towards my biological and adoptive parents, so I don't project/transfer these things onto my now ex anymore? I definitely used to. I just let them leave and was strangely calm about it. I'm sure I'll get depressed pretty soon though, I might still just be in shock and somewhat dissociating. I feel like I should be angry too since the reason for them leaving me was literally pretty arbitrary (my parents getting a puppy), but I respect their trigger and boundary.

I have tried joining discord servers, going to events, using dating apps to make friends or find a partner but something just has never been there for me.

 I just wish I could know what it's like to naturally be able to take cues from other people and feel a sense of comfort and belonging often times I feel as though I am unwelcome even when people do not say anything to that effect. I never know what they are thinking about me if what I am saying is the right thing to say in that situation and so even when I do try to put myself in situations where the objective is to interact with other people I lack the drive to do so. Like for most conversations, I can have them if need be I know what I am supposed to say I just don't feel compelled to speak to people and yet I still long for their companionship. I regret not being able to go out to places with friends to experience the general sense of kinship that I see others engage in because of my admittedly idiosyncratic nature.",lonely,I don't understand how to join in,2021-07-12 02:28:45

I have another friendgroup aswell consists of 5 people including me but we only talk from time to time and its mostly about Anime, and a game which i dont play so i tend to sit out of these chats. 

Everytime they ask me to hangout i would refuse because i liked isolating myself and only accepted to come a few times when im bored, when im down one friend of mine (My Best friendo) somehow managed to put a smile on my face, his weirdness and humour is amusing and entertaining, but i feel like i kept throwing him away whenever we got into arguments (we always make up afterwards).

Now im entering my first year of high school and transferring to a different school, as much as it pains me to leave all my friends behind i have to because my mom wanted me to, at this point i havent talked to any of my friends for months and one day one of them asked us to go for a photo session, we all agreed. We met up at the photo studio and i was shocked that both of my male friends got taller than me while im still roughly the same. We had fun in the photo session, but i realised my everyone of my friends had changed, either through personality or looks. They talked to each other having fun playing genshin and etc while i just feel left out since i dont play any of those games. 

On my way home i just thought to myself how everyone around me is changing while im just staying the same as i am, i feel sort of left out. I feel like they have already forgotten about me moving on as life goes on. Now im moving to a new school and im affraid i wont be able to make new friends since its online classes.

Must be living a dream to have a friend like that.

It does not make sense, none of it make sense.. why are people so hard to fucking talk too? why do I feel like I'm less then everyone I talk too.. like every other conscious thing on this planet is better then me.. whenever I'm in public, on a bus, In a restaurant, or any other place with people.. I feel alien, Like I don't belong there.. like everything and everyone who's around me is judging me, glaring at me, uncomfortable around me.. like every step I make, every inhale and exhale I ever do around other people is wrong..

I'm pathetic, and the way things look rn, I'll always be pathetic.. everything I do is pathetic.

I just wish I wasn't so awkward :( I just don't get being social.. so many people my age make talking to people look as easy as breathing air, they never struggle and everything they say just rolls out with no hesitation, then when I try to talk to people I either say something stupid, weird.. awkward, or I just go quiet for a long time and only make things worse for myself.. I just wish I fuckin' understood how it works. I feel so stupid not being able to speak with people.. It should be so easy, and somehow I can't fucking do it. I can't keep a conversation going, I can't start a conversation for shit.. and its really starting to piss me off, It's gotten to the point where I try to avoid any social situation as much as I can in public.. online its different, but even there I cant speak, and It's made me feel like shit.. I feel like I'm missing so much out of my fucking life just because I'm an awkward, uninteresting person.. and I fucking hate it, and nobody I talk too really fucking gets it either, its always the same fucking ""OH! There's nothing to worry about! You just have to be yourself! you have nothing to worry about, you just need to talk with people and stop beating yourself up! being awkward is a normal thing for Everybody, there's no need to stress it"" which only makes me feel worse about myself, I don't know why I'm like this and why everything that comes out of my fucking mouth is the worst possible thing I could possibly say! like the entire world is going to fucking end after just saying ""hey, hows your day going?"".

Not necessarily anxious, just rarely feel like I can connect with people so I barely try unless they share direct hobbies with me. Small talk feels again, like a chore.

I haven't really tried dating in the last year or so. Casual sex on the blue moon but each time followed with emotional regret. I get interest from people but I never feel we have common ground to spark my interest, so I let it fizzle out. I haven't felt excitement for anyone in a long time. Sometimes it comes close, but never close enough for me to actually entertain the idea of a relationship. I do horribly miss a relationship I was in, although I don't want it with that ex specifically. But I can't find it with anyone else it seems. I pass up attractive potential partners because it feels like a waste of time if I can't even find a shred of emotional interest.

i think i’m going to be alone forever, too. i will always find something about another person that makes me cringe, and that soon grows into annoyance which grows into passive aggression. that and i get so bored easily.

Before the pandemic, I had a moderately sociable daily life. Because of the sort of work I do, my pool of new people to hangout with was constantly renewed every few months even if some of it was just for work. But, now it seems that virtuous cycle has been broken. I haven't been around anyone except close family and a few colleagues, even with things getting back to some semblance of normalcy. However, I'm still feeling starved for connection that is more than just the superficialities. It has actually began to affect me in many ways. I have a nagging, incessant restlessness in the last few months that I can't seem to shake; sometimes I drive aimlessly for hours in my city almost wishfully, hoping that someone would call or text to meet-up like earlier days. But of course, wishful thinking never makes things materialize.

I can't seen to muster the motivation to do the usual things I enjoy either, like writing music and recording (I'm a guitarist), reading ( I'm pretty voracious), writing, and other projects that keep me busy. I just pine for that kind of connection with somebody that has casual depth; that is to say, being able to fluidly shift between the banal, hum-drum things to even deeper topics, ideas, and feelings-- and back again. Well, without getting too neurotic, message me if you think this might be what you're seeking too! 

I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

Married, and divorced.  My brothers?  All have families, with children.  My father?  Living his own fear and grief.  My boyfriend?  Not quite ready or learned on how to deal with this.  For fucks sake, we’ve hardly been together two years.

So lost in this hell of a world we live in. Feels like the things I do for fun is beginning to fade as if their is no reward to it anymore. It becomes so hard for me to try new thing.

Ik that eating fruits and veggies is crucial to your well being but I can never pull myself to do it.

I confided in her my worries and we made a promise to support each other through the thick and thin. I could confidently say she was my only friend, really, the only one.

There was a phase where we’d wake up only to spend our first minutes awake chatting to one another, discussing personal issues and daydreaming about a better life than what’s been shown to us. Looking back, we were naive to think we could run from our problems.

But here’s the catch. She was on the other side of the planet. She felt like a world away and plans never did see the light of day.

Life got in the way, conversations grew plain and distant, silence filled the empty texts that were never sent or deleted. 

Then I finally got the hint.

She’s taught me a lot, like how fast life really hits you at times(like right now) to how harmful it really is to repress everything inside. We all need someone to let it out too, that’s just how we are.

3103,chuckfoe,1625957754,1,"Quick recap;

In my whole 22 years of leaving life, I had 3 meaningfuls durable relationships, one gal, 2 dudes, nothing romantical. And to be honest, they look closer to a 40yo office worker than a 22yo uni student. The oldest one is with the girl. Once upon a time, 5 years ago, we were close but since high school ended, if I can see her 2 times a year, I consider myself lucky. Second one is Little Guy, younger than me. We had some kind of senpai/kouhai brother relationship until we both met Big Guy who took my role. Then the third one is Big Guy, who I met 4 year ago and has been my roommate for 3 years until last month. Since then, I’ve heard of them once a week on D&amp;D night and will probably stay the same until the end of time. And for the last 4 year I haven’t met anyone meaningful except maybe my psy but since i’m paying me i say that it doesn't count.


That describes 90% of my meaningful social interaction. After reading this, most people must be thinking ‘’ wow that guy must be one hell of a hermit, probably living off social securities in his mother basement and trying to dodge any social interaction possible and you couldn't be further from the truth. I’m literally drowning in social interaction. Since I’ve had my first real job, I’ve only had ‘’social’’ jobs. I’ve been a beer advisor in a craft beer shop, taxi driver, hotel front desk agent and security guard. I've had over a hundred coworkers and multiple thousands of customers, multiple regular and yet, I've been able to go further than the daily chitchat. 


First time I've gotten aware of that situation I was like ""wtf is wrong with me, am I really that disgraceful that nobody will ever wanna be with me"" and so on. Then it was like ""Other humans are bad and they are worthless"" and so on. Finally I was like ""god or something as curse me"" quite ironic from a man of science like myself.


After many years of back and forth between those mindsets, I think I've maybe found a middle ground. I think I may have been shielding myself, protecting myself from potential bad interaction. I've always feared that someone will turn on me, use my moment of weakness against me. Tarnish my reputation for its own personal gain or entertainment.


So here I am, with this new found wisdom looking for a way to change my mindset. The best way I think I've found is to actually force myself to meet new people and try creating something meaningful. I am currently not ready to try it IRL but I think I could create something with a stranger on the internet since he can't really screw up with my livelihood from far far away. 


That's where I need help, I have absolutely no knowledge (and no success) on how to meet new people over the internet. Maybe some of you have some trick, some platform were I could meet people, any help will be appreciated.


Thanks for reading until this point

I hope you have a nice day

3104,throwaway222444333,1625957604,1,"Has anyone here outgrown friends before? And how did you cope with it?

After graduating high school, I noticed my friends and I just don’t click the same anymore. It’s been really hard to process because I’ve known both of them since literal birth and we all live in the same neighborhood too. I used to feel so understood and supported by them, but now there is a disconnect even though not much has changed about our personalities. Something just feels off. Outside of them, I never had any other real friends and barely spoke during school so I’m kind of panicking about our friendships sizzling out. For the past year I’ve been sitting in my house alone, and it has been a great opportunity for me to grow/figure out what I want in my life but I’m scared that I will stay lonely forever. 

I’m at the point where I deleted all social media because its just a big reminder that i have nobody to talk to (a pretty stark difference from when I used to be an influencer and had internet friends &amp; fanpages to talk to at all times). I also haven’t seen one of my best friends since February, and my other friend I see often but just feel so disconnected from her. I almost feel frustrated when around her because her energy is just different than it used to be and I don’t sense that she is a genuine friend to me anymore. All we have now are surface level small talks. It feels like she doesn’t want me in her life anymore and that she’s hiding important things from me. I try my best to be a supportive friend and hide my confusion with a smile, but they don’t reciprocate that effort back.

I guess I’m posting this just because I want to hear that someone understands what it feels like to randomly grow apart from people you once considered family, and to know that I’m not alone.",lonely,Outgrowing relationships and being alone,2021-07-11 08:53:24

I use to volunteer and donate a lot. And all that ever got me was being manipulated and abused. Also exploited for money and other stuff. I feel like a idiot for ever believing some people had the capability to be good. I also just had a break up my ex literally said i was to nice. Im so fucking done all i ever tried to be was a decent human being and it has gotten me nowhere. I have no friends whenever i talk to people they say im annoying unless they want to use me. Im worth nothing at this point being nice and decent human being has gotten me nowhere in life and never will.

3108,IntrovertedPanda91,1625957059,1,"It seems like good people, genuine conversations, and chill vibes are so rare lately and as a result I’ve ended up extremely lonely feeling utterly worthless most days. I have zero friends irl, I live alone, grew up without a family and the closes thing I had to a parent died back in November so I don’t really have anyone now. I won’t lie I’m not desperate for attention but I really wish I had somebody that kinda gave a damn about me. 

I’m doing all the cliche self happiness/love bs that you often see on movies. I hit the gym (lost a lot of weight, but I’m still fat) I’m even seeing a therapist, I changed my look, also got a new job, updated my wardrobe, forced myself to socialize more, even volunteered, gained some hobbies, even moved into a new place. Worked on my personality in a lot of ways, gained some confidence, I’m mostly polite and respectful, not the best looking guy in the world but definitely not the most unattractive one either. I’m doing my best to beat depression and become a positive person and you know what all my hard work has gotten me? I can now say I’m lonely and I hate my life with a smile on my face instead of a frown.

But yeah people don’t seem to like me or worse most people irl don’t even realize I exist most days I’m literally a background character to everyone else’s life and it sucks! Online isn’t much better I get ghosted quite often. My love life is non existent. Also the only time anyone ever calls me is when it’s about my cars extended warranty lmao like fml why am I even paying for my phone bill at this point? I’m really trying to put myself out there more and hopefully make friends but it’s just so difficult. Why can’t making friends be like shopping on Amazon oh loyal, honest, chill person?

3110,WhateverItWasILostIt,1625956207,1,"I’ve been doing long distance with my boyfriend since I was 15, so almost four years. It’s definitely not easy, and can feel so isolating at times, especially because I don’t really have any friends where I live, and he works a lot so we don’t talk as much as I’d like. He’s visited me quite a few times in my country, and I was meant to finally visit his last year, but that didn’t happen for obvious reasons, and now they’re not letting foreigners in for who knows how long. For a while now I’ve started to feel so left out and envious of how little I feel like a part of his life over there. 

I’d so like to meet his family, and be a part of his friend group, but it doesn’t look likely, I’m just known as ‘that random girl he’s dating on the other side of the world’. His friend is getting married soon, and there’s a lot of buzz about it. They have this big group chat where they all talk about it and make plans, as he’s the best man. I feel awful for resenting it so much, partly because I wish it was me in her place getting married, and partly that I wish I could be part of all of it. I tried, but let’s say I don’t really fit the bill. We all did a group video call one day, five of us, and it was excruciating, I was talked over, ignored, and when I tried to ask friendly questions or spoke, there was just an awkward silence. Needless to say I wasn’t welcome. 

I don’t resent him being friends with them, I just wish I could be a part of that perfect looking dynamic they have going on. Since the one girl is the only girl in the group of my boyfriend, her fiancé, and another guy friend, if I am brought up I’m compared to her in basically everything, looks, personality, needless to say I lose in every category, in their eyes. I guess it’s kinda petty, it’s just something that gets to me. Not to mention my boyfriend’s mother thinks she’s great and is also going to the wedding, meanwhile she has no opinion of me, and resents the fact my boyfriend is dating a girl thousands of miles away.

It's like I feel as if everyone is out to attack me personally so I feel as if I need to get there first even if that's not their intention. 

Am I a narcissist? I like to think I'm not. But I do think highly of myself and I'm also insecure with how lonely I can be. I can't tell if I'm manipulative since I try to hold it back but if I had no chains, would I be manipulating people all day? I don't know.

I also don't like how lonely people are portrayed in society and in media. As people who are that way because of something inherently wrong with them and as possible threats. I don't mean any harm to you or anyone else. I don't want to hurt you. But somehow, you think I do because I am insecure and think everyone's out to get me. If I lash out at you, it's because I get unusually defensive over something that might not even be an insult. And there's nothing you're doing wrong. 

Also, to my ex girlfriend, you did the right thing in leaving me even though you said you wouldn't multiple times. I was clearly unstable emotionally speaking and I unnecessarily lashed out at you for a weird reason. I'm so sorry for hurting you. I know we were teens back then and we're adults now.

3128,Ok_Shop_4631,1625948958,1,"I'm currently a 21yr old male who is almost a junior in college. It is also summer and I'm currently working which helps with feeling lonely because it keeps my mind busy, plus my co-workers are super nice and easy-going but they aren't my age which makes it tough to go out fishing or something. They are around 30, married, and have kids. 

I just finished up about 2 years down at my local community college in order to save money and be able to live with parents while going to school. Even though financially it was the best thing, the school was relatively small and didn't have any clubs or organizations to attend in order to meet new people. So, the only way to meet people was in class which I met a few but many were older vets using their GI bill or it was people my age but they weren't social. What I mean about them not being social is they were just focused on going to school and working which was the main mindset of the individuals at the college.

I met this one student who came from the larger university that I am transferring down to next fall and I thought he was pretty cool. We ended up striking up a friendship and conversed more through Xbox and it felt like we had a lot in common. Our conversations became more deep and intellectual to where we actually got to what I thought were good friends. I started proposing in the last weeks of school of last spring that we should hang out after finals and I tried asking if he wanted to go fishing, or hit some golf balls at the driving range. I proposed that we could take my vehicle so he didn't have to bother with his truck. Then school got out and I know he got a new job and started a summer class as well, but he just stopped talking to me. I can't help but think was I too pushy in asking if he wanted to hang out but when I would ask he never would answer. What I mean, is he wouldn't bead around the bush, or say maybe, not even a no or a simple yes. He flat out would not say anything and then talk about how he wants a girlfriend and he's a bit lonely and that's why I wanted to hang out to maybe get his mind off those things. Anyways we haven't spoken since the first or second week of summer because I didn't know if I created a problem by being too pushy or maybe I don't give the vibe that people want to hang out with me.

All throughout high school, I had a ton of school friends or acquaintances whatever you would like to call them. Every morning I was excited to see people that I knew and was fairly familiar with. I wasn't really super close to them other than maybe two or three and that's ok. Even though I knew people and they would actively say hi to me in the hallways and whatnot, I never got invited to go hang out with anybody. It gets a little hard to see people that I used to converse with at school on social media hanging out with people doing things I enjoy.

3161,themo98,1625937585,1,"Well, I'm soon turning 23, spent most of the past 10 years, including my High school and university years up until now, in relative social isolation with the pre-pandemic time at uni being much better than high school but pretty lonely nonetheless.

I remember learning from early on not to do anything that would anger my teachers, family, anyone. That, I guess, spiralled into me living a reclused, disconnected and boring life. There were days where I'd go to school and come home without even simply appreciating the fact that the other 26 students in my class were human souls too. Or that I am one for that matter. I sat off my time at school, sat off my time in front of the TV or Computer at home.

All this while gradually improving my grades and passing hiih school with a reasonable grade. Everyone (including me who was just a kid internalising stuff he heard) saw my grades improving over the years and thought I'm fine, not noticing that I'm practically socially isolated, not really living my life. Well, it's not hard to do good in school if it's literally the only thing in your whole life.

Whenever I wanted to meet friends or do fun things, it was deeply questioned. I had no privacy. I lived alone after high school to go to university in another city and went home over each weekend. So many Friday and Saturday evenings I bored away my youth since the earliest days I can think of, but now it hurt the worst.

I've never bern happy with my housing situation. My uni town appartment is on a loud main road, and living with my family means constant potential for conflict, a guaranteed lack of privacy and no social life as most of my few friends have long since moved on from the city we grew up in. Even though it is nice to have my family around sometimes, it is getting hard to live together.

I started renting a student dorm room in April and really just want to go live there. I may have no courses, lectures or anything, but exams, projects and rotations keeping me busy as a student for the next three years at minimum. I could technically do that from my family's home, but it just doesn't work. Should I just completely move to the dorm and just live my life, do my work? I've been there a few weeks and it's a cool place to live in, my flatmates are cool and we sometimes do things together. My family would be pissed but I pay it all on my own and my gut feeling says that is still the best choice. What are your opinions on this?",lonely,Is this the solution for me?,2021-07-11 03:19:45

I hope that years later mental illnesses is given more attention and studies years. I know that there are other diseases that need more studies too but studies regarding mental health is as important as other illnesses such as cancer because somehow mental illness is a form of cancer, it is dangerous. It's as dangerous and as harmful as cancer. Cancer gives physical pain but mental illness gives mental pain, both of them hurts. No need to experience them to know that. I hope people will be more kind and stop treating mental illness as a joke. No one wants to be broken. Healing isn't linear but it's not impossible. Silent battle is still a battle. Let's strive to win againts it. If we can't overcome our demons, we can at least dance with them. I WANT TO LIVE. The world is a better place with us in it. It will soon be our turn to be happy too.

 I didn't have any friends in highschool, but that never bothered me because I was super focused on maintaining high grades for my parents. It's safe to say that I was living my life for them rather than for me.

For the last year I haven't spoken to anyone other than my twin brother (who's worse than me) and my mom. I'm not sure if I even know how to make friends. And as sad as this sounds, I've grown too comfortable with not talking to people. But I don't want to be like that anymore. I want to have friends and I want to be liked.

However, I know myself, and I know that the fear of rejection is too strong in me. I don't know if I'll truly try and change in college, or if I'd just stick with my comfort zone and sit and be alone like I did in highschool. Since I'm already alone, nothing will change even if people DID reject me, so I might as well try and make friends... right? But if I was faced with that rejection, what if I feel like I'd never be able to be accepted anywhere? Would I be able to handle that feeling? I know you can't live your life saying ""what if"" all the time, but that's WAY easier said than done.

 I want to change but I feel like I'm stuck. I feel like I'm so socially behind. I'm 20 but I never had a boyfriend. Never attended any parties, never hung out with people outside of school...

My dad passed away 4 years ago and he was my only link to any of these people, to anyone in life, it seems. I just started crying my heart out...saying to the sky ""Daddy, i miss you so much... I can't do this without you! How am i gonna do this?!!""

I just woke up with actual tears in my eyes and just started crying again bc i don't know how to move past this loneliness. I'm trying to fight it, but I'm getting more and more withdrawn.. I'm in therapy, medicated, i have my own family and a supportive SO, but i still feel so lonely and disconnected.

Almost everyone at work is invested in their families and are older than me. I have a hard time connecting with my coworkers and roommates.

But now that we are work from home, I can go more than a week without talking to anyone face-to-face. And I believe it’s starting to take its toll...

I’m still very fortune to have a few friends from high school and college friends in a discord, but one by one they are starting to enter relationships or move back to old family / friends. I’m losing them... 

All I do now is sleep all the time (during work) and get super nostalgic for the past to the point of tears. I had so many people around me throughout middle school, high school, and college and never even realized it. If I could go back, I wouldn’t have said no to all the opportunities I passed on. I feel as if I’ve burned so many bridges, and now I’m paying the price. 

Literally a year ago I was the happiest I’ve ever been, and I was so thankful for the life I had. But everything changed this year... quarantine continued and now I’m a shell of that former self.

I love all the friends I’ve had over the years, and I’m so fortunate to have made so many memories. And I’m starting to think the time of friendships is over... I can’t watch any shows with groups of friends anymore because, based on what my parents or others are telling me, I’m never going to have that experience again. 

I’m told by everyone I’m still rather young and I have a lot of life left to live, but if I’m just going to be alone without forging any new friendships of meaningful relationships, then what’s the point?

I tried to get her back and she made it apparent she didn’t want to hear from me. She blocked me and I tried to reach her through mutual friends and emails. Big mistake - but I was desperate and didn’t know better. She filed a restraining order. I was so embarrassed that I went into a homeschooling program. My isolation and loneliness has gotten worse.

I am 28 years old male. So my story basically starts way back in 2018 when I had friends, family, girlfriend and a good job. Picture perfect life basically. Then everything started to go south. In 2019 my granny died, my parents divorced and left the home. My father died the very year in 2020. So it was me and my girlfriend but she cheated on me with someone else and left me saying the note that hope you understand. After all that trauma, no joy was left in my life. I had many sleepless nights. It affected my job. I started making tons of mistakes there. So they fired me. I am not strapped on cash so I don’t have anything to worry there. Then I started spending all my day playing video games, watching twitch and YouTube. Basically I became a couch potato. I gained alot of weight, maybe due to all those beers and burgers. 
So there was this one friend I have he was always there for me. He’s like a brother to me. He suggested I should go get my ass to counselling. For this once I agreed with him. So I got this counsellors number from internet. She was rated really highly over there. So she was a very soft spoken and a nice woman. We had couple of sessions but after awhile they became way more frequent. I may sound a bit weird here but meeting her feels really refreshing. After awhile I realize that I have feelings for her. We don’t text or talk after our session. But it’s just this time feels like my old self. I don’t know if she has a boyfriend or not. Deep down I know she probably does have a boyfriend but I don’t have guts to ask her out cause if she says that she has a boyfriend it’ll break me down. I don’t want to ruin this good thing I have.

She took a shower and I got into her phone to read the messages she was sending to the guy she was planning on meeting earlier... I don't remember much because it was such a rush to invade her privacy, but I did notice that he was serious about her making a ""concrete plan""

I didn’t know what kind of future I would find with computers but my family made fun of me until I dropped computers all together.

And then I was a pretty talented clarinet player. Just after 2 years of playing, I was playing college level pieces in middle school (which looking back is an insane feat). But I only played for about 3 years. I was renting my own instrument and my family took it away from me and returned it despite me still practicing everyday. This one really hurt me, I wasn’t even in band to socialize or hang with friends. I genuinely loved playing my instrument that much and it was taken away. I even start writing my own music for an eventual album I wanted to make.

Next was bodybuilding. I was a shy skinny nerd so bodybuilding was the last thing you’d expect me in. I researched the shit out of it and if you were to ask me what my primary passion is, I would answer bodybuilding. I grew muscle pretty quickly too. I went from the shy nerd in high school to the still shy nerd but buff guy lol. I did all this never going to the gym once. I pleaded with my parents to the point of tears that all I wanted was a consistent way for me to go to the gym. At this point, I’ve stepped inside a gym only once in my life. And just to rub salt in the wound, my sister actually hired a personal trainer and trained with her while I drove her for a month everyday.

The latest one has been my cooking ventures. Ive become a pretty good home cook over quarantine. My plan was to start making money selling food. Hell, I even considered just giving away food for free to customers just so I could get more cooking experience. I wanted to start my own business but my family has plans on their own. Everytime I bring up what I want to do, I get immediately shut down and my family tells me that I should actually help them with their own ideas.

For the past month, I’ve found a new job. I didnt know what it would be like going in to it but basically, I work from 9-9 with no lunch breaks at all. My body is fucking withering away and my family insists I work there for longer until I raise a shit ton of money. I don’t know how I haven’t reached my point yet.

3240,SportsMajor,1625889401,1,"I've (19M) always had a small group of friends or people in my family I talked to throughout my life. It used to be with kids around the neighborhood when I was younger. I had a few great memories with them. Then, it was hanging out with my cousins all of the time up until two years ago a few months after I turned 17. I was really close with them for a long time (for the last two summers together I was there almost everyday) but ever since we stopped seeing each other I rarely talk/text them. I had a few friends throughout high school, but those friendships have fizzled out. Since then, I haven't had that small group of friends.

Ever since I stopped hanging with my cousins almost everyday during the summers two and three years ago, I haven't been close to anyone. I want friends that I could hangout with, watch movies with, play video games with, go to malls with, stay overnight with (is that normal with friends at this point?), and do many other things with like I did with my cousins, but I can't find any. I miss the times I had with them as recent as two years ago, but we've had to move our own ways. No bad blood, but we don't see each other often anymore. I knew this was coming as we were growing up though.

I also want a relationship, but I need friends and people to be interested in me first. I've tried to create friendships with a few people I had an interest in, but my history has been short and not-so-good. Long story short, I got left on read by both of them when I would reply to their snapchat stories. That was three to four years ago though, so I'm over them. The one time it seemed like I had a shared mutual interest in someone (it seemed very likely they were dropping subtle hints over Instagram at the time for me to make a move), I was too nervous to break the ice. That was two years ago, but I ain't over them. Early on this year, they stopped viewing my stories everyday so that hurts. I also run into them at the park from time to time.

I was hoping college would change that, but so far it hasn't. At the start and end of my freshman year, I had no friends. I was on-campus two times a week in the fall and once in the spring, so that didn't help. I'm hoping that changes though as I'll be on-campus five days a week next year and will be working with one of their sports teams next year, but I doubt it. Right now, I'll just focus on myself and improve some of me. I need to learn how to break the shyness as well. That's holding me back.",lonely,Long vent.,2021-07-10 13:56:41

I'll start:

You will have ample amount of time to do whatever you like,without being interrupted or demoralised by others.

You can observe,think and draw conclusions more easily from more increasingly complex situations.As there is no one to dictate their judgement upon you,you will learn via trying.You view on life itself will change based on your own experiences and everytime you fail or misjudge something,you will realise you are wrong and correct yourself without intervention from outside.Thus resulting in a better thinking system.

3281,BlackMew,1625871113,1,"Fyi, I'm 34, FtM (he/him) - just wanted to avoid confusion. 

I thought after all this time, all the people I got to know... I wouldn't feel so lonely. But I do.   
What I feel like is a stepping stone. I become friends with people, and then I introduce them to others, and I end up just being left behind / forgotten. 

It happens time and time again... 

I've been on a somewhat mental downhill since late 2019, then fell out with a friend completely March - April 2020 because they had taken to ignoring me for a month after disagreement, which is the worst thing you could do to me. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and my fear of abandonment is way up there. So it set it off and I had dissociated a bit. 

I finally got myself pieced back together during the summer despite COVID.   
And then I met someone online. I went on a trip, but I was talking to him alot. During the trip I planned another the very next month to go see him. He, himself, is also FtM. Early 20s.  
The time I spent with him was AMAZING. We meshed so well. We had great adventures. He trusted me so much, as a random person on the internet that he got to know, to come visit and stay with me in Airbnbs.

But seriously, I just felt so much joy and peace. And I was scared alittle, I felt as thought I was falling in love and I thought I couldn't. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend in 2011, from a 7 year relationship that had turned abusive and toxic. (Also finally cut her out of my life in 2020). And I had finally been okay with me being single. 

Tl;dr - We both started calling each other partner. 

Dec 2020, I found out my best friend was going to move to the middle of the US. Kinda close to my boyfriend. But it still hurt. I didn't have that many people around, so many friends had solid jobs, their partners, or even children. I held together because of my boyfriend. 

We planned for me going to visit in May, and meeting up midway between where he lived and my best friend lived, for the 3 of us to hang. Boyfriend was excited and we were planning what we were going to do. 

But shit is going on with his mother being controlling and abusive. I don't hear from him for 3 weeks, when we were talking almost everyday. There's alot of long and complicated things, but he basically ends up telling me to cancel the trip, then ghosts me for a month, then comes back saying lets just be friends, it hurts of course.   
Day after he says for me to unfollow him on social media because he has this weird thing about people he knows IRL seeing his posts, and he feels too vulnerable and pressured. It's a weird hangup. I get upset and tell him I feel like he's just trying to cut me out of his life. He reassures me that's not the case.  
2 days after? He drops a big message on me, saying he can't do this, he can't be the reason I had all this anxiety, I was crying, and just everything that had happened.   


He ghosts me for a month.  
Finally talking after I threatened to come out there to get the things he borrowed from me- telling me he doesn't want to even be friends, saying I didn't do anything wrong (bullshit), and that's it's all him (bullshit). That he can't get passed what we did to each other. (him abandoning/ghosting me ; me making him feel watched/vulnerable)   


And I just... broke. For a week I didn't go to work. I didn't eat much. I hardly drank water. I was sleeping for 12 - 15 hours a day. It's only been 3? or so weeks since that. I wound up in the ER for an attempt at life, I had walked there myself.   


I feel so shattered. Alone. Friendless. I don't have any family. No parents. No siblings. Nothing.   
My friends were my family. I just hate not being as important to them as they are to me, because that's all I have. But they have so many other people and things going on that I'm not at all a priority.   


And I'm tired. I can't find the energy to do much.   
I'm at a shitty job. I had to give up school to work and survive.   
I just feel hopeless. I miss so many things. I miss feeling alive. I miss going up to see friends. I miss hanging out with my best friend in person. Online just doesn't cut it. I miss being physically close to someone. I just... I miss so much. I hate it.   


I can't even get help. Kaiser only is allowing one therapist appointment per month, because they don't have enough people. I'm trying so hard to find help that isn't going to cost me an arm and leg to do so. 

I don't know... I just feel like I've used up all my strength and hope. I feel like my age attributes to how I just don't feel like I can make deep connections with people anymore.   
I mean I did... and I just... I can't put that sort of effort in someone again with the risk of this happening. I almost ended my life from how much it hurt.   


I'm going day to day, going to a job that I'm not getting enough hours, not enjoying the things I once did, being alone, living with a housemate that is also my landlord and I just... don't talk to him. He's in his 50s, stressful, and odd. Very difficult to talk to, and he makes so much noise all the time. But it's where I can afford to live.

 I want to scream but no one hears Because I'm drowning deep into myself, losing my mind
 So used to being alone that I forgot there was such a thing friends,
 used to the For the constant cold I forgot how a warm hug feels,
 Trying to find strength to keep going, pushing all the pain to the side trying not to break.
I still want to live but it's so hard to hold on to positivity because the emotions I put aside are bursting out and eating the energy I need to make it all continue.
 I sometimes wonder how much longer I can make this movie go on, how much I can deal with all those demons all by myself, maybe I'm hiding it but I need someone there for me to just tell me ""everything's going to be fine"",
But because of all this loneliness I forgot what you feel when you are more than just friends, so I no longer have a passion for this kind of love.

 Feels so lost
 Who ask me if I'm okay
 I always answer yes even though the situation is not always okay.
 I fall apart into pieces and lock up emotions
 And honestly I'm afraid of what might happen once everything collapses ... I'm scared ... to hurt myself ...
 Oops I did such a good process
 And I was able to maintain mental balance for quite some time ..
 But sometimes I feel the wall falling apart stone after stone and the whole balance dissolves and becomes chaos ...

 What have I asked for that there was one person who cared enough about me to come visit and see that I was okay?
 That it was not so difficult to go through this selection called a relationship?

 That my only true friend was not an animal this time?
 Sometimes I tell myself
 ""Just forget everything, at the end of the day only you and the dog are left so what is it worth at all to try to open up that no one cares anyway.""

 If I could take out everything I keep in my stomach in tears I would already be doing it ..

I'm envious of people who have best friends and always keep in touch and plan things to do together. But I guess that it's just hard for me. I honestly want friends who I can make appointments with, who shares the same interests etc.

I'm jealous of my boyfriend, he has lots of friends irl. He introduces them to me and they're good people. They share the same interests as him and are very supportive to one another. Sometimes I get jealous when he makes appointments with them even though he spends a lot of time with me already. But dw I'm glad he has good friends who he can spend time with ♥️.

In my previous school I made a few but they've all moved on with their lives and made new friends.Which is great, I'm really happy for them. I'll never forget the happy memories I had with them. 

I'm a bit extroverted, I can easily strike a conversation with a stranger. But ya know... It's hard to find people who you can feel comfortable with.

Since the first day of school, I was bullied and made fun of without the ability to defend myself because I didn't speak the language of the country I went to. I was so excluded that I had to aimlessly walk in circles in the middle school's playing ground because nobody wanted to talk to me. I felt so awkward. I even followed the other kids in hopes of them including me but I was completely ignored. I was like a ghost to them. Everybody seemed to have fun. It destroyed me to point of shattering my true self-esteem. I endured two years at that middle school then we moved out to another city. At that point, I craved human interaction, was at my ugliest, and started self-harming. Out of nowhere, a girl in my class sees my fresh self-harming scars and tells me that she did the same thing, trying to dissuade me from continuing that practice. We even started chatting on social media trying to ease each other's pain. That's until I told her that I wanted to end it all and that I loved her. She threatened to call the police, which changed my mind. But that destroyed the bond that we developed and, like a dick, I started trying to guilt her into loving me. Things went south and long story short I became known as the depressed, self-harming, crying-in-school kid (teachers knew about the hit that I did). A status that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies. Fast forward to my first year of high school. I am still a shadow of my former self trying but I thought that I was reformed. Especially after befriending some friends. I acquired a gym membership and even willingly did a speech to my class, at the end of the year talking about how people change, how our class was perfect class accepting of everyone, and being a microcosm that could meticulously project our society. A microcosm where we can find the future: artists, doctors, architects, engineers, and more. Ending the speech with the confession of my love to a girl. Everything seemed going right. ""I am improving,"" I said to myself. Then year 2 comes. The whole year, my ""friends"" and I only talked in school. Rarely texting and we do it's for me being used as a tool for something. I spent all the holidays alone on my pc trying to lie on myself saying things like ""I don't need friends anyway"", ""I am happy"". Sometimes, I unveil my true feelings and start crying by the least trigger such as reading about how much people are having fun in their lives. I hate it when I see people happy. I hate god. I hate my life. And I certainly would've driven a fkn spear to my heart if it wasn't for the fact that I am a coward and that my parents have already paid for my college preparation year.

As farthest from the naked eye…somewhere I cannot see. Is a treasure that’s already so dear to my heart…where pure joy and romance wait for me. Do men believe in real love? Most women don’t feel that’s true. But because I know that any heart can be broken….even a man’s heart too. Real men want love. Love that’s deep and true. The kind of love that holds your hand…and always sees you through. Real men want a woman to cherish…to protect and to love and hold. So they wait for that one true soulmate…because she will be more precious than gold. Gold won’t even compare to the beauty within her and to that love that she gives. She will be his reason for searching no matter what…no matter how hard it really gets. A real man does believe and love. And this I know well. Because men do have hearts too.

First a little context: im a 21 yo girl who basically never had a real connection with a guy. In the last year (more actually) Ive been really trying to make myself better so that anyone would like me. Ive been going out (i mean, as much as covid lets me), ive been meeting new people, ive been trying to put myself in situations I wouldnt normally.

So far, these are my conclusions: I put walls around me and I cant, for nothing, put them down. An example: a couple of days ago, I was at a gathering and I met this guy and we connected and he was really flirty (but in a non weird way) and I, even with a lot of booze in me, couldnt just have fun. I kept wondering “what would people say if i kissed him, what would he think, what about tomorrow…?”. And he was just genuinely being nice

Im so sick of my brain just being non stop. I wish he would just let go and let me have some fun, but i just cant. This sucks, because i just want to be with someone caring, but my stupid brain always keeps me from having fun and enjoy life

Anyways, anyone have any advice? Thank you so much",lonely,I feel like I cant take my walls down,2021-07-10 04:01:24

3335,thelonelyheartdoc,1625848775,1,"Hello all, I hope everyone is well. 

About me: 24, male, med student (i'm almost finished), extroverted (life of the party type), I'm known to make people laugh, very sporty and socially comfortable. 

\###

My silent fight against my inner demons began around a year and a half ago, where I came out of a relationship (long story short, I have been with her for 3 years, we were happy all the way until the end, even speaking about getting married, but she broke up with me over a lie told by one of her friends. (We have never had a huge argument and we understood each other very clearly for the entire relationship)). This was a signifcant event because this shattered my confidence and self-worth. I was in denial that being in such a happy relationship with someone who tells me everyday she loves me could end so abruptly. I internalised the blame on myself, fuelling a newfound self-hatred. I did not confront the liar because it upset &amp; angered me so much that my ex wouldn't believe me when I said I didn't do what was accused of me. 

Alas, I could forgive this. Life is like this after all. I, admittedly, was extremely sad, but I never showed it to anyone, not out of being embarrassed, but a because of compartmentalising nature I have. I have a seen a lot during my life, some good and some bad. I just focused on my work. I also have a lot of stress from my family and extended family so that kept me distracted and worsened my head too. 

While struggling to get to grips with my newly single life, other realisations came where for one, I realised I never had a proper support group - i.e. a group of friends who respected my presence rather than use me for my advice. In my trauma, I had nobody to speak to because I was the one being depended on by those around me, keeping them together. This was a pressure I could handle though because it involved talking to them and I get a lot of satisfaction in making people relaxed and comfortable. All the while, my own mental health was plummeting: my family situation was becoming awfully strained, my friends whom I thought were friends ghosted me, and I felt incredibly unloved everywhere I went. 

This was when I met someone who I really clicked with, just a little while before the pandemic struck. Everything was perfect. She mentally stimulated me like no other. I deeply fell for her. It was reciprocal for her too. I really felt like my head was starting to improve and I was being happier with myself, until it came the time for me to return to uni, when she dropped the bombshell on me that she wanted to end it because ""I wasn't quite the right one"". Her breakup text (a few days later when I asked why in my moment of weakness), was ""You're really kind, funny, handsome, charismatic. I am so glad that I met a man as incredible as you. But sometimes, you care about someone so deeply about someone, you can care about them and they can be amazing, but it just doesn't feel right"". More question marks were raised than answers, and this made me descend into the same pit, the pit of sadness, lack of self worth and an awful self hatred. I have struggled to shake it off thus far, even when I do constructive things to offset its effect. Internalising the blame on myself again... 

Perhaps because of the pandemic, perhaps because of the nature of time, I have found that people all around keep to themselves and don't involve me in anything. I understand that people have their own things to do, but I seriously feel isolated in my uni, in my workplace and honestly, the world too. I love talking to people and making people laugh so I'm not used to not being around people. It's like winter has befallen me and the leaves on my tree are all gone. I'm withering away along with it. 

I now have absolutely nobody to talk to. As the finals of the Euros approaches, I realise that I don't have even a single friend I could go to the pub with to watch the game. I watch on people's stories of them enjoying themselves, where is I am sat around with no option but to stay put. It's hard to ignore things when you're already a receptive person.

Adding to my loneliness, I also have the added pressure of thinking about the future. I feel that I am absolutely nowhere in life and I have not reached any of the pinnacles I have planned to reach. I don't know what kind of a doctor I want to be. I don't really have any hope for a family. I knew it was a red flag when I presently don't even have a hope for a single friend in my life. I'm travelling the ocean of life alone, crying in the dark for some reprieve. 

I have been trying to offset my loneliness by doing creative things, like gardening, working out and writing. I have also tried to place an extra emphasis on being kind to people so that they don't have to feel the way I feel. I genuinely believe that a little bit of kindness can go a long way. But my mind is wailing with sadness after a year of not speaking to anyone other than my family. The only time I can mask what I feel is in front of people who depend me, when I paint a smile to hide my grimace so that at least they can feel some comfort. 

If you have anything to comment, please feel free to do so. I would love to hear what you lot have to think about what I have written. I am all ears for advise too.",lonely,Behind my painted smile,2021-07-10 02:39:35

3352,kainlevi,1625839863,1,"Just moments before you were with me. Unlike the real and past events we did not have any resistances while getting to know each other and after. The moments were filled with the feelings people describe with butterflies in their stomachs.

Our touches, kisses and playful intimate times were dear and full of life. No second guessing thoughts or insecurities. Just riding along the waves of apparent reality. Even talked about the need for a training coach like klitschko if your soldier-like father ever came to visit your flat by surprise. You laughed. But just like all of this in dreams doors are open or everyone has keys.

But you were with me. No one but me. And so was I. The feelings of craving you before I even left, as I looked at your expressions, and the feelings of not overstimulating our time together and letting it become a routine were bittersweet. Loving and rational beings experiencing the world with absolute gratefulness.

The reciprocity and common ground made me safe. I did not worry about a concept such as infidelity here. And then during something like a party where I was talking to a friend of yours another guy came to me, being quite pushy. He embraced me and threw me up into the air. Right after he told me by his bitter but vast smile with running tears. “You know what - I never had her” (as if she was someone special representative for the very experience I described).

I answered calmly despite the uncomfortable throwing that messed with my neck. “And you never will as long as I live.”

These short lived but intense moments brought me back. Especially the neck crushing throwing was like a free fall back into waking up. 

In reality my sleep has been bad. Not sleeping until the morning hours full of existential frustrations and mental baggage. It mirrored my bad posture in sleep and the pain in the neck.

It has been almost 9 years since we met through my best friend at the time. 5 or 6 years when we were last in contact. A few Years of spending time with each other after school was over and the next phase of life took its course. The many days in a row we sometimes spend together filled a hole I did not know existed. How I held your hand for the sake of it and innocently slept and woke next to you.

You got together with my friend when we studied for the final exam and the time we spend as a group of 5+ friends was the best time in school or maybe life I have in memory. The hours in the library were long moments of quiet and these efforts were paid for by the breaks and time we spent together around it.

 I don’t know how my attraction was located in my mind. Despite the slight bitterness I could ease and even be happy to see my most favorite humans be together. It was breaking a part in me that was simply there by evolutionary means of procreation - whatever the price for this cherished time.

My mind twisted and I even somehow introduced some weird social engineering momentum to get to hold your hand a few times. Let this be the dumb compromise. Just let it continue to be whatever it is.

But then you guys just suddenly break up after a few weeks. Like my mom and dad you did me some impact I just don’t know what to feel and think about. Just would and could bes’. The group wanted to split from her altogether.

But our friendship that began without their relationship has already found a place in my heart. It was difficult to decide with a lack of introspection. Do I like her too much in a bad way or is it really the personal relationship? How do I even separate what my mind makes of each person. Life was too fast to think.

By Mutual Connection I held onto her causing great contempt and accusation on intent.
So we started meeting up as the group became a spoiled place to be in.  I just could not give into such a demand of other people’s relationship. I am my own person after all. It must have been the maturity we lacked, a reality nonetheless. 


I held onto my “responsibilities” as a friend to my friend. Realizing I really loved her - I still remember the open space table where we sat eating subway baguettes. I thought to myself “my greatest prove of love would be staying by her side forever ”.

Life buddies so to say. She let me in on her life, her relationships and thoughts. We rode the streets on longboards, to another city, became vegan for morals, spent time in a house just the two of us and went to fitness together... We synchronized and I could even tell things out of nowhere. Like how i just knew you did something to your hair.

There was no relationship you held on for long during our time. The parties we went to and opportunities of socializing were a pain though. It was agonizing to just standby as other guys attempted to get close to you. My mind twisted and I had hoped you would just find one decent guy. 

We developed something that flickered. It never got out of bounds but it was put out every time by unassuming events. You went to vacation and suddenly you came back oblivious to our feelings. Instead you had a love interest from the short moment visiting family.

I knew my reluctance and guilt towards my friend made me undecided and weak. I could not be direct and claim you with my feelings. But it was utterly breaking me. I did not ask for myself but assumed the curiosity and support of a friend. You felt it, asked me about it but I insisted on keeping it up. 

The people and casual relationships kept eating away at me. My initial feelings became a responsibility that wanted to sustain themselves for their beautiful memories. You fell in love with me but your feelings were once again redirected by a small car accident and the worries about it.

We are both sensible to the world. You probably even more so and I lacked determination in this messed up position I have put myself in. My mind lost to my feelings and became a bitter wreck as you connected to other guys twice each time when I was sleeping close by. The realization have taken my sleep and put me on my feet running every time.

I started to lose myself in distracting from my predicament and put on fake traits to connect with different women. I became toxic and it is my own fault. The roots haven’t receded despite change of mindset.

I don’t know anymore. The isolation and distance I have put myself through in the past years have filled my head with so many observations and introspection that my feelings and these memories have ceased to be something personal rather that my subjective experience.

I blame it to the hole in me to want love so strongly, dream so far and fall so hard. All that self denying thinking. Truly I even feel guilty that just the concept of you is subjected to so much of my projection and pain. You just happened to be on the receiving end just like I was for you.

I made best friend who I got to keep for 5 years, but nothing ever lasts. I wanted a friend group, I had a friend group with that best friend, I got to keep it for 7 months. I lost them in April. The one who was supposed to love me disappeared just like all the others at the end of June. 

Abandoned and alone once again. I saw friends from middle school on the Sunday that I lost my love. I tried to bargain for what didn't want me, but those old faces opened my eyes again. I felt like myself. I felt like I could just be. I opened myself up. I used Reddit again, hitting people up, trying to make friends, trying to fix the loneliness from the hole in my heart that was left. Tried to search so hard for the right one to lay myself to sleep with that I burned myself out with all the people I ignited conversations with. My mind could only handle so many connections before I started to lose track. I'm sorry if I ever started a conversation with you, but then never came back.

Joined servers, made friends, rose in the ranks of the systems, becoming a part of something. A community, a home, somewhere to go, something to cling to. So desperately I want to be a part of something, I want go belong, I want something that won't disappear this time. My memories, I try to forget everything, everything that didn't last. Why should I remember the things that will never return to the way it was? I'll reminisce when the scars heal, but for once, I want to keep my memories. I want to make so many. I wanna replay every happy moment in technicolor, hearing the laughs, seeing the smiles, spending minutes, hours, a long while together. I don't want to let go anymore. 

It's a losing battle with chronos and I. I can hold, cling, and try, try, try to make sure it last forever this time.

3370,OKappnMyKappn,1625824114,1,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for three years, and I've grown close to his family very quickly. I never experienced what a real family felt like because mine is very fractured and distant. 

Within the past two months, three of his family members have passed away, so he is in a horrible state. I'm trying to be there for him, but I'm hurting so bad. I've been working overtime so that he can take time off, while cooking every night, and taking on the majority of the chores, while grieving on my own.

I'm exhausted. Mentally and physically. Today, we're missing the funeral of his uncle because we can't afford to take any more time off. I feel guilty for not being able to be there, but also for not making enough money for my boyfriend to be able to go.

I've been trying to contact my parents and siblings, but they don't respond. I feel like I'm completely on my own.

Today at work, a 70 year old lady came in and mentioned that she has a house near my work that she has to travel into the city to check on since she moved away. I gave her a post-it with my information on it, and told her that I would be willing to look after her pool and check on her home as a side job so that she wouldn't have to. She said that she would give me a call, and since that moment, it's been all that I could think of. It made me realize how lonely I am. There's a hole in my life where family should be. I'm way more excited about the possibility of a relationship with this stranger than any monetary compensation. 

I know that I'm not alone, but I feel isolated. My only friends are my coworkers, and I'll never really be a part of my boyfriend's family until we have children, and I fear that I'm incapable of carrying a child to term. We desperately want to start a family, but I've already had two miscarriages.

3371,Wheredabttmsat,1625819947,1,"I'm a gay guy in his 30s and still have never had a BF. It's currently 4 AM and I woke up alone, again. Honestly sick of it.

Meeting people in general is always a royal pain. I was closeted until my early 20s (so never learned to approach guys growing up), have always been socially anxious, and am even hard of hearing. That's a HUGE obstacle in just talking to people. 

I've heard too many people claim it's easy to meet folks. Fuck you, no it's not. I'll give you $1,000 to successfully find and KEEP someone around while incredibly anxious and badly hard of hearing, I'm dead serious. 

It's caused me to rely on trying to meet guys online, but obviously that's not the best way given how flakey everyone is. I've been ghosted, blocked, and ignored maybe over a thousand times over the years (not exaggerating). The number of people actually willing to meet has been single digits, and all disappeared after one meeting.

Pro tip, NEVER believe the flirts or high words of praise you get  on Tinder or Grindr or Reddit or Snapchat. Guys will say literally anything for validation, nudes, or a quick hookup.

Just once, I want someone to stick around, not ghost, to want more than just a hookup or string me along or waste my time. To actually go to sleep with and wake up in the morning.

3373,Wander_Bear,1625818238,1,"Lost my partner last year, but a lot of people lost a lot of people. And it's been about a year now. Last time I kissed her, I stopped and kissed her again. I always kissed her goodbye twice, ""just in case I don't get another chance."" I knew in the back of my mind there would be a point where it really was, but I always thought I'd have more time.

I didn't.

It wasn't just an abstract excuse for affection.

It was just another way to say ""I love you,"" then one day, it was reality.

One day it really was the last time.

In the deep of the night, though I've grieved and processed and continued forward; when all is quiet and the dark presses close, when the silence is loud in my ears, I am haunted by the truth: I should have asked for one more. Two was a lifetime too few.

I don't know how to be happy any more. I don't know how to live with this overwhelming solitude. Maybe someday I will meet another silly, sarcastic, wickedly intelligent woman strong enough to kick the world's ass, with enough tenderness left to cradle my head in her lap at the end of a strenuous day.

Someone I could take care of, who took care of me back. Someone slouched on the couch under a blanket, crunching popcorn to a scary movie or playing cooperative video games like we were 12 and it was Saturday morning.

We were a team. And, I thought for a long time, an unstoppable, unbreakable team.

Now I can never be certain I'll find it again -- or if I even should. I don't know if any one man should be allotted two chances at true love, when so many are still searching for just one.

So for now I wander through my routine.

I bury the silence in music I play too loud.

I break the tension lifting weights, until my arms are too heavy to move.

And when the only thing left of my energy is in my fingers, I write.

I've written her so many times; countless letters trying to reassure her that everything is alright. That I'm taking care of all the people we loved, that I'm okay. That I will be. That I can still feel the sun on my face; that the whisper of her memory does not cripple, but empowers.

My family is the type of family that can go 3 months and only speak a total of 100 words to each other. I didn't make my first friend until about 7th grade, she woke me up because I was sleeping in the back of class to tell me school was over.

3396,JerkAssHomer,1625804476,1,"Some context: 

I've always felt lonely, even in the presence of others (longtime friends, my partner, coworkers I get on with), but it never bothered me all that much. When I moved to Denver back in 2011, I didn't make a huge group of new friends, but we still got along, hung out, and still talk and support one another to this day. I moved back to my hometown in 2017 and reconnected with old friends and, to my surprise, made plenty of new friends at work. I'd host cookouts, or have people over for game night, or do activities with all of these people quite regularly.

Then, thinking I was helping a friend, I ended up in Montana knowing only my partner and this aforementioned friend. This friend needed roommates in order to stay in this town to finish their degree and my partner and I wanted to get out of our hometown (I also lost a friend at the same time this discussion was had and my grief-stricken mind thought I needed to get as far away as possible). A few weeks before our move date, the friend informed us she'd gotten into a program in a town four hours away and would only be with us for three months. I figured, okay, that's enough time to meet people and find my group and she promised to introduce my partner and I to people who we might get along with.

Fast forward to being in Montana and I hardly saw this friend the three months she was living with us, the cooking and cleaning responsibilities fell mostly on me, and the friends she had barely spoke to me or my partner when they came over. My partner and I are polyamorous, so we did try dating new people at first but no one really was a good fit for us - our circle stayed small.

Pre-pandemic, I made about four or five new friends, but I only really see two of them frequently since I usually hang out to smoke weed with them and just shoot the shit. The other three are significantly busier (nanny, promoter, drummer for a band), but we do have fun the few times we see one another.

The friend who initially brought me to Montana would come to visit, but I always got the vibe she only wanted to hang out because it was a guaranteed couch to sleep on. If we went to a concert or got breakfast with her friends, I always felt like the odd duck out of the conversations, even being ignored for the entirety of a concert/night on the town where I literally left the show for over an hour to play Pokémon Go and no one noticed until the house lights came up. Afterwards, her and her group wanted to go to a bar where I was ignored again and just went to the car to listen to a podcast for an hour before they noticed I'd left again. We haven't spoken since that night.

Okay, now that that's out of the way -

I quit my job back in April. I was financially stable enough to take some time off and recover from the burnout the pandemic had brought on. During that time, I saw my partner and the two friends I hang out with regularly fairly regularly, but not as frequently. I also ended up with a decent amount of mushrooms, which was great, but also gave me the mental space to reflect on how depressed I was and how isolated I felt out here. Towards the middle of my time away from work and interacting with people, I ended up doing some amphetamines (insuffilated) and having a period of time where I wanted to socialize but couldn't really go out to places where people gathered. After coming down from that binge, I had a period of feeling unmotivated and more misanthropic than usual.

Finally, I decided to look for work and ended up getting a job a few weeks ago. I genuinely love the work (small kitchen where I'm one of four cooks inside of a grocery store) and I appreciate that it gives me a sense of purpose after spending two years working at a gas station.

However, I feel like mentally, I'm just not ready to interact with large groups of people, having to remember faces and names, trying to play the work politic game. My manager is friendly and we've had nice, quick conversations about bicycles and food, and one of the cooks I've worked with is a genuinely nice person, but we don't have much in common aside from the fact we both smoke weed and take psychedelics.

For the most part, anytime I speak up at work, it's work-related and nowhere near that level of comfort I had talking to new people in Denver or back in Texas. I spend my lunch break alone mostly to avoid the crowds at the store (I'm vaxxed, but still try to distance as often as I can), which doesn't bother me, but I know that probably means I'm not going to interact much with my other coworkers. Every day after work, I come home and have vented to my partner about how isolated I feel on the job.

Maybe it's just my brain not working right, or maybe it's just that breaking in period at a new job. I seriously considered looking for a new job today, even though I know I wouldn't be paid as well or enjoy the hours as much. I'm mostly just venting because I don't want to burden my partner with this when they feel just as isolated, so I figured why not just scream into the void and get this off my chest. I just want to be able to talk to people like I used to, but I feel like something broke inside of me during the pandemic and I'll never get it back.",lonely,It Feels Like I've Become Feral During the Pandemic,2021-07-09 14:21:16

Why would he do that to me? I’m so angry. I would never do that to someone, he’s caused me so much pain. 

I’ve been so lonely and sad for so long, I was so excited to have hope at being happy for once. Other people don’t understand because they don’t know how fucking horrible I feel all the time and how much I really need this.

I know it’s so pathetic but I’ve been trying to contact him on different accounts on different social media but he keeps blocking me. He really can’t just tell me why he unadded me?

I’ve been working since May and there’s a guy I like. He’s kind of similar to me, though seems more “normal” and dependable. Being around him kind of makes me feel safe and his looks don’t annoy me (kind of feminine, my height). So I wanted to see if he’d like to be friends… not sure why it took me so much time (2 months, essentially) to realize that. I’m pretty stupid.

But anyway, now I am working on the evening shift and he’s in the morning one. I feel like it’d be creepy if I just went to my workplace and to my job area when not scheduled and try to talk to him.

I’m 20, girl, basically a lesbian, live in UK, at uni, study a science related course, enjoy watching YouTube, enjoy watching people game, started playing elder scrolls online a few days ago, very casual gamer though, played a lot of minecraft as a kid, have an avid interest in true crime, love any film in the conjuring universe despite it scaring the hell out of me but I also love disney films too, mainly watch series over films (Brooklyn 99, Modern Family, OITNB, RuPaul, Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor, IT crowd, Friday Night Dinner), listen to a mixture of music (NF, twenty one pilots, 5 seconds of summer, blackbear, Hans Zimmer - whatever makes my ears happy tbh 😄)

Realise that a lot of that makes me sound boring and perhaps immature but I’ve isolated myself for a while which knocked any productive hobbies out of reach for now... or maybe I am just boring 😄

3457,proletaaripiika,1625770721,1,"So maybe i am not a completely lonely individual for most of your point of view. 

I have a bf, but he's either at work or gaming at his place most of the time, so we meet approximately once or sometimes twice a week. So something like 80% of my freetime i'm all alone. He likes to be alone a lot, loves gaming, so we don't see as much as i'd wan't to, but you know, got to respect others wishes and habits.

I have no friends in this town, you know how it is (really difficult to find a likeminded person to whom i can trust even a bit) and after living here for 7 years has made me to accept it, that i'll probably always be aloner. And i hate it so much, i didn't wan't this. 

At work i have noticed that i'm just unabled to form a bond to anyone (i have really different kind of personality and past compared to anyone else, trauma brains, bpd and what not, so not an easy person but ffs i am trying with all my essence). 

Then i have 2 long time friends, but they live in other provinces. Other one i meet maybe a couple times a year (we use to be really close, we were roommates for a long time, but then boyfriends came along etc.). 

Then there's my best friend. Had always have a completely trustworthy relationship going on for a beautiful 27 years. Sometimes we have been on the phone every day for hours. Calling all the time. Just perfectly fullfilling friendship, except the distance. This spring we talked about going to this camping site to spend some of our summer vacationtime, and i had specifically requested my days off to be at the same time with her, so i could join with her and her extended family. The days were confirmed etc. Then they suddenly had some family drama, which included cheating from one member of the extended family and my friend told me that the trip will probably be canceled because of it. She did not spoke of the trip after that revelation so i came to clonclusion the trip was cancelled.

Well the next time i hear from her is 2 days prior to the originally set date for me to join them in the camping site, she called me that they were already there and also stayed a night before in a nother place at the beach. I didn't spoke much during that call. Then little later that horrible feeling of betrayal, confusion and anxiety kicked in (i know, i'm not the fastest to recognise my feelings, or that smart either). I confronted her the next day and she said she simply forgot and was very apologetic. How could you forget something we've been talking about so many times? I asked if it was someone in the extended family that didn't want me there and if she's just covering for them. She said no, she just forgot. Then promised to visit me couple days after (they were only couple of hours drive away). I didn't want to say no even though i felt so bad and some past traumas were reminding me of all the ignoring and other bs. I just wanted to meet her, but when the time came i just couldn't feel as relaxed and open as i would otherwise do. She came with her husband and son, stayed for few hours and left. She was so happy and bubbly. I felt like shit.

So i wen't to my boyfriends house, cleaned his appartment and passed out a little after he came home from his evening shift.

I don't know what to think about all of this. There has always been this thing going on with everybody that nobody wants to visit me if they're not gaining anything from it. But for her to do it? I don't know what to think anymore.

I have questioned from several people what it is that is wrong with me, why people just don't like me? I have had few answers and immediately started the work to better myself. But it's clearly not enough.

I come from a very abusive household (except my mother, she was an enabler but at the same time groomed, brainwashed and abused), so i have gone to no contact with few of my own family and to very low contact to others. Just to avoid the toxicity, narcissism and clear disrespect to keep my mind steady. I don't want to be a part of that anymore. So when i see these kind of sick traits in people that my family haves, i distance them from me. And it's amazing how toxic so many people are. 

My go to reaction to my shitty situations has always been fleeing. Either it's breaking up with boyfiends or friends, moving to another town or even country, quitting my jobs, got to study a nother degree or just isolation etc... But i'm tired of that shit. I just have to accept that people just don't like me and i don't know why because most of people are unable to give constructive criticism in a polite way. Or god forbid talk to you about something that bothers them. Why is this? 

Is it social media? I really feel like people aren't able to concentrate on a good conversations anymore. I left SM long time ago, it has something so unnatural in it.

So, to conclusion: I like drugs and alcohol. They make me feel good. They're always there for me, giving me the dopamine i so much grave from other people who just aren't interested. I would love to have hobbies to join with people, but i have to do those by myself. So i drink, smoke, take pills and burn my stomach with coffee and energydrinks, do shit by myself and stay as a cityhermit (/s).",lonely,Summer vacation time and i've been drunk and taking other substances as well for a 5 days on a row now...

I know that from a very stereotypical prospective online friendships are hard to maintain and overall 'less wrapped up' as we say in the Black American church and this is why I'm making such post on here, you know, as a last shore because if this place in which we are 'lonely' isn't the right one to ACTUALLY establish a real friendship than nowhere in this damn web is!

It just gets progressively worse as this feeling would often get accompanied by sadness and depression. It gets to the point where i just get random headaches from my brain trying to process so many different racing thoughts. 

Thoughts on like how everyone else has somebody to talk to or simply just have a random conversation through text and what not. How other people are at the peak of their lives enjoying youth. How other people manage to maintain a best friend, heck having a group of friends. Though i do have a grp of friends i talk to but its inconsistent, since most of them are older than me and have jobs and stuff.

It doesnt help that i suffer from social anxiety, major depressive disorder and bipolarity. Its even ironic that I'm even typing this as often i would be too anxious to post remotely anything. It sucks so much as i would have to deal with so many intrusive thoughts like the urge just just punch a window or heck even smash my head onto my desk just in hopes to ease the mental processing that going on.

Yeah i am getting professional help but it only helps to a degree. In the end I'm just lonely and frankly pathetic. I never was able to maintain friend groups, i never ever gotten the experience a proper relationship (heck I'll be amaze if theres even a single soul who can tolerate a person like me). I got back stabbed and manipulated by people which made me lose someone who i thought was my best friend. They were the only person i ever sought solace in, they were part of my happy place and not to mention the only person i ever ran to when i slit my finger and bleeding out after punching my wardrobe.

I hope everyone has a great day ahead, just wanted to be heard i guess. It gets overwhelming but being through all of this shit just motivates me to help others in the same position.",lonely,Anyone ever just get a huge wave of loneliness,2021-07-09 03:57:22

3463,fmlfmlfmfl,1625765033,1,"I was a serially lonely kid through high school. I was awkward, didn’t make any friends, lacked self esteem and self confidence, was generally extremely awkward. My teenage years were a painful time - i was in constant suffering due to loneliness.

2 years into college I had started to get better. I managed to make two friends and took a liking to economics. My two friends left the country to study abroad after college. I graduated (in 2019) from college with a job and lived in the same city as a few folks I knew from college. We’d meet on weekends for dinners and other things. They weren’t my best friends by any measure but I had folks around me and it helped keep away other thoughts. Things were going well. I loved my job, I had things to look forward to on weekends, and I was slowly beginning to forget that at one point in my life, I didn’t have a single friend.

I never healed completely but I managed to create a system for myself that allowed me to cope. 

Cut to March 2020 and everything came crashing down.  My country locked down hard and I didn’t  meet another person for two months. I’m still socially awkward and struggle to keep in touch virtually, over text. With each passing day, I fell deeper and deeper into loneliness, and into a void. I lost virtually all the connections I had built. This, coupled with feelings of inadequacy — no one thought of me enough to even check in. Other side effects creeped up to - weight gain, depression, insomnia, suicidal thoughts.

It has now been over a year since this pandemic began. In these 16 months, I’ve gone back to square one. Everything, gone. I’ve gone months without even speaking to anyone outside work. I’m more lonely than I’ve ever been. I’ve lost all motivation, I can’t even get myself to get out of bed and turn on my computer to work. 

The pandemic is still raging where I live and we were back under lockdown again just a few weeks ago. It looks like this will be the norm in developing countries for a long time. I have no idea how to cope. I have no idea how I’m going to not be lonely again. I don’t think I can deal with the suffering and thoughts again.

Im 28 years old abd have been working from home since November 2019, However I wasn't fully home until March 2020. So its been well over a year of little human interaction. Im home sometimes 15-16 hours a day alone. No children, no pets, a husband that doesnt have a license so my schedule is based arou d when he needs to be picked up and dropped off. Up everyday at 530, make breakfast and lunch take him to work come home start my own job, leave at 5 to go get him and come home to make dinner and sit on my phone umtil bed time. I feel like my husband jsut sees me as this insane woman. I try talking to him and hes just ""you need a change, have yoi reached out for help....etc"" and then the one consistent friend ive had for almost 20 years has 3 kids of her own and trying to vent to her is the same exact way almost. She just says im sorry and things will get better and trys to make suggestions and I hate it. My sister thinks im my mother and my dad just wsnts me to suck it up cause life never gets better. I sit around this empty house invalidating my feelinfs all day telling mhself im just a nutso chick and its all in my head and im a big baby to just get over it. I tried doing tik tok and I really enjoyed it because I got rid of Facebook back in January because of all the hate and negativity and tik tok was helping me learn to dance and making me laugh... Like real belly laughs. And then I started trying to gain a following and its veen 3 months of making videos and I just feel like a loser that made a fool of herself. 

I just want to not need anyone for validation, I want to love myself as much as my husband says he does, or the other people in my life that say they love me and tell me I have all of these good things about me.. But why dont I see all of these gold things? Why am I that person that has to have someone telling me how I feel or what I want. Why don't I just know? Why the hell am I so freaking indecisive all the freaking time? Why do I expect so much from others? Like how Ive always gone above and beyond for others but never felt it in return... Why do I feel like such a needy asshole, Im so damn co dependent on my husband. And soooo naggy... I complain about him so much and me so little.

I was diagnosed as a child with high functioning Asperger's Syndrome, which aside from the obvious hurdles that comes with, didn't bother me too much as a child. But after middle school, and especially after high school, everything feels like it's crumbling apart. I didn't have any real friends growing up, no one lived near me, and in retrospect the kids that were nice to me were probably just doing so because I was different. Hell, I got expelled and sued in fourth grade because the school simply wouldn't believe that I was autistic and not a problem child, so I had to leave everything behind. I finally made real friends in high school, and things finally felt good for a few years, but fast forward around seven years to today, and I don't think I've ever been any lower.

*Q. And are you doing anything to fill that void?*

*The most upvoted comment will receive a Teddy bear 🐻 Award by me and others can give too !*

So for me I will just write in the post itself - 

I feel lonely cause I feel I have no person close to me (not even a close friend) with whom I can share everything or be intimate with(love and care) although I do have mom but that’s different na and another reason is cause of lack of interest/motivation in studies sometimes.

So this loneliness can be fulfilled by bringing back interest and motivation in my inner self and maybe getting a lovely person who loves me back and everything is from both side.

For this loneliness to be catered I am trying my best and taking baby steps to solve my anxiety issues in studies and hopefully little by little get grab of it again, and in aspect of the person in my life 😅No step taken yet , I tried online although anonymously only but well it’s not that easy and very less people got interested.

3483,TheMasterofDoom,1625752401,1,"Allright, I'm gonna start by saying that I have a lot of friends and a supportive family (although I distance myself from them a lot). I am good looking too. So far so good you would think. If you'd see me out on the streeth going about my day, you'd think: This guy is going places.   


But that is not the real me hiding inside. The real me that's hidden inside is lonely and suffering. You see, it all started when I was very little. My biological father beated the shit out of me, until I was 5 years old. That's when my mom divorced him. I was also bullied in pretty much every school, for being ""different"". Even the teachers themselfes would bully me. It was later found out that I'm a high functioning autistic. As a result I do not fit in anywhere. I'm not normal enough to be normal, yet not autistic enough to be part of the auti community. I simply don't belong anywhere.   


Getting into a relationship has been very hard for me. My first girlfriend, just broke up with me after 2 months. I was 15 at the time. I was never given a true reason. Sometimes I still wonder what happened. I have talked to girls online and went into those online relationships as they call them because I simply don't have the confidence to go and look for girls out in the wild. My past still haunts me till this day. Most of those online relationships were complete disasters, ending up in me getting hurt and more and more traumatised with each one.   


I was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago and am now in EMDR treatment. I have a none paying job (I'm on disabillety) and get to come home to an emtpy house everyday. I just wish to come home to that special person for once, one day ya know? Recently I thought I found her. Things went well for a much longer time than usual. Buuut, then it turned out she just wanted to be friends. I was not sure how to handle that, but I gave it my best shot. Ofcourse my past and traumas caught up with me, and were happy to ruin things with the girl in question. Just my luck. Now things are beyond repair, and I'm not even sure what to do anymore. I feel like I'm so damaged, that I can never be in a relationship with any woman.   


Sometimes I think about just ending it, because the lonelyness is getting to me. The pandemic has certainly not helped. I try not to complain to my family and friends in real life to much, as I'm sure they either don't give a damn, get sick of it, or simply think I'm overeacting.   


My biggest fear is to die alone, or I guess I should say to die lonely, since we actually kinda all die alone anyway. And since I'm turning 29 this november, and am still completely and utterly alone, it's starting to look like my biggest fear will soon be my harsh reality. Seeing the people around be happy and in healthy relationships, getting married, and having kids, makes me feel hurt and alone. No one would ever want something like that with me, and I can't really say I blame them, since I'm just me. On the other hand I'm just glad it's me suffering and not my loved ones. Maybe I deserve this, idk.

I feel so alone. Like there’s something wrong with me because my coworkers all have social lives and constantly have stories and people to see and places to be. I have nothing and no one and i’m always asked why i’m “so antisocial.” I’m told, “so you really have no friends?? No homegirls? No sex life? What do you do all day by yourself?” 

what I do is lay around because I collapse from exhaustion the minute I get home from work because i’m so mentally drained and then I proceed to cry myself to sleep. every. single. night. But I won’t say that though.

They told me to go around and drive for about half an hour and take a trip down the freeway to get my battery up and running again. It was around 10:00pm at that time. So I took the freeway all the way across town and in that direction was the area of the city where I used to live in and grew up before I moved as a teenager. I also went to middle school there. 

Being 24, that was a long time ago. I drove past my old middle school and the memories of the days of having the best friends I ever had came flooding back to me. It was like I was seeing apparitions of the past on school grounds of me and the old group of friends getting up to our old shenanigan's for that period of time nearly every day for three years. I remember a time when being lonely wasn't something I ever felt and I thought that me and these people were going to conquer the world together. 

Well... best not to live in the past. After all, I didn't know I was making memories - I was just having fun. Oh, how time passes us by. I enjoyed my ride home. The radio was all weird.

I’ve always had trouble finding friends to chat and play with, especially maintaining those friendships. Over the course of 1 year I’ve been in 4-5 different groups and I never lasted two months in each of them.

The last group I was in was in was larger than the rest. The leader of the group mass invite people in there which caused a clash of personalities + a bunch of cliques and drama was created. I know that not everyone will like each other but I did want people and myself to be more intergraded with the group so I tried doing an game night and out of the 12 that agreed to join, there was only a turn out of 4 people which made the game night end quick due to the less amount of people playing the game. Also joined in other events in hopes of getting intergraded more. While I made some friends, it felt like no matter what I did and say, it would remain at an superficial level. 

The friends I had were dense and insensitive. They would say rude things like calling me stupid or dragging people down in playing raids. Then they wonder why I don’t ask them for help with the content. One of my friends saw my withdrawal at the group selfish, when I told them the problems I had they ignored it only to find out they did it to prove a point. Felt betrayed and I distanced myself more from the group. Seems like whenever I talked there wasn’t much activity until I was quiet and someone else was talking. I tried taking a break because the fight with the friend still made me upset. Came back and I still felt the same. This was the point in the group I felt like I was indirectly not wanted in there. What sealed the deal is when places and timezone was a topic. Someone mentioned they lived in the west part of somewhere and I genuinely didn’t know and they said “I told everyone this, guess you can’t help stupid :|”.

After that, just went numb. Went quiet after that for two days. Then I just left the alliance. After I left the same guy that said the comment to me posted a video meme. Nothing else, just that. Someone leaves the group and you sent in a meme. Wanted to tell the person off but if they didn’t message me to talk about the situation then it was probably not important to them. So I removed them off my friend list and to this day I haven’t heard anything from them or the rest of the group except for one guy who asked what happened. I’m grateful for the guy reach out to me even though we didn’t talk much in the group. But I can’t help feel they only did it out of pity cause I did make it clear to the group before that if I leave I would have no one else which is why I stayed in longer.

So once again I’m alone and I’m going to keep it that way. Just wanted to vent because I have no one else too.",lonely,Left my group of friends and no one except one person bat an eye when I did.,2021-07-08 16:26:23

The ease of effortlessly letting me go really opened my eyes to the fuck everyone but me mentality.

But I think shifting focus is the best thing .I wanted friends more than money , possessions , oxygen. The idea of a friend seems wonderful. You have their back, you have theirs . When they are emotional you support them . And when you are on the brink they have yours... Oh no they just pack their shit and head down fucking goodbye ave .

However, it seems that no one wanted to *really* be my friend or hang out with me. I am always either thought of last or forgotten about yet I put and give all of the respect to the other party. I always wonder if it's due to me being neurodivergent. However, it didn't bother me too much since that I'll be going to college in a different state, in a big city, and will be ""starting over.""

Well, as you can tell by the title, that is not going so well.

My college heavily pushes on everyone to be involved in clubs, network, and make friends. I feel like that advertising alienates a lot of people, particularly those with social anxiety or communication difficulties in general. In my case, it seems that whenever I try to make friends, they would communicate for a few weeks then disappear (but be active on other social media). Do I have an aura or smell that makes people repel me? (Think of that one episode of *Spongebob Squarepants* where everyone runs away from Spongebob because of his breath.) I don't feel that I have anyone to relate to or confide in that is in my age group. While I only get along with either the staff or college advisors, I can't really tell or joke about certain things to someone of an older generation, unfortunately. Everyone else in school feels more accomplished in life. I quit social media (which is like a sin in college) because the impostor syndrome got too strong. But it is not like anyone cares because no one has reached out to me in months. It seems that my high school problems have transferred over to college.

I can't confide in my family as I'm already seen as an outcast to them. Going on Reddit has helped soothe the pain of loneliness. Additionally, my art hobbies help keep my mind busy. However, as I will be returning back to campus soon, I'm just wondering how to deal with being a lonely adult again with no sign of things changing for me. It seems that I can figure out how to improve everything about myself except relationships: They will forever remain the most unpredictable, frustrating, and confusing things to me.

I’m tired of the same old person who talks for a day or so then never again. My sense of humor is sarcastic, crude, and dry. I drive and have my own place. I mostly like watching horror movies, going to graveyards late at night, breaking into abandoned buildings, hoodrat shit, reading books, making references to things no one understands, playing old school games like Super Mario World and Earthworm Jim. Pokemon is also something that I think is super cool. I have a dog and he's pretty chill, I also like reading and knowing interesting facts about the world we live in like that humans can only see and comprehend three colors, where butterflies can see six. I also like history a lot and I doodle which is cool.

3588,guygoingthroughlife,1625690510,1,"I’m 21 my life is a mess. I don’t do anything. Broke. Unemployed. No passion for anything - nothing i work on. I can’t relate to normal things people go through. For example ‘your high-school crush’ - I’ve never really had a real connection with anybody, my mind just plays tricks on me when I’m lonely thinking I need those people more than I actually do...
Haven’t had my ‘dog days’ you know the days that are supposedly spent having sex  - partying etc just overall the normality of such things i’ve hardly experienced. I did do a few of those things back in university but ever since I left - I only feel like I’ve been forgotten about by everyone I know. Haven’t seen my friends in months or even years. They make efforts to see me but I always cancel last minute due to my anxiety or just the state I’m in - I just don’t feel like I’m somebody you would want to be around. They are all living life - travelling. Then there’s me - haven’t bought clothes in over 3 years. Hiding a hair transplant secret I’ve kept for about 8 months now - I lost a lot of hair early on in my life - I was the only person in my ‘circle’ that had this issue - I could handle it before but it just got so bad to the point I could barely go outside if it required me to show my hair.   I live with my mother and rarely have my own personal space. I love her to death but feel like I won’t be able to thrive in life in such an environment. She’s an Angel - were struggling hard but she makes it seem like it’s nothing. There are days where life is just repetitive - I barely have anything to say and I know she’s lonely so I’m stuck in this constant cycle where I feel guilty I’m not talking to her enough - but then I feel I shouldn’t blame myself for such thing. She’s heavily depressed - one of those people who can smile and act like everything is fine then will eventually have her breakdown and what she and I call it - becomes ‘low’ for a couple of days, weeks or months even. I was in University before so I didn’t have to see too much of this  - this is basically the story of my life. When I was away she suffered. When I’m with her she suffered. She always wanted a ‘normal’ family and to be loved - I can love her the best I can as a Son - but I can’t be her lover and it pains me she may die alone. Sadly, the reason for her suffering is my father. I used to live with him years ago but without knowledge  - I didn’t know the main reason I stayed with him was because my mother was battling mental health issues and thus led me to think he only looked after me because he had to. My mother fought to raise the daughter they previously had with him and build a family but her dreams were crushed due to the actions of this man. Worst thing is I’ve spoke to my father without her knowledge and they both said there are lies to each story - this has led me to be highly paranoid and I genuinely feel there is no one I can trust. When I left to go university, my father never visited me - rarely called or would text me - never saw him - he got married to some woman and kind of just forgot about me. I don’t have any brothers,  just one sister but she’s been through hell - and as a result is very distant and I can’t expect her to be able to save me.  My sister and father also have no connection. He basically disowned her. I’m extremely scared for my future and scared I’ve wasted my life due to my inability to change my ways. I’ve always kind of been in a ‘daze’ - as I said I went to University, which was actually a university ranked highly in my country but even in school I could get good grades but never knew any direction my life was heading in - I just did what was expected to please my parents. I’ve always kind of been alone. I remember going to my friends houses and see the way they would talk to their siblings or just the difference between my family and there’s - it interests me, it’s almost as if I feel like a little kid. I wish I had this.

To top it off, I have ED due to a porn addiction I’ve developed over the years - this has led me to having embarrassing situations with girls. The first time I had sex I had taken a pill (Viagra) and even then could barely manage. I don’t want to do such a thing every-time I’m supposed to have sex but yet again it’s my fault. I feel like all the bad choices I’ve made have affected my life far too deep. To solve this problem it supposedly takes 6-8 months. By then I’ll be 22 this is the age people begin to start settling down - or are  building their careers or have begun looking for partners to start a family/settling down with - people are having kids that I know of. I’m so fucking scared I’ve completely fucked up and I won’t even have the time to fix it. My friends call me ‘gay’ and ‘weird’ and I know I can never expose such a secret.

But truth is I'm always caving in, always depressed, always at the verge of crying but I never show it. When I'm in public I try to smile so no one won't ask what's wrong with me, that why I'm introverted now I guess. At least it's one of the reasons.  When they do ask and I vent a little.... Not even telling half of the mental burdens I have, I'm told to just smile, there's nothing to be sad about, etc. Like that helps..

I over think, ramble sometimes... But my mind circles. And when I think of past traumas, something hurtful or negative a loved one did or said...for example... I am dragged into hours of stiffening depression, feeling unmotivated, and sometimes vividly indulging the thought of suicide. I don't go most days without crying, sometimes it's so bad that tears just flow for hours uncontrollably. I legit don't want this, I wish I could be normal and happy, wish I could be like other people who don't know what depression feels like, wish I didnt cry so often.

I've had people come into my life before and said theyre here for the ride or that they want to be my ""bestfriend"" but that never lasts, they always go. And it's hard because I don't think I can control my emotions, I either don't care about someone or I'm all in and would do anything to make them happy, that's lead to the trail of heart breaks I have in my past.

briefly about my person. I am male, 17 years old, from Europe and still go to school. 
Currently are summer vacations, which is usually something positive for a student.
But tbh and as expected, day by day I slip more and more into loneliness, sorrow and sadness…

It's really hard to describe, but I just feel weak and extremely sad.

I have one friend that I hang out with from time to time. But we are so different persons that its sometimes really uncomfortable for me and I prefer to stay alone instead of meeting him…

Otherwise, I get along well with a few boys from my class, but there's never anything going on. In general, I'm rather a shy person and I think for the most people just uninteresting and boring, and therefore hardly anyone wants to have something to do with me..

My parents go on vacation for two weeks and I stay at home, alone. So I spend two weeks probably almost completely alone and bored...

I do sports every day (workouts), that gives me strength and somehow a motivation. But otherwise nothing is going on. I do work in a supermarket twice a week, but that's also only on 2/7 days....


I really need advice...

I ask Him that if He won’t take my suffering than to just get me through another day. He does! Somehow, something works out. It’s not about chanting repeated words, He wants to hear YOU!

3618,AnnualSmell,1625679379,1,"\[20M\]

I've struggled to create and maintain any form of friendship/relationship all of my life. Living through my childhood was a pain in the ass but I don't let it define me. I've had to learn to deal with everything on my own because every cry for help has lead me nowhere. And I don't consider having things be this way to be a negative mindset. This has only made me stronger and built my character.

Lately though I have felt even more alone. Seems as if nothing is really 'falling into place' for me even when I believe I've done everything right up to this point. I don't have people that I can rely on. I don't have people I can really talk to. I don't have people to call when I am in need. This is frustrating. I feel so alone. But there is nothing I can do but keep pushing forward.

Living like this is tough. I remain closed off in my life because I'm afraid of being hurt/left by others. I don't want to open up and rarely ever leave my room. Sometimes I ask what is wrong with me? What am I doing wrong? But I really don't feel that I have done anything wrong or that there is something wrong with me.

Sometimes I wish there was someone I could rely on but that isn't really realistic. And maybe I don't even need that to live/survive. I fear any kind of further abandonment and at the end of the day only I have always been there for myself.",lonely,Alone Forever,2021-07-08 03:36:19

3637,Weirdhipster294,1625662040,1,"I actually don't know where to start. When i was 6 years old, i was climbing down the stairs of the school and then meet my parents.
Suddenly, a bunch of kids came rushing down the stairs and pushing me down with them along the stairs. That has caused several bone fractures and i was nearly paralyzed if it weren't for some surgeries.
But unfortunately, the accident made me limp a bit and because of that, i needed help from people to climb stairs for example.
Nonetheless, thank god i can still walk! Not as normal as anyone Would but with only few limps.
The accident had turned my life upside down, people started moking me, classmates especially. It started in high school and continued in college now. Now, im being treated like a handicapped. My whole life,
i was a loner and i didn't have any friends. I am an outcast. My classmates seemed to have their own groups in class and i am always left out. They organized events and get togethers without me knowing.... If I'm lucky, i would see the pictures on Facebook or Instagram. I tried making friends but i always get rejected because i was perceived as a liability (since sometimes i need help with stairs or walking on pavements). And it hurts so much feeling this way. At one occasion, i thought i had 2 friends whom i can count on,eventually. They showed me their true colors and i realized they only used me because i was the smart guy in class. In terms of relationships, the situation is worse, i'be never hada girlfriend or gone on a date. it was either unrequited love or flat out rejection. And this is mainly because of the accident i got into when i was young. I was
even looked down upon and ignored via texts and in person because of this too.
So I'm literally cracking from the inside, i see people accomplishing so much and i'm not getting even closer to what they have. I see people
having fun playing sports whilei sit there alone because i can't play collective sports (like football, basketball etc..) and it hurts so much,
how people treat you like you're not human, like you're a freak or something just because you look different and you think differently.
These feelings are affecting me. I'm actually thinking of giving up.
I like video games so much. So sometimes i stream on Nimo TV. But i get so many hurtful comments like "" your gaming sucks dude! Go suck a Dick "" (apologies for the words that's just one out of many Comments that i receive daily).Everything i do is not appreciated. I'm feeling worthless, unwanted and unworthy of anything in this life.
Sometimes, i even wonder why am i here ?..
In my case, im an introvert, INFJ-A to be exact, i dont have a social life and my love life is non-existent. I've never kissed a girl or had sex with one tbh. It's seems embarrassing to me because people my age have experience, like at least they had one relationship at a certain point in
their lives. I'm 25 and i'm a virgin XD. I'm making it sound funny but the thought of me staying alone /lonely is constantly haunting me. Girls or at least women (cuz girls sound a little bit immature) dont like me romantically. I've never beena close friend to a girl to be honest XD.
Also, I'm not looking for one-night stands, but more of a serious relationship with a future (family, kids, house, job, car that sort of stuff). Ive never tried online dating because i know my chances are slim competing with other men who are athletic and who drive fancy cars... Girls don't date nerds and geeks like me...
As for friendships, it's a dead end. I was used and betrayed because i was the smart guy in class so people come to me when they need help solving the exercise on page 73 from book A and notes and summaries for chapters or exams...

What pushed me to the edge are 3 incidents:
1-The fact that i never get texts from anyone. I always check up on people and try to see how they are doing but in the end, nobody cares if i disappear or die..

2-3 years ago, i met a girl in class whomi had a crush on, tried getting to know her, invited her out she accepted once and then she started declining. After 2 years of being friends and classmates, i decided to confess, so i had written a long text to her telling her how i felt and ended up with a harsh rejection. She literally said :I can't accept you
because you have a problem with your left leg. My parents wont accept you either. At that moment, i was crushed.

3-Last year, also a girl i met in class and whom i had a crush on,a fellow introvert, we started talking on WhatsApp first, then she suddenly stopped talking to me. What's worse is that she started ignoring me in person. I didn't try to know why but her behaviour made me feel worthless.
This has been affecting my self-esteem and my confidence to the point that i feel like giving up all together.

This isn't because I want to, but because I feel like I need to. The anxiety, self-hate and a bunch more I can't put into words just get overwhelming so I end up dropping them.

**VENT START** 

About a year ago after I had kept trying to reach out to people but just ended up dropping them, I told myself ""I won't reach out to anyone until I can fix my problems"". Enough was enough, I had hurt people I cared for, and who cared for me, and I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just wanted a friend.

Fast forward to now and I'm even worse off. I'm better off overall as I've been focusing on my hobbies, myself, and getting myself forward in life, but I haven't been able to make friends. I'm always so anxious, my confidence is non-existent and my social capabilities have gotten so bad. To send an SMS I proofread it like 10 times, keep editing it, and when 10 minutes has passed I've sent a SMS saying like ""Hi, did you want an ice cream or hamburger?""

I can't even walk to the fucking store anymore without fixing my hair, brushing my teeth, makeup, trying like 3 different outfits, and then deciding on a pair of jeans and hoodie, whilst being an anxious wreck.

I wouldn't mind being friendless if it wouldn't impact me like it does. I just want someone I can spill my heart out to when I need to, but also laugh with when I need to like a normal fucking person. No, instead I'm inside my house 24 hours a day. Maybe taking a morning stroll some days.

**VENT END**

**QUESTION**

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how tf do you make friends without leaving them? With or without an explanation given to them. I got everything down on how to make friends, but how can I stop leaving them? Friends are what will build my confidence and build me up in general, but it won't be worth reaching out to anyone if I'll just hurt them in the end.

A month ago I came home from uni to spend the holiday at my parents’ house. They live far away from my friends, so I was (and still am) feeling very lonely and isolated. 

One night I decided to make a reddit account to talk to people online. I ended up on r/sex and from there I got to NSFW reddit. I was fascinated. Girls were posting nudes and instantly getting hundreds of upvotes and comments. Wanting what they had, I took a pic of myself without showing my face and posted it. It was a big success. All day I felt happy and self-confident because of the many upvotes and compliments I had received. 

The following week I posted photos which were more and more explicit. The comments and messages I got made me feel special and desired. I also felt a sense of control that I never had in real life: I could post whatever I wanted to, whenever I wanted to. It was great! 

I started “befriending” some of the (mainly) men who messaged me. I spent a lot of time answering them at night. Often they would ask me to send videos of myself on kik and snapchat. I wanted to make them happy, so I did.

At first I enjoyed the attention, but these past few weeks I have started to feel a pressure to answer messages and post pics even when I don’t feel like it. If I leave someone hanging or ignore them I feel extremely guilty. As the person who posted the pics that made them aroused, I feel like it is my responsibility to get them off. 

At the same time, I’m receiving truly horrible messages on everything from reddit to snapchat to kik. A lot of it is degrading i.e. telling me that I am worthless, desparate etc. unless I send more pics and videos. I also receive a huge amount of rape threats.

I know I brought it on myself, but it’s all making me feel even more sad and lonely. And I STILL feel bad if I don’t reply: I have to please people and make them happy, otherwise I’m a bad person who deserves bad things.

Im confused and angry. My whole life(19/m) i waited to finish high school so i can get a job and finnaly start making music. High school was empty and painfull... didnt really make a lot of friends i barely went outside of the house and all the classic high school experiences(girls, drugs, or just generraly doing stupid stuff like idk going into an abandoned house at midnight) never happend cuz i was busy trying to survive high school, so every weekend i closed the door and wrote songs or played games, and every weekday i was staying up late doing the same trying to make the most out of a day.

My stepdad was abusive and was addicted to gambleing. He could put on all of our money on the 20th on a soccer match and if he lost we ate bread by itself for the rest of the month and he was bullying /beating me cuz it was my fault that he lost cuz i bring in negative energy. 
This got to the point where i was kicked out and had to live at my grandparents..

I could look past these things cuz i was writing music but the past few months i barely write anything decent. I got so tired of writing about the same stuff of me feeling empty, lonely, anexous depressed.. when i dont write i feel worthless and if i write bad songs i feel stupid and talentless.. I realised having almost no experiences wont help my writing process so i started looking for a job where i can meet with new people.. but every job iv found is almost as depressing as high school... (12hour shifts, 4times a week and i will still be bymyself without a collague or anything)
im slowly giving up, i barely sleep im fighting with brain fog everyday and it seems so pointless because i realise it will never get better. I havent felt love, or just good in so long im afraid ill never will. Nothings going for me(not a job, i dont have hobbies other then writing, i dont have good friends or realtionships) dont even try anymore. I spend my time with playing nostalgic songs and nostalgic games but it just makes me sad that the kid i once was with full of energy and dreams is getting faded in the weekdays..
Im sorry for posting this but talking to family isnt an option my friends are meh and i tried therapy but it was just me paying money so a doctor can give me drugs i can pay even more money for..

3646,BritThrowawayTT,1625655592,1," 

Hello, I am an avid user of Reddit; I have created this account to open up. It should be noted the title is not 100% true, only 9 of my flatmates are in a relationship while the remaining two have been single for a couple of months, at most, but they are already 'talking' to people.

So I am a 20-year-old male, who is currently at UNI. And I am writing this because I feel lonely.

I am/was the type of person who is content about being single, I never sought out a relationship, I have flirted before, but I haven't tried to cement anything further. I am not bad looking guy, I go to the gym, tall, and a relatively pretty face. Looks are not my barrier but my personality is. Like many insecure guys, I put on an 'act' of self-love -which is true sometimes- I look at my reflection when walking down the street and I give myself compliments, this usually in front of my friends, they know I am not being serious, I've been voted most fake but also potentially most successful in the house. This way of life has faired me pretty well, but recently I just want to wake up next to someone, have someone to cuddle, to listen to (one of my strong suits), and watch films and documentaries with. I currently do this now with my flat, apart from the cuddling part but that depends on the temperature but I am starting to feel like a third wheel or you could say the eleventh wheel. I have a problem about opening up about my life to my flat and I keep my groups separate as possible, I would never bring people over and I will avoid my flat ever meeting my parents (they aren't bad people, I am just insecure.) I told them I don't think I could introduce them to my GF, if I ever had one to them. I had similar issues in College, girls would ask for my number and I would find excuses to say no, I joke about my 'goal is to be single throughout the whole of my education' but this is sadly coming to a sad truth. I also have the issue with keeping in touch, once I leave an institution, I rarely talk to people afterwards, I was also voted most likely to never get in touch after uni. I am not an introvert though, I love conversations about various topics and I enjoy listening to people and about their lives and their relationships but I don't think I could share that kind of information about my relationship. I honestly just think I am jealous, as the majority of the time I am fine and happy, but I have random bursts of feeling lonely and this has become more frequent. I've planned to travel with one of my single flatmates and a couple but I am scared that the single one will get into a relationship and invite the gf/bf and as a result, I would rather solo travel than be a fifth wheel when traveling. My biggest issue is that I am saying all this but it is not like I am trying to court someone, I have these bursts of loneliness and then move on. I am terrified of introducing someone and then my flat (they wouldn't) saying something or if the relationship ends and they ask the question ""whatever happened to X?"" I come home and my parents ask me ""have you got GF yet?"" and then say ""you wouldn't tell us if you did"" and this is absolutely true. I am scared of getting in a relationship with someone for the sake of it, I have mood swings and therefore, at a whim, I could decide 'I am bored' and end it. I don't want to hurt other people but I also don't want to be a 'bachelor' for the next couple of years or do I, I really don't know. I am just immature but wouldn't it be better to make the mistakes young rather than older when there could be real consequences?

This is how I see a tiny portion of myself, if you ask my friends they would have a different conclusion and reasons.

TLDR: an insecure dude, who doesn't know what he wants but is starting to feel lonely, as the people he knows become a part of relationships.

Probably because I ask myself why I am doing it and come up with no real good answer.. but in truth the answer is of course loneliness. Missing human connection, like so many others, especially through the pandemic. 
It’s starts at the pit of my stomach and wakes me up from sleep in my chest. I know where it has stemmed from, I’ve recently cut ties with someone who I’ve shared a complicated relationship with for 7 years. She was my fiancé, the love of my life. But there were mistakes on both sides, and we could never get back what was lost. I made the decision to step away as the relationship was causing me to lose sight of myself, any love for myself and I felt that I had no self worth. Even though I know there was no happiness only discomfort and anxiety for me at the end, why I now think of her and what I miss.. I hate that. I know it’s always the way. I genuinely feel that I will never meet someone again, because I have completely shut down to everyone. I try to seek joy and happiness but all I feel is numb. So this morning I decided I would let a little of this thought go into the internet ether..

I did it again. Today I jumped at the opportunity to hang out with my female coworker after work because i’ve been craving human conversation and connection. 

I should’ve known better. The entire time was spent talking about her, and her problems, and her boy drama, and her friendship drama, and her showing me picture after picture of her last Vegas trip with her girlfriends and me replying with “omg you look so pretty! you guys look like you had such a good time! omg!” 

I don’t give a shit. She never asks about me, I should know better. And whenever I do try to talk about what’s going on with me, she’s too busy on snapchat or instagram to even pretend to listen. And then when she interrupts me she’ll blame it on her “ADHD.” 

I have fucking ADD myself. I don’t use it as an excuse to be rude, self centered and inconsiderate. 

What really sent me over the edge was that we got dinner and when we were asked whether we’d split the check, I said yes. I was so proud of myself because normally I offer to pay and nobody ever minds or even offers as well. This time I said let’s split the bill. But then the waitress gave us one check. And I put down my card, thinking she would too. Nope. When I got the message, I awkwardly said “that’s okay, I got it girl.” 

Then we went out to dessert. Her idea. When the time came to pay, she has the audacity to be like “you got me this time right girl? I got it next time!” 

She never has it next time. I reluctantly paid and smiled and tried to enjoy the rest of my time, secretly boiling on the inside. 

I spent $100 on eating out that I had not planned on. $100 might seem like nothing but I have a budget, I have bills to pay, I live on my own and money is so tight these days. She has no rent to pay, lives with her mom and she makes MORE money than me. She knows damn well how much I struggle and STILL never feels bad about allowing me to pay. 

I’m so fucking sick of this. It’s not just her. Anyone that ever wants to hang out with me, I always end up paying for their time for one reason or another. Nobody ever offers to pay or at the very least split it. And if i’m paying, can you at least pretend to be my friend?? Pretend to show interest in my life and my feelings?

3667,AzraKasm,1625640268,1,"My childhood was filled with friends. I went to a small private school where everyone basically knew eachother. It was a nice time in my life looking forward to playing with my friends and talking about the latest episode of whatever show we were into at the time. I always had someone to talk to or play with even if I didn't know them all that well. Growing up I've always heard stories of people's experiences with fake friends. It sounded so ridiculous to me that someone would so stereotypical about being a shitty person. Like talking shit behind someone's back? People actually do that? It sounded so stupid to me like a thing only cartoon characters would do. I never had any enemies or people I couldn't stand just friends. I never thought the people I considered friends would do anything like that. They were my pals and they saw me the exact same way, right? A year before highschool the person I saw as my best friend did a complete 180° and made fun of me in front of a girl he liked. It came out of nowhere, he was so blatant and cruel with his words he even mentioned things I told him in secret. I was shocked and on the verge of tears it was like the 6 years I've known him for didn't even matter to him. All this over a girl? Our friendship didn't last long after that but I was more broken over it than he was. He was with a different group of guys before the year even ended. I never saw him after that school year. Highschool was no different. It hurts especially when the guys you thought would be your friends for life don't even have to courtesy to acknowledge you in the slightest anymore. I'm nothing but an afterthought to them I truly thought I met some genuine people that I could relate to but I'm just ""that guy we hung out with in highschool"" to them now. I'm just feeling sorry for myself at this point but I can't help but think back to when I was a child and so naive to think people weren't as disingenuous as characters from a Disney Channel show. Is it selfish to want your friends to atleast message you back? To atleast show some concern for your well being?

I used to stalk her profile on weekly basis since two years and last March, I confessed her my feelings through a manifestation letter. The manifestation letter was so good that eventually she became interested in me and contacted me to know me better. Knowing the fact that I was her teacher's son and was a talented student, she asked me all my personal information. We became really close and communicated with each other on regular basis via video messaging in Instagram and in first week of April, she said she wanted to be in relationship with me. I hadn't excepted it (as she was my crush) and happily accepted. We wanted to meet non-virtually but due to Covid crisis, we couldn't. She was also interested in abroad studies and asked me everything about the US undergrad studies. Our house recently got hit by a Covid crisis and we lost our grandfather and she uplifted me during those times too.Everything was going good until last 15 days, after which she behaved indifferent and said that she used to like me although I should expect nothing from the future. She said she would be applying to Australia as soon as covid restrictions got over and insisted that we both should know we won't be together. I desperately wanted to talk to her by meeting so I requested for a date. She dismissed that by saying she was busy in households and would think about it later. Since last week, she started to text one word straight forward answers and being aware of the fact, I requested that we should meet in 2-3 days. She ignored my request and I couldn't help it. So, exactly 3 days ago, I requested her that we should just become good friends (informal breakup) and we would be talking in Viber. She accepted that and said she couldn't deny the fact she liked me, so we should keep talking as good friends. The day before yesterday right one day after the breakup, she contacted me in Viber and talked a lot about my father's surgery ( which happened recently) but yesterday once again she ignored my messages.

But fuck is it hard not to think about how much I fucked up a good thing because I was young and didn't understand love was more than just a chemical attraction.

I've also lost my friend groups into adulthood by never reaching out to them. We used to play games together weekly, then no they, then we stopped talking, then I never made new friends. Now I spend days never talking to anybody. My emotions are all over the place, I'll occupy myself and be happy but the second I stop and have free time I get anxiety from not having an intimate emotional partner, I panic from having friends to chat about my day with, I get anxious thinking about how hard it is to find those things and I'm scared of feeling like I only meet new people to replace the ones I lost.

I rent out my house to help pay for the mortgage. I have one long time tenant and one that just moved in very recently. I'm on friendly terms with the long term tenant, but I've never tried to be too friendly as I feel at the end of the day it's still a business relationship. However, once the new guy moved in, we all started hanging out together more. We'd watch movies together, eat together, go shopping together, etc. 

Recently I've noticed that the 2 tenants are hanging out together almost every day, and I feel left out as they'd go out for drinks or hang out together without inviting me. I invited both to watch a movie together, to which they agreed, then later was rejected as they had a change of plans and decided to go downtown for drinks without offering to invite me. I feel like I brought this on myself by keeping tenants at an arms length. What can I really do at this point? They're both great tenants but every time they hang out without me, it feels terrible.

im 17, havent had a single real friend, and lived with my parents my entire life, we live in the country basically in the middle of nowhere. for the past year and a half ive only left my house a few times to go out and get things because my mom is immuno comprimised. she tries to homeschool me, but she doesnt do it much on account of her being ill a lot of the time.

the only life i have is online, and i sit on discord looking at everything and i realize i really do have nothing socially. i cant even talk to the online friends i do have because if my parents knew i was talking to anyone else they'd freak the hell out. tpying that out i realize how toxic that sounds, and maybe it is, but part of me cant blame them. they grew up abused and neglected, generally shit childhoods.

i want to leave this house. i hate saying it because its privledged as fuck probably but i hate this house so much. i sometimes feel like i'll never leave here, i dont even care where i go i just want to go somewhere new. i want to see anything new at this point or meet new people, or even just talk to my online friends with my actual voice. i want to actually learn things and shit, even if i'll be a socially awkward sperg who can barely do shit. its better than wasting my time playing the same few games over and over again.

But they made a lot of mistakes, and I got mad about what happened, and eventually they stopped liking me because of my attitude. (I reacted fairly, tbh.)

Unfortunately, my feelings didn't go away and I was planning to meet up with them once travelling is safe again.

So I made my feelings clear and asked them to DTR so that we would be a couple, but they rejected me and said they only think of me as a buddy now. 

They still want to talk to me as a friend, but they are out there being a simp and hitting on bartenders and stuff (who only pretend to like people for the tips; I mean, I was in their shoes, I know the game). 

It hurts me and maybe this person wasn't smart enough for me to ""like"" anyway if they would spend their time on people who only want cash.

I need to get over them, but I have literally no one else to talk to. They were my best friend and the person I would go to to talk about everything. (They treated me that way too.)

I hate online dating now, but should I try to meet new people online? Should I do this to at least make me feel like there's possibly more people out there whom I might like? 

Or is that being co-dependent? Should I just sit at home alone every evening after work and talk to nobody? Would it be more ""character-building"" on my part to just watch TV after work, stay away from people, then go to bed and focus on work the next day until I'm off again?

I saw him over the timespan of 6 months, where he simultaniously saw 5 other girls. I asked him to end it with the others when I found out, and he did. We had a good months before i found out he had found someone New during that time. I wanted to be more which surprised me very much and I realised I had fallen for him. He ended it when I told him and said he didn't want anything serious. I was deadly broken for about Half a year. Maybe also because he now had a very serious relationship with that New girl.

I have tried staying friends with him, because he says he want to still be friends (though he never really am a friend back). So friendship is not going to good.

I have tried to figurer out why it's not working out, and now that we rarely to never see/talk to eachother I have realised that I still love him. Every time im on a date or with someone all I think of is him and how much I wish he were there instead. I feel so weak and pathetic for still having Hope and being so in love with him after all this time AMD with everything that is happening.

Is there any way out of this. I really don't want to be alone anymore and hate the person im becoming.

Graduated. Got a job. Hard time making friends. Pandemic hits, I'm the only one in the office for ""safety reasons"" (meaning I worked the coverage shift for the datacenter and HAD to stay on-site while everyone else got to work from home for a full year).

My grandma passed. I moved out. My brother got a girlfriend and though he lives with me, he's never around, never talks to me, plays Destiny with me for like a few hours randomly when I can manage to stay awake long enough to be up when he gets home. 

I have my mom, and I have some friends online. But I can't be with those friends. I have panic attacks if I even try to get into a voice chat with them. Text is fine, but it means I go days without even opening my mouth to speak. My mom loves me and I love her, but a 26 year old man can't spend all of his time with his mom.

I feel that because of this loneliness I wasted my youth and I never got to have any of the typical teenage experiences.  

I think that it's at the start of the pandemic that being lonely started to bother me a lot more and it lead to multiple realizations. While I thought that I had a few friends, the pandemic made me realize how fucking wrong I was. Those people that I considered friends weren't real friends, but just ""school friends"", people that would reach out to me whenever they needed some answer or help for an assignment. I would never hear from them until the start of classes and never did they reach out for something unrelated to school. Furthermore, it was recently my birthday and of course I spent it alone. This year especially, I was hopping to receive the traditional ""happy birthday!"" text, but only one person bothered to take 30 seconds out of his day to do so. The worst of it is that people reach out to me the next day about school stuff. Also, I realized that I was always the one reaching out to people and ever since I stopped, my phone also stopped buzzing. Nonetheless, I still constantly check my phone hoping that someone texted me. 

This summer I've been going on walks and bike rides throughout my city trying to be more active, but whenever I go I can't stop to secretly hope that I meet someone with who I can talk and I find this so pathetic.  

I really want to fill this void of human contact and have more friends because I truly think that if I can't share anything with someone else and just live inside my own bubble, then life starts to loose it's importance. 

By the way, I've been working in a store for nearly a month now and I've been talking to this girl with who I sometimes work (I don't always see her). I actually really like her company and I was thinking of asking her to meet outside of work, but I'm afraid that if she says ""no"", it will make things worse at work and I'be even more isolated.

(23F) I have just finished my pgce / qualified as a primary school teacher and I should be happy (which I am I love being a teacher) but life right now is so stressful. I finished my course about two weeks ago and all of a sudden my bank account has dropped and my tenancy is ending soon and I just don’t know what i’m going to do. I am being cleared for supply work which is taking forever as I am waiting for a dbs and i’m worried with the summer holidays coming up…… so in other words I feel very lonely (on top of the stress of figuring this out). Life is very repetitive right now, I feel I don’t have anybody to talk to or open up to. I haven’t had a group of friends for a few years now, I have had people in my life who I considered a friend but they always had their own friend group they would do things with. I see groups of friends and it makes me sad that I don’t have that, there are people I talk to here and there, but not like proper close friends, which I did have when I was a teenager and I miss that. Making friends as an adult is hard. I always found it difficult at uni because people always had other friends groups, I was shy growing up, but honestly I do feel I have come out of my shell since teaching, there simply is just limited opportunities as an adult to meet and get to know new people. Its hard to not be negative about life right now when everything is against me - financially, my flat, idk what is going to happen. All I want is to have a stable income and a nice home and preferably people to talk to. These last few weeks have been hard to feel motivated, mentally I am not feeling good. I have no motivation to do basic household duties, I just don’t feel happy. Nobody gets it, nobody understands how i’m feeling. I really need to get back into my routine of teaching because its the one thing in my life that I have which makes me happy, but the job scene is so hard right now.

I have been really struggling with a 4 year long relationship that just ended because I caught her cheating with one of the guys who lives with us (who also has a gf still, even after I came forward and told her...). My (now) ex was also physically and verbally abusive, and I am now stuck in the apartment that we rented together with her and the guy she cheated with. I don't have any family or friends in the country, or I would have explored that option, but now I'm stuck with them. Every day, I feel like there is no one out there for me in the form of friends or a potential partner, and I've been feeling so deeply alone. 

I work 9-5 and commute a total of 4 hours every day on top of that. I have a dog (a sweet little Shelty) who I love more than anything, and she's really the only thing other than work that gets me out of bed every day, but I feel like it isn't enough.. I don't know how to make friends with people anymore, and I feel extremely jaded about love and relationships now even though my whole life I have dreamt of being a better husband and father than my (absent) dad. I would just really love to connect with someone and shake away this nagging loneliness. Maybe someone has some insights that would help me view this situation differently?

3744,DelawareMountains,1625607107,1,"My childhood was so very lonely, I had few friends and no actually close friends. My parents never tried to connect with me, my sister and I didn't get along, and the rest of my family lived too far away to really be in my life. People loved me (well, my parents did) but there was no one I felt close to and that I could trust. 

It wasn't until I was 17 that I first loved someone, she was my highschool sweetheart and we understood each other so well. After a few years we broke up because we just didn't work as a couple, but we ended up being best friends after that so my love for them didn't go away it just changed. That lasted until a few years ago until she found her own girlfriend, and after she moved out of state to be with her she cut contact with just about everyone else, me included. I didn't know this for months, until I messaged her on Facebook (she had changed her number without letting me know) and she blocked me. I wanted to come out to her, to share this revelation I had about myself, but clearly she wouldn't have cared.

The next two people I'm not even really sure if I actually loved them. They were my roommates, one of them was my (adoptive) brother, he didn't grow up with me but I felt very close to him as I grew older. They both supported me in a way that almost no one had before, and while they weren't perfect they were my best friends. But things changed as I started discovering who I was, who I really wanted to be, because they didn't like the person I became. They were always closer with each other than either of them were to me, and when we started fighting they sided with each other and tried to shut down my opinions. I couldn't live there anymore, so I left to go live with my partner, and after that what was left of our friendship just unraveled until they stopped speaking to me.

Then there's the last person I know I loved, the partner I moved in with to get away from my closest friends. I was absolutely smitten over them, and they loved me too, but they never trusted me. Our fourth breakup, when we called off our engagement, was the beginning of everything between us turning sour. Our fights got worse and more frequent, they would be mean to me for days on end, it became common for them to verbally abuse me until I cried. We tried to get back together multiple times, and some things did get better each time, but every time we got back together they cared for me less and treated me worse. Eventually they had done so much to me I felt scared to spend time with them, so I had no choice but to stop trusting them and to cut them out of my life. 

By that point I hadn't loved them for months, they said they loved me but I don't think they ever actually loved me as who I am, instead they loved a made up version of me that they wanted to make reality. And they really did try: so many times they punished me for being emotional because they wanted someone stoic, so many times they forced me to take them out because they wanted a social butterfly, and they always chose what we did together because they hated my ideas of fun. I wasn't the person they wanted me to be, and I wasn't even the person they thought I was. They thought of me as a liar, as an idiot, and as a psychopath who liked to start fights. There was only one thing they thought about me that was true: that I was a crybaby, and I am but I never knew how to tell them that they were the reason I cried 9 times out of 10.

After all the awful things they did to me they still thought I was the bad one, and that it was my fault our relationship fell apart; they refused to believe the truth, that they had abused me and destroyed our relationship. But despite what they did to me I still think they're a good person, so many terrible things have happened to them and now they're scared to let anyone in, and I just want them to get better. Their history doesn't excuse their actions towards me, but I still care about them and would never wish harm on them.

Now that my ex is out of my life I have no loves left. I have more friends than ever and I'm grateful, I'm dating more people than ever and that's wonderful, but I have no one that I truly feel I can rely on. I spend most of my days alone at my parents house, and while it's a nice break from the forced sociality with my ex it's still crushing me slowly. I feel better but my depression is getting worse, I share my feelings with my friends but there's no one I feel I can be vulnerable with. 

In the end I know I will survive, this is not the first time I've been loveless and I've survived before, but what is it worth if I don't have someone to love and trust? There's nothing more valuable to me than genuine human connection, but I've always felt so disconnected from those around me. I'm trying to find people to love but it's a slow process and my past has made me wary of others and even love in general. I know I can't give up, but I'm so tired. I just want someone there for me, someone who understands my struggles and will catch me when I fall, someone I can open up to who will hold me while I cry. Someone to love, that's what I want, but it's so hard to find someone like that.

That's it really. Guess I'm just venting about all this, there's no advice left that can help me change things. Support would be nice, but the good feeling from that is fleeting, and after it's gone it feels like I'm back on my own. So say whatever is on your mind I suppose, a conversation is more worthwhile than most of what I have now. Thank you for reading this and giving me your time, even if you don't say anything it's still a nice gesture just to have me in your thoughts. And I hope that you'll be okay too, we're all going through so much, you deserve to be happy and I wish the best for you.",lonely,"I've only ever loved a handful of people, in any way, and they're all gone now",2021-07-07 07:31:47

All the other girls are so pretty, they get hit on constantly and most of them have loving, attractive boyfriends. I never had a romantic relationship, no guy has ever wanted to be with me, even not so attractive ones, im too ugly for this it seems like. Im thin, flat chested and I have a plain child like face, so im only good enough for hook ups but nothing more serious. 
 
  Tbh I was getting so envious of other girls in the group that it significantly lowered my self esteem. I didnt want to bring toxic energy, so I ghosted them and for 4 years I hardly left my house, didnt go to a single party, event or meeting since then. Its sad bc I did work on myself to be a person who is interesting and fun to talk to, but I still feel like no matter what, people will always be more interested in getting to know someone who is more attractive and its heart breaking to me. I know, this is how the world works and I cant do anything about it. Im so jealous and scared that I will always be alone, with no partner or friends.

  When I was younger I was prettier but still no one was interested in me. Im now in my late 20s and i think its my last chance to have some fun before my youth ends, but I think im going to waste it because of my insecurities.

3762,LostKitten1133,1625598005,1,"So I have a friend, a friend of two years, probably my closest and only friend right now. We were like peas in a pod. We would tell eachother everything, I would comfort her when things got bad, emotionally supported her when her family and school brought her down. And she comforted me after my boyfriend left me.

But recently we haven’t been talking much. Mainly I would message her, and we would message for awhile then all of a sudden she wouldn’t reply back. I guessed she was busy, she had school, a new boyfriend, other friends. But still.. there was a nagging feeling in my mind that she just didn’t want to talk to me. So I decided to give myself a cool down period. Decided not to talk to her for a few months, then see what happens. It’s been 20 days now, and she hasn’t messaged me back. This was our last conversation.

Me: Made lemon slice, but the icing was a little too... runny

Her: Ou yummy

Me: Thanks uwu

How have you been btw

Her: Miserable

I made tiramisu tho

Me: Ooh nice

I didn’t respond to her saying she was miserable. Because everytime I did, previously for the last of June and May, she would try to push the subject away, or insisted that she didn’t want to talk about it. I thought about it a lot. And maybe it had something to do with a little vent I had with her about how I felt life was purposeless. Perhaps she felt like that was reason not to use me as her emotional bedrock. 

Or maybe I’m overreacting. Last year we barely talked at all, only like once a month or something. I still supported her, but I wasn’t that close to her. Last summer the relationship developed where we basically shared everything with eachother. It felt warm and comforting to be with her. Now it just feels kinda cold. I don’t know what’s happened, but I almost just feel like it would be better to continue my months of silence until I don’t feel any pain just from the thought of her name. But I don’t wanna stop caring about her, because she’s amazing. But I must. I can’t bare the thought of losing another close friendship. Everyone just seems to leave me.

Because Love was never made in fear. 


Fear is a trap that can hold the keys. It’s always creeps and always feeds. It can make us feel lonely…sad and afraid. It preys on our spirits on our darkest days. Fear loves to cling to whatever is pure. It fights in the midst of all we must endure. Fear is never patient and never kind. It tries to surround us with darkness in our minds. Fear is the foe that waits and sees. And it attacks us in our very time of need. Fear an enemy to love, because love is true. So it tries to break us and tell us love won’t see us through. Fear is always afraid to be seen in the light. So it runs and it hides within us on the darkest of nights. But when we Choose to call out fear as it really is…it steadily begins to lift and let more sun light in. Love over fear? The two don’t even compare. For real love always wins…always saves. And is always right there. If you don’t feel it near? That’s ok. It will still hold you close😊💕. For love will always find us…no matter how much we lost hope. Words of Love and kindness will always see us through. If you need a listening ear? Call on me and I will come to you.💕

Time and again, I've seen people on this sub (and similar subs) post about anxiety related to loneliness arising partly from an intense FOMO. You might've been a socially active person or weren't one at all but it's totally real feeling like you're being left out of all the good shit happening around. Maybe it's due to your lifestyle, maybe due to the type of people around but mostly because you're overthinking about all the possibilities you're not a part of. Sorry, inter-dimensional travel is still fiction. You can't be part of two realities at the same time but you can be the best part of the reality you choose. All you have to do is make a choice and believe that it's the best one possible and nothing else would seem to fit at that moment. If you were doing something else, you wouldn't have been able to participate in whatever you're doing rn, doesn't matter which option seems more interesting or appropriate in retrospect. So, go on, pick a card, take a road, choose a flavour and own it, instead of dreading about where else you could've been, who else you could've met or what else you could've done. What's happened is happened, but the next step is still yours. The only thing you need to stop worrying about that which could've been is accepting that which is.

I do have autism, which fucking frustrates me. How easily so many other people don't know they have it when it comes to basic social interaction. People are starting to treat me differently because the days are becoming blurs and im watching as my face and body change, how it burns on the surface of my skin and how it's becoming more and more man-like, how my facial hair is just now kicking in and becoming more rampant, and my baby fat is slowly burning away as I feel more and more stiff, how my mind recently shifted from one mindset to another, how people are treating me differently now and it is starting to scare me.

Why did i do this to myself? did i do this to myself, or am I just like this? I don't like being like this, but it's all ive ever known. Covid stole my early 20s and so much needed social interaction is lost, and I'm just so lonely. ""just be yourself"" and you'll find love. yeah. that's never worked because someone who is still mentally in a place that he can never escape from in a world of maturity and responsibility and people much more socially successful than him is making him suffer and scream on the inside. I do much better texting than I do with talking to people, and it makes me so so fucking angry.

good god i just want to know what its like to be in love, that's it. I've never been in a relationship or even kissed anyone, and i don't even know if i ever can. I've always been single, and I've never realized how blind and wrong I've always been about the things I thought would make me happy if I were to stay that way, but in the end i only worked away my early 20s for some money that i didn't nor do know how to spend. 

If I were to give advice to my 18 year old self, it would be to party more, to LIVE more. It would be to go out and just DO more rather than trying to LEARN more or indulge all alone, because experience is so much more potent, useful, and valuable than knowledge. I would have never got a computer or video games if I knew that the real world would offer so many more opportunities and happiness.

I'll never get back the youth I never knew how to properly utilize, because I don't feel it anymore. But what does matter is how I spend my future that I know now how to properly use, because it's all I really do have and know. I just honestly wish I knew who I could spend it with, but I have no clue, because being single is all I've ever known and feel comfortable with, and I have no clue who to even trust anymore.

Yes, I finished my degree and working in a career to which my degree is associated. Yes, I live on my own. Yes, I have a few mundane hobbies mostly kept to pass the time. I come home after work and sit at my desk trying to distract myself for four hours until I’m tired enough to fall asleep successfully. I wake up unnecessarily early but I find that I do better in the morning than at night so this isn’t much of a problem. I continue to distract myself for 2 hours on my computer before work, drink my coffee, and smoke a few cigarettes just to consume something other than junk food. I ponder my reality occasionally and try a few google searches trying to find some consolation in the reality that I’ll be alone for at least for the next 33 years. It honestly gives me some sort of relief that I am at least halfway done with my life. However, it is also exhausting to realize that I essentially have to relive an equal number of years I’ve already completed. The first half lived with hope, enthusiasm, and dreams while the second half will be lived existential dread, weariness, and melancholy. The thing that I want and have always wanted, a loving relationship, is not in the cards for me and I can only hope that my unhealthy habits will snuff out any additional years of my life so I will not have to endure any additional years that is necessary.

Little rant(skip to down below to get to the point where it says SKIP TO HERE)

As of lately I’ve regretted trying to talk to people online. Since I’ve been away from my college campus (online quarantine), I’ve been trying to reconnect by conversing via the online world. It has left me feeling even more lonely as there is a lack on genuine connection from my experience as of lately. Makes me feel very empty and even more so depressed. But it has helped at times, as I had some genuine conversation which In grateful for. It’s my fault, as I suck with talking without being in my head and being awkward lol. Over-talk as you’ll see in a minute as well.

My experience with talking with people isn’t much. But I have notice this pattern of people acting in a sense. You can say it’s being respectful or nice. It’s this thing where they mimic your wording or act very nice to win your favor, but it eventually stops or walls up in a sense. I’m not sure if I’m wording it correctly. Like you know when we were toddlers or young children, we were able to walk up to fellow kids and just be straight forward, blunt, and genuine while being kind naturally. No judgement and taking people as they are, wanting to enjoy there time. Just talking to one another and not putting up a act to fit into what is right or wrong, as well as not having bad intentions. A genuine down to earth meaningful interaction. I really miss that very much. The way people talk, it’s hard to find a real connection. It’s when they are trying to seek validation or fake their speech. It leaves you sad and empty. I miss the real talks and not trying to impress each other or judge each other. Just seeing one another beyond or the physicality, but the soul itself. No more act. It makes you feel very lonely. When I talk to my baby siblings, they say what’s on their mind and are unfiltered. They aren’t acting, and have honest intentions that are easy to see. Genuine parts of my life for once, in which if I didn’t have the chance to experience I don’t know how I’d be doing right now. I miss seeing people try to understand you as you would them, rather than give up and mark one another as tedious. To not give up on one another it’s really rare. It all makes you feel like an  outsider. Makes you feel empty. Slowly takes away my love for people. My wording maybe very messy as I am tired and ranting while being so. Let me know if anything is confusing!



(SKIP TO HERE)
But anyways, it has left me to get away into my hobbies and things I like to be around and do. 

Such as:

Try out and explore new places
Watch anime/read books/manga
Get into my religion 
Spend time with family 
Try my best to live life
Cooking
Baking
Creating art

So what things do you like to do to improve away from loneliness?

3808,Ill_Performer519,1625563528,1,"I’ve been very alone for years now. I’m a 22 year old guy turning 23 this year. Recently just kind of been having this feeling of really wanting someone to hang out with from time to time. But then I realize that I can’t, I think I’m depressed because I can’t really be happy anymore and I feel hollow, emotionless and just way more negative , I don’t want to bring anyone down with me! So I built these walls around me and don’t really let anyone in. I’ve been staying boring and keeping everyone at a distance.

I know I can beat this depression/anxiety, but man is it hard rn. I think I just miss my old friends, the ones who I felt comfortable sharing things I never shared with anyone else, Really being my true self. Yeah I might have not been the best person to have a convo with but I was always really caring and I would always be as helpful as possible. But all of that suddenly stopped one day, I sent my usual message and just never got a response back from them. I guess I just got dropped. To this day I don’t truly know why they stopped talking to me, I asked but never gotten a repose. I wasn’t blocked but I just never got a response. I got my suspicions but I’d rather not focus of speculation. I just told myself, it is what it is and just walked away broken hearted. Now I’m just a grumpy guy who just wants to be alone. 

I hate being so damn boring it pisses me off. I hate not being able to laugh anymore, not being able to be happy, second guessing myself and constantly being alone! I’m tired of it and I just want someone to help me. I never ask for help, I don’t want to bother anyone but I’m getting to the point where if I Don’t do anything I’m going to lose my shit. I feel like I’m lost and don’t know what to do anymore how do I stop this! I want to be with someone who is just chill and want to grow as a person with me. Maybe help me find myself. Someone to help me remember how to laugh someone who can help me get through this really tough time. 

I can usually power through all of these emotions but lately I can’t. I’ve been trying new things out like just doing fun activity’s on the weekends like going to rivers, water parks, horse back riding and going to fairs, I even started deep cleaning my house to try and not think of this painful loneliness. Staying busy is hard when you want to just give up and be alone. 

TLDR:
I feel hollow and boring, just want to be left alone. After friends dumped me I’ve became frustrated and depressed. I hate the way that I feel and I’m lost.

The answer, of course, is that there is no reason why it would change now. I am a 21 year-old male, about to turn 22 in a month. With every month, with every year, the window closes. Narrowing ever so slightly more. Past a certain point, there will be no going back for me. None. Certainly, finding a soulmate would be out of the question if friendship is something I haven’t ever been successful at yet. 

Would anyone even care if I disappeared without a trace? Whether it be starting a new life somewhere or perhaps offing myself in a way or in a place that no one would ever find me. Sure, my family. Maybe. Although I really doubt my extended family would care. So that’s like, what? Four other people who would devastated, and that’s even assuming they all would be. 

If I can’t have anything nice, why should people get the luxury, the privilege, of knowing how I die or where I go?

3849,InternationalRule193,1625545207,1,"I’m a single, F who is directionless and worried about her life. 

Originally I’m from the West Coast, born and raised. I never left home until after college (commuted all years). 
At 24, Left home for the first time to take a job in the field that I studied, located in the Midwest. Stayed there for two years...I didn’t know anyone when I moved, so I used apps to help me meet people. Eventually I made a few good friends who I keep in touch with until now. 
At 26, I got into one of the top graduate schools in the country over in the East Coast. Left the life I built behind in the Midwest to start my grad program. Luckily I already knew people beforehand in the city I was moving to. 
At 27, I was fortunate enough to offered a residency at a top consulting firm, but since it’s located in a different city in the East Coast, I have to move again. Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone in the city so I have to start over again. 

I’m not saying this to brag. I had a tough conversation with my parents. They asked me to either choose a life of loneliness for a job where I don’t know anyone, or come back to work in the West Coast. 
It’s tough, choosing your career and hopping from place to place. However, I know this job will help me grow professionally, and it’s an opportunity I know others would be grateful to have. 

But I realize I can’t form stable relationships because of the fact keep moving, and I’m scared I’ll end up alone because I don’t know where I’ll be for the 2-3 years. It’s even hard to date, and I feel like I’m wasting a lot of time. There’s a part of that wants work hard at my job and move up the career ladder, but that means staying in DC and being alone. And another part that wants to move home to be closer to my family- but that means leaving the job behind. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared and confused, and I don’t want to feel like I have to give something up. I know I need to settle down somewhere eventually, but right now the way I’m feeling hurts. This is a rant, but please feel free to share life advice.

3852,chaos_energy,1625544491,1,"This is long and rant like. And it's okay if no one reads or cares. I just want to type on my phone and pretend that somewhere someone will be feeling exactly like me.

Between depression, anxiety , chronic pain and a very toxic relationship, I find myself going days without talking to people. I'm a classic people pleaser with no boundaries and due to trauma, I have lot and lots of people in my life , whose problems I listen to and help them. All of them think I'm very close to them. 

But I have no one. Yes I can shit text one or two of them, but no one to ever check on me. And it's okay, I find myself telling myself. I listen to and help people with no ulterior motive but I find it hard to go on somedays.

I go from app to app, refreshing as if I'll miss a message. When messages do come, saying I'm not fine is not even an option. And plus they wouldn't understand me. Shallow , self absorbed people, is what I like to call some of them. Maybe I'm too harsh. Or maybe I'm too kind. I can't say.

Work has lost meaning few months ago, and sometimes I feel like crying on work calls. I can't frame sentences because somedays I don't know how. I know I'm an empath , but some days I hate everyone, and have no empathy for anyone.

I look at the walls of our shared bedroom , thinking I don't even have my own space. I cry in my bathroom and sit in various places on my bed, as if the feelings and mood will change.  I crave touch , and love. Even an internet stranger who simply cares about me and nothing else.

How did I get so lonely. What did I do wrong. How will I go back to work soon, not being able to cry during the day - striking meaninglessness conversations with people, pretending I care. I remind myself that this is not rock bottom. Rock bottom would be in September when I go back , surrounded by people and yet no one who could see my broken heart and soul. 

Why don't others have that same ability I have to see through 'im fine'. Why doesn't anyone ever truly care with no ulterior motive, if I'm fine. Why doesn't anyone just hear without giving me their toxic positivity.

Will my brain lose the ability to form words? My parents whine about them being lonely. They have each other. They talk. He and I don't even talk. Too empty souls , too scared to leave each other. But can it get worse. I'm so scared of that day. Days pass thinking , how would it be if today was my last day on earth. And I know I would never actively want to die, but where are all those accidents and scary infections. Why doesn't one of them knock me out and end this endless , soul empty-ing loneliness of mine to rest....

Every person around me with someone keeps saying that I'd meet someone but obviously that ain't happening ( I've been waiting far a decade or so). I do well at my (entry level job) and I'll probably have a decent future once I gain some experience. But I don't see the point if I'm alone.

#I don't really try hygiene wise anymore like makeup or doing my hair or taking a bath. I sponge bath every so often.

Sorry, I'm just leaking. I can't believe it's 7 months later, since we had a real conversation, and I'm still so incomplete. I don't understand it all. I don't cry as much as I used to, but I still have days where I can't budge. I can't do anything because nothing seems to matter. I miss her and I love her, and I just want to tell her over and over again that I love her. But it is to no end. I did it once and all was taken away. Our friendship.

3874,Userur,1625533174,1,"Wealth and poverty aren't merely economic. There is social wealth and poverty. There is also romantic wealth and poverty. The rich are rich in all forms of wealth for the same spectrum of reasons that they are economically. Some are rich because they worked hard and consistently. Others are rich because they invested into something at the perfect time. Others are rich because they won the lottery. Others are rich because they inherited that wealth.   
Some are poor because they're drug addicts. I used to work at a gas station in an area full of crack and meth heads. Every homeless person there is or was a drug addict. Some are poor because they're lazy. Some are poor because they're developmentally challenged. Some are poor because they lost everything in a tragic set of events. I'd argue most are poor because they inherited that poverty. Most poor people in the world aren't poor because they're lazy or incapable of making great wealth. Theyre poor because they were born into poverty. Most of them don't want to be poor. If given rhe opportunity to get out of poverty, they'll take it with open arms and will find more value in a piece of the wealth that the folks who were always wealthy have, then those wealthy people percieve in all the opulence they possess. The proof of this is that the wealthiest nationalities in america come from poor countries. People from nigeria, or India, come from vastly poorer situations than most americans, yet in america they are wealthier than most white Americans since the great absence of opporunitis in their home country made the opportunities that we possess stand out. They are wealthier because they see the opportunities and take advantage of the opportunities that most locals take for granted.   
In the same sense, the loneliest of people often nake the best of friends and the maot passionate and honest of lovers. The best friends I've ever had were people that knew what it was like to have nobody to talk to no matter if they wanted to or not. The least judgemental people I've ever known were the ones that understood what it was like to not be understood.   
So while there are a lot of people that like to pride themselves in how much they have (money, friends, relationships, etc), and in turn look down on people that possess less then them, and assume they must be superior, the folks that have less on average will perceive more value from a piece of their wealth than the wealthy folks will from all of it (unless of course those wealthy folks earned that wealth or themselves used to experience a vacuum). Quality is better than quantity. It is better to have a couple of real friends than it is to have a dozen superficial aquaintenceships. It is better to have one true lover than it is to have had a dozen casual relationships.   
If you are wealthy I am not envious or jealous. Being wealthy in any context is not a bad thing. It isn't something that you should feel guilty about. But it doesn't make you a greater person. It doesn't matter how much money you make, how many friends you've had, or how many women you have, that doesn't determine who you are as a person. And if you're only means of feeling good about yourself is to look down on people that have less, and indulge and binge on your wealth, than you really are a small person. On the outside you may be glamorous, but on the inside you are paper fiction.   
No matter who you are you deserve to love and be loved, whether or not that is happening for you. It isn't anymore to want from this life than the right to eat and be alive. And whether or not it is happening for you, I hope that it does. ",lonely,you deserve to love and be loved,2021-07-06 10:59:34

3876,RF3107,1625532016,1,"So, since I was a kid I had only a few friends (1 or 2), I used to like it because I am a huge introvert.
2 years ago I moved to another city with my father (leaving all my close family and friends behind) where I didn't knew anyone, new school, new people, new life. When school started I tried to stay away from people but instantly got adopted by an extrovert, and then he introduced me to some of his friends (4) and after some time ,we started to become very close friends, we talked for hours, played for hours and hang out sometimes, it was great, I loved them and we were really close. 
A year passed and something's changed, I started to date one person of the group and then broke up with her, and then dated her again and then broke up again (long story), it got a little weird but in the end we were still friends.
I started to feel tired, I didn't have enough time to be alone (I'm still an introvert), so I started to ignore them a bit, time passed and a fight happened which separated the group in 3, I stayed with the ones that I thought were right but in the end they solved their problems and stayed kind of friends, I guess, I mean the group is still separated and we don't speak with 2 persons.
In the last months I've been feeling a bit lonely, because I'm tired that the only person that speaks to me now changed a lot, and is really upsetting me, the only thing he speaks about is LGBTQ themed, he as a LOOOT of problems in his personal life and as much as I try to support him, I don't enjoy our conversations anymore, he isn't the same anymore, and I can't have a conversation were I don't feel bored. So here I am, stuck with one close friend that I don't feel comfortable with, with only my father as close familly and sad because it's too late to make my group come back together.

3884,Nobody_apostrophe_s,1625527317,1,"For as long as I can remember I've felt like some sort of alien that can't make human connections. I've never been able to meet people. In all of the friend groups I've had, I've always felt like the weirdo that the group decided to adopt. I haven't made any new friends since I was in college, and now that I've been moving around for work for a few years, I have virtually no access to people. I've had zero success romantically, having never had a date or even held a girls hand at 26, and honestly this part hurts the most; at least I can keep in touch with my geographically distant friends online and get some friendly interaction that way, but there's no way to mimic someone that you care about caring about you.

On paper, nothing is wrong with me. I actually have a lot going on. I'm very financially comfortable, I keep myself in shape enough to have visible abs most of the time, I'm a decent cook, I think I look pretty good, and while I come across as introverted, I think I have interesting takes to add to lots of conversations. I'm responsible, clean, and hard-working. I enjoy helping people when I can.

That said, for the last four years, I've found myself stuck in the same loop:

1. I'll realize that I want to meet friends/dating prospects.
2. I'll try to find some activity to do or a place to go to meet people.
3. I'll end up not finding anything appealing among the available volunteer opportunities and clubs, so I'll just go somewhere that people can socialize.
4. I'll find myself at a bar or a cafe or something like that alone, looking around at people who are only out to be with their friends. No one is approachable, and no one ever looks in my direction.
5. I'll go home feeling awful and lose the nerve to go out again. 

I remember spending almost all of my spare time over one winter at a local starbucks. I would work on my laptop or read a book, thinking that if I put myself out there, then maybe someone might start talking to me or I'd have some of magic eye contact with a cute girl like you see in movies. Most of the people who worked there recognized me after a while, but nothing ever came of this after sitting around for well over 100 hours (and now that I think about it, drinking hundreds of dollars worth of overpriced tea -- wow).

I've seen a few therapists over the last few years, and they all seemed to think that going out again and repeating that awful loop is how I'd fix things for myself. I just don't know how to explain to them that the world doesn't work like that, at least not anymore. I can't sleep at night because I keep wringing my brain for every last drop of think juice that I can dump on this problem, but I never have any new ideas.

I think I'm just supposed to be a lonely person, even though it really, really hurts. I'm a strong person, but I'm losing the will to live at this point. I wish I could have a hug.",lonely,It feels like there's nothing I can do about my loneliness,2021-07-06 09:21:57

3892,smoharry516,1625523884,1,"Life has been pretty interesting for me. Around march last year, I met this really pretty and nice girl. We talked, went to homecoming and we started dating soon after. We were both introverted, but it eventually felt like a great relationship.

Until it really wasn’t. She struggled to open up to me. I had to learn about her and judge her personality through my own observations and talking with her friends. Through all of it, I truly loved her. However, for the last month of our relationship she pretty much avoided me at all costs. She had her job and college, so it was excusable but it still got to me. Towards the end of that month, I talked to one of her friends and the truth was revealed. She had told her that she thought I only loved the thought of her and that thought what we had wasn’t genuine.

I totally shut down because of that. I had no idea how to approach the situation, especially when there was no contact at all. I eventually broke up with her because I had no idea what to do. I still feel guilty about it because it was the week of her birthday, but I just wasn’t in a great frame of mind anyways.

So anyways fast forward to start of this year, and it wasn’t any better. I started to become super anxious at school. I struggled to reach out to those who weren’t friends, had trouble speaking in front class, etc. It especially didn’t help that I was losing some of my friends.

One of my friends was caught up in a breakup with my best friend and I ended up choosing my best friend. I think it was best in the end, but I still miss her. Another one of my better friends has also changed. He had slowly become an arrogant A-hole. We have slowly gotten distant and working with him hasn’t helped. I still try to be there for him, but it’s hard.

So, all of this cultivates to me going to the doctor and I discover I have social anxiety. I think it is rooted in my breakup, being so lost with it and parental problems I haven’t mentioned lol. I recently have started therapy and it has helped a lot. I still have a lot of good friends and I keep them close. But I don’t know, life has been weird. I just miss having someone there for me, or at least thinking I have someone, and those friendships.

Any tips? Sorry about this being a dump of my life over the past year or so, just needed to get it off my chest.

Deprived of any compliments, any sort of affection or interest that females gives me I instantly fall in love.

I’ve even tried to ask some of these girls out… but every single time it’s the same thing: “I see you as a friend” or “Thanks.” And this is what scares me the most: do I actually fall in love with the person or with the fact that I might not be lonely for once.

I don’t know whether I should worry that I will never be with someone or that I’m incapable of loving because I’m still relatively young… but holy shit is it depressing to know that there is no one out there that feels something for you or that thinks about you.

The only perk was again, my co-workers.  Now, I'm all alone.  I try to get along with my new counterpart, but they do not give me the same energy my old co-workers did.  If anything, they live in their own bubble.  Work is mundane, primarily tickets, training that I won't remember if I were ever to leave this company, and every day meetings.  

On the weekends, I'm alone by myself.  I usually drive around to get out of the house.  I hate my neighbors.  One of them thinks I like them.  I probably do, but the thing is that they don't have anything going for them.  She doesn't have a car or a good career.  I think she's older than me too...  

 I don't really have people to hang with, and when I do, it's not fun.  When I'm stuck at home I hear my neighbors talk about how cocky I am.   How I should be able to move out with the amount of money I make.  I have bills to pay, dumb shit to buy, food to order because when I get lonely I tend to buy fast food.

In the past, I’ve struggled with choice paralysis when it came to getting involved with my community and combatting loneliness, so I wanted to share my strategy on how I chose these activities. I decided to join activities that will expose me to the same people on a regular basis, and I think that will lay a solid foundation for making friends and meeting new people.

Another reason I chose these activities is because I wasn’t having a lot of luck with Meetup. Where I live, there are groups with thousands of members, but I noticed that the meetups were very infrequent and have few RSVPS. In addition, the same people didn’t show up every time and that made it hard to get to know people (I’m not knocking Meetup if it’s been a great resource for you - if it’s added value to your life, definitely keep using it!) 

Anyway, last point here - I know that everyone’s time, budget, and energy levels look different, but I just wanted to share my journey and strategy for combatting loneliness in case anyone could relate to the above :)",lonely,Decided to join two activities in my community,2021-07-06 05:16:06

3919,QwertyWolfma,1625511795,1,"I'm not sure how to start this, or how to really explain it. This is not a cry for help, nor a post for pity or sympathy; I just feel like trying to explain my thoughts for once. 

To start, I'm 24, and I'm in a weird place when it comes to a ""social life"". Last year in December (2020) my engagement and relationship had come to an end for personal reasons in both parties. During that time, I had 3 people aside from my fiancee at the time that I would call ""friends"". 

*Side note*: I have a difficult time with the term ""friend"", Because I feel like I have a lot of ""friends"" but out of all of them I would only hang out with 3; Everyone else would be a friendly interaction or somebody that I would see on a normal basis And both of us considered each other a friend; like someone that works at a coffee shop I frequent at. * 

To keep things short, after the relationship and engagement came to an end those ""friends"" did not bother to reach out during New Years or anything to even see if I wanted to do things, I was left alone in my emotions, I also came to find out they had said some things that I was not okay with Because it was disrespectful towards me and my now ex. Toy Story short I am no longer friends with those individuals and have not seen them in months. 

Fast forward to present, and I find myself with a lot of people who seem to like me, who say ""we need to hang out"" constantly but then never reach out, and when I reach out every once in awhile it takes hours if not days to get a reply or even the following reply is just an entirely new topic, disregarding my ""wanna hang out sometime next week?"" texts. It may be clichè but there's a scene from a popular show called Bojack Horseman and the quite is something like ""One day you're going to look around and realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you, and that is the loneliest feeling in the world"". 

I feel like that describes my current situation or at least, how I feel. I'm sure I could Ramble On for many more paragraphs but I can't really tell what's relevant to the situation and not, I just needed a place to ""vent"" Because the subject always gets changed when I go to counseling, and I don't have anyone that I'm close with to really talk about it with.

Or 'Is what I see around me real, or just a dream?' I swear that I when I was alone, I can sense people watching me, and keep I mind that I was a little kid having these feelings. I was pick on at school for my interests and for just being myself, then. Some teachers picked on me too. I'm not sure if I have some mental illness or disorder, but like I said I know there's something different about me.

Fast forward to when I was 9 years old. This is the turning point in my life because this is when I started to suicidal thoughts. When I got upset or sad I thought about stabbing myself or hanging myself. When 6th grade came around I was still picked on and anxious, I didn't do my homework because of stress. So from that I attempted suicide for the first time, it failed. But that didn't stop me from trying it over and over again.

I have had 4 girlfriends so far in myself, the first 2 not much happened, but my 3rd and 4th is when it took off. Me and my 3rd girl friend, we'll call her Samantha. So me and Samantha were close friends and we talk to each other a lot, our pears told us that we should date and so we did. Of course it was awkward at the beginning, but we soon became very comfortable around each other. We were constantly hugging and kissing. We started to talk about getting married and getting a house, looking back I was premature to talk about those things, but we didn't care we were to madly in love. But, I got a kick in the balls when she told me ""We need to talk."" So she said that me and her are more friends than lovers. That broke my heart into a million pieces, I couldn't believe that she did that to me. Months past, then I meet my 4th girlfriend, and we'll call her Morgan. Me and her meet on the bus, and we quickly became friends, I could tell from the start that she liked me. She'd go out of her way to talk to me, even if I was writing music. One day she admitted her feelings and I did as well. And again I got kicked in the nuts again when she told me that she wasn't feeling like having a relationship.

3947,PotatoTurt,1625496041,1,"Im sorry for the long read

Life in the past few years have been messing with me mentally.

I have so much bottled up anger and sadness that caused so much physical pain towards others who have (attempted to) bully me.

I'm too scared to go to therapy for my trauma that I got from my abusive side of the family. Because I know I would be diagnosed with something.

My mother would rather spend time with her boyfriend instead of raising her three kids. And wonders why I don't want to call her. She would rather send us off to a different country than to be a motherly figure in her kid's life and live her life like she's in her 20s. She did that already.

I have dated my childhood friend who turned out not to like me, and just wanted my attention, validation and resources. And left me to carry the relationship by myself. With her sexualizing every male she sees. And went ahead and left me for my former friend. And I went back to her out of desperation and loneliness. And after what she did a second time, I don't ever want to see her around.

I have a part time job for the summer at a high end Italian restaurant, as a chef. Cooking has always been my mental gateway from this lonely hell on earth. It feels like one of the few ways I can put a smile on a stranger's face. So I strive to be the best in my field of work.

At school I have a small group of friends, but I have an emotional and mental wall placed in front of all of them. Not one of them truly knows what goes on in my head.

I studied hard for a scholarship and got a interview in a month for it. And I already submitted my college application. And I have my CXC exams on Tuesday and Wednesday.

But I'm tired. I just want to rest my head and be with someone who at least acknowledges my existence, for who I am, not what I have to offer.

I spend too long dealing with everyone's problems, but nobody offers to deal with mine, or even spend enough time with me to realize how I feel. 

And seeing couples being happy sets off a bomb in my head. The fact that I get jealous easily and that I can't even be with someone for myself.

I just want to feel something, emotionally, in a positive way that would set me free. And someone who will love me as much as I love them.",lonely,"So much people and expectations from me, but no one who real knows how I (16m) truly feel.",2021-07-06 00:40:41
3948,joeythedauntless,1625495911,1,I grew up bouncing from group to group never having any true friends to watch out for me. I've always tried to build good relationships with those around me and tried developing friendships that just didn't work out. in the end it always ends with me having my heart broken and them moving on without a care. I poured endless amounts of effort in to change myself to make myself fit in. I never had anyone to support me when I was hurt or hear me out when I needed someone to listen. What's worse is that throughout my life I've never been taken seriously by anyone this added more to my mental trauma of never having a snowball's chance I in hell of having a good relationship. This caused me to fall into a bunch of bad crowds dealing with drug addictions and money problems and caused my own parents to abandon me. I spent the last few years turning my life around and made some friends who would watch out for me and care for what I do but I still can't get rid of this feeling of intense sadness and loneliness and I'm worried that I'll never truly be happy again. I'm just a mess of abandonment issues and depression and to be honest I don't even wish to live anymore as even though I've made some friends I fear that one day they'll leave me and that even if i die the world wouldn't care what happens to me.,lonely,I just don't feel happy anymore,2021-07-06 00:38:31

Not a single step comes naturally, I need to learn and consciously apply every single one.

I'm not even mad about it, I also wouldn't date someone who I don't find attractive. And I'm totally fine to have great friends that I get along with. A good friendship is worth more than a short fling. But it still hurts a little not to be desired and physically attractive to anyone.

3961,Tayoto_Sapru,1625480144,1,"For my entire life, love had evaded me. I’m “just a friend” material, for some reason. I’ve given up on the whole concept of love so many times that I didn’t think it was for me. This is basically the entire sub, though, so that’s nothing. There’s a tl/dr at the bottom. 

I’ve been trying lately not to let myself become convinced that someone likes me.  One day, my naivety caused me to let my guard down. May 3rd was prom. My last year in high school. I went, and as one does, mistakenly let a girl into my heart. She looked me in the eyes while we danced and told me that she liked me, and every doubt left my mind. We had known each other for years, and had even flirted with each other a little. This girl was the one. We danced, talked for a little while, and she told me to consider this a date. 

For a week or so, we talked on Snapchat, trying to find a good time for a date. Then she blocked me on every social media platform she had. I tried for two weeks to get in touch. Her friends told me she didn’t mean to do it. I knew it was bullshit, but I tried anyway.

I eventually got her actual phone number. Late one night I texted her, “What did I do wrong? I just want to know why you would do this.” She read the message, didn’t answer, and deleted the conversation, and then blocked my number. It was at this point I knew that she wasn’t just playing hard to get like I thought. She wanted to forget that I exist. 

And then I hear, a week after this, that she’s going on fishing trips with her ex. The one who had broken up with her right before prom. She didn’t care about me. I could probably spin my Mustang into a tree and break my neck, and she wouldn’t feel as hurt as I have for the past couple months.

I don’t want to see this girl again. She cut me deeper than any person ever has before in my entire 18 fucking years of loneliness. Yet, I still can’t get over her. I’m pissed off. Pissed off at myself, at her, at the guy she’s dating, pissed off at myself for falling for her, pissed off at myself for not getting over it, pissed off at myself for being pissed off.

3987,clark12302,1625468195,1,"I’ve always felt lonely but rationally thought out kinda loneliness. It’s not that I’m without people to talk too, it’s more that I’ve always understood how meaningless anything you do is in the grand scheme of things. Think about it, if you cut off your hand and, how long is it until it’s not a part of you? Eventually you’d learn to live without it the same way a dog acts different when you cut off their balls. Eventually you’d move on without a hand. 

If you can move on with who you are without a hand then you could without a hand and foot right? Maybe even half your entire body? Maybe even just your head and chest? If you can move on and change into a different version of you without these, would you move on if you lost all the senses too? Imagine being in that state with only a head and chest but you also can’t see, say, smell, feel, or taste anything. Eventually you’d move on but what if you were born like that? I believe that’s the truest state of being who you are, a state where nothing in the outside would can effect you and you’re left with no interaction but the interaction with yourself but if you live in a state where you’re not effected by anything nor do you have any memories of anything, wouldn’t you just live in a state of pure existence? Kinda like a plant? If that’s the case and all I am is the little bit of constantly replenished energy keeping my body alive while my dying brain creates a feedback loop make to process information that I call my consciousness then how can I ever actually connect with someone outside of my own body? 

Everyone is equally as separated from each other as everyone else so if everyone is actually that separated and the only version of you that I’ll ever know is the projection of who you looked like you were analyzed from my prospective then I’ll never know who you truly are. Nor would you know me so the only thing that you’ll ever actually know in this life is yourself.

3989,BeanJam42,1625467583,1,"As the title prefaces, it has been more than 7 days since I've spoken to anybody. Much longer than since I've gotten into a real conversation. I don't share a lot of interests with my friends, not that I haven't tried to, so most of my communication is through texting people. It's been several weeks since I've had a conversation that was longer than me reaching out, getting 2-3 replies, then being left on read again. I decided about a week ago to see how long it'd take for someone to reciprocate and reach out to me first, and today marks the day when my last text message partner reads ""seen more than 1w ago"" and at this point I don't know what to do anymore. What makes nobody notice me? I reach out and stand out as much as I can, not begging for attention but not being too shy to fade into the shadows. I make my hobbies known (ie. I publish my photos and my other artsy shit) and I'm not the most unremarkable person, but ever since summer started I've vanished from everyone's minds. During the school year (I'm 17, oops) all I get are people begging to leech off my 5.0 gpa work ethic, which I only managed to get because I'd feel like a failure with any other GPA. After they get what they want (I'm not gonna turn them down because I don't have any friendship points to lose over that shit) they vanish again. And when there is no schoolwork they never show up to begin with. The only other time I'm spoken to is if I'm needed for mental support, people come to me about abusive households and mental breakdowns and suicidal ideations and i try my best to be there for them or call the police if they're committing actions to harm themself, and don't get me wrong I welcome them to come to me I want to help as many people as possible, but I feel as if I'm intentionally trying to seek mentally unstable people because they make me feel needed, which i never get in return, I just got out of a mental hospital after texting a few people I was going into one, most left me on read after I sent that I was going into one. I give all and get none, and I don't know what to do anymore.

This isn't a post to complain though, I'm not gonna be like ""I'm such a nice girl, why don't people like me?"" Or be any kind of entitled fuckhead. Instead, I ask of you all what the hell I can do anymore! I try reaching out first, i try to be nice to everyone i talk to, i try to be interesting and fun to hang around with, I try to be...as human as anyone else I know, with their own likes and dislikes, personality, strengths and weaknesses, yet I'm at the bottom of every list. It's heavily taxing on my mental state, and i have nowhere to go to try and find out what to do. So much so that I'm going to an internet forum for lonely people to cry out into the darkness at 1:45am, when I have to be at work in 8 hours.

Last 4th of July, I ended up getting dumped by my first love, we had dated for a year and a half, starting when we were 17. I know that shouldn’t be a huge deal. It’s been a year since then, but it still hurts and for whatever reason I’m still not over it. We broke up because she ended up getting feelings for someone else, but I guess that’s irrelevant.

So this year I decided I wasn’t gonna be alone. I just met a cool girl about a week ago, and we made plans to hang out for the 4th a couple days ago. Well, today rolled around, and I didn’t hear anything from her. I sent her a few messages to check if she was still down to hang out tonight, and never heard anything back. She ended up opening my messages later on, but never replied. Since this was the only thing I had planned for today, and everyone else already has their own shit going on, I ended up stuck at home drinking and just trying to disconnect from reality.

Honestly, I’m not even that upset about this girl standing me up specifically. I’m more upset that I just can’t seem to fucking win, and I don’t even understand why. People tell me I’m a good guy, funny, attractive, etc, and yet I’m on my own 90% of the time, despite my best efforts to make friends and find love again.

I always got along with people and became acquainted, but I never built any natural and deeper lasting relationships.  I never hung out with people outside of school or felt I had anyone to tell my problems to. I developed intense social anxiety and persistent mild depression. Because of this isolation, I latched onto perfectionism and a false portrayal of intelligence to prove my self-worth.

I spent all my time trying to be someone I wasn’t. I studied all day and wasted countless hours sifting through textbooks alone. Every mild social interaction incited anxiety in me. I got along with everybody, but understood nobody. I used my obsession with schoolwork to fill the growing void. I graduated valedictorian in my high-school last year.

I didn’t feel a sense of accomplishment, I felt nothing but the familiar isolation. I succeeded in being someone I wasn’t and now I have nobody. Throughout my years, I watched my peers throw parties, date, hang out, and enjoy life, while I wallowed in my own miserable realm.

I spent the first year of college at home. Nobody from high-school has texted or tried to contact me.

At this point, I’m pretty much permanently damaged and destined to be trapped in this mental prison. I can try to ‘fix’ myself, have a positive mental attitude, be mindful, etc, but I can’t change who I am. I’ve had my issues so long that they are permanently etched into the inner workings of my brain.

When I talk to people my age, I feel like I’m talking to an actual alien. I can converse easily, but I can never develop a deep relationship. I’ve diverged too much from the perceived normality. Our interests never align, and they always have a tight-knit friend group. Thanks to years of social anxiety, I can never communicate truly beyond the superficial level.

I’m constantly lonely. I’m not sure if this is a result of the physical + mental abuse I endured as a child, genetic, or a combination, but I see no end in sight.

Is it really? “What comes around goes around” does it? In the past two years I had one ex lie straight to my face, lay in my bed and tell me all the shit I want to hear, then ripped it out from under me and started a life with another guy. I’m not even happy that he cheated on her and left her with a kid. That isn’t enough, why? Cause I don’t have someone, there still a frayed end to this story that life won’t heal. I had another ex break up with me and all she had to say for herself was “you didn’t do anything wrong, I’m the asshole.” If I’m so great why am I still here? I had an ex show back up in my life, I loved her and yet even after I drove an hour to see her on a blown transmission all she could say was “sorry the spark is gone.” I spent a year and half talking to a girl at work and even with her flaws I thought the world of her. We went out to the bar, we made plans and out of nowhere “she didn’t feel it.” The common thread was always “I want to go slow.” Now that has become a red flag to me. I don’t think people who want to go slow know what they want and I refuse to be in those situations again.

I’m on every app, I go to bars, they’re always empty. I try and manifest a relationship everyday, nothing. I look into the mirror and see how dead inside I’ve become, I’m on the downward spiral.

I tell myself that better times will come, but I don't believe it, not even a bit. Recently my parents asked me in a call if I was happy and the answer is no, I just feel miserable. I can't find another adjective that describes me better. Being empty, desolate. Is it too much to ask for a pill that takes everything?
Absolutely nothing has flavor, I don't mean just food, I mean watching movies, going for a walk, playing games, everything is bland. Today I had to turn off the music because I did not tolerate it, I do not tolerate anything. And being alone doesn't help.
If my psychiatrist says something like ""it is very comfortable to work with you"", something she said the last time I saw her, I feel rejection, disgust. I would feel much more comfortable if instead of that they told me ""you really are despicable"". I would feel warm, that they are not lying to me.
Is it too much to ask not to feel SO bad? The only girl I met on tinder yesterday blocked me without saying anything. It was to be expected and it's understandable, but I can't help feeling sad.

Keep taking things day by day, doing what you can and doing your best and if that feels like to much focus on just putting one foot ahead of the other. Every path, every journey, started with one singular step, so don’t feel bad if all you can do is baby steps towards whatever progress you desire.

In the last couple of months I've been trying to socialize more by regaining old and abandonded friendships.

And surprisingly it partially worked!! I've been meeting with one good old friend regularly and it feels quite good. 

We've met many times in the last couple of months, we both started skateboarding again, so that has bonded us quite a lot. He even introduced me to her girlfriend and one night they came to my home, were we had some drinks and had a good time.

So yeah, It looks like my mental health is improving a little bit thanks to socializing with a friend.

But despite being a little bit happier in the last months, I still feel super lonely, especially when I say goodbye to my friend.

He is quite sociable and he always has someone that wants to meet with him or someone that invites him to a party. I guess that he doesn't even imagine himself struggling to socialize... And that makes me wonder, why? 

Why does he always has someone there? What is the secret?

All of this makes me feel really sad and I don't know exactly why. I would like to believe that it's not envy what I feel, because I am truly happy that he is so sociable. Maybe it's just demotivating seeing a person effortlessly socialize while I have barely did it in the last few years.

I don't know... Whenever the meeting is over, everything starts to feel like always, empty and lonely desolation...

I don't know if expressed what I'm feeling correctly, but if any of you have understood me and wants to share it, I would like to read your experience and also know how did you managed this situation:)

 So this year comes around and.....nothing. No invites from anyone, anywhere. Not even to watch fireworks, or have a beer. I always have to do the inviting, every time, always, no matter the circumstance. Cant remember the last time I was genuinely invited to something out of the blue. I was planning to go down to the beach with my brother but he's sick (and was my ride down, I dont have a car) so I'm not going to hang with him. My poor dad is also down at the beach all on his own, his wife/my mom died back in January so this is probably the loneliest i've felt in my life, and same goes for him. 

So this is partially due to circumstances, I was expecting to go the beach this whole time but literally the day before it has been cancelled basically due to my ""driver"" getting sick. 

The golden rule is bullshit, treat others the way you want to be treated?! HA! What a fucking joke.

4080,WhereIsMyMindhuh,1625437784,1,"I have always been a shy guy and valued all friendships incredibly highly, coupled with low self esteem it’s difficult to make them. I’m now 45, still socially awkward but hide it/act better nowadays. But I have remained friends with the same people from senior school, these are still my close friends. I have a few things in common with many of them, don’t get me wrong but never in my life have I been a best friend. Or had what I’d call a best friend. Never have I been on the same wavelength as someone or has someone really understood me. I’ve never really opened up to anyone as I figured being myself would scare people off somehow. 

I obviously married my first girlfriend as I’d never get another, right. We have two awesome kids so that’s one of the reasons I’ve not left as it’s pretty much loveless as we have nothing in common. I’m also afraid if I was to split up I’d be forever alone. Although I’m feeling forever alone now anyway. If I did split up who would I talk to? I have shared my feelings over a drunken beer with a couple of closer friends but not really valued their advice and they have not really helped. I guess I’m always in that second or third tier friendship level - so low effort, I treat everyone like first tier which helps with my popularity, but I don’t get much back. 

Anyway, rereading this it sounds pretty bad but in reality it’s not. I guess I have got used to it. I do think I should try to make different friends but I like being a loner to some extent and find it impossible to just talk to someone.

4087,mgtoown,1625434001,1,"I’ll give you the backstory. Sorry if this gets long winded.

When I was 21, I met a girl who I loved from the moment I laid eyes on her. We literally travelled the world together. She was mine and I was hers. I got her through university, helped her get a promotion etc I didn’t ask for anything back, just wanted her love. 7 years later she cheated on me and got pregnant with a guy. She ended up marrying him. I was severely depressed and tasted real loneliness for the first time.

4 years after that happened I met a woman on a well known paid-for dating site. I assumed I’d find someone more serious on there. I met a woman who said she had her own massage business and luxury car. A super long story short: she turned out to be an escort providing adult services.

I was distraught. She cheated on me twice and I had a moral breakdown. I have got a psychologist but it doesn’t help much. I forgive this woman for the pain she inflicted on me, but the trust is now non-existent. I accused her yesterday of talking to other guys. She swears she hasn’t this time and I think I believe her but it’s too late because we had a very very bad argument and she thrown and smashed a drinking glass during it.

Since then she’s had me blocked the entire day. She’s blocked me in the past when she’s angry but this time I think she means it. 

I know deep down it can never work. She wants to get back into the “massage” stuff and she has been an escort who cheated on me twice.

The problem is that I’m so damn lonely. I can’t bring myself to let go. I cried today alone sitting on my bed. She’s all I’ve got and she’s blocked me. I emailed her 3-4x begging her to unblock me but she didn’t.

Sorry if this all seems pathetic. To finish where I started, I never thought I’d be crying alone age 31, when I was 21 and met the original girl.",lonely,I actually cried today…31m,2021-07-05 07:26:41

4089,InternationalPool383,1625431915,1,"I met a group of girls when I started year 7 and we quickly became very close and almost inseparable. We was quite a big friend group (think it was about 7-8 girls at one point). Eventually people starting leaving and forming their own friend groups, which is fine I mean I still stayed friends with them just didn’t hang out as much. 

By the time we started year 11 we was a group of 4. For privacy reasons I won’t use their real names however I’ll use fake names to make the story more easier to follow. So it all started when let’s call her Charlotte starting dating this guy and she had sex with this guy. This was a big deal as that was her first time so she took no hesitation in telling us. I said that’s great but please be careful but everyone else in the group was being bitchy and said “I bet it wasn’t even enjoyable”. I though this was weird straight away I mean it’s not like their experts in sex anyways. However I didn’t think much of it and just carried on with my day.

The next day I come into school and Charlotte runs up to me and is crying and can barely get her words out. She tells me that loads of people have found out about her having sex and she’s been called a slag because of it. I told her not to worry and we’ll figure something out and I managed to calm her down and get her to her lesson. Once I was in my first lesson I got told from let’s call her Emma (who was in my friend group) that another girl from our friend group let’s call her Olivia was the one who spread the rumour. I thought this was very two faced and I desperately wanted to tell Charlotte but I also didn’t want to ruin my friendship with Olivia. 

Eventually Charlotte finds out that Olivia was the one who started to rumour and cut her off completely including Emma. However me and Charlotte remained friends. This clearly upset Olivia and Emma however I tried not to let it get to me. They would call her names behind her back and gave her the nickname “the slag” when referring to her. As I said before they didn’t like that I was still friends with Charlotte and they eventually would completely ignore me when I was sat right there with them. They would make plans in front of me but never included me and then I would go home and see on Snapchat that they were hanging out at the beach and going out to dinner without me. It made me very upset however I didn’t want to say anything to them because they would deny it and say that I’m being sensitive. 

One day I walked into school and decided this is the day that I’m not going to sit with them anymore and I started sitting with some other friends one of which included Charlotte. The whole time they stared at us but we ignored it. That evening instead of speaking to my face about the situation Olivia and Emma both messaged me about it. I explained how i felt ignored and pushed to the side and not included. They acted like they didn’t realise but I feel like they knew what they was doing. I said to them we can still be friends and talk however since then I’ve tried to talk to them in class and they ignored me so I gave up and we haven’t spoken since. 

Sorry forgot to mention this earlier but I also found out that Olivia and Emma was talking about me behind me back when my ex broke up with me. They comforted him and would talk to him but they never once asked how I was doing and if I was alright when he was the one who broke up with me. Surely I was the one who needed comforting for being dumped not the other way round. Not trying to sound petty I just think they could of tried to comfort me too.

Since then I’ve left school and I’ve never felt more lonely in my life. You may think me and Charlotte have stayed friends which we are it’s just she has a boyfriend and she’s hanging around with other people and I don’t want to get in the way of her relationship and her new friends because they are quite popular. I feel as though I’m never going to have friends again because with my apprenticeship I’m working with people much older then me and when I start college in September I’ll only be going once a week so it will be hard for me to find friends. I’m also really worried I’m going to be labelled as an outcast which makes me think no one will want to be friends with an outcast or want to date one, so then I also feel like I’m unworthy of love and a new relationship.

Sorry if this sounds really bitchy and petty as I’m reading it back I’m thinking maybe I’m the problem which makes me feel worse about this but I don’t know I just need other’s opinions.

But yeah, sorry I just really needed to rant and tell my story because I can’t really tell anyone. Thanks for reading it :)",lonely,Why I no longer have any friends,2021-07-05 06:51:55

Last summer around this time I introduced some friends from high school to my friend group I made in middle school. They all hit it off and it was nice. We got around 8 people and everyone was super friendly but now I feel as if I’m the last person anyone wants to hang out with or even play video games with. If people want to play party games over discord I’m never @‘d or if people want to hang out and see a movie I’m never invited. The only time people hang out with me is when I invite people to do something. 

I’m so happy that I was able to bring these people together and create great friendships for them, but it’s sad sometimes when I get left out. I have pretty bad anxiety so the thought of not being liked on top of the FOMO really isn’t that great. I don’t even mind not being hung out with. It’s just I would prefer if I didn’t know. Ignorance is bliss and all that.

4113,codecrunchie,1625422464,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

I've spent the last 2 years walking around campus seeing groups of friends laughing together, couples holding hands, hearing groups of friends in class talk about parties they went to and people they hooked up with. Meanwhile I've had days where the only time I've opened my mouth was to thank the dining hall lady for serving my food, which I obviously ate sitting alone while surrounded by people eating together.

I stopped posting about this awhile ago, since it didn't seem too healthy to dwell on it, but I just want to get it out. I fell in love with a girl last summer who lived close by when I moved into the area. I wasn't supposed to. We can't be in a relationship. But she became my best friend. We spent all kinds of time together. 

At the end of November, I finally told her my feelings. She told me hers too. But then it was over. She still lived nearby and we worked in the same place. But she wouldn't be alone with me ever. She would hardly exchange a word or look at me. This was a struggle beyond imagination until she left at the end of May.

She's been gone over a month now. I'm doing fine. But it's my first summer here without her. I keep thinking ""Why is this summer so much more boring than last summer?"" And then I remember how much time I spent with her. Especially today, on a holiday: No one to spend it with. I was with her last summer, I can still remember standing with her in an empty parking lot and seeing fireworks go off in every direction.

Really, I think I'm getting better. I don't think about her as often as I did. But man, do I miss her. And man, does everything seem a lot less interesting without her around. 

I'm going to the wedding of a mutual friend this month: Will she be there? Will I be allowed to exchange a simple word with her? Is there any point in being so cautious when we live worlds away now? When I approached in March, she said she's not mad at me. She said it's not a punishment. She just wanted to do the right thing, and she didn't know how to do that without keeping her distance.

I have no one to talk to, no friends or family. The years are flying by and I literally can't remember when I felt happy the last time.

4152,spoodydoo,1625394569,1,"So two “friends” of mine are holding a party for the 4th, and I was invited a few weeks back. I hardly ever leave the house due to depressive episodes so when I was invited I was super excited and have been looking forward to the whole thing as the date approached. 

Yesterday a friend (one of the hosts that invited me) reached out cuz I made a post about throwing up and having stomach issues from an unknown cause. I’m inclined to believe it was my anxiety that triggered it; (the things I ate recently were what a relative also ate, but they didn’t get sick) who knows though. Tonight I just so happened to mention that my anxiety was so overwhelming that it triggered nausea and made me throw up multiple times. As soon as I took an antacid though, I felt way calmer and my stomach settled. I told her that getting out to do something with my friends would probably be good for how I’m feeling and maybe even make me feel significantly better. I’m an introvert with anxiety but sometimes I desperately need to get out and socialize, so every week as the day approached I was checking in with them to make sure the party was still on.

An hour later she messaged me saying her and the other host agreed that they would feel pretty uncomfortable if I showed up, and “for yours and everyone else’s sake, it would be best”. 

So vague to just go and talk about it and decide I’m not welcome. I hate texts like this cuz how am I even supposed to know *why* they’re not inviting me? I’m not sure if they think I might have a stomach bug or because they just don’t want to hear about my anxiety issues anymore (I mean, they *could* just lie to me)...either way, I’ve learned my lesson. I’m no longer gonna bother talking to anybody about my issues, whether it’s a stomach bug or a panic attack or a deep depressive slump. Every time it ends the same way; I cause too much discomfort or issues and they drop me. They come up with excuses. They stop inviting me to things. They plan things without even considering me, knowing full well that I have no social life otherwise. 

Being invited made me so happy cuz I was finally gonna see the group of people that I care about so much. I was finally gonna have a reason to get out of bed, shower and get dressed. As of now I think my friendship with them is at a downturn; it’ll probably fizzle out soon (they’ve already hung out without me multiple times, for instance). This really just pushed me over the edge. Screw being honest with people. I’m hardly ever “fine” but I guess they don’t have to know! It only causes problems. I’m a problem. I get that now, and I’m done with all of it. Even if she changed her mind and said I could come, what’s done is done. I don’t mean to sound bitter but what she said was honestly *so* uncalled for and kinda stung, regardless of reasoning.

TL;DR: Friends invited me to a big party. Told one of the hosts my anxiety made me throw up again, so she decided she didn’t want me there *and* told the other host my business. Fed up with it.",lonely,(TW: V*mit) Told a friend my anxiety made me sick; big mistake!,2021-07-04 20:29:29

I hate feeling lonely. I just deal with it cause its not new to me. I've always been a loner, not by choice, just kids can be cruel. Who you are in school, is basically who you will be the rest of your life, not many people change that. 

I wish I had a better childhood. It was just a blur of nothingness. Didn't do much of anything. No gf in highschool, no one liked me that way. no real friends. Just by myself. 

I really would wanna know what its like to feel loved. I know that takes time. I know I'm not good enough to try. It makes sense why I'm alone. I actually am not that attractive compared to other guys. I'm fat, but my face is pretty slim. So I'm kinda stuck with my face. I'm not super tall. I'm not super hung. I don't have alot of money or a place of my own. I know some girls don't care about that stuff, but it still brings you down, makes you insecure. Scarlett Johansson could tell me I am perfect, and I'd still feel the same way about myself.

I'm afraid to be in a relationship sometimes, cause I'm afraid she'll see I'm not good enough, and leave. Thats fair. I'd leave me too. I know my flaws, my issues. I'm forgetful sometimes, I'm slow in my head. I don't know why I'm like that. 

I'm not perfect. I don't know if I'm worth it. I feel I'd be a useless boyfriend since I don't have anything to offer. Just me. 

Idk. Maybe I'm being stupid. Plenty of people have told me. Plenty of people tell me to stop being a bitch, stop being a pussy, to man up, etc. Sometimes people are gross in giving ""advice"". I don't want to hear that. Makes me uncomfortable. And sad.

4160,_feelslikeimdrowning,1625389336,1,"Using a Throwaway account for this.

I just graduated from high school a few months back and feel so helplessly alone, even when I'm surrounded by friends and family I feel like they don't really respect me for the real me, only the idea of me. I think something might be broken in me and I'm not sure what it is and I don't have anyone I could even talk to about this, I just outwardly appear to have a very energetic attitude towards everyone around me so I don't even know if they would take me seriously if I tried. 

I fought so dam hard to make myself the best version of myself, I'd study hard so I could be well educated, I'd work hard on the track to make my coaches and teammates proud, and I make a hard effort to maintain good friendships with all of my classmates.

I heard that people like hard workers and strong athletes, so I gave it my everything and work out 1 - 3 hours a day until I very recently became a state champion.

I heard that people like men who are gentle, generous, and humble despite there power. I have never so much as raised my voice to a peer, much less talk behind people's back, and have good control over my emotions and how I display them.

I heard that people like guys with good grades and a good work ethic, so I not only pulled my own piss poor grades up from a 2.6 to a 3.0 in two years, I did all of that while doing homework for other kids for free because I knew the material and wanted to be helpful. 

I even heard that girls like guys with hobbies outside of school related activities and clubs, so I've immersed myself in countless admittedly mostly sporting related hobbies that I still actively participate in till this day. 

I work hard, I don't drink or do drugs, but I'm also definitely not a nun and still like to have fun. I don’t have any enemies, I feel like I can call most everyone in my graduating class my friend, I think I have a good sense of humor and my friends often ask me to tell them campfire stories(I have this weird ability to addlib stuff like this).

But at the end of the day, all of the sports trophies and handshakes and ceremonial pieces of paper with stickers and empty complements on them mean nothing to me. I have earned absolutely everything I have set out to with my blood sweat and tears, nobody helped me even when I asked, but I can't find a single person I feel a genuine mutual connection with once all the smoke clears and the dust settles.

I want to hold someone, I want someone to rely on that can rely on me, and I want someone who shares mutual feelings with me.

I'm so frustrated, because I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I look around and all my friends and classmates are paired off, I was the only person who came to homecoming and prom without a date and I felt so alone standing in that crowd of people.

WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

I don't think it's because I'm ugly, as shallow as this is, I'm 6'5 and I did model agency work several times in the last few years.

I don't think it's self esteem or confidence issues, I do a good job at maskerading as someone keeping it together.

I don't have a car, but I have a job and I still go places and hang out with people.

I don't know what to do anymore, I don't even know if I'm willing to try at this point, I feel so helpless and alone and crushed. I've gone above and beyond in everything I've ever done in life, and all I want is someone to acknowledge me; to appreciate me, to tell me I actually made them proud.

I know I'm not entitled to love or a relationship just because I passed some requirements, but I want someone other than my parents to love me.

I want to love and to be loved back.

I want to be wanted.

What do I have to do to earn that?

What do I have to do to deserve that?

4168,AliciaFromHyrule,1625386438,1,"I've never had any real friends since I was a child. I'm deaf so I got sent to a boarding school for deaf and hard of hearing pupils starting in primary school, so playing with hearing children never happened.

At primary school, I was just the ""friendly quiet classmate"" that got invited to birthday parties but never was anyone's friend. I would just bury myself in books.

Puberty starting in secondary school was hell. I got bullied and I still remember a classmate telling me ""Everyone hates you"" bluntly into my face. These three words still haunt me to this day in my dreams. Since then I'm not involved with the deaf community. It's a small world where everyone knows everyone and where rumors can really spread fast around. It's annoying.

The only friends I could make were online but they never lasted long. The longest friendship lasted 8 years until the friend simply vanished. 

The only good relationship I had with anyone was my mother who was also deaf. She was a really kind person and I liked spending time with her. We communicated in sign language, so there were no communication barriers. Unfortunately my mother passed away two years ago and I'm all alone in the house where we lived together. I'm not close with other hearing family members.  
Recently I've completed my studies and am now in a full time working position. But the communication with my hearing colleagues is of course hard. They are really nice but it's really hard for me to lipread them during lunch breaks when we gather together. Deaf people can only lipread 30% of what has been saying, the rest has to be guessed from context. It's really exhausting and often I'm just bluffing, saying ""yes"" without having no clue what they said. 

So yeah, I'm pretty lonely. I try to make the best of it, I try to keep myself busy with my hobbies, I like to explore new places on my own but at the end it's just sad knowing, there is no one waiting for you and is genuinely interested in how you're doing and how your trip was. 

A few days ago we had a pretty bad thunderstorm. I was commuting in the train and the train was waiting for hours at a station because there were storm damages on the tracks. I've seen all the other passengers pulling their phones out, calling someone. Most of them left the train at the station because they were being picked up.

4179,iknownothingxx,1625382638,1,"and now i’m sitting alone on my couch in the dark. with nobody’s company but my own. 

I haven’t had a friend in years. I’m 27 and only have my sisters to talk to. And it’s never fulfilling. I’m the oldest and they don’t genuinely care about me. They just talk to me because I pay for everything and give them rides. I’m always there for them but nobody ever wonders about me. They know I struggle with severe depression/anxiety and even knowing that, never check up on me. 

I asked two of my sisters to come over so we could have a movie night and as soon as I was finished getting ready, they were like “sorry don’t feel like coming over anymore maybe next time.” 

I feel so fucking pathetic. I cooked and bought snacks too. Not for myself because I never have an appetite, but for them. 

One of my coworkers called me and for a moment I got excited because I thought she’d want to hang out. Of course not. She just wanted some adderall so her and her friends could party. I know people only reach out to me when they want something, it’s always been like this, but it hurts every single time. 

She met me by the door and I asked her if she wanted to come in because I didn’t want the food to go to waste and I wanted someone to see my place because I spent so much time making it look nice…but of course, she was too busy and was late for something. At 10pm.  “Next time tho, thank you so much for coming in clutch! love you girl!” 

She doesn’t love me. She doesn’t care about me. Nobody does. Only care about what they can get from me. 

How do people just learn to cope with never having anyone be there for them? I’m starting to think my anxiety disorder is caused by the debilitating loneliness.

4186,OG_Booty_Slayer,1625380499,1,"I am drunk at the moment but not drunk enough to make many typos ('I hope) but I will apologize in advance anyways.

I my only two best friends decided to disappear/go ghost. I have no way of connecting with them. One of them deleted the only way i can K.I.T with him, while the other made a statement that he doesn't wanna be friends or associated with everyone he met before July 1st, deleted all social medias, and haven't responded to one of my SMS texts. Now I am all alone. I do have other friends, but not only are they far physically but they are far in a sense that they can never connect with me the way my best friends did. So now I'm stuck with the feeling of lonliness.

I always tell myself that I need a girlfriend (btw I'm 21M, hmu ladies (Just kidding... sorta... like lowkey sorta)). So I try these dating apps and I can never get far in any of them. I rarely get matches. I find one special match and they're either from a different country (Okcupid) or they just don't respond (Tinder). I try different things to stand out and it never works. I never wanna become anything close to an incel, but I feel like something about me stands out in a horrible light. Like it got me asking ""Damn it, what's wrong with me?""

So I have no real friends, and I can't find a girlfriend to genuinely love with all of my heart. I have no one to be around where endless joy is guaranteed. Sometimes I think desires such as those are selfish of me. Like what if they give me happiness, but I dont give them happiness? Is that why my real friends abandoned me? Is that why no woman can love me? Is that why I must suffer and die a lonely death? 

I remember growing up as a child and spending my adolescent years feeling bad for myself, only to hear shit like ""There are people around the world living worse lives than you"" only to hear shit like, ""People are dying for an opportunity that you have"" (I noticed I typed 'only to hear shit like' twice and i was too lazy to backspace so I tried to cover it.... yet here I am typing shit that is taking longer to backspace all of that). Sadly it doesn't make me feel better. It just makes me feel worse. It makes me want to die so that I don't become a waste of space. It also makes me feel guilty for simply enjoying shit even if its temporary joy. Why should I live if I feel bad for myself despite all the privilege while there are people fighting to have the privileges I can't enjoy? It's so fucked in my view.

Really, I just want to die yet unfortunately three things stop me from committing suicide and finding my salvation: Curiosity. My family members and people that feel deep sadness and guilt from hearing suicide stories. And Physical Pain. With those three things in my head, its hard to end it with a trigger or with a knife or with something painless. Some say its my strength, but I won't believe it simply due to reason three (pain) and the fact that I have similar ideals to the nihilism and absurdity philosophies. 

Like all humans, I just desire one thing: joy. Eternal happiness. But unfortunately when you look at reality, you realize it isn't certain for all human beings. So then if I'm one of the humans trying to find my happiness but will forever fail to find or keep it, then why continue when it's easier or even better to end it (and answer the great questions surrounding what the ""after-life"" is like)?

Maybe it's not easy to enjoy some privileges alone. Maybe I don't have anything to simply motivate me. Or maybe I just don't want to be human.",lonely,"Shitty Title. I Suck At Titles, But I Want To Die Basically.",2021-07-04 16:34:59

Starting off i’ve been through a mass tragedy in the past and mental abuse, I have a lot of anxiety, depression, and insecure but i feel like those traits do make me more loving, compassionate, understanding, and sensitive

I met her on a dating app because I had a hard time meeting girls, we matched and started talking and everything went great, we learned about each other, we never argued, hung out all the time. It was perfect, I always treated her great and took her on nice dates and always respected her, the sex was great too so that wasn’t the issue, one day she told me about how her father beats her sometimes, had been raped in the past by a family member around the same age, abusive ex, and groomed by another ex.

Usually I would run from something like this but I thought we could help each other and help heal eachothers wounds, the relationship was great for a while until yesterday, 

She wanted me to grow a beard so I did but I wasn’t so comfortable with it because it doesn’t fit my style and it was itchy and I asked her if I should and she said I like it but you can if you want, she got mad. I called her out on being mad at me and she got very offended and said I was gaslighting her when I wasn’t. 

After that she mentioned how the night before of how I disagreed with her point of view of sex workers and I said I was disappointed in her but in the end I took back what I said and apologized and we moved on but she decided to mention this while we argued about the beard.

She told me randomly mid argument that she can’t do this because she isn’t good enough for me and that I’m better off without her, I was screaming crying and begging for her to stay, she’s all I have and is my only friend along with being my girlfriend. I told her she can’t throw this all away over something so stupid and we can resolve everything as a team, I also said “why did you get so close with my family and come over all the time and cry about how you didn’t want to go home because you’d get hurt, you became very close with my mom and sister” and she said I was being manipulative, In the end I let her go because it seemed she wanted to.

Later on my friend found out she was on a dating app, also her friend came forward to me saying she lied about being a virgin (besides the rape) and that her sophmore year she had sex with a guy in college (she must’ve been 15 at the time and him 19 which is illegal) along with lying about her being raped and her ex abusing her and her dad beating her.

I talked about it with multiple “friends” and everyone said she seems super mentally unstable, even my parents said she was but never had the heart to warn me.

I am devastated beyond belief and truly hurt, I’m scared everything was a lie, she also gave me stomatitis and I still stayed with her.

Since I can remember, it feels like all of this has started since preschool. I completely remember not playing with any of the other kids, and I clearly remember that I never spoke to anyone. Through middle school and high school, I hated lunch/recess because I would have to sit by myself most of the time. If I was lucky enough to have one friend, then I'd make the most of it, but in general this wasn't the case. I remember in high school during lunch, I would literally just walk by myself throughout the campus during my lunch. I had no one to talk to most of the time, but when I did have my friends (3-4), it seemed like it was hard for me to contribute anything to the conversations. I still had a couple of best friends, these friends I would be able to talk to about almost anything, but it was rare to have the class as them.

moving onto college I felt like I would be able to make new friends. Well I did in a way, but these friends I made came and went. I was NEVER invited to anything. in all of college, I probably went out with friends about 10ish times.

What bugs me most is that I never got invited to anything. and in most instances that I can remember, I would be the guy everyone *likes* but isn't important, is never spoken to, and is never really listened to.

This transferred over to my dating life. I didn't start dating until my sophomore year of college. I would usually get ghosted OR it would seem that they (or me) lost interest. I genuinely though that in these 4 years of college is find someone. People from my high school have told me I've turned ""cool"" and like a really successful guy, but it's funny because none of these people would ever invite to anything.

Everytime I run into some old friends and realize that they didn't invite me, they act all nice and generous to me, but then they quickly leave. I just find it odd, it makes me feel unimportant.

As of now, I'm looking for a summer job before I start my PhD program. In the mean time, I'm at home all day listening to music, reading, doing math, and if I'm not home I go workout. I have gone out with friends/dates a total of 0 times for the past 2 years. If I do go out, I just go to a store and literally buy nothing, I just go for the sake of feeling something. Or I go to skatepark to go skating by myself.

I'm so so lonely, it's very depressing. I have nothing to look forward to, and I genuinely want to sleep all day just because of how montone life is.

4208,SportsMajor,1625374324,1,"I'm just thinking about what was and what could've been back then.

I had plenty of friends from the neighborhood growing up. Our friendships slowly faded though and they're all gone. I might be able to reignite one if I shoot them a message on Facebook, but everyone else I got no way of contacting. 

I used to hangout with my cousins all of the time to make up for the lack of friendships I had. This probably went on for a good 7 years up until the end of 2019 (when I was 17). I knew this wasn't going to last forever, but I made the most of it: ordering food late at night, one time gaming until 8 AM with them, having sleepovers all the time at their place (we all liked it and we did this A LOT during summer '18), watching movies, etc. We haven't talked or seen each other much since though.

In high school, I didn't have many friends. I had one during freshman year, but they became popular and left me. I had one throughout all four years and we were close, but we haven't talked in awhile (and I don't mind that). I knew a lot of people though and have them added on most of social media. I was cool with them. In college, after one year, I have NONE of that and don't expect that to change.

Speaking of high school, I remember when someone I was interested in seemed to drop hints on IG for me to break the ice with them one summer. I never did though because at that point my confidence seemed to shatter (and I have no idea why, but it was slowly falling apart over time) and I was scared to take a chance. That was two years ago and I still want them. Too bad they likely don't want me anymore. That likely became very clear when they stopped viewing my stories actively early on this year after doing so for the past two years. We've actually ran into each other at a park but haven't said a word, that hurts even more.

Speaking of Instagram, I've quit most of social media as well because of this loneliness. All I got left is this Reddit and my 20-follower private Instagram where I save/post memes. Those who I have following may not know it, but they're the people I'm cool with for sure (and they may not know it).

4210,Lynx914,1625373754,1,"Been contemplating on posting for some time now. Originally I thought of social media but I’ve since deleted facebook and Instagram from my phone. This past few years I feel like I’ve been getting more depressed with the thoughts that I have no best friends or close friends really.

Most social interactions was thru working in a office with colleagues. Since taking my own business now to fully virtual structure this has really pushed my thoughts even further. More freedom sure.. but now I’m mainly on my own with no interactions with others like when I worked elsewhere. But even then that was more of a working relationship. Which made me realize how I really don’t have anyone I can call a close or best friend.

I’m married now 11 years now and my wife I do consider my best friend. But I can’t suffocate her with my needs. She has friends that she considers close and still hangs out with since her younger years. I can’t say the same for me. Any friends I had were like classmates, we talked yeah but never hanged out or stayed close after school.

I didn’t consider myself unsightly either, everyone commented on my decent looks but I was a loner, very socially awkward. My teen years I mainly went to school and work right after. Since I was 16 I practically worked mostly. Looking back on it all I can’t help but feel I wasted 20 years of my life not living more of a life or having social experiences. 

Was working the issues? Instead of going home after work and playing a game should have I forced myself to get out, the thoughts keep running thru me but in the end I keep getting faced with the reality that time has passed already. There’s no turning back the clock.

Two years into this relationship that everyone thinks is perfect, and I want to run away. I’ve never in my life been lied to this much, betrayed, disrespected, and neglected emotionally and sexually. 

Self esteem? HA! I used to have that. Where did it go? 

I think a piece of me dies every time I look into his blue eyes and I know he’s lying again. I don’t know how much left of me there is. 

Yet… here I stay. What’s wrong with me? I like being alone. I was happy alone. Did I get caught up in the illusion of happiness? Did the warmth of sleeping next to another body make me forget how clear my brain can be when it’s not swarmed with doubt and criticism?  With OCD intrusive thoughts and anxiety caused by his discrepancies? 

Who have I become? 

Is my mental sanity and my dignity worth having somebody in my life? 

I mean. Loneliness isn’t too bad, right? 
You eat what you want. You have time for hobbies. You work out more. You focus on your goals.  You build friendships and look for things to do and people to meet. 

I’m an introvert, so that’s slightly my worst nightmare lol, but it beats being lied to all the time. 

I miss feeling respected. I miss feeling loved. All I want is to find my person one day. The person I can rest my head on his shoulders and feel safe. No lies. Trust. Protection. Unity. 

I can’t feel like we’re a team if I’m constantly being lied to. I just can’t. I can’t trust anymore. 

I think I’m just lonely. And the thoughts of leaving make me feel lonelier (also quick funny thing, my auto corrected “lonelier” to “kinkier at first LMAO I wish!)

I’m also actually afraid that I’m done. That’s it. I’m so freaking traumatized after this relationship that I’m DONE. I literally never want a relationship again. Fuck marriage. 

I really just want to make a lot of money, build a modern house with a big garage, ride motorcycles, have cats, and have a job I actually love and I’m good at. I used to pray for a good boyfriend. I used to pray to God on my knees to bring me somebody honest and good. I’ve had too much bad in my life. I think I deserve something good. 

And God gave me yet another experience to learn from. 

Why? WHY. I’m not even religious and I’m still mad. I deserve a shot at happiness too. Don’t I? I atleast deserve respect and loyalty.  (Note to friends—never date a people pleaser. They’ll put everyone in front of you)

I’m struggling to keep the few friendships I have and barely even have the motivation to anymore, I’m struggling in school and work, and have become literally antisocial. I don’t even feel like myself anymore - I am such an emotional/sensitive/empathetic/people lover “mom friend” and all of that is gone. I just feel broken.

The good news is, I’m moving in a few months to a state where I already have a friend group (currently online friends), my boyfriend, and will start going to in person classes again so the days of continued isolation are numbered.

Either that or really happy and well resolved with myself.

Am I being too greedy? I keep making the characters in my novel act out all the silly little things I long for, but lately even imagining them makes me feel uneasy - and just to clarify, I'm not upset about the fact that some people get to be happy like this.

I built my brother a computer in November, and bought him a game he already owns (Destiny 2) on top of that, and he'd rather play on his Xbox. I told him about this game that's on sale right now (Risk of Rain 2) that I'd be willing to buy for him, and he still says no

This same game (Risk of Rain 2), my friend told me about it, even though I've known about it for months. I never bought it or mentioned it to my friend because I figured he wouldn't want to play it. Or, what he is doing now actually, is not playing it anymore and rather playing a new game (Outriders). He says he has ""videogame ADHD"", and only sticks to two games in particular, which I don't play. One (Path of Exile) is a game I've tried a few times to get into but just isn't for me, the other I played on and off for nearly 10 years (World of Warcraft) and I refuse to play anymore. Anyway, I bought Risk of Rain 2 because he said he bought it, but now he is already moved onto another new game, which I am not interested in

My best friend of 5+ years isn't responding to the texts in our group chat. I told him we're playing Risk of Rain 2 with no response. I texted him the next day with his name and a question mark, and still nothing

Another friend, she just got a computer recently, but she doesn't have money for games. I asked if she would be interested in a game I was looking at (Viscera Cleanup Detail) and she said sure, so I bought a copy for me and a copy for her. She wasn't able to play that night I bought it, which is no big deal. The next day I'm talking to her and I know she plays Golf With Friends, so I buy that. We played 2 rounds and then I had to get off for the night for dinner and such. We haven't played since

My girlfriend is extremely busy for the summer. She is living at a camp ground all summer, with only 1 day off a week. However, she only works about 6 hours a day. The rest of the time she spends sleeping in, doing art, playing videogames, watching tv, and occasionally having parties. Unfortunately, guests aren't allowed on this campground due to some incident in the past few years. She will come see me late Friday nights, stay with me, hang out with me during the day Saturday until she has to leave in the afternoon for work, then back to my place again late Saturday night, then she's with me all day Sunday. Unfortunately, if there is a party going on, she'll ask if she can go to it. I want her to be happy, so I say yes, but it bothers me that she sees all these people all day everyday from Mon-Fri, then still chooses to see them over me on the weekends

For a very long time in my life i have been dealing with problems related to sexual stuff. Since a young age I have been incredibly addicted to porn and bdsm kinks later on for a while to. I always was a very boring person in general, so when i met people, or talked with ""friends"", the only thing I'd ever joke about was porn and I would almost talk about porn all the time or kinks or fantasies of mine or people we knew. Because porn was the only thing I watched, and also i always fapped to it every single day and sometimes twice or 3 times a day.
Whenever i was sad, or just angry, i would fap to relieve myself and watch my favorite porn videos. Over time I developed fantasies and so everytime I see a girl or go in public and talk with people I always imagine the most disturbing sexual things u can imagine with that person. And so It gave me lots of difficulties to interact with people already that I am a lonely person in general and made it harder since I only talk about porn and fantasies and in my head all that comes up is fantasies and disturbing thoughts of that person. I no longer want to go in public or be with people because sometimes the sexual thoughts and fantasies are too strong. I get sexually attracted to someone extremely easily and when I love someone I cant stop loving them, and that created me other problems. Just a cute voice of a girl or like a girl touching my hand or even a girl just being near me I'm only going to think about the stuff I'm talking about and I'm going to be extremely sexually attracted to that girl and think it's love and see it in a very deep way. Sometimes it's like voices in my head and telling myself disturbing sexual related stuff. Recently I've talked to a girl online (because I only talk to people online since I have no real life friends and it's easier for me to talk to them) and and she's 13 and stuff she's she's young, yet when she talked to me via call discord j instantly became extremely sexually attracted to her, I'm scared. I don't know what to do, I've been dealing with this all my life, and I've never been able to change or stop any of it.

My bm even though we are  nice to each other would much rather have me wiped from their existence. My parents well my mother doesn’t care for me at all. Although she doesn’t want others to see that as she more concern of others perception of her. My father well he is hateful mean to everyone I think it has to with sun Down syndrome. My brothers live multiple states away. We don’t get along and haven’t talked in sometime. I came from very broken home. When I was younger I thought how my family was that it was normal but it wasn’t (not getting in details). It took a lot of years and 1 complete rock bottom to realize that. I did manage to pick myself up and get my life back on track. But after very short marriage stint with a narcissist something finally broke in me. I thought give it time and I be back to the old me. 3 years later and I’ve gotten worse. I have no friends mostly my fault I push anyone and everyone away that I think is trying to close or that I think has bad intent. I deal with a lot of abandonment issues, anxiety, and depression. I try to keep it all well hidden by acting like this carefree comedian of some sort with anyone that I interact with. I spend most of my free time abusing alcohol with some weird hope I might drink myself to death. I’m not suicidal and I don’t feel like I’m a addict. I’m just extremely lonely after doing chores around the house or going to gym. There not much else to help keep my mind off relentless negative thoughts. I have tried to make new friends and reconnect with old ones I try to go in with open mind and at first it starts good but then I get distant and start self sabotage myself I suppose. Romantic relationships are a absolute no go to for me. I haven’t any interest in type of thing for at least 3 years. And when someone does make an effort in that way I end up being distant and feeling like a sociopath. My Self worth self esteem it’s all very low.

How can I start this off? I'm sporadic in my thoughts and constantly beating myself up mentally for being so dumb and ignorant at times. When I'm not down on myself, I'm barely holding it together wishing someone would see how torn and broken I feel on the inside. 

I deal with wanting to be a good person and help everyone but I'm not thinking fully so I get lost in the dust when I just am trying to be good. I never really had support or genuine care growing up. Most of the time it was discipline with criticism and harsh words. 

I feel as though no matter how hard I try to reach out and get help. I'm just left to drown in my own struggles. I could use a friend. Someone that maybe is a bit more motivated to try and help me get into a better mindset. I've been working on it for a long time with one issue at a time. Not fully getting rid of the problems just managing them better.

My so-called friends are nothing but a bunch of snakes. I give up on being social and will turn into a complete loner if I haven't already...

Are these the first steps to sociopathy?

I sincerely can't put into words how demeaning I feel. I have no one to talk to, no one to go out with, or no one to trust.

Hey, so I'm 21M like you've read and I'm in the final semester of my college. I will be graduating in a couple of weeks with a job lined up for me in a month.

But this post isn't about that.

So I am a quite selective and aloof person in general. I can count the number of friends I have on my fingers. And that's never been a problem for me, even though a series of harsh events in school has got me into this state in the first place (that's a conversation for another day).

But ever since the pandemic hit, with all the lockdowns and distancing happening, it's been really difficult for me to get out there and meet new people. That sucks cos I had actually told myself I'd be more outgoing and talk to people and make new relations. And this pandemic hasn't helped.

In addition, to make matters worse, I am a night owl who sleeps at around 2-3 am doing work, or writing, or playing something. And it's starting to get really lonely, and it feels like I'm locked up in this room all day, wasting away my youth and missing out on all the things people are doing/ have already done in my age range. To make matters worse, I had broken up with someone last year due to some reasons and now I wish I hadn't. As much as I think about her, I know that this is my loneliness talking and it isn't right for me to text her again. So now I'm fighting that urge and the thought that maybe I shouldn't have broken up with her. Sheesh.

So if anyone, preferably in the age range 19-23, is looking for someone to talk to, do drop a text or comment below. I don't mind talking to anyone but if you're looking for a relationship, it would be better if you were female and living in India. It doesn't have to be NSFW, I'm alright with settling for a friend, and if it goes to be more than that, then better right?

Few things about me:

\-Engineer who dabbles in writing

\-I can make memes for you, sometimes cook too

\-LOVE Dogs, sadly don't have one tho (dad doesn't approve)

\-I'm a great listener, can and will try to help if in need

\-Enjoys watching Movie/Shows, like Horror/True crime content a lot

\-Sucker for deep meaningful conversations (mostly late at night xD)

Would love to connect with y'all!

4292,SeeYouN3xtTuesday,1625341539,1,"Honestly man, I’ve always found birthdays difficult. I find this one especially difficult. My gf of 2 wonderful years moved on (before me, obviously). 

She called me to wish me a happy birthday last night and it destroyed me. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it for the past 14 hours. 

Now here I am with the regular heartbreak I call ‘birthday’, compounded with all the questions of breaking up w a best friend/partner. 

I had thought about whether she would call— I didn’t think so, as she’d forgotten my birthday the last year, why would this one be different. 

Well, now that we’re apart, she remembers my birthday. Knowing how difficult it is for me to talk to her (breakup is very fresh— and I’d asked for space); knowing the difficulty, she called. And seeing her name on my phone instigated the fastest onset panic attack I’ve ever had. 

I picked up.. I’m not the kind to ignore phone calls. Man do I regret picking up— she was nice, wished me a happy birthday, asked to chat for a few. I couldn’t pull myself out of the quiet anxiety attack I was going thru, so I was short with her.  I didn’t know how to act, how to be. I know she’s moving on and I’m upset at her for it. I’m happy for her, but upset for me.

I miss my best friend. Birthdays have always been tough and lonely— but they’re ESPECIALLY tough and lonely after feeling loved after a long time— then having it pulled away.

Basically everyday just becoming so boring after i finished my high school. I want to study further to university but i had to wait until January of next year to apply for it. That means im free to do anything i want this year but quarantine literally makes the whole thing all worse. 

I want to work part time but many businesses suffers because of the pandemic. And also im a bit shy on finding work. Everyone is probably suffering right now. And im getting bored waking up and repeating the same shit just to entertain myself or distracting myself. 

And the more day passes the more things seems more uninteresting. I played games more and more and i found it not fun anymore. I played games with my friends and its getting boredom too, they have school so they basically busy at some time but the point is even though we spend time together im still getting tiresome of it. I watch a lot of anime and read some manga, and its getting me bored too at some point. Idk how to fill this empty feelings, something just felt lost.

I probably have everything tbh, i have a good phone which im proud of, i can do a lot of stuff with my phone, i have a decent pc, although im thinking of upgrading it because its really an old pc (still using ddr3 ram btw) but i can play any games with low settings basically not a problem i still can entertain myself with my pc, i can do alot of stuff with it! Watching YouTube, twitch, playing games and more. And yet i found it getting boring every single day. I wanna work to earn money which i originally plan after graduating high school but pandemic happens. I bought some shirt in order to make myself a bit happy having new things with my parents money. The government give us free fund to make us buy things in order to stabilize the economy too which is good. Bought Witcher 3 with the fund(steam summer sale) and gave some of the fund to my brother too.

Im getting worse day by day, and honestly needs some changes. Idk how i can survive until next year if i have to repeat the same day everyday. Even spending time with friends with online games makes me exhausted. I can't figure out a way to change. Maybe i should start exercising but im skinny and i have anemia. 

Maybe all i need is physical touch with human. Meet up with friend would probably can help me feels better, seeing a good friend face to face after a long time. I have this opportunity just this morning and my parents denied my wish to see my friends because of the pandemic. ""U may get infected by the virus if u went to your friends house""says my mom. Maybe this is the reason why im writing all this. 

Im living in a good condition, i dont have any family problems, so i live comfortably. But having my parents to see me just go downstairs to eat and spending all my time in my room kinda feels bad(my house is a bit small after all). I have things that can entertain me. I have a lot of movies i havent watch, lots of games that still waiting to be play in my steam library, lots of artists that i haven't listen in Spotify. I have everything maybe.

Im really in a dire condition. I feel empty day by day getting bored and now i kinda understand how my friend that i used to comfort every night feels like.

Those few minutes where we were together felt so validating and made me happy, but it was just platonic. It hurts. It hurts so much, I desperately wish I could hold someone in my arms and care for them, I’ve tried dating apps, I’ve asked out lots of girls I was on good terms with, zero results.

4316,ac5d82f94b,1625329947,1,"He broke up with me at the end of May. I wasn't expecting it. I just thought we were going to talk through the argument we'd had and make up. Instead the conversation went deeper and deeper and then suddenly he was saying he wanted to end it.

Over the next few days he wasn't very receptive. It turns out a friend had removed him from a group chat and he thought I was pushing him away. I'd updated my Netflix password and downgraded our Duo account to a student account for me, just on anxious impulse. I didn't mean to hurt him. And I was furious that my friend intervened and didn't consult me.

A week or two later we talked all night on a call. We even played a few matches of a game together, and some further ones with a friend of his too. I thought it was a positive sign. I was hopeful. He said he still had feelings. He wouldn't say no to a possible future together.

But then a week later in another call it's like the opposite was true. Before it even started he said about the call I'd asked for that we should just ""get it over with"". He said his feelings are gone and he doesn't love me anymore. He said he didn't see a future for us and wouldn't say that he could see us ever getting back together. He was cold. Nothing I said made a scrap of difference. And he said the previous call convinced him I could be a good friend,  but not partner. Adding to other things he'd only told me after the break up, he said I make him anxious. That even hearing the notification noise on his phone makes him worry it's me messaging him. Since when?!

It's been two weeks. I poured my heart out to him and apologised. I feel incredibly guilty even though he never told me he had these feelings, and I couldn't have changed anything without him speaking up. I worry about how much he's started smoking even though it's not my responsibility to care anymore. I miss talking to him. I miss caring about him and taking care of him when he wasn't doing well. I miss his company and his laughter and just everything about our relationship, even the struggles. Because I didn't mind the difficulties. I loved him.

I hope that time might bring his feelings back. I hope that we can try again now that I actually know how he feels. I wish he would give things a shot and see how it goes. But until then... I just feel so alone. I feel empty. My mind is constantly occupied with thoughts about how I failed him and how he also failed me by not communicating. I hate myself for making him feel too uncomfortable to talk to me, but I also hate that he didn't bring up his discomfort so we could have resolved it.

All of my friends are sick of me talking about the break up. They've heard it all before in my previous one, and this one is both worse and better than last time. I want him to come back more than anything and I'm willing to do the work on myself needed - I've started on it already - but I have no idea if he'll ever see me in that way again. I don't even know if he cares.

4319,waluigis-tacostand,1625328708,1,"Six days ago, I went to a Christian youth summer camp hoping that I would be able to bounce back from quarantine. When I got to camp, I met three boys and two staff leaders who seemed nice and started to build a connection during dinner on the first day we were there. Everything seemed fine, we got our cabin, and I thought things would be better than last year’s camp. 

Holy shit was I dead wrong. 

The next day I tried to start up a conversation, and everyone completely ignored me and turned away from me. At first I thought maybe they didn’t understand what I was talking about, but then the same shit happened over and over again. But what happens when anyone else said anything? Then of course my cabin mates would laugh or crack up another joke. No matter how much I tried to talk to them, it always ended in a blank stare or a small nod. 

Then came the activities. It was impossible to have the slightest amount of fun because I never made any friends and I was deathly afraid of burdening my cabin mates. The only time my name was ever mentioned throughout the entire week was if they told me a car was coming or to get out of their way. 

The worst part was that I knew I was supposed to be having fun and just like all the other kids, but all I could think about was how much my cabin mates hated me and how alone I was when the whole point of going to this camp was to not feel so alone. I felt every last ounce of what little confidence I had drain out every minute of the day. I hid in the bathroom and cried at least twice a day on average. 

I never experienced anything related to jesus at all, and I didn’t understand anything about praying for each other and all the other great things about coming to camp because I was the only one who only experienced one of the darkest points in my life. It brought back many traumatic times back from middle school when I was bullied nearly every day and never made any friends.

On top of that, my family and I were kicked out of our house for about a month to repair drywall damage. Now I sit here curled up crying super hard, unsure if it’s worth even trying to have a social life again.",lonely,Sitting in bed crying,2021-07-04 02:11:48

We reconnected two years ago but it was never the same. We haven't spoken since.

I miss her every day. I miss that kind of closeness and intimacy with a best friend. I miss being able to openly share every thought, opinion, and secrets without feeling judged or abandoned. I miss our little moments, our every day second of moment together. I miss our shared inside jokes and laughs. I miss her every damn day.

Then last year happened, even with the virus we stayed in contact but last June I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the thought of never skating again got immediately imprinted in my mind and I closed myself off again, I didn't keep in contact as often and slowly lost my friends, I know it's my fault but I am alone again and I don't enjoy it anymore.

4335,Asleep-Orchid-1597,1625312828,1,"So my really close friend(let’s call him A ‘M23’) has a GF (call her B ‘F21’) they’ve been together for 3 years. Recently, A started to talk to a girl called C ‘F22’ He knows C from years when he met both B and C at the same time since they were friends at the time. A and C apparently had feelings for each other at that time but they couldn’t do anything bc C had a BF. 
Anyways so A has a relationship with B until now, and kept a friendship with C just as friends, and last year C broke up with her BF. 
A few months ago, A and C start to talk more and have feelings for each other again. A told me at that time and I was really confused as to how he would do that to his GF, B. So months pass by and he keeps on talking to C and hanging out with her. Mind you, I never met C at the time but I knew who she is as a friend of my friend, while I met B multiple times and all was cool. 

So last month, A introduced me to C while he was at my house and they were chatting on video call. Days later, A and C passed by my house and we sat in the car and this is where I met her face to face. Everything was fine and normal for the next month. During this month, I spent most of the time with A and therefore C was always there either in real life or on video call. I got on really well with C and I cracked a lot of jokes and made her laugh, and we once (with A being there) did a roleplay while on video call that she is my gf and that I am flirting with her since I never had a gf so I was practicing chatting to girls with her. So really that was just a fun thing to do and was all cool. In that month, I hanged out with A alot and therefore I met and talked to C on vc alot. Mind you that both of them acknowledge that they are not in a relationship with eachother yet due to B still being A’s gf. 

Last week, I “M21” suddenly start to have feelings for C since we got on really well and we always flirted as a *joke*. Note that everytime I talk to C is in the presence of A. Yesterday night, A was in my house and was on a vc with C. Everytime the phone was in my hands, whether A was next to me or left to do something, it was clear that C was being cold with A while being just a bit more energetic with me, whether that is because she doesn’t know me that long or she actually can’t stand A anymore given the fact that he still has B as his gf, I really don’t know. After the vc ended with her wanting to sleep, A sent C a meme 20 mins after ,which she replied to and then they started arguing on chat, and A left my room and went to the living room where he stayed there for minimum an hour which then I fell asleep. I am 100% sure that I wasn’t mentioned in their argument because really all the feelings for her are in my head and I’m pretty certain that she doesn’t have feelings for me and they are not even thinking about me. Him leaving the room and arguing with her reminded me that I’m nothing in this situation, I’m just the lonely friend.

While they were arguing on chat and I was alone in the room, I decided to crush my feelings and stop asking A about her and try to tone down a bit when talking to her because all those signals that she is giving me are hurting me and she is playing with my heart although I’m pretty sure she did not mean it and has no feelings towards me. It pains me to stop flirting and joking with her but really this is for me and my health because I can’t keep on doing such things to myself. I have to end my feelings towards her.

 I keep asking myself, what if she actually likes me? How is it fair that A has 2 girls that love him while I am alone for 21 years? Why isn’t this girl mine? Why do I have these weird feelings? What if she starts to like me soon? When will my turn come? When will someone ever love me? How is life fair? I like this girl man. I feel so happy when I talk her. This really hurts.

The results of  my effort from 5 months ago till now is that I am still lonely...

I have reached out to people here on reddit and I have created friendships among people but I know I am boring and not interesting to talk too so yeah they eventually either stopped talking to me or talk to me once in awhile...I even became friends with someone whom I talked to a lot in the beginning of our friendship but has slowly died down after awhile. Like we don't talk a lot like how we used too and it is not their fault. I don't blame them. I don't blame people for loosing interest in talking to me. I understand people are busy with their lives or that they have better things to do than just talk to me. I also understand that I am not fun, funny, beautiful, or wanted. There is nothing wrong with me being not fun, funny, beautiful or not wanted. I accept it. I accept the truth of these traits of me...I always known but I have always denied it or tried to change it because I didn't want to have this lonely depressing feeling within me...within my heart. But I believe I am accepting it now, I am accepting this lonely depressing empty feeling. I have been fighting it since I was in the 1st grade.

I remember in the 1st grade how much I desperately just wanted to make friends. I saw how beautiful friendship can be. How other children share and talk with each other. How they always stay put together and do things together. I remember I wanted that feeling. I didn't want to be alone. People bullied and made fun of me because of my ugly appearance and how weird I am for being myself. I did eventually made some friends in elementary school but I lost contact with them. Now that I am older, I still have this lonely depressing empty feeling and I am just done trying. Events in my life recently have made me realize that I don't deserve to be happy. Events in my life recently have made me realize that I don't deserve to be in love. Events in my life recently have made me realize that I don't deserve to have dreams. Events in my life recently have made me realize that I should accept that  I deserve to be lonely.

It’s weird and idfk how to describe it other than I know that I am there, I know I am alive and I’m doing “ok”, but I don’t actually feel it. I don’t feel present?

I know that. But tbh, what I really need is a hug. Someone who could just hold me tight and tell me that I’m gonna be okay. I guess I’m depressed. I’ve recently gotten into getting tattoos and I understand now why people cut their wrists. Something about the pain, the actual physical trauma just feels so damn good.

I need love. I need comfort. I’ve just been dying for intimacy with someone. Maybe that would make me feel something. Maybe lover would help.

I’ll come home from hanging out with people and I’ll feel a big void. If I don’t have anything to do for the day I feel so sad, and I am somewhat socially awkward and it feels hard to make plans.

Every time I try to date it gets messed up. I know I’m still young but it’s so painful. They always end up being too busy, or too far away, or just not what I’m looking for. I was just talking to this guy from Tinder and we were gonna go on a date and he seemed wonderful and all of a sudden he decides to tell me then that he is 16. 

I feel so unlikable or something. I’ve also been trying to improve my loneliness by reaching out to people on here but it seems like every single friendship or whatever I have online always fizzles out, whether I lose interest or they do. I don’t know why I lose interest if I’m so lonely, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It just becomes so tiring to continue a relationship when I can’t talk to them in real life

Last year at this point I was actively suicidal, and have been on and off until a couple months ago. Now it’s in the back of my head for parts of the day, as opposed to at the front of my mind. I also have chronic fatigue and it makes maintaining social relationships so difficult.

Secondary school was absolutely horrible for me I was probably the only kid in the school that hated break time and lunch time. During lunch time I'd walk around the whole school hoping to find the 1 supposed friend I had and if I couldn't find her I'd just walk around the whole school till lunch time was over, break time was a bit easier as it was only 15 minutes. Fast forward to when I'm 15 I start to catfish and I catfished 2 people in total  because I wanted to talk to someone and feel like I actually had a friend. 1 of the girls I catfished later became my online gf and I told her I was a catfish but she still accepted me and I was very sorry for what I did and explained to her why I did what I did. Fast forward about 1 year and  a half she breaks up with me and still sent me into a dark place, multiple suicide attempts and life long self harm scars. What really hurt me was that 2 days after our break up she was with another guy and you can imagine the pain I was feeling, I had lost my only friend, gf and found out she was with someone else 2 days later. We continued to talk for 2 years on and off , I tried to move on from her but she was my first love (I wasn't hers so easier for her to get over me) so it was 10x harder for me to move on. As time went by she was having sex with other guys, getting with other guys and when I'd find out it was heartbreaking as I still loved her deeply even after 2 years. She has a right to live her life as she pleases but it really really broke me and I still hurt to this day.

Me:hey

Me: how you doing today? What you interested in?

4393,koyione,1625274078,1,"2018 my hubby of 17 years got cancer.  1 year trying anything to save him. 1 year being his personal nurse watching my athlete whither away.  

We both have big families.  We both had so many friends.  Those 2 years - it was just us. Not one person came by or kept their promise to visit - much less help.  That broke him. He never knew I could hear him crying from the loneliness and loss.  

So instead, I spoiled him rotten. I made his dreams come true until he could no longer leave his bed. I kept him smiling, laughing, well fed and deeply loved.  I held him and read to him, played games, did karaoke for him, wrote poetry just for him.  

One morning, he lost his sight and frantically hit the bed. So I got into bed with him and he pulled himself up into my arms. God, that must have hurt so much - the cancer having eaten everything inside him from his under his heart to his upper thighs. He held on so tight.  I held him and sang to him and kept telling him how much I loved him - promising to always take care of him.  Promising to find him in our next lives.  And he passed. He was 48. 

And it broke me. 

I did it alone. The treatments, hospital and meds bankrupted us.  Our house, our vehicles, savings, retirements, home assets - all gone.  I had a ring that I was hiding for him for our 20th anniversary.  I sold that to cremate and buy his forever resting place.  With the remainder, I moved into a little apartment to start over.  At 47. 600sq ft of boxes - 20 years of our lives.  

But I smile and carry on.    

 And I am so lonely.  

So much so that I have been attempting to cultivate new friendships - but it is hard. Especially when you can clearly hear what people really say.   

A year ago I met this nice guy where I live.  A smiling, happy, friendly guy with a good heart.  It took everything I had to ask him if we could be friends.  One big smile and he agreed.  We had beers and talked.  He invited me to a party. But like everything in life, we move on. Nowadays we chat, maybe once a month for a few minutes  while standing outside. I know how popular he is and feel bad stopping him to chat. I imposing on his time - so I do my best to keep it short. He always smiles. 

I am not even a blip on is radar - and rightfully so.  He is focused on life - his future.  

I am at the other end with nothing to offer.  

So why does this hurt so much?",lonely,"It is what it is, right?",2021-07-03 11:01:18

4404,Throw4w4a,1625271217,1,"Hello Guys.

Im not the type to complain, so this account is a throwaway (nor do i have anyone irl to vent to anyway), but its been weighing on my life and affecting me immensely, so thanks to anyone who took the time to read ahead and give me their insight. So please hear me out.

If its any relevant Im a 21y.o F.

So I left social media very young, around 16y.o because Facebook had caused me to get caught up some problems even irl, so i just deactivated my account, forever. Same for Instagram later on in 2017-ish bcs i didnt feel it helped me much nor do i wanted to share too much with people as I am a private person.

Since I left high school and went deep into my studies, i obviously felt a big decline in the number of friends and basically now have no one i cherish or just someone to hang out with. And not to toot my own horn, but I am told im attractive, smart and loveable person. However, my lack of social media presence seems to raise people's eyebrows a lot. understand where theyre coming from tho, but its way too much effect, its like they think im a freak or someome mentally impaired or have something to hide... I just life freely and do other things with my time.

Covid, lockdowns and reopening all have made me feel incredibly lonely and starving for some meaningful relationship with people. Im a young girl in her eatly 20s, Im supposed to be having fun and building solid links with people, yet here I am lonely and feeling incredibly detached from everybody around me.

In college, people like me, as I am fun and engaging, but it rarely goes further than irl interactions, or the occasional Whatsapp conversation (the only ""social media"" besides reddit that im on). I have made a Facebook account earlier in the year because of covid to keep track with school stuff and possibly meet new people im my college.

So despite me being, relatively good looking, very chill and loving to people, fun etc, If u see me irl you would think im the most populatlr and sociable person there is . Yet i cant help but feel people are weirded out and keep their distances even if ie we hung out all day and such. My lack of online presence, as in posting, constant updates etc, just seem to discourage people from taking any chances on me, as if im a risky bet.. I feel so sad and isolated all the time. My old friends i still keep contact with, but like me, most are buay or moves elsewhere for a job or studies, my childhood best friend broke up with me for some guy she started dating... Everything is adding up and it truly feels like its only me vs the world..

So I wanna take matters into my hands and do something about this, as I dont wish to waste my ""golden years"" being lonely and living in mediocrity. I am solliciting your help dear redditors, any insights would be helpful. 

Tried Tinder for a while, nothing but booty calls and people again being weirded out and thinking im a catfish or shady because i have no other social media to link them to.


I was even thinking about making an insta account from scratch, but its so weird joining SO LATE, and adding new ppl and having no likes and comments on the pics i could potentially post, because yes i have no one close atm in my life, and frankly i doubt anyone would care if I died tomorrow.

I love trying new restaurants, and each time i wanna go i just feel so heartbroken having no one to call up or invite. I can see the pity in my mom's eyes when i tell her my friends are busy or are not living in my city anymore.  So im home most of the time. With Covid i barely even stepped out of the house...

I'm 15 yrs old and I don't have friends I guess. I live in Bulgaria (a Country in Europe). 

When I was something about 11 years old I just learned Russian by myself. No one in my family doesn't speaks this language. Now all of my thoughts, ideas, jokes, etc are in Russian.  For me, it's very uncomfortable to speak my native language and make new friends, or perhaps a girlfriend. I just can't talk with them in this way I want it.  I used a lot of my time to search for some ways to get to Russia as soon as possible but this is impossible. My family is not poor, but obviously not that rich to pay for my school education, rent, bills, and all of this stuff in a country like Russia and especially in a big city when i am just 15. I tried to make Russian friends here (In Bulgaria), but I didn't manage with them. IT'S just very hard for me to build a good conversation.  All of my music, YouTubers that I watch, news that I read are in Russian and I don't know what to do:( Ig I need to wait until the moment when I get 18 and just go to a Russian university, but I don't want to spend the next 3 years like this, only by myself. I don't know what to do... I'm so bored. Always falling in jealousy and looking at my very small collection of happy memories.

""You aren't entitled to anything""

Wow congrats you realised that people choice and free will to decide who the interact with.

You think that helps? You think that makes us feel any better? All you've done is remind us how useless and unlovable we are.

You're right that we aren't entitled to people feelings but hell. Are we not entitled to be loved by someone? Are we not due our break from whatever the universe is putting us through. Are we not allowed to be loved by others?  

Suicide talk:
""It will get better""
""You just have to keep going""

How do you know? How do you know we haven't been trying for however long? How do you know that things will get better when I'm 17 and I see people with the same problems as me who are in their mid 30's what do you know about my life that I haven't known about while trying to live it?

And why? Why should I keep going when I know that nothing will change and all I'd be doing is subjecting myself to more of the torture that brought to this point in the first place? 

""Trying the same thing and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity.

General:
""You're not alone we're here""

As nice as it is and as nice as its intention is we don't register comments and DM's as social interaction. Like I have one friend who I message on snapchat everyday. That doesn't change the fact that I haven't hugged anyone in year and have all but forgotten what that feels like. We are in pain and isolation and I'm sorry but a few comments and messages from people we've never met before doesn't help as often as people seem to think.


The reality is we are alone we feel alone and it hurts so much to the point where some of us me included have the desire to end our lives. It fucking hurts to the point where an unknown void of oblivion sounds better than trying to keep going in this cold and dark state. Sure sometimes someone can start a DM and care like really care and give you time and that helps. The thing is we are like a starved animal. Except instead of food it's social interaction and just love that we've missed out on. So when someone throws us some food we know at it as much as we can and for as long as possible with all our energy. So yeah we come off as needy or we get way too attached way too fast.

I was hurt by people, friends and family, and for a decade I been dealing with depression that's eating me away and so I am eating away my feelings with food and yeah my issues just keep growing but who wants to hear about that. 

Today I had a breakdown though and I started missing my old friends and that awful school life that sure felt like I was alive with all the emotional rollercoasters and troubles and fun with people. And I realized I've been pushing away everyone who tried to befriend me. It's just comfortable being alone, even if it gets awfully lonely at times. 

Do you ever look back on old memories and realize you treated some people wrong or you let others treat you wrong? I can't believe that there was a time I wouldn't have a moment of peace with all the friends and after school texting with a bunch of people, gossiping about teachers or planning silly pranks on classmates.

4477,VinceEra,1625226298,1,"  Hey, never posted to this sub, but I definitely know how many people here feel. At age 16 my family turned against me, tossed me out on the street, left me to rot, I lost many friends, struggled for years, but in the end I met some phenomenal people, people who lifted me up, made me successful, when I thought my own dire situation was beyond fixing, so I figured I'd extend a hand to anyone who needs it, not out of pity, and not to be a robotic fortune cookie reader of fake life advice, but I'd love to be a true friend to anyone who needs it.
  
  I know how it feels to feel like everything in life is stacked against you for various reasons, whether they were in your control or not in your control at all, and I dont wanna be a cheap inspirational speaker, because for most people that is certainly the last thing they need, if you would like to chat, form a close friendship, talk about tv shows, whatever you study, your occupation, videogames, music, literature, pets, I would certainly be happy to chat with you. Religion, gender, age, and appearance mean absolutely nothing to me, everyone deserves a chance, the world doesnt need to be perceived as superficial, and on a platform where I never need to see your face your personality means everything.
  
  I apologise for the rant, maybe nobody will see this, maybe somebody will, and maybe we will become close friends, you dont have to be a perfect conversationalist, maybe you arent much of a talker, maybe you don't do much at all lately, that can change, if youd like to play games, watch something together, even chat about something as simple as weather, a catalyst for beautiful friendship doesnt need to start with complex conversation, and conversation certainly shouldn't feel forced. Anyway, if you actually took the time to read all of this I appreciate you, I'm not a big reddit user so I apologise if that is apparent, however I'd love to get to know some people here, and I wonder how some of you are lonely, because some of the posts here are truly beautiful and inspirational, anyway, I truly hope you have an excellent morning, afternoon, or evening depending on where you are today.",lonely,If You Need This,2021-07-02 21:44:58

I don’t have friends irl bc I distanced myself from everyone, I haven’t got anyone to talk to, but I do have 3 online friends who I’ve been talking to for over a year now, though they barely reply to me. 

Idk do yall ever feel the need to just have that one best friend who sees you as number 1 as much as you see them as no1? I’ve never really had that, my friends never viewed me as number 1, but I’ve always put them first. I did have a friend who was so close to me, but she went into uni and now she has other friends, we distanced from each other. She just threw away our 6 year friendship like it meant nothing so it hurts. 

I used to be able to tell her about my day, I’d go into so much detail and she would too but slowly she’d stop replying so much, only adding a word after 3 months in uni, it just sucks.

But the only comforting thing for me is that whenever I help them-- when they want me to do a favor for them, ask for some advices, or even some financial concerns (which are seldom because I don't have much money as I, myself, is in need of money also), and anything that will solve their problems.

She was the only person I looked forward to seeing, hell, the only person I didn’t get sick of or low-key dread having to meet up with. She cared about me in a way no one else has at a time when no one else would. She had her issues, but to me, she was perfect. So of course I fell completely in love with her.

Long story short, she didn’t feel the same way. Pair that with the fact that I had been straining the friendship already with my stupid unstable behaviour and my seeming inability to improve which probably stressed her the fuck out at times. So it’s not a huge mystery that the friendship fell apart pretty shortly after I admitted I had feelings for her. 

We don’t talk much anymore at all, haven’t seen her in person for almost 2 years. Might occasionally get a text from her every couple months or so, but I can never seem to get her to respond more than about 4-5 times before she’s gone for another couple months.

I don’t care, shit happens, it might hurt like hell when it happens but you just have to get over it. But that’s the part that I can’t fucking do. It’s been almost two years and I still don’t know how to get the fuck over it. It still think about her all the time, fucking miss her. It’s stupid, I don’t even know if I’d want to be friends again cause it would probably be more painful than anything else but I still miss her for some fucking reason. 

I just want her out of my head and I hoped that time would make that happen but it’s been so long and it doesn’t feel any easier. I tried making other friends, even had a couple girls who wanted a relationship with me since then but I just didn’t want any of them around me, every time I was around them I just got super irritable and wanted to be alone.

This has never happened to me before, I have severe attachment issues, I couldn’t even attach to my family to the point where I honestly couldn’t give a shit if any of them died. But she was different for some fucking reason and now I’m here with no experience on how the fuck you’re supposed to get over people and move on. 

I don’t know if it’s the texts I get occasionally that remind me and keep resetting the process or if it’s all the times she shows up in my dreams or what the reason is but she’s always in my head and I don’t want her in there anymore. I can’t fucking sleep, I don’t want to eat, I’m just so fucking depressed every time I think about her but I can’t stop myself.

But what does this mean exactly?  Obviously loneliness cannot cause death in the same way as smoking, so what is it specifically about loneliness that shortens a person's lifespan?  Does loneliness have an actual biochemical effect on the brain and organs that cause them to fail sooner, or is this statistic skewed by higher probability of suicide or unhealthy coping habits as a result of loneliness?

And is it actually loneliness that causes the damage to a person's health?  Or is it the *feeling* or *perception* of being lonely that causes harm?  For instance, I am an off-and-on marijuana user, and when I smoke, I don't feel lonely at all, even if I've been isolated for a long time.  It's only when I go for extended periods of time sober that I feel the misery that comes with being lonely.

4527,ryanxlolx,1625199098,1,"I never had many friends in school because of my anxiety. I had 2 friends throughout high school, and I’m still friends with them to this day. We message in the group chat everyday, we share a sense of humour. 


But everyone else stops talking to me. Some come back. But then they leave again.


I met a girl last year in university. We were in the same program, and she was always nice to me even though no one else would even try to talk to me. We were good friends, I’d open up to her (probably more than I should, but I’m not used to making friends and developing friendships). I’d be dramatic sometimes, and sometimes an asshole, but she’d still talk to me. Then she got a boyfriend, and stopped sending me memes and pictures like she used to. But she’d still talk to me. 


Then I met two girls (separately, but around the same time), who were in my new program at uni (online, so we never actually met in person). Mostly talked about schoolwork, but they were super friendly. 


Then about a month later, I met a girl online. We hit it off, started dating. Long-distance relationship. Eventually she stops talking to me, but she came back about a week later. 


Then April came around, school year ends, and the two girls from my classes stopped messaging me. The girl from my last program, my closest friend, stops messaging me at the same time out of nowhere. I started to feel super alone.


But I still had my girlfriend. Until May, when she stopped messaging me. I don’t blame her at all, she is dealing with a lot, and it’s something she does. But it hurt. Everyone was gone, but my 2 longtime friends (who I don’t even hang out with, we just message).


Dark month. Addicted to weed. Pitying myself, feeling alone, suicidal thoughts.


Then June. My friend from last year messaged me again, and we pretty much pretend that the month long gap of not talking didn’t happen. We hang out a few times, message more frequently. Until about a week ago, when she stopped again. 


My girlfriend still hasn’t messaged back to this day. I miss her so much. I’m trying my hardest to support her, but I don’t even know if she reads my messages. I don’t know if she still likes me. But I love her so much and I know she’s worth waiting for. I pray to god she’s doing alright and that she still likes me. I need her.


But that’s where I’m at now. All I have are my 2 longtime friends, have no clue what’s going on with my friend from last year, or my girlfriend, and still haven’t spoken to the girls I met in my online classes since the semester ended. I’m constantly in a state of hoping someone will message me. And I don’t understand why they stop. I’m tired. I just got hired for a job this week and I have no one to tell. I feel alone. I feel regret, I feel depressed. I have anxiety and constantly feel panicked, especially with my new job training coming up. I want to better myself, I’ve been trying. I started working out, sent out resumes and got hired, got a haircut, but it all feels pointless because I’m still alone.",lonely,I’m tired of hoping people will message me,2021-07-02 14:11:38
4528,Fabulous-Advantage,1625198920,1,"I'm a young person who finished college so when people get to know me they ask me, oh how was it or what do you enjoy in free time? And I didn't really have friends and I struggled through it alone because I knew I had different issues than the folks who I just felt like were different than me (they could have fun, they had friends), who I feel like grew up more normally than I did (trying to find the reason in my childhood), who were actually more connected. And it's hard to explain that I actually was in therapy and that's the one thing I'm looking forward to when I earn money, because in therapy I can actually begin to develop and explore what a healthy connection with someone else feels like. And people look at me (Or I assume they do) and all the things I've done and achieved and school and wonder why I didn't get to figure that out.

And when people ask me what my personality is like and it's kind of dead, to be honest, I'm down a lot of the time because I might need medication for my mood but I can't pay for it right now and also I was in therapy and I may want to approach slight personality changes (that is possible but not easy) that resulted from my history of having to avoid and been criticized so badly to avoid people. It's just too hard to explain to normal people. That even my personality I don't really know. I kind of just sit here and try to move through the day. I keep trying and I keep fighting but I don't know who I am or what I want. 

Obviously they can say they relate, they'll be like, oh I'm not close with my friends also, or they'll say, oh yeah I'm pretty quiet too, etc, and I get they're trying to relate to me, but it doesn't relate to me. You still want to smile when you meet someone, you still go out with friends every now and then. For me, sometimes I don't even want to try to smile because of what happened to me, because I actively tried to be different despite the setbacks so maybe the absence of my smile is to tell you that I am so hurt that I don't want you to feel comfortable either. I just want those who judge me to understand that I actually tried to change, most of my life, and if the solution is to accept, then I am still learning.

4531,ZealousidealPea3199,1625197814,1,"Hey, my name is Noah. Im 20yrs old and im from Los Angeles. Im currently struggling to find connection with people my age and im searching for a real lasting friendship . My main passions in life revolve around Music and Animals. My dream is to be a successful music producer/preforming artist and eventually buy a ranch with my girlfriend and open an animal sanctuary/rehab. I dont drink or do hard drugs. I love to smoke weed though when i get the chance. One of the reason i feel that I struggle with maintaining friendship is because i find people use me for my kindness and generosity. What i mean by that is im a people pleaser. I like to help others in time of need and sometimes i go above and beyond for people who would never do the same for me and i have suffered because of that. In my everyday life i try to treat everyone i come in contact with with respect and dignity and sadly, not everyone shares in that same philosophy. Some of my interest beside music and animals are video games (fallout new vegas is my favorite game of all time) religion (im not religious and don’t subscribe to any doctrine but learning about different faiths and lesser know biblical stories/text is so fascinating to me) and politics (i define myself as a left leaning libertarian so take that as you will) Ultimately, id like to meet someone that i can get along with and not have to worry about being taken advantage of.

Hard to pass up.  Only catch was that it is 8 hour drive away.  So my family planned to move.  We went to court to apply to move away from my step kids' father.  The kids were told that they could stay with their dad but none of them wanted to and all 3 wanted to move with us (they are all 16+).  Despite this. The father has used every delay tactic and is fighting in court to force my wife to stay in his region.  We've offered a generous visitation plan to keep the kids in his life and even a reduction in child support he had to pay to make up for the increased travel time and cost.  So because of this I've been away from my daughter and wife for 3 months.  Living in a small town, where I know literally no one.  I'm so lonely I cry everyday.

4567,fairy_flora,1625180496,1,"I used to be very content to spend time alone; I solo-travelled, would go to the cinema alone, loved having my apartment to myself, etc. I had friends, but not loads and they weren't always the most reliable for bigger plans like travelling or days out, so I just got on with it myself. A few years ago something changed, I was on a trip abroad and it really sucked that I had no one to share it with. I started feeling like that about a lot of things, and the time I had by myself felt like a bit of a burden. 

I made the effort to make more friends and to date - I joined clubs, accepted every invite, went on dates, etc. I honestly kind of burned myself doing all that but it seemed like it was working for a bit, until I went through a bit of a rough patch and realised that a lot of the friendships I made were pretty toxic. Over the last two years I've been slowly losing friends and at first I felt positive about it because I thought I could make new friends, but due to covid I haven't been able to at all. 

I do have some close friends but they can't give me the amount of contact I need - they obviously have their own lives and 90% of them are in serious long term relationships, so their friendships aren't their priority. I spend days at a time alone. During the worst times for covid I was almost totally alone for months, even spending Christmas alone due to my family having covid over the Christmas period. There are people who care about me and like me, but seeing them once or twice a month (if that) is not enough. I know that's more than some people have but it's been like this for years and I need more.  I come back from spending time with people and cry because it wasn't enough. 

None of the people I dated worked out, the only ""official"" relationships I've had in years lasted 8 months. Most of them only last max 3 months.

4574,mkdrive2,1625175715,1,"I have always been a low quality human. When I was little, I was an incredibly dumb person. I would not know many things my peers thought were common sense. Furthermore, I had social anxiety and awkwardness, but I hid it under an outgoing and aggressive front. I forced myself onto some kids and many did not resist me and became my ""friends"". But at the first opportunity they had, they, of course, left me. 

But it was not all bad then. Some kids might actually have somewhat liked me at some point. There was an advantage in having an outgoing front. But as I grew older, it was more and more difficult to befriend people, and because of my social awkwardness my social anxiety was very high.

I suffered very much until a few years after I started studying in university. I started reading self-help books about cognitive behavior therapy or similar, written by therapists. One book of a German female therapist and the books of an American therapist helped me a lot, and I was able to reduce my social anxiety a lot. I am gradually getting rid of my social awkwardness and I think I am also not as dumb as I was in the past. I think I am gradually picking up most or all of the common sense that other people have.

But I still ended up avoiding people for many years, because I did not want to deal with their negative reactions and rejection. Unfortunately, the self-help books made me convinced that I could live a happy life without talking to or befriending people. But there I think I was wrong. No matter how much I convinced myself that other people don't matter, that staying alone is not bad, I was still quite unhappy while isolating myself. There was always something missing.

A few weeks ago, I started reaching out to people again, and even though I had some difficulties, I am quite happy with how things are right now.

Unfortunately, I had to realize that I am probably a very unlikeable and uninteresting person. I never seem to get past the stage of other people being polite towards me. Never did they want to go further and befriend me. If I meet people I know outside of the place I usually see them, then most people do not even greet me, they are very unenthusiastic seeing me. 

I don't think there will ever be people who truly like me. And especially women would never consider me as dating material. They would only look at me as if I was a eunuch, not a real man.

I am finally getting to the point why I chose that kind of title for the thread. XD

Today, my father and mother had an argument that was quite nasty, and I could not stop thinking that I would be able to be more mature than my father if I was in his shoes. But I cannot picture myself ever finding a woman who would actually be willing to marry me and stay monogamous and not divorce me after a short time. That is because I am just that uninteresting and unattractive of a person, and I am not someone who women can depend on. I am not competent in anything. I broke off university without a degree btw, and I don't have a real job. I am mostly dependant on social welfare.

But I would really like to have a relationship someday. I also want to marry, and maybe have a child. But I am already almost 34. It is probably impossible. And even a relationship seems very unlikely. I don't think my status quo with people will ever change. I will always stay the uninteresting and unattractive person that I am right now.",lonely,"I would like to have a relationship, but I am an uninteresting and unlikeable person.

I guess I’m just turning to this place of community for some advice and guidance. I’m a 25 year old dude and I truly feel like I have nobody I can call my close friend. I’m dreading the thought of getting old and looking back at my youth thinking how much I missed out on because I don’t have a close group of friends I can rely on and who want to genuinely make the time and effort for me to live out different experiences/adventures. I think I’ve always been a bit quiet and I suffer kinda bad with anxiety especially social so I find it difficult to make friends / meet new people but nonetheless I try usually to no avail. I’ve recently moved out of a house with my closest friend of 8 years as he has just seemed to drift away and move on I think partly due to how I am as a person but he’s found a new friend now who he’s moved in with so I guess you could say I feel kinda replaced. It sucks because I’ve done so much for people I thought were my close friends and it seems as though they’ve all just given up and forgot about me in some way.

I know people say you don’t need others to live your life but the thought of living out different experiences alone is a bummer, I think most people would agree.

I'm not lonely because I don't know how to be by myself; I'm by myself the majority of my time and I'm perfectly ok with that. I enjoy it. I get drained by other people for too long. I've been in long term, live-in relationships and have had to explain how I just need some alone time for a few days every once in a while. I'm ok being alone. But my loneliness is something else. 

I'm lonely because I don't have anyone I want to tell about my time alone. Even in some of these relationships, that feeling hasn't always left me. 
I don't need to spend my days with some one, but I want to tell someone about my days. I want some one to care when I tell them and for me to get excited to tell them. And not just in a polite way, because that's some how more unbearable. 

I'm fortunate in that I do have friends. I'm friendly and approachable and I can force it when needs be, I know a lot of other people would struggle with that social foundation, so I know I'm lucky, but I'm so tired of forcing it. I feel lonely in a room full of my friends when I know I have no one to go call or message after my day and tell them all about... everything, anything. 

So yeah, I'm just tired of the tips suggesting lonely people just go out there and mingle, go online, find more hobbies that are social etc etc. That's not always the problem.

4586,brandelyn_,1625169966,1,"Western culture is rife with toxic positivity. ""Others have it worse,"" ""look on the bright side,"" ""you'll find someone someday.""

I'm not going to tell you those things, because they're bullshit. They're invalidating. 

You're in pain. You're suffering. It hurts to feel alone. I get it. I feel that. I know what it's like. All I ever wanted was to find that one special person whose love would melt away all my insecurities and bad habits.

Turns out that finding real love didn't fix all my problems. I had idolized the thought of finding ""the one"" so much that I was living in this romantic fantasy of ""happily ever after.""

But everything I didn't like about myself, all of my habits and ways... they didn't just ""get better"" because I found my person.

Through therapy I've realized that seeking external validation of our worth will never be enough. Understanding that every human has the birthright to wholeness, and that there is genuinely nothing ""wrong"" with any of us made a world of difference (excluding those who intentionally hurt others. That's wrong). Those people still deserve to feel worthy, though. Hurt people hurt people, and even if they don't know they are suffering, they are.

We all have our reasons for feeling not good enough, and they are valid, as all feelings are. 

But they're not correct. 

You may have a laundry list of everything that's wrong with you, but you're still enough.

You may hate the way your brain works, but you're still enough.

You may hate how you react to things sometimes, but you're still enough.

Finding your validation internally means that it never goes away. If it takes another person to feel that you're worthy, they can also make you feel unworthy. That's awful and painful and it's the human condition.

But you're enough. Some of the humans on this Earth DO appreciate you, even if you think they don't. Even if you feel like you don't deserve it.

You're here because you're lonely.  You feel like nobody cares. Well, I care. I want to see you happy.

Please consider therapy if you're not already doing so. I had to unlearn a lot of seriously negative thought patters and also feeling like I was worthless, hopeless, and unfixable. 

My deep desire for self-destruction led me to being a 37-year-old woman who was a homeless crack addict three years ago. Now I have a wonderful partner, a beautiful place to live, and a job and volunteer work that fulfill me.

It took a LOT of pain and struggle to haul myself out of that. I was lonely. I was afraid. I knew I had to do it anyway, to create the life I always wanted.

Also consider that by ""getting outside yourself"" you can find the connection you seek. People can tell when someone is down on themselves upon first meeting. It isn't an attrac*ting* trait and many will steer clear, because you're reminding them of all of their own insecurities.

Practice self-care. If you don't care about yourself, you can't expect other people to bring you out of that.

Here's to hoping you find many people that you connect with, who accept you as you are. There are plenty of us out here. 

Time is going to pass anyway, so why not start today. Future You will thank you.

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"[Friendship] Hey!

4606,Snoo66908,1625159737,1,"Hello everyone. Sorry for the long post but I try to hide my problems from my family as I don't want my shit to affect or worry them. I have 2 younger children with my girlfriend Ive been with going on 15 years. She wouldnt really listen anyway. Of course she knows of my issues but over the years we've really drifted apart and I have no one to talk to/vent to as I've self isolated. I finally made an appointment with a local psychiatrist for July 6th. I am so excited to maybe finally gain some relief from this depression and major shyness and social anxiety Ive been feeling. Its getting worse and to the point where I cant even go into the gas station,clinic without my heart pounding, sweating and this weird tapping/rubbing my fingers together thing Ive noticed I do when I'm panicked or in public. I walk/talk fast cuz Im trying to get the interaction over as quick as possible and go back home. Im really underweight and I think that is what causes alot of my severely low self esteem. I hate looking in mirror . I hate that I havent done more with my life.  Ive always had problems with addiction but have been on methadone for going on 5 years now and have been clean for over 2 years now from opiates. I have taken mushrooms a couple times in the hope of relief but i realized again that Im just self medicating again and stopped. I dont understand why I never gain weight. Ive never had an eating disorder or anything like that. I dont have good eating habits because I just never feel hungry and just nothing ever sounds good. Ive even tried drinking GNC Bulk 1340 drinks to gain weight but never do. Sometimes ill go days without eating sometimes and I sleep alot more than normal.  Its so hard not to just give up .If it wasnt for the pain Id leave my children with, I probably wouldnt be here. I wouldnt say Im suicidal but Iwouldnt mind passing on and would consider it a relief to be gone. Of course people stare and say judgemental shit but I try to not let it get to me but it does honestly. I've finally realized I cant fight/argue with everyone that says a crappy comment or I'd be fighting all the time. I'm really irritable and frustrated most of the time and have been diagnosed as bi-polar and manic depressive when I was younger. I A long story but Ive attempted suicide twice , shooting myself in the abdomen when I was 19 and cut my arms up bad enough to where I lost alot of blood and had to have tendon surgery on my hand.  I now wear long sleeves everyday as I do not like the bad scarring o. my forearms to be seen. Lately, Ive been having a lot of nightmares and very vivid dreams which i normally do not have. I made a list of things I want to talk to the doctor about but Im not sure how to go about it cuz theres quite a few things on the list.  Do u think I should tell him I have the list and just ask him if i should read it to him or just give him the list?  Sorry for the rambling,  all over the place post but I would rather talk to strangers online than anyone around me. It seems like the people i know put me down more than helping so i just stopped trying. I dont know why i am posting other than just to tell someone, anyone.  If youve managed to read all this thank you and i wish the best for everyone. God bless you.",lonely,Finally going to psychiatrist next week. No one to talk to so thought I'd post,2021-07-02 03:15:37

Just right before the pandemic, I was making great friends &amp; memories &amp; bam, now everyone is scattered around since the world shut down.

4645,1in7billion_,1625126303,1,"This really sucks. I’ve been alone for awhile with no one to really reach out to when I’m down. I’m more socially awkward if I’m being honest, but lately I’ve been trying to reach out to people more both irl and online. Both have failed. It’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I literally cannot find meaningful friendships!

I mean, do I do have an amazing online friend that I talk to, but lately it’s been less and less frequent when we talk due to them being busy, which I understand, but it’s definitely hard. We barely talk now. Plus, even if I were to want to meet them, I couldn’t due to how far apart from each other we are.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Who do I reach out to? Will I ever find anyone? Or will I just die alone? Who knows. All I wish for in life right now is at least only ONE person out of almost eight billion of us to love and care for me, while I do the same. I love doing things for people, and it feels amazing when others do it back to me. I just want mutualism. It’s like no one cares for me. No one ever checks up on me or even asks what I’m doing. I have to be the one reaching out to people and those people never meet me halfway anyway. Why? It sucks so much. Even when I’m in a crowd, or with my larger family, I feel so alone. But with one person where we both care for each other, I won’t feel alone. It’ll feel like being cheered upon a stage filled with thousands of people in a stadium.

The ringleader, Bob Miller, confronted me in the schoolyard because I had to tell what happened. He yelled “Squealer!” and punched me in the face; I punched back. (Fought to a tie, but I was kicked out of the gang.)  After that, I had no friends at all. I went to a new school the following year where I made new friends I never saw after that one year because they all enrolled in different schools at the end of term and so did I, alone.

4679,a__lonely__child,1625109003,1,"There for the longest time, I was content with having nobody. I knew seeking love from my family was a lost cause since my mom was (and still is) less than approving of me, and my dad's working all the fucking time. I've always been extremely socially anxious courtesy of Asperger’s, and confronting anyone at school was never an option I considered. I was happy alone, since anything was better than that debilitating anxiety I was cursed with facing. But after fifteen years of having nobody, I'm really reconsidering.

Every day is the same now. Wake up wishing I had someone to tell good morning, get ready of the day wishing I had someone to be ready for, go do what the fuck ever (mow lawns for cash, practice keyboard, study music, or other shit) wishing I had someone to share my day with, get ready for bed wishing I had someone to tell me about their day and reassure me that I did enough, and combat chronic insomnia wanting to have had someone tell me goodnight. There is no true variation in the days my life consists of. Hell, even calling it a life is a stretch, because ultimately, I'm not living. I do not feel alive.

I tried confronting people at school. I really did. I tried to converse with people I'd once known to be the fuel to my grand, nightmarish, day-to-day struggle. The result was ridiculing. In the eyes of my peers, my personality is my academics. That was my sacrifice in skipping two grades. I'm still slandered for being autistic, which is something I could've avoided hadn't I have been open about it. It's for things like this that I believe I'd have someone that enjoyed my presence for me weren't I to be myself. What a settling thought that is.

I've never been hugged. Only two people have ever told me that that they are proud of me, one of which has since passed away, and the other abandoned me mere days ago. I met the latter here on Reddit in another account. We actually got along well, I loved talking to her, and I thought she loved talking to me. I was convinced that I was ready to trust someone. Then she up and fucking disappeared, proving to be just as absent as everyone else that ""cared"". As a matter of fact, said abandonment is why I'm here right now. I presented my heart to someone, and she branded it. It genuinely burned.

I don't know how I'd react to praise. I don't know how I'd react to care. I don't know how I'd react to love. Why? Because I've never been able to look one in the eyes and tell it ""I know how you feel"". I want to feel, finally. I've been told to be dismissive of this idea before, but I don't care if I'm ""just a hormonal, confused teenage boy"". I'm a person, too. I can tire and be saddened like everyone else.

4683,Trapezoidal_Sunshine,1625106115,1,"I'm a perpetually single guy in his early 30s. I have very little experience with dating and relationships. I've followed all of the advice one usually hears when asking for help in this realm: workout, lose weight, dress better, ""put yourself out there"", etc. I've tried, I really have - especially in my mid- to late 20s. And it just never really worked for me. I finally gave up trying for the most part several years ago and worked on accepting the fact that I just wasn't meant to find love. I wouldn't say that I'm happier, but had gotten to an ok place and was less sad about the whole thing. It's been years since I've gone on a date or had sex or even just hugged someone who wasn't a relative - I miss all of those things, but, I thought, I had accepted that I'd likely never experience them again.

Then a short while ago something happened. I won't go deep into the details but out of nowhere a real live woman messaged me online. She was interested in me. We talked. A lot. She sent me photos and I sent her photos. She was hot as hell! And said she thought I was hot too! We got along great! For the first time in years I felt those feelings again - like having your crush talk to you at school. Excited to get a text and seeing it was her. Eagerly anticipating getting home from work so we could talk some more. Finally having someone to talk about my day with. It really seemed like she felt that way too, she even said as much. I was wary, but she seemed totally real. Her details checked out. She spoke like a real person and talked about mundane things and little details that I don't think a scammer or prankster would think to include in conversations. She never asked for anything or acted in any way that made me think she wasn't being honest.

And then the other day she simply vanished. Practically right in the middle of a chat we were having. I understand that people have lives and didn't think much of it at first. I'm not one to pester, so I stayed quiet, figuring she'd eventually get back to me and explain what had happened. She never said goodnight like we usually do. Never said good morning either. Never responded to me asking if she was ok. Never spoke again.

I wasn't born yesterday, I understand that I've been ghosted - and I accept that. Nobody is required to talk to someone if they don't want to. But I'm having a hard time dealing with this woman just crashing into my life like a hurricane after I'd done so much to get past my failures of dating and love and women. I'm angry that she stirred up those feelings - that hope that excitement - and then shit all over it as fast as she showed up in the first place. I don't understand why she shoved herself into my life only to disappear. I didn't ask for this.

4685,CottageSwan,1625105947,1,"Sometimes I don’t know honestly. I’m not sure why things have shifted this way over time in regards to how we communicate as humans. Idk if talking to new people is just weird to me so therefore I just prefer my long time friends and fail to understand new people and how to talk to them correctly.

People hate small talk and want “deep conversations”, what do you expect for others to be constantly stimulating your mind so you can achieve mental orgasms 24/7? Probably a weird thing to say but small talk is pretty nice if used correctly. It’s not about having a rush every single time but then again do people actually desire long term friendships? Ones that involve forgiveness,love, compassion and legitimate growth?

People act as if bonds aren’t mainly formed off of communication/interactions. It’s a gateway to that leads to friendships. Putting in effort even with the “deep conversations” just to get back some nonchalant responses or even better yet they are super excited but have absolutely nothing to add.

These same people complain about not having friends while neglecting their own actions. It’s a pattern I’ve noticed over time. I wonder if people become addicted to loneliness and it’s like a forest they can’t leave. Like even if there was a search party looking for them in the east subconsciously they’d head west, avoiding help at all costs. I know people struggle with this and my heart goes out to them.

Yes, connecting with others is quite difficult. It seems like a pick and choose game, I mean why wouldn’t it be? I’m selective as well. We all should be. I tend to isolate and spend time with myself a lot since it’s just what I like to do. 
Therefore I know I have to constantly make an effort to check up on my friends and let them know I’m okay as well because if I don’t then I know the road I’ll head down.

Also it’s very interesting to see people’s true colours as time progresses. Starts off weird then it just gets worse then you wonder if they’ve been planning it this entire time. Like a wolf in sheep’s clothing - just waiting to pounce &amp; devour.

I do have social anxiety but as long the ice is melted somewhat I’m fine. The ice can be hard to melt though, I feel like when you live your life not really interacting then you actually start to, you realize how much stress and expectations people put on you instead of just letting things develop or cease naturally. There is no need for any type of obsession. 

I’m genuinely interested in the people I allow into my life but then I struggle with connecting with them since communication styles differ I guess. It’s such a hard road to navigate.

I don't know if other people have this but when I am in a relationship I honestly do better in all espects of my life. I get better grades, I connect more with my family, I get a studentjob so I can spoil her, I'm more social, I go out more with my friends, etc. It's just that when I have a gf I want to be a better person for her you know.

I just really miss waking up and seeing a text from that special girl. Seeing her light all up when I compliment her. Just joking around with her and laughing all day. I miss just laying in bed all cuddled up and talking about our days. Comforting her when she's having a tough time and telling her I will be there the whole way. Sometimes annoying her a bit just because I can haha. Taking her out on dates.

I just miss it all so so much. I have tried so hard to connect to girls and getting to know them but I always end up getting ghosted by them losing interest. I always try to keep conversations going even tho it is incredibly hard for me since I'm a big introvert and I always end up getting dry answers and I can just see them losing interest in me.

4698,araliaelata,1625098381,1,"I just need to express how I feel. I recently got out of a relationship and I'm single again. For the past years I've had a few long term relationships. I would be in a relationship, be single for a few months and then in a relationship again. I've had issues with feeling lonely my whole life. Mostly because I really was alone with no friends for the biggest part of my life, even now I am. And I was always trying to fill that emptiness with other people, romantic relationships. 

This time I feel like it's going to be different. I want it to be different. I don't want to jump into a relationship again, I really want to work on myself and my issues for a while, because I have a lot.  But I also feel like after I'm done bettering myself (who knows when tho, it's a work in progress kind of thing) and i choose to put myself out there again, it's not going to happen. I just have the strong feeling I'm either too broken now or maybe I will never find someone right for me. I don't really know why I think this, it's just a feeling. 

I have a lot of mental health issues and a lot of people can't deal with this (biggest reason i have no friends atm and had trouble with this all my life). I'm afraid ill never have friends again and I'll never have a relationship again. I'm afraid no one wants to deal with me and my mental illness when they could have someone who is ""sane"".

I really am a hopeless romantic and I love, love. I've been reading romantic books again and watching romantic movies. I honestly feel the exact same way I did as a teen, before I ever had a romantic relationship with anyone. It makes me happy seeing people in love and just everything that has to do with love, but i don't see it ever happening to myself. 

I don't know what I'm trying to say. I just need to express how I feel and vent I guess. Long story short: I'm afraid I'll be alone forever.",lonely,I'm afraid I'll be alone forever.,2021-07-01 10:13:01

However: I have no friends. He has tons of friends, which is wonderful. When we get together we all get along. And I am fairly sure that they get among with me. At least some of them. I get insecure sometimes, but remind myself of the kind things some of them have said about me, like, “She’s a keeper,” and to me directly, “I like you.” 

These comments mean a lot to me, because I am seven years older than my BF, and I haven’t always been the most secure when it comes to relationships.

Anyway. I am 100% isolated. Ok 95%. My BF works offshore and is gone every other week. Nobody calls me to do anything while he is gone…and why should they? They have literally met me three times since Thanksgiving because of COVID. 

Anyway. I am so sad here. Living in this town. BF is gone seven days at a time. My friends are the clerks at Circle K, my elderly neighbor, and his granddaughter, whom I pay to water my garden as an excuse to have someone to chat with. Sometimes I go sit by the bayou and cry.

I’ve always felt lonely, never really felt like anyone truly cared about me especially my friends. There’s one teacher at my school who showed me that I do matter and basically saved my life. My mental health is improving which is amazing but I still feel so alone. At my school there’s only about 40 people in our year group and I just don’t feel like anyone is truly my friend. My best friend is always hanging out with her boyfriend and my other “friends” only say hi and that’s it. I don’t understand why I’m so lonely and my mental health is improving but this is keeping me down. I enjoy being in my own company but not all the time. I know that my friends are temporary and I’m cool with that because once I go to university I plan on not talking to them but I thought that for now I’ll keep being friends with them. My only friends are teachers which I’m totally fine with, they’re way more interesting and much nicer to me (probably because they’re getting paid haha) but obviously I can’t hang out with them all the time.

4749,baileyas,1625070533,1,"In the past 2 years I've gone through a lot, my family moved back to the US after living in England for 5 years, we we're practically homeless for a good 2 months, I went through a pretty rough breakup, a global pandemic hit, and then we moved to a new town again. Needless to say, I didn't have much of a chance to meet a whole lot of new friends, and dealing with some mental health issues didn't exactly make it a whole lot easier. I've known for a while that I would probably end up spending my 21st with just my immediate family, and while there's really not anything wrong with that, I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on the usual 21st birthday. Most people seem to go out with friends and drink and just have an amazing time letting loose, but I have no one to do that with. I don't want to look back years later and feel that I missed out.

I thought that visiting all my old friends this summer would make up for the lack of plans for my actual birthday, I made plans with a couple of them to do a double birthday party before I flew home, but it all fell through. Only one girl I was friends with before I moved has actually made an effort to see me while I've been here, the rest of them haven't reached out a single time, which has honestly made me feel a lot worse. 

I'm trying to look at it optimistically, I start college in August and I have a lot to look forward to, but it's becoming harder and harder to shake the feeling that spending my birthday without a single friend brings. 

Had anyone been through anything similar? How can I make this more optimistic?",lonely,"About to spend my 21st birthday with no friends, and thinking about it is like a punch in the gut.",2021-07-01 02:28:53

4751,HiWelcomeToWendys4,1625069851,1,"I posted here before and retracted my post // Honestly I feel so fucking lonely and it's due to the fact that I've lost a tonne of my friends and contacts due to a situation and drama that occured. I'm 18 btw recently turned 18 and have felt upset and anxious ever since it all occurred. I feel so upset and awful after what happened it's insane.  I feel awful because I've lost half of my friends and stopped speaking to a tonne of more people I basically have barely anyone to talk to in my eyes at least and it fucking hurts . Seeing the people who stole my happiness from me happy makes me so sad ... I was even thinking of suicide a few weeks ago because I was so distraught at how things panned out. Every day I get anxiety about who's going to block me on socials or who hasn't... seeing the ones who took my happiness aka my friends all happy and fulfilled makes me upset . 


I've always been a popular person , always had friends always was someone who had people around me... I noticed I often try and become happy and fulfilled from those around me... and I'm so fed up of this. I need to learn to be fulfilled on my own. I have no friends or I may have some but I feel as though I've pushed everyone away. I have one best friend and me and her haven't spoken either because she has her own issues to deal with and I respect and love her always... I just. This sounds pathetic but I honestly only need her and I hope she comes back soon because I'm breaking over here . (You see what I mean ? I rely too much on others...) I'm just so fucking upset and depressed I can't take it. This all is a shock to me. I've never felt this alone and isolated in my life. I wouldn't wish this on my mortal enemy.

4761,yourmak3r,1625062318,1,"[M28] I feel like that everyone in my ""closest"" circle of friends has managed to build another circle of friends, which they like to spend more time with and I am the only idiot who held on to those old highschool friendships more than I should have. They also spend a lot of their time with their SOs, which is understandable but still kind of sad that they can't make time to meet up more than 2-3 times a year.

As a result, we have all gotten more distant with each other and don't rely on each other for support. They have their gfs for that but me, well nobody, except for one American friend who is as miserable and lonely as me but whom I would probably consider my must trusted friend atm. We live very far away from each other and only communicate online tho. We are going to travel together this summer which I am super excited about.

Anyway, bottom line is I am completely lonely most of the time and while I am really trying to do stuff by myself I am more and more growing tired of it and everything blurs together. I don't really enjoy anything anymore. I am just jumping from one obsession to another to distract myself (this year it's building knowledge in finance and riding my motorcycle...alone, naturally). Now with the beautiful summer days in Europe and post-lockdown everything hits even harder. I would love to spend time with friends by the lakes or go hiking or hang out with them at night but this is not my reality unfortunately. Nothing really changed for me post-lockdown.

I also let a woman into my life (I am really careful after my last relationship) only to be played with and used as a toy most likely since apparently she didn't give a sh** about me and just needed me for sex. I am very fit and tough-looking so women objectify me a lot and don't give a damn about my emotions.

Except for one co-worker who wants to get me laid and use me there are also no people at work really who seem to be interested in hanging out off work and most of them have families and children.

In my family we also don't really talk about mental health and it's a taboo in ways. My parents have also never provided emotional support really. They are only result-oriented (good grades; uni; work).My country is very backwards in that regard anyhow.

Well, I am completely drifting off here. I am sorry.
