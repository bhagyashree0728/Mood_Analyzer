1,OnceWholeSoul,1625061477,1,"I (M38) spent 20 years in a bad relationship, had a kid tried to make it work at 20 -38 . At 20 i gave financial control because I worked a lot and out of town as where the money for a family. I wasn’t home to pay bills and such mistake one. 

The stress of an unplanned baby into a relationship that was not healthy . I was so beat down from being controlled financially and a partner with sever introverted and only negative thoughts and feelings that I became a mess myself. I didn’t see it happen , I couldn’t leave , as I had no dad until my step dad at 6/7 . He put up with me and my mother ( she was fucked too) . I couldn’t let a kid grow up with out a dad .  Mistake 2  . Not understanding I could have been better dad if not there everyday but healthy mentally enough to be there often if I would have left. 

So 20 years , gaslit , controlled , not supported in anything . No money . 
No emotions shared . I have all the emotions and like a robotic sponge she took them . Never returned . Ruined me .  Broke me . I fought and tried . 

It got better . Things got better slowly but too little too late . I was hollowed out and the scars wouldn’t go away . 

Separated and selling the house . 



I will finally walk away , with some money , barley enough to start over but 20 years gone and so much damage and scars I will never have a new car , new things , nice things.  I will be old and have nothing I should . 


I found someone , who understands me and has an ocean of kindness . Can’t be mine , but I can’t stop communicating with them. Just knowing they care for me and understand everything as when I talk to them I’m ok for a minute .  

I don’t know how to start over and be ok I lost 20 years of income , myself, time and emotions is daunting .



I am healing and seeking help. I just get so lonely as the few around me don’t know how bad I am inside and the one person who does can’t be in my life the way I need . I just get all of these emotions and don’t know what to do !",lonely,"Life is devastated, the one thing I need I can’t get back.",2021-06-30 23:57:57

I had no problem being faithful, I love you so much I hate you
Because you left me when I needed you the most
So now a bitch is how I rate you
My female friends making you wonder
Guilt got you feelin' suspicious
From when you was creepin' on me on the under

Five kids and I fed them all with board, bread and spread
Them was my motherfuckers
Treated them like sisters and brothers
But somehow fell out of place
Fuckin' with they punk ass mother
I apologize
I wish I could turn back the hands of time

Wishin we could pillow fight, just one more time
But Miss Rhonda wanna put them laws in my life
Although I'm happy I never picked you, that you're not at all in my life
Solo, that's how I'll kick it the rest of my days

17,ShadowfatherUSMC,1625049654,1,"I know, ultimately my life is going to end in nothing. Maybe I'll have children someday, maybe not. These things are fine with me because I know that that is the case for the overwhelming majority of people. The problem that I have is that I am not even meaningful to myself. I don't pursue my hobbies, I don't try to get good at anything. I have no excitement for pursuing any type of career. I don't feel like I have the right to stick up for myself in the cases that I should, and I wind up furious with myself later. I get very lonely, and I long for a romantic relationship, but I am very cynical about any kind of meaningful relationship in general. It is as though I am terrified of bringing any form of meaning into my life. I would even push people away who tried to get closer to me. Whether they were friends, family, or even women that liked me and I liked them back. I am doing a lot better than the mess that I was in in my twenties. I used to be extremely reclusive, I had a problem with alcohol and marijuana. Couldn't hold a job. I was very self-centered, and cost me friendships. I'm in a much better place now, but I got a long ways to go. I am handsome, I am intelligent, I am charming, funny, kind and caring. Looking back, I think maybe it's because I was caring and emotionally sensitive, that I became so bitter, reclusive, and used alcohol and drugs to dull my senses. I've heard an analogy of it being like the TV volume was too high and I had to turn it down. At this point in my life, I feel like I am having a lot of trouble untangling myself.

20,Germankessy,1625048125,1,"Hi, what I am about to say may sound crazy but I'm not exaggerating. This is the first time I'm telling people other than therapists but I am desperate. Please be gentle. I desperately need help.

So I'm 35F and I have never dated or had a boyfriend. Ever since I was 17, I remember thinking of having a boyfriend all my waking hours. My thoughts were something like ""I want a boyfriend. I wish I had a boyfriend. I don't understand why guys don't want me, why won't guys give me a chance."" I wouldn't say I have low self esteem because most of my thoughts actually include confusion that men wouldn't want me because I don't see myself as lacking in the looks and personality department, though I don't really do anything all day.

Before my desire for a bf kicked in, I was highly self motivated in high school and did a bunch of activities and self study. But when I was 17 and began experiencing what feel like uncontrollable urges (not for sex, but to have an emotional romantic connection), I have been unable to focus. I dropped out of college and have been unable to keep a job.

If I watch a movie or take a shower or eat, I am still constantly thinking of men (nothing sexual, just the desire for a boyfriend).

It has gotten to the point I'm so miserable having these uncontrollable cravings that I can't get out of bed most days. The only thing that can get me to leave the house is the possibility of meeting someone.

I want a boyfriend so badly that every time a guy talks to me, including a cashier or bank teller, I immediately get an adrenaline rush and ask them for their number or if they want to hang out sometime. Most say no i don't knlw you or try to pretend to want a relationship but really want sex. I'm absolutely aware that my approach makes it impossible to date, but I have been unable to control these urges to ask men to date.

Online dating is worse because I get so excited that I keep messaging men extreme things right away, such as I am so excited you wrote, I know you're a great person, I'll do anything for you. I feel an intense need to get them to say they're interested romantically. I am able to hold a 5 min conversation but after that I have been unable to stop myself from saying extreme things no matter how hard I've tried.

This has exposed me to predators, men who said they loved me but wanted only a one night stand, and internet trolls who said they loved me then said it was a joke. However when I believed I had a boyfriend, I was able to focus, leave the house, have goals and hobbies. I wasn't thinking about the guy all the time or needing to talk to him constantly. Instead, it just got rid of these urges and allowed me to focus on everyday life. The longest a guy has pretended has been 2 weeks so I go back to the cycle.

I spend hours a day trolling dating apps messaging every guy.

I know that the solution here is not getting a boyfriend but to be happy alone. But I don't know how to stop. If I could get my mind off men for 5 minutes an hour during the day, I'd be so relieved. I have been to therapy over the past decade with different therapists and a psychiatrist has prescribed me stuff with depression and impulse control, I've tried countless meds but I don't see an improvement.

What I am asking here is, has anyone ever experienced anything like this, and can you think of anything to help me? I am aware of all the logic as to why I shouldn't need a boyfriend to complete me but I cannot stop the urges so I'm asking how I can for even 5 minutes get my mind off thinking about having a romantic connection.

Its late at night right now and i cant sleep, i feel so incredibly lonely nowadays and im too scared to try and talk to other people or catch up with old friends becauss im worried wut they might think of me. I sometimes feel so hated even tho im also aware its an irrational thought. Im in a discord server with friends from highschool but i stopped talking after a while because i lost touch with them during quarantine. Everything is so difficult. But i hate myself for thinking that this shit has to be easy which it isnt. I dont talk to my parents either, i find my mom annoying sometimes when she gets annoyed at my weird eating habits. I cant get therapy because id have to ask my parents since im a minor, but id rather not ask them. I want to cry so much right now. The person i talk to most i dont think he even cares abt me as much as i care abt him. Im too scared to ask because i feel weird asking him that. I dont voice chat with anyone except for 2 other ppl but when we do vc i dont talk very much. Im in 11th grade and i am a female 16yr old. Most of my friends are guys becauss i find the girls at my school either fake, weird, or just not my type of people i like talking to. Should i be this picky. Maybe thats why im so fucking lonely. The only joy i find during the day id when im listening to music or doing rlly good at a video game. Did i mention i had eating problems, like where if i put food or think of food i tend to just gag out of no where. I hate food sometimes. Im underweight and i probably lack nutrients. I had a thing with this guy but i broke it off because i knew it wasnt going to work so i didnt want to get hurt in the future. Im so alone. I know there are some people who care about me. And im grateful for them. But i just wish i had a deep connection with them because i value that in friendships. I sometimes say, ""i am content with my life"" but thinking about it i only say that becauss im trying to deny the fact that my life is boring and i am boring and i am just a disgrace to society probably. I feel weak most days, i eat terribly most days, i sit down all day, do nothing, am i content with that? Fuck no. I want to make friends, but im scared to talk to people. What if they hate me? What if they think im weird or cringey? What if they know im trying so hard? What if they find me annoying? What if? What if? Its always me overthinking in the end. I want to move out of my parents house yet i know im not capable of taking care of myself. My arms are weak, i cant do anything, i always need help, my parents never taught me anything, my parents were never there for me emotionally. Why would i want to tell my mom my issues when i know shes gonna judge me and lecture me afterwards. Why would i want to please her after everything she hasnt done for me. Maybe im too harsh, i am a teenager after all and ik its normal for teens to have these thoughts but, the feeling is so strong. I hate myself? Or i hate my life?

Pretty soon after we met we were talking every day through discord vc and would sometimes video chat. We did everything together and he introduced me to so many things. We watched sports together. We watched movies. We played video games. Sometimes, we just talked. He helped me through a  lot and he tild me things he said he never told anyone else. It was never just goodbye, it was “call me when you wake up”. Needless to say, I liked him. And he liked me too, but we never put any labels on our relationship. I dont know if I was too scared to ask or it just never came up. The way we talked I felt like there was a mutual understanding that we liked each other and we both werent talking to other people. It really doesnt matter though because around 3 months into us talking he unadded me everywhere out of nowhere. On all the games we played, discord, snapchat, everywhere. It was so sudden that I had no idea what to think. I’m a very insecure person so I blame myself, but I cant figure out what I did. I think the part that is hurting so much is not having any closure, no reason as to why he did it. I’m a strong person. Ive been through a lot. But Ive been struggling so much to pick myself back up this time. I try to distract myself and talk to my friends but I always end up making myself sad again.

33,Dutch_vanderlin,1625040051,1,"I have my own feelings, but I know how much more real and powerful yours feel to you. So I can't possibly know what you're specifically going through. But I know it's hard and I know 'hard' is an understatement.

But I want to tell you that you're strong. Some of the strongest people out there. I know you might not be able to see that right now and I'm sorry. But trust me you are. To wake up everyday to face what you're facing takes strength. Incredible strength. If your strength could be translated into physical power, you'd be giving superman a run for his money. You're strong; and I hope you discover that within yourself.

And since the universe/life can't apologize verbally, or at least through writing, on their behalf I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way things have gone. I'm sorry for the way things turned out. I wish things could have turned out differently and so I'm sorry.

But while it may seem bleak and hopeless, know that it can get better. There's always hope. A happier future is always possible. Even if you can't see it right now. Life can sometimes be like a dark tunnel. You may not be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel but if you keep going, you'll find a better place.

Most of the time it won't be quick. Certainly won't be easy. There will always be hard days, weeks, or months. But you have the strength to meet and overcome them. Don't let your mind trick you into thinking otherwise. It's biased to the negative side for now.

But when you do feel down and feel like you've failed or feel like you're worthless and can't achieve what you want, give yourself some slack. It's not easy, especially with what you're going through. You're trying and that's good. Be forgiving and understanding towards yourself. Cause through thick and thin you're always there for yourself at the end of the day.

I know my words may not mean much. And I know it might be difficult to see and get the full meaning through the emotions. But you're fantastic. And deserve to be happy. It won't be easy but don't give up hope. You'll get through it",lonely,For those having a tough time,2021-06-30 18:00:51

39,Fantastic_Counter996,1625034802,1,"Here it goes. I'm a long time lurker of subreddits like these, and this topic has been on my mind lately so I feel compelled to post about it. 

I'm 22F, about to turn 23 in 2 weeks, and the closer my birthday gets, the sadder I get thinking about the fact that I have no friends to spend it with. A bit of background; I am a true introvert and also dealt with severe anxiety and derealization up until the age of 19 or 20. I had a tight group of friends in high school, including a couple that hung on from elementary school. Fast forward to my final year of high school -- the elementary school friendships had fizzled out for the most part (a natural part of life) -- and I ended up hitting rock bottom with my mental health (unrelated to those friendships ending). Looking back now, I suppose this is where my high school friendships started to fade. Everyone was getting ready to move on to bigger and better things, and I was just focused on surviving. I ended up missing a month or two of the school year because I couldn't even get out of bed to go to the washroom without having a severe panic attack. This all happened around the time that final exams were going on, so I don't blame my friends for needing to focus on themselves. A couple of them even reached out to me while I was gone (which I really appreciated), but eventually they began to move on one by one, and after graduation we lost contact completely over the course of a few months. When I got out of the thick of my mental breakdown, I had lost my university offers  and wasn't even sure that I'd graduate from high school. I didn't have the mental energy to maintain friendships because I was trying to put myself back together again. Since then, I'd seen old friends here and there, but the relationships weren't as solid as they had once been. I ended up taking a gap year and then started my first year of college. I made a couple of potential friends there but ended up dropping out of the program and losing contact. A year after that, I started a university program, and at the tail end of my first year COVID hit, and all of my courses have been taken online since then (it's pretty difficult to make friends in zoom lectures). I've had multiple jobs within this time frame, and ended up meeting some pretty great people at my current one. However, I'm now moving on to a new job and I'm worried that those potential friendships will fade as well. 

Now I will mention that I have a boyfriend who was here through all of this, and who has been extremely supportive. I'm close enough with his friend group that I feel comfortable joining in whenever they hang out or play video games over discord, but it just isn't the same as having my own group of girlfriends to relate to. I've also got one friend who I've known since childhood; we had a two year hiatus after a bad fight, and although things have been decent in the years since, I feel like I can't completely be myself around her. 

I'll also add that I had another childhood friend who ended up being extremely toxic and manipulative (and possibly narcissistic), and chose to cut ties with her when I was 20. I'm mentioning this because since ending that friendship, I've had a really difficult time connecting with new people. 


Okay, we're in the home stretch of this long-winded story. It's been 6 years since I graduated high-school, and while I've met some decent people, none of them have evolved into actual friends. I have a tough time staying in contact with people, and when I do try to make plans, they never work out.  I'm definitely not perfect, and there have been times where I could have answered messages quicker or been more direct about making plans, but it seems that everytime I do put effort into a friendship, it isn't reciprocated. I scroll through Instagram and everyone seems to have these close knit friends who they see and talk to all the time -- I want that. I'm not offensive to look at, I'm quite friendly, I'm funny, I have hobbies and interests that I would love to share with likeminded people -- so I wonder: what am I doing wrong? Why am I so lonely?

Ok, I’ve been at this newer job for almost a year. Around 3 or 4 months ago I started to talk about quitting (I was one of the better employees at the time) and out of no where my boss and her assistant (the one I have feelings for) start being nicer out of nowhere. Then BOOM a promotion from bagging to cashier and then BOOM not even a month later I’m a bookkeeper. Now this is where I start developing feelings, my bosses assistant (BA) starts training me for my new position. At first I felt nothing towards her other than friendship but it slowly developed into liking her. Now BA is an attractive woman I gotta admit but that wasn’t what I liked, our humor and personality where basically identical except for our hobbies.

Now jumping to present day I haven’t seen BA in about a week and a half, and I have to admit that I’m nervous and slightly excited to see her. I know it will never go anywhere. I believe BA has a significant other and I’ll admit it hurt to think about that but I’m happy that she has someone she likes. It’s not difficult to work with her or talk to her at all. Sometimes me or her will say something awkward but the other one usually just laughs a little to clear the air. BA is a kind and attractive person but I am not that good looking if I’m being honest.

58,SomethingCleverest,1625027137,1,"I posted most of this as a reply to someone else somewhere, but I thought maybe it would be interesting for other people to read in general so I'm sharing it as a regular post.

Finding human friends and consistent, stable, enduring human relationships is hard. We all know that.

One popular alternative to this is acquiring animal companionship. Lots of lonely people get pets, and it can help a ton. Many different scientific studies have concluded that owning pets can improve your life, increase longevity, and decrease loneliness. And through the wonderful magic of Stockholm Syndrome, you can force your less-intelligent animal companion to love and depend upon you the way you just can't with most humans (not legally, anyway).

But... what about when they die? Won't that leave you feeling even lonelier than before? Just the thought of this, or past traumatic experiences, can scare a lot of lonely people off of the idea of getting themselves a furry friend (though as seen below, our bias toward furriness may be part of the problem as feathery and scaly friends tend to last longer). Dogs are called ""man's best friend,"" but... most of them only live for 10-13 years and many popular ""pure"" breeds suffer numerous genetic problems that makes old age for them a painful ordeal. And puppy farms in some places can be a living nightmare.

Myself I'm more of a cat person. I've had several very close, loving relationships with kitties. They can be much more affectionate and personable than some believe (not cat people), and the fact that they are usually harder to win over than dogs (the emotional sluts of the animal kingdom) I think can make it feel like their love is more earned and therefore more valuable. Plus they are largely self-sufficient and easy to take care of. And most kinds of housecat, well taken care of, can live up to 20 years! That's a long time! But still... probably not as long as you're going to live.

If you do decide to get a dog or cat, please adopt one from the pound or an animal shelter. There are many in need.

\*

&amp;#x200B;

But if you want an animal companion that is going to last longer, here are some suggestions:

&amp;#x200B;

\*

Horses - some breeds can live 40-60 years. And you can ride them! Not advisable to try this with most dogs. The Icelandic Horse is known for its hardiness and for being energetic and friendly. Not for everyone, obviously, as maintenance can be expensive. But they are beautiful, noble animals that many humans have formed strong bonds with. Don't get one unless you're willing to commit large amounts of time to grooming and maintenance though, or else large amounts of money to pay someone else to do it. Though horse grooming can be very zen. I used to get the same feeling from washing, waxing, and detailing my sports car.

Asian Elephants - hard and expensive to care for, but they live on average from 50-70 years and the oldest on record died at age 84. You're probably not going to be able to get one unless you are Joe Exotic or live in a farm somewhere in Thailand or else some place with unusually lax laws, but if you do, they can make for great friends because elephants are some of the most intelligent animals on the planet along with humans, dolphins, whales, crows, and maybe octopoda - though octopus intelligence is not well understood. Btw some species of whale also can live super long but... not in captivity... and I doubt your fish tank is big enough.

Blue and Yellow Macaws - on average these beautiful and intelligent birds live to be about 80. In captivity many different breeds of parrots have been known to live 90-100 years or longer. And they make excellent pets! Probably the best overall option on this whole list with lifespans that conveniently match the average life expectancy of a human, so you could get a baby macaw as a child and have a lifelong companion that you wouldn't have to worry about abandoning yourself whenever you kick the bucket. One note: I'd strongly urge anyone considering getting a parrot as a pet to do your due diligence and ensure your feathery friend has been ethically sourced. There is still a lot of illegal trafficking of exotic birds to various parts of the world, which is awful for the birds.

Aldabra Giant Tortoise - the oldest one on record lived to be 255. Many species of tortoise commonly live to be 100-150, perhaps thanks to their very slow metabolism. Smaller, more common species are very popular as pets, easy to obtain, and cheap to care for as they eat simple food and not much of it. Plus if they ever get outside and try to run off you'll have a much easier time catching them than you would a dog or a cat.

Lobsters - they can live to be 100-150 years old and will be forever thankful to you for sparing them the fate of becoming someone's expensive dinner. Many types of shellfish and mollusks have similarly long or even longer lifespans, some living for several hundred years.

Greenland Shark - not the prettiest species of shark, but perhaps due to their preference for arctic waters they are the longest-lived extant species, with estimated lifespans of 200 up to over 500 years. And sharks are cool. They've been around for 450 million years so they must be doing something right. Don't trust that slanderous Hollywood hack job Jaws. One caveat about the Greenland Shark: they grow to 24 feet long, so unless you have a very big, very cold fish tank or swimming pool this probably isn't a realistic option for a pet. On the other hand, the smallest common aquarium shark, the Dwarf Shark, suffers significantly less than the Greenland Shark in the looks department, only grows to about 8 inches long, and still lives for an impressive 20-30 years.

Sponges, corals, anemones and tubeworms - not the most interactive of pets, but they are technically animals, some are nice to look at, and some species can live for thousands of years.

Turritopsis dohrnii - also known as the ""immortal jellyfish,"" it is thought that it may be biologically immortal, meaning that it will *never* die from old age, thanks to its ability to switch back and forth between its pupal and adult stages of development. Some species of hydras also have this talent. But the immortal jellyfish is actually quite beautiful and could make nice pets I guess. Though they are tiny so you will have to invest in a magnifying glass to fully appreciate their company.",lonely,Long-Lived Non-Human Companionship,2021-06-30 14:25:37
59,Dependent_Visit_5601,1625026965,1,"The title isn’t 100% true. , and have had one close best friend for years. For over ten years they have been my only friend.  This summer, they began their first job, and spend almost everyday of the week working. My friend pretty much only hung out with me all those years, but lately they’ve been starting to reach out and hang out with other friends of theirs. Their entire week is filled with either work, or spending time doing things with a friend of theirs.

I know I’m overreacting, but I just feel like I really don’t have anyone. That Im going to spend the rest of my summer alone, staring at my phone or the tv while no body else really cares about me. I’ve been holding back tears all day cause I know I’m going to spend my whole summer alone and feeling worthless.

I have struggled with major problems regarding loneliness my whole life, but it always turned out okay because I had my friend there with me. But I’m beginning to realize I don’t really have them so much anymore, and life is starting to feel pointless.

I did a pretty terrible job explaining this, and left out a lot of important details, but otherwise this would’ve been pages and pages long, and no one wants to read all that.

63,yksjysjys,1625026096,1,"I'm somewhat used to it by now. I'm an ambivert leaning towards the introvert side and it's tough to talk about stuff that's negative or not constructive. I love having goofy conversations. In some way, I guess I just want to make people happy. I love almost everyone. I love just walking and watching birds play or planes fly. If I see a dog and their owner looks friendly, you bet I'm going down there to pat and say ""goodest doggo"". 

But uhh, I'm a lonely guy. I don't have what people call ""true friends"". I talk to a bunch of people, hang out with them, but then what? It's just not fulfilling. I'd love to be friends with someone who is really positive in a realistic way. Someone who doesn't mind if a stranger is rude to them randomly. Someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously. Someone who'll basically just be goofy with me and laugh stuff off. 

Ah well. I'm writing this for myself I guess. Listening and singing along with ""The Fray"" post midnight. All in all, even if I'm lonely, I'm reasonably happy :)

Hi. I'm lonely. I feel totally alone. I'm in my 20s, a time in which I see everyone surrounded by friends or those, like me, with none at all. It's like we're in these bubbles; reaching out to touch others can be too hard, and everyone outside seems too bothered with the bubble to try and get in. 
I want to gather all the bubbles. All of you, lonely and sad, I'm lonely too. I want to talk to you. You don't have to talk back, that's okay. We can just sit together, and you can listen, and I can try to make you smile, and feel less alone... I'll make jokes, sing songs, or whatever you need.
Because I am SO lonely and SO empty on the inside. And I just don't want you to feel like me. I want to be there for you, and hear you, and help you feel joy that you deserve. Maybe we can just be in our bubbles, but together. 
I think I'm going to start some kind of stream... where I'm just there. So that if you feel alone, you can be with me and we can talk, or we can just exhist next to each other, through a screen. But I'll be there, when you've had a bad day, when someone cancels plans on you, or ghosts you, or forgets your birthday or even when you're in a crowd but feel like a ghost.

72,-Dancing,1625021960,1,"It's been 6 years since I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. The same length that the relationship was...

&amp;#x200B;

I was 25 then, and we had been seeing each other for 6 years. I met her when we were 19, we met, fell in love and moved in with each other. 6 years later though, I wanted to take my life in a different direction and she didn't want that. So I pulled the plug on the whole thing and made the decision.

Things got nasty before they got okay. I went back to university, got a degree like I wanted too...

&amp;#x200B;

but nothing has come like I thought it would, I failed to find a job with my new degree. (I know global pandemic). It's been 2 years since graduation and I don't think I will find a job that justifies the loans. I thought by choosing a STEM degree things would be okay. I was making a wise investment in myself.

I went to therapy, got help, got on medication. Things became more stable then they ever have been before, but I gained a tremendous amount of weight, to the point I feel uncomfortable in my own body.

I've had a stable dead end job for the last 4 years. It's a small business, the owners treat me well, but I make so little that I won't be able to move out of my parents soon.

&amp;#x200B;

So within that context, I've foresworn dating. I tried a little after the break-up and had minimal success. They say dating for women is like being thirst in the middle of a salt water sea, while dating for men is like being thirst in a desert. It's the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

And to be honest, I don't wanna date anyone. I rather like being single, but I do miss the nights of cuddling and watching a movie, playing a board game with each other, or going out to eat. I miss an autumn hike. I miss having someone to hold sometimes in the middle of the night or someone to come home to, I miss the companionship.

I guess I just want my cake and to eat it too.

Although I've learned that loneliness hurts for different reasons, it really hurts when you want someone. I wanted someone two years ago and I'm pretty sure there was a good chance they shared that same interest because they seemed to be dropping subtle hints through Instagram (not going to explain why as this would make this post long). We didn't talk either so I was surprised and was ready to break the ice through the DMs that summer since school just ended.

That never happened though. I was too nervous to do it even with the perfect approach to make a move (reply to her IG story) and missed. Even then they still dropped subtle hints from time to time and I still didn't make a move. Looking back, I probably could've started doing so during the pandemic but I thought it was too late.

Like the title says though, I still want them. Thought I wouldn't see them again after I graduated high school last year but I've ran into her a few times at the park while shooting around and that's only made me want her more. 

I want to do something but I don't have much hope. She isn't viewing every single one of my IG stories anymore like she did for the past two years (which is why I still think I could have made a move last year looking back). Not sure how much that means though.

Honestly, I'd think to myself when it was currently going, that I didn't know how I landed a long lasting relationship with someone like her. We wasn't much alike in terms of hobbies, but there was something there that we could just talk for hours on the phone and we wouldn't get bored.

Now, she's been in a successful relationship for about 3 years now and I miss her so much and at the same time I'm so damn pissed and jealous over it. She's living what we always talked about. And I just feel so ultimately replaced. Like no one batted an eye. 

And I'm already really shy/socially awkward when I first meet someone. And no matter where I look, I always feel like I'm very much not alike a lot of people. Or at least date-able material. 

I'm a easy friend to make and a good one at that. I can make people laugh and chat with them perfectly fine once I talk to them for just a little bit. But in terms of impressing or alluring or whatever someone, I just see myself so indifferent from the norm or most.

98,imtiNation,1625010525,1,"I think i have hit the acceptance stage of really understanding that i am really lonely and probably really depressed. Ive avoided this for the past couple of years but i suppose these feelings have hit home strongly today and stem from incidents from the past couple years and recent events. 

My whole life growing up ive always had loads of friends but i suppose as you get older its natural to see your list of close friends shorten as you all go about different paths in life. 3 years ago, i had 2 people who i would consider my closest friends and people who i had known for a good 10 years. While on holiday we booked a room for 3 beds, we turn up to the room and there were only 2 beds. We complained and the hotel decided to add in a folding bed. I jumped into the shower and when i came out, i was told that the folding bed would be mine. Now im the tallest out of my mates and at the time probably the biggest in terms of weight, so it felt wrong that i would take the folding bed but i accepted it. Having slept extremely rough that night i began to realise that my friendship with these 2 people who i had considered my best friends were actually built on all the sacrifices that i make and realised that the friendships have always been one sided. Whenever it was one of their birthdays, i would buy them a gift and treat them to dinner, I would always listen to their problems and make them my own and i have lent out money to them in times of need. However, none of the above was ever reciprocated, i never really got birthday wishes not that they ever remembered (frankly not a big deal) and they never really had time for me when i had issues. It was an awful feeling to realise that they just sort of expect me to just accept and make sacrifices for them and it hit me that i always accepted it in fear of having no supposed 'close' friends and i was simply holding onto them due to the fear of being lonely and because we had been friends for a number of years. After the holiday, i mentioned this to them and decided to end this relationship but a part of me felt like staying and hoping that they would message and ask why i was feeling this way and find ways to mend our relationships. A couple weeks passed and they never even messaged me to ask why i felt this way and why i decided to end our friendship. It felt incredible that these 2 people for whom i would go out of my way to always help and support did not even bother to drop me a message to see how i was or even call me to check in. 3 years later and still no message from the people who i always felt like i shared some of my best memories in life with. Extremely depressing when i look back on old photos. 

Last week, i was speaking with my siblings and they all spoke about what their plans and holidays with friends would be once covid restrictions have fully lifted in the UK and we sort of went around the table and when it came to me, my only answer was to talk about my job and career. The truth is, to avoid how lonely i was, my job and career completely took over my life to the point where i became a workaholic. All my spare time was just dedicated to work which helped in pushing me up the career ladder fast i suppose and for a while filled the hole of lack of friends and being lonely. A recent job change has meant that I am no longer extremely busy and work can no longer take up all my spare time so I just have so much spare time but no one to share it with. 

I sit in my apartment wondering how I have reached the stage of having no friends in my life and realising how lonely i feel. Was i right in ending the relationships with 2 of the people i considered my close friends? My job means i only have interaction with a handful of people and i unfortunately have either nothing in common with them or they are too junior for me to have really strong relationships with as it may come into conflict with the senior role I have as i directly supervise them and would not want to cause any issues at work. 

Honestly I would do anything to have a friend I could go to the pub with, to talk the entire night away to, to speak about the future and things life may bring, to go out to eat at restaurants or go to the cinema. Just a friend to simply say hello to and laugh with. I am grateful to have a loving family and amazing siblings who always come over to my apartment and check in on me, but i still feel so lonely inside. 

Over time, do we all accept that we are destined to be alone/ feel lonely and just get on with life? How do you make these feelings disappear or even suppress them? I almost feel frightened to approach people and have found myself to distance myself from any social events in the fear of finding a friend and then just losing them and finding myself scrolling through memories and missing them. 

Sorry for the really long post, I have no one to really explain how lonely i feel to.

114,RepresentativeZombie,1624999136,1,"I work from home and I have anxiety when I go out, which makes it hard to enjoy going out and harder to meet people. My ex left me (after a year of giving me the could shoulder) in late February 2020, like two weeks before COVID came to the US. I got the first roommate who was interested only to quickly find out that they were a COVID denier, and I really didn't want to deal with that, so I helped them find a new place.

Despite visiting with family on the weekends and hanging out with my ex (who I started to be friends with again a few months after we split up,) I felt like I was going crazy from loneliness during COVID. and one big reason why I thought things would get better is that I could find a roommate, someone I'd get along with. I didn't expect them to be best friends or anything, but someone I could at least talk to or hang out with sometimes.

I interviewed about ten people, but there was a clear standout; someone who I ended up chatting with for hours after the interview. We had a bunch in common, and we seemed to get along great. I fast-tracked things and they moved in!

Fast forward a few weeks. They moved in, and... I literally never see them most days. Even on days where they stay home all day (which I only know from their car,) they literally never leave their room except to use the bathroom or get DoorDash food. It's like they're trying to avoid me almost all of the time, a total 180 from how they were before they moved in. At first I was worried that I'd done something to offend them, but then one day they were in a social mood and we talked for a while. They were perfectly jovial, like everything was fine... and then they retreated back to their room and barely said a word for another week.

I make more than enough to afford the place, and while the extra money is nice the main reason I wanted a roommate is to have someone around who I got along with... and it's clearly not going super well in that regard.

125,bigpoopy93,1624992489,1,"I don’t understand this pattern. I go through one traumatic event after another, and after each one I’ve had less and less people to support me and by last year after being abandoned by the person closest to me who I was in a relationship with, I also lost the rest of the few friends I had left except for one, so then that person was being supportive and was condemning my ex for how they discarded me and condemning my old friends for also ditching me, yet sooner or later, as usual.. that person ended up abandoning me too and now avoids talking to me. 

So the same people who have been there for me after others abandon me, abandon me in the same way later or the same people who condemn those who have harmed/abandoned me, and who say they would never do something like that, end up doing the same thing to me later on even though they said they wouldn’t and condemned others for doing that previously, and were supporting me after someone ELSE did that to me. 

What gives... seriously... and it’s always people that voluntarily try to be there for me and be in my life , people that sought me out to begin with and once I felt it was safe enough to confide in them I did but then they seem to like get tired of me, maybe because my problems aren’t short term and I have a lot of illnesses and traumatic circumstances that aren’t just temporary hardships, maybe they all just get tired of me then. It’s like clockwork, the same pattern happens every single time. I’m just kind of floored at this point and I wish I could get an explanation. Or if someone doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore I would rather them just tell me they aren’t comfortable being friends anymore or something.. instead of the friend-ghosting thing. Especially when these are people who are literally aware of my issues and abandonment trauma, and like I said, are the same ones who have condemned OTHERS for hurting me, ghosting me, abandoning me.. like .. make it make sense.. 

I also find this almost comical in a way. Because years ago before my life was ruined, I used to be considered like, a cool person..I had a lot of people trying to be in my life and also a lot of leeches and users, they all wanted something from me because I had “connections” and did a lot of stuff, helped people out.. so now it’s surreal because it’s become the opposite since I’ve become chronically ill and had my mental stuff and trauma grow over time. Now it’s like- everyone avoids me and I’m like I  guess I was only good for something and deserved to exist when I benefitted others. But now if I’m no longer a resource to people then I guess not worth knowing me. I’m upset that my fears and beliefs have only been reinforced. I know people have lives and the world doesn’t revolve around me. But all people do is try to be in my life and then once I let them in the disappear like the last ones did. When they said they wouldn’t. Why? Am I that defective? Does this happen to anyone else? 

TL;DR:

Every time someone has abandoned me, someone else was there for me, condemning the other person, only for them to eventually abandon me in the same way. And the cycle repeats itself, til now there’s basically none left.",lonely,Everyone abandons me. Like everyone.,2021-06-30 04:48:09

Of course, I did my best comfort her and listen to her as she was very upset as it was her idol. She doesn't know her idol personally but it disturbed her greatly of course as they did help cheer her up and inspired her for almost 3 years now . I don't regret answering her call and I feel glad that she was able to feel better somehow. Plus, before I called her I was actually celebrating my birthday w/ my older sisters and my mother so I had to make her wait for 30 mins (which is bad of me).

One thing I do is search for horny girls to text with. There also there's no luck for me. Its happening now. There are a lot of other things I can do, I know.

But right now I want some connection that's sexual. Atleast virtually. And anonymously.

I feel like I’ve just been letting my life pass me by. Not really interested in anything or anyone one. I just go to work, do everything that needs to get done and just keep on going. I just live life day by day, keeping my head down and not bothering anyone. I’m sick of it but I did this to myself and now I’m paying the price. 

I’ve been alone for a long time, I’ve gotten used to it. Happiness doesn’t last long and when I do finally feel somewhat happy It doesn’t feel real. The only real happiness I feel is when I walk home after a long day and see how excited my doggo gets. Idk why I’m writing this but im feeling very down. I can usually just keep on going but man has it been tough and just wanted to vent.

I feel like I miss talking to people and just having someone there. But after giving it some thought, it’s probably better I don’t talk to people. I’m probably going to keep on powering through the loneliness like I always do.

I still do. 

I just don't like to see anyone.. It's been like this for more than a year.

I havent talked to anyone today. Found this sub. Just typing my thoughts. I'm sure the bot will remove my post like all the other posts I posted on reddit.. But anyway.. I'll just type for myself..

My ex today told me that she got ""Kicked out"" from her home by her mom. My heart broke. Because it affirmed I was right. She used to live with me, then said I'm bad and left. Changed her number. NEver called me again. I knew I'm not the problem. I knew she has undiagnosed BPD. But she wont get help. She wont acknowledge it.

 I dont mind being alone. I dont mind she's gone. I'm used to losing the things I love. My cousin, who was like my brother, died at age of 38 one year ago from cancer. Since he got cancer.. over those 2-3 yrs that he was sick.. Everything changed for me.. my entire worldview.. Nothing really makes me happy anymore.. I keep thinking about my cousin, Peyman. How hard he worked to become a professor at oxford university.. And then died. Now he's sleeping under ashes forever. Makes me question things.. made me question everything.. Do I really wanna go through with all this.. all these exams.. all this stress.. all this debt.. BAR exam.. and then work hard.. for what.. to die like my cousin like I never existed before? Heh.. Let me get back to my Ex issue..

It doesnt make me sad that she is not with me. I want her to be happy. It would have made me happy had I heard today that she is dating a guy and they love each other. But now I heard that she again got kicked out becuz she fought with her mom/siblings..  she did the same thing when she was in my home.. and did the same thing when she was at her dad's home.. Today I googled it.. I found they say theres direct relationship between BPD and homelssness.. It makes me sad. It breaks my heart to see her going through this. She is brilliant. The only child in 9 children who went to school and  got her law degree.. but her injuries and parental neglect from childhood are clearly there.. stess, anxiety, inability to communicate.. anything you name it that is needed to destroy her life forever. And the fact that shem again, got kicked out of her moms home today confirmed that my theory of her Borderline and her problems continiue to persist and get worse and worse over the years.. It just makes me sad. Totally good girl, a brilliant person, her life destroyed because of all the neglect her parents did during childhood.. she's 33 now and literally doesnt know how be in a relationship, with anyone.. (Thus constatnly gets kicked out wherever she lives.. In fact.. I never kicked her out, she just leaves and later says you kicked her out..)

Anyway.. Just my busy mind.. I feel much better writnig these here.. Even i f it made sense to no one.

All this only to reach a point where there’s no fixing the shit he’s born into as things only get worse. His whole life is nothing but a joke. And since he has no purpose he simply treats everything and everyone like a joke because he’s got nothing to lose.

I don’t sympathize with his actions only his circumstance which they were able to capture so beautifully. Because although even though my life isn’t as harsh as people like his.

212,mo-91,1624941624,1,"Some nights I cry myself to sleep because I feel so lonely. I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship. Not necessarily for sex but for the companionship and being able to share experiences with someone that you love and care about.

I have a great group of friends that I love and cherish and I do enjoy spending time with them. But I see them able to meet people that are interested in them so easily. They jump on dating apps or social media and they get matches and there there’s me. I hardly get any matches and if  I do I automatically think it was an accident and if I do reach out I don’t get any responses. If I’m on social media I see old friends and classmates that are married and have families and I wonder why I don’t deserve that too. It’s a huge blow to my already non existent self esteem. Although I am happy for them I want to have that experience as well. I try to stay off of them so I don’t feel disappointed. 

I try not to compare myself to other people but its so hard not to. I try to make myself feel better and try to feel positive. But when you try to tell yourself that you’re a kind and funny person its hard to believe it when no one else seems to realize it. I’ll tell myself that you don’t need another person to make you happy to try and soothe myself. I’m also so mean to myself. I tell myself that I’m ugly, if i mess one little thing up I tell myself I’m stupid and I can never do anything right and I tell myself maybe if I lost weight someone would finally want me. Sometimes I wish I could escape my thoughts and not be able to think or feel anything. 

Just one time I wish someone had their eye on me. I wish someone was glad to see me and couldn’t wait to talk to me and tell me about their day. I wish someone smiled when they looked at me because they were glad that they were mines. Maybe one day it will happen and maybe one day I won’t have to feel like this anymore.",lonely,30F never had any intimacy. Long rant,2021-06-29 14:40:24

They obviously never gave me any affection and pretty much hated me for reasons ill never understand as i've just been a normal kid.

This made me become this mess of a person and since I couldn't find affection within my own family (even something as simple as a hug) I really needed someone to be with to feel comforted and loved and appreciated.

My mental health kept diving as the abuse got worse and as a result I kept losing friends because they either judged me and thought i was just overreacting or doing it for attention.

This further made things worse for me, but I finally met this girl who I just found comfort in. Her hugs, holding her hand, all these small things just made me feel happy for once.

But, things at home kept getting worse for no reason at all (and I mean no reason because my parents are messed up in the head idek how) and over time my issues kept growing.

My issues caused her to get insecure about whether i'd keep loving her and that just hurt me for some reason, and over time my issues got too much for her too handle as she snapped at me for always thinking about myself when all I was trying to do was to just feel some sort of comfort :(

I've never been a bad person, I've just had the worst luck and been in the worst situations and now I am stuck in a room in a country where its a triple lockdown, far away from my old home, from my old life, from my old friends, from everything.

I have had many people in my life, but, sometimes, I wonder, whether they see me more as a counselor counselor won't charge them for listening to their whining, or just a set of ears that will reciprocate to their bullshit that no one else will.

Does that make me sad? Does that make me lonely? Does that make me insignificant and worthless?

To answer those questions, it all depends on my mood, and sorry to disappoint, but none of the answers would be considered anything ""positive"". It's more of ""bad"", ""worse"", ""worst"", or ""catastrophic fuck up.""

People have told me that I'm a good listener, and I actually listen, not just to hear them and then forget about it seconds later. To give you an example, my ex always appreciated me for remembering her favorite chocolate, something that no one ever cared for, it's sugar free Hersheys milk chocolate. Other times, I would stay up all night long, listening to someone crying, whining, venting and having a meltdown over her boyfriend issue, which is fucked up, because the boyfriend in question happened to be a buddy of mine and that I had hardly spoken a word to her until that moment, where she whined all night long.

But... along the way, what I've learned is that...

- if I choose to stick around, I cannot blame others, because I was able to see the signs and yet I chose to be there for the person; and
- I can walk away, and not feel guilty for caring myself.

I don't know if this is a typical post on this subreddit, but I genuinely wish, and hope, everyone finds their own happiness and feel wholesome, because, there will always be someone, who would appreciate you for who you are, even though he/she may not be in your life right now, or that you have doubts and are terrified of it.

She broke up with me nearly 4 months ago, we spent 2 months apart, and in that time she got with a new guy and dumped him, because of how she claims she felt about me. Since then, we've been meeting, talking frequently and so on. she's asked for time before she makes any choices, which I understand. theres more to it than that, but thats the gist of it.

Im just so tired of constantly being told how it'll go wrong and how I'm being blinded by love or fear of lonliness or whatever other crap I get told. I KNOW there is a pretty strong possibility this wont work. I DO have worries I'm being used as a crutch or being kept around till something better comes along. I DO have plenty of trust issues now because of this, but despite this I have a chance. A CHANCE at getting back with someone that I still care about. Someone that means a lot to me.

Ive spoke with family and friends and all i get is, shes keeping you around as a crutch, be careful, she'll hurt you again. Guess what? I already fucking know I could get hurt again! I'm terrified of getting rejected again. But I geuninely do believe I have a chance.

Having everyone tell me what a dumbass im being by giving her a second chance, spoils any enjoyment I get out of spending time with her. Even if it is only as friends. I'm constantly anxious of what shes doing and reading in to everything she says WAY deeper than necessary. All because NOBODY seems to care about how I feel.

I want to be with her. Now if it doesnt happen I can live with it. It'll hurt like fuck, I'll be upset at being rejected, but at least I tried. At least its over and done with.

302,GPottsK13,1624903585,1,"Hi All,

I just felt like I needed to vent somewhere so here goes. So I have felt alone for a while now maybe 2 - 3 years and its not that I am alone but I feel it all the time, I have friends I see often and family that is great and very loving. Yet I feel so alone in a way that I haven't felt like someone wants me or wants to be with me, like im just there because I was in the group chat or that someone else was with me at the time that plans where made. 

I have also been single for a while now coming up to 7 years and im talking like no female interaction apart from chatting when I see them in person, this is mainly my doing as have kept to myself and not ""put myself out there"" you could say but I have also never had someone come up to me and try anything with me. Like when I think about it, its weird but I just have very little to no interactions that are ""sexual"" or even flirty. I don't really know what it fells like to be loved by someone in that way as I don't think I have ever had someone actually want to be with me.

I like my work in fact I love my work and the people I work with but feel like im someone else when im there like im just putting up a show, I don't pretend to be someone else but its like me in HD with subtitles your just getting more of me sort of (that was hard to explain ahah). Its a very physical job so I think I just get lost in the work and forget the loneliness while im there. 

I'm 25 I just want someone. I get very jealous of my mates in relationships as I feel like I have missed out on knowing what that feels like as only having relationships when I was younger that didn't really mean much. I don't really have anyone I can come home and just be with.

I feel like I have to start conversations with people not that they want to start one with me. Its hard.

I'm a bit lost and didn't know where to turn.

305,CozyLens44,1624901808,1,"So, me and this girl have been messaging each other online from halfway across the world for a little over a year now. 

We really connected at first, even if it wasn’t for the best reasons. We both suffer from anxiety and depression, and used the internet as an escape from that. She was someone who no matter what I could vent to, and I was someone who supported her and helped her no matter what. That was our friendship, and it worked. At least, I thought it did...

Over time it became more and more obvious to me that she really wasn’t helping me, and that our whole friendship was just me pushing her.

Pushing her to open up.

Pushing her to get better.

Pushing her to be my friend.

And it just got too much for me... it is too much for me. I’m so tired of our friendship- it just feels so draining. It’s either me pouring my heart out to her, and getting nothing. Or it’s me giving 200% just to help her, which very often is in vain.

Of course though, I communicate with my friends- and I’ve brought these problems up with her many times. But.. she just never really gets any better.
And, when you can’t even see a person without the problems you hate about them- is it even possible for them to change? 

One of the main things that is keeping me attached to her is the fact that I care about her well being. She’s been depressed, and even somewhat suicidal in the past... so, as long as I’m somewhat attached to her- it feels like I can keep an eye on her, and make sure she doesn’t do anything drastic.

Not that she really needs me to do that for her though, she is getting help as far as I’m aware. She’s seeing a therapist, something I’m very proud of her for doing. But, the thought of me leaving... and then something going wrong; that terrifies me.

But yeah, that’s my situation. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, as she’s usually the person I talk to about issues like this in my life. So... I feel pretty fucking lonely right now.

Any advice and or insight is appreciated.

We share chores, do the shopping, hang out, chat, just, exist together. And it's nice. He also cares about me, seemingly more than anyone I've seen who's not related to me by blood, and hell, even a good chunk of those. If I'm not home on time, he'll check in, if I'm acting strange, he'll ask if I'm okay, he'll tell me off if I do too much on my own, he helps when I ask. Hell, he even does the thing where it I write something in another language he'll translate it and call me on my emo shit. And I've realized, in some small, tiny way this has to be similar to having a partner, a boyfriend, any of that, and it's so nice? I had no idea what I was missing, and now I want the whole thing. Really, really bad. I want all the stuff now, but also cuddles and kisses and love and affection and hanging out and watching shit together and couple stuff. It's like I've finally seen how nice it is to have someone around all the time and now I'm dying to have the full thing and keep it and I don't know how. And I know I can't have that from him, and that's totally fine, I'm good with that, but I want to find someone I can have all that with. 

Then there's the fact his presence is causing no small rift in my family. And that's okay, my family isn't great anyhow, so I'll gladly have a good friend around and cause some issues with already less than stellar family. My grandparents hate him being here and are throwing a fit in the only way the know how, basically threatening my home, and telling me they disapprove everytime they see me. Which makes me avoid them and isolate more. And I'm doing the same with my mother and my sisters because I worry they will also tell me how much they don't like it and don't approve, so I avoid them. Even when I go into bed my cats stay with him and I get left totally alone, that's why I got the cats to start with, to be less alone. 

I don't have many friends to talk to as is, so I can't discuss this with anyone really. The one friend I do have is his ex so she's a bit biased so she's out. And I doubt discussion will help, but sometimes I just want to tell someone what is going on.",lonely,"I think I figured out why, but that's not helping with how to fix it",2021-06-28 23:33:38

So then I moved to another branch and even tho my friend was not working at the other branch I still tried to contact him from texting and phoneing him but then one day I decieded to ask him to hang out and honeslty it just aint fare that he is busy and does not get to my texts because I was sick of being bored at home and even tho he gives me comics and shit he never asks me to hang out because when someone give u all this shit they should count as friends right? Little did I know I was not happy at myself for my job because I hated my job so much that I decided to ask him to hang out or if he had better people to hang out with cause no one hangs out with me these days because I was sick of fucking excuses and shit even to the point where I even got paranoid that he was seeing other people ever since I left because he never checks in to see how I was going or even for a catch-up!

I have acquaintances, and people that I’m friendly with and would chat to for ages on a night out for example. 
However I have never had that core group of friends for years and years that other people always seem to have.

I can honestly say I don’t have any ‘enemies’ or friendships that have ended on bad terms... they just seem to fade away and I don’t know why because friendships mean so much to me.

Idk but a combination of shyness and insecurity have  always locked my deepest feels inside, resulting in this empty feeling.

369,Global_Maintenance_,1624867739,1,"I'll make this short. I have been in a relationship with the love of my life for the passed two years through college. She's a year behind me, I just graduated. I took it upon myself to move from the US to South Korea after graduation to pursue some personal growth and a career for myself which I have been wanting to do since Sophomore year. I was going to drop out of school to do so at that time, but then I met her and decided I would stay in school and remain in a relationship with her. 

I ended things with her because I didn't think it was fair for the two of us to be so hung up on each other, calling every day, trying to FaceTime all day every day - it would just do more hurt than good. It's been two weeks now without my best friend. When we left each other we just laid in bed together holding each other crying for hours - literally -  knowing that the end was here and all I want to do is cry in her arms even more. I don't want to say end because who knows what the future holds, but it feels like someone very close to me has literally been ripped out of my body. Ripped out of my soul. Our relationship was amazing like the kind where we ""finish each others... sandwiches"". We hung out all the time together, so much to the point that she wouldn't even hang out with her girls without me being there and vice versa with my friends. Not on any trust issue shit, just because we're each others best friend and who else would we want to hang out with? She would work at night and I would go sit with her at work. The nights she wasn't sleeping over at my house, we'd call each other and fall asleep together on FaceTime. 

We haven't blocked each other or unfollowed or anything, just both agreed that we should stop talking and try to move on in order to grow more as individuals. I'm starting to hate myself for making this decision. I miss her so much I just don't know what to do. I don't think it's fair for me to reach out to her considering its only been two weeks and I initiated this - we agreed that we want to be friends at some point but I just really don't think that its possible atm. 

Not only am I in Korea on the other side of the world, I'm locked in a two week quarantine not able to leave the Hotel room. I just have so much time in my head and on my phone stalking her profile, our memories, photos and videos together. Thinking about messaging her. Wondering what she's doing, whether she's already talking to other people. I'm just so deep in my head I don't know what to do. It fucking sucks. I'm not really close with anyone as my friendships kind of faded over the past two years considering I found my person, so I don't have anyone to talk to or vent to. 

I'm just distraught and in constant heartache. Idk why I'm even posting here. I'm sure my story isn't even that bad, especially considering this was my decision - but what do you want me to say? I'm happy?

Guess it wasn't that short. But I just want to vent, cry, scream. I feel like I'm imploding. I wish my ADD would actually start tripping me out so I could think about anything other than her. But no.",lonely,My decision. My fault. My loneliness.,2021-06-28 18:08:59

372,throwitawayfor3v3r,1624864419,1,"TLDR at the bottom 

Single 27 year old woman here. I'm sorry if I do sound jaded but the truth is, that's how I feel. I've had some terrible friends who ended up betraying me and not being genuine, friendships that fizzled out and so on. I've had ""friends"" who hooked me up with a bad ex only to take his side after being hurt. ""Friends"" who verbally put me down and so on...

The situation started from me moving to the middle of nowhere, having severe anxiety and not being able to meet people. The village I lived in were full of heavy drugs, toxic people and absolutely nothing to do. No clubs, groups ect, even in the surrounding parts (I think that there must've been one group for people aged 50+ on meetup). I also had mental health issues and other conditions which leave me unable to work full time. Since moving I also only kept in contact with 1 close friend who I ended up ghosting as she was so abusive and I couldn't tolerate it anymore (And I never ghost people unless the connection cannot be rectified). I was also at university but I only had associates who were just frankly out for themselves/their own grades ect.

When the isolation REALLY kicked in as soon as I moved, I've tried speaking to online counsellors and had advice from parents, people on forums ect. And despite having severe anxiety, agoraphobia and many trust issues then, I tried to be as proactive as possible. ""Try meetup"", ""Try online dating"", ""Try bumble BFF""... Yeah, none of those worked and it is NOT that simple, I honestly get sick of hearing these suggestions. Although these options HAVE helped some people, they don't work for many other people. It can be a real kick in the teeth for those who try to be proactive, especially those with anxiety.

Here are my experiences with the 3....

**Online dating** - *This resulted in me being stalked or dealing with people who only wanted hookups ect. I've been on and off them for years and long enough to know that I will NOT meet someone through them or anyone that I click with through an app. I'm also an intense person who loves deep conversations, so the constant small talk was painful for me! I've also dealt with abusive guys on there and it ruined my self confidence. My experiences have been so bad with online dating and I've tried time and time again only to make it work only to realise why I quit them in the first place. Deleted the apps for good and have been happier since...*



**Bumble BFF** - *I've been on this app on and off for a while and spoke to a few people for many months at a time. But one experience on there really put me off! 

I spoke to one woman for quite a few months, like at least 6 months. She knew a lot about my situation (I described above), the bad friends I had, was dead supportive and seemed lovely... Until I noticed red flags (which I ignored!) and met her in person. She would constantly send me screenshots of her other friends messages and even sent me photos of her friends partner and told me intimate details of their sex life (Or lack of sex life). But the truth is, I never met these people and you should not be doing this to your friends. 

When we met, it took a ton of courage since I had to travel a VERY long way to see her due to living in the sticks and having anxiety from not going out much... Anyway, she had this horrible type of bitchy/hostile vibe when we met and rarely spoke. She kept rolling her eyes and acted like she didn't want to be there (which ill get to soon). I bought us food, tried to be as nice as possible and had to LITERALLY CARRY THE CONVERSATION. Now despite having some form of social anxiety, I'm luckily very good and holding conversations and even then, it was SO hard. It was like we had nothing in common, all those months of chatter went down the pan. Anyway, back to the part where she acted like she didn't want to be there, she is one of those dishonest people who won't tell you she doesn't want to go out or meet up if she doesn't want to. 

I asked her if she would be too tired meeting after work and she kept insisting it was fine. When I got the vibe that she didn't want to be there I immediately got flashbacks of a conversation we had. She sent screenshots of a group chat of her and her friends bickering over organizing a day out and asked for advice. It was literally like that mean girls phone conversation. Her friends were leaving the group chat/excluding members to bitch about them behind eachothers backs. It was a case of, ""I don't want to go with this person but I can't say anything"". I just told her that if you don't want to go, just say so. Stop saying this behind eachothers backs. Anyway, this made me realise how bitchy and two faced people can be and put me off of female friends, especially since you can only befriend people of your own gender on BFF. Oh and what do you know, she ghosts me. She didn't even have the decency to block me because at least then, ill get the message. I thought something had happened to her initially and was worried.

As for the other people, I also spoke to another woman on and off for a year or so. She is a nice person but it felt so forced and I was carrying most of the conversation and knew it would be awkward if we met. I opened up a lot to her but she just didn't get it or was understanding when as a friend so I didn't feel comfortable talking anymore. So when I was done with bumble I was done with everyone associated with it as I was sick of carrying conversations and just not connecting with people. Tried talking to males on there and it was just like dating apps. Wheb I spoke to people it would involve me trying to make or carry the conversation based on their bios and 90% of conversations would go like this, ""Oh so have you visited [insert place here] or do you like [insert thing here]?"" ""Yeah I've visited there and like it."" - it was so frustrating that I'd unmatch people like this instantly, now imagine what it would be like actually meeting people like this and trying to carry a dead conversation in real life. After a couple years on and off the app I was done for good. Also matched with some males on there that came across as very judgemental and rude, I find that people on apps are more horrible and less respectful in general. I honestly hate what swiping apps have done to society and will never use one again. I've also met someone on reddit previously who said she met nobody on bumble BFF too and its not worth using. It honestly doesn't differ that much from the dating version.

Oh, I've also made, ""online friends"" on Twitter and I never kept in contact with some of these people as people can be the worst, most judgemental people online as I said before. Especially if there are 0 consequences. Many stuff and people I spoke to on twitter gave me major trust issues and made me realise how bitter, miserable and easily offended people can be.*

3. **Meetup, city socializer and eventbrite** *With eventbrite, many are events that are just listed there. You don't know if anyone will turn up and is preferably for those who already have friends to go with.

With meetup was virtually non existent... Many people will RSPV to an event but never turn up. Now this is the worst thing for someone who has social anxiety, has to psyche themselves up to turn up alone only for nobody to turn up. So I didn't bother going to any events as they were too far away and the events/groups weren't clear enough. If the groups were more active and they had things like, ""Meet us by the entrance or contact the group leader if you get lost"" that would help... It was just you had to turn up and hope for the best. Now, meetup is even more nonexistent due to the pandemic and isn't even worth using... and I'm not good with virtual events, I actually find it more nervewracking being on camera than meeting people in person. I've also tried City socializer and paid, by the time I did that there were barely any users and only a few online events where nobody attended. It was a waste of money.*

This sounds negative but in the end, I had to stop trying and put myself first. Because all of this was making me feel a lot worse. 

So how am I doing now? I'm on meds, practicing more self care and appreciating what I have. I've got back in touch with one male friend I was going to go on a staycation with but it didn't work and hes terrible at communicating at times. But its nice to have him in the background, I've never had any horrible red flags or vibes like I did with people in the recent past and can talk to him without it being forced. It's like I can talk to him and keep a convo going with minimal effort compared to the methods I've tried and that's how a friendship should be. I've also moved to a much nice place but there's nothing I could do due to the pandemic making it VERY hard, so I have no friends in this new area too but luckily live with family. There was even a lovely yoga studio at the end of my street I wanted to join but closed down due to the pandemic and every event is... online. After my experiences, I don't care how lonely I feel, I will never go back to apps or forcing connections and feeling THAT low. Because that makes you feel more alone. 

I've self referred to a mental health service that usually does social groups. As for when they will do them again, I don't know. I'm also keeping an eye for for ANY real classes but won't get my hopes up in those working out either, even if everything was open. Now, I believe that these things shouldn't be forced and how it is pointless trying to build a connection online. I feel like my chances of having a social circle or partner (thats another story!) is done since its so hard to make friends as an adult. So I've looked into becoming a single mother by choice via sperm donation and building my life from there, possibly meeting other by choice mums via that route because I need to do something as I don't want to end up completely alone or worse, without a family and dealing with rubbish like this. Especially after my experiences, I feel like its important to be careful in what you invest your time in and I'd rather invest it in me and starting family rather than trying to fit in, find my place in the world and forcing fake connections. During all of this, I'm lucky enough to have a small supportive family and a mother who is like a best friend to me. 

So if you're constantly told to join a club, try BFF or meetup and have social anxiety. I know how tough it is! And if it has worked for you or people you know, great! I just wish that people would be more understanding and that there will be less stigma amd judgement associated with loneliness as it could happen to anyone. 


TL;DR - Moved house, struggled with isolation, anxiety, depression and making friends as an adult. Online dating, Bumble BFF, Meetup,  Social media, City Socializer did not work. So now focusing on me and building a family on my own instead. I found it easier to accept never fitting in or finding my ""people"" as opposed to forcing things and struggling to fit in.",lonely,I am honestly 100% done with making friends as an adult...

373,stockeh_,1624864136,1,"My last romantic relationship five years back took a toll on me and I lost most of my friends in the process (roommate cheated with my SO while living together).  I have somewhat come to terms with what has happened and am mostly moved on, albeit the occasional thoughts arise weekly, if not daily.  I have not dated since and my friend groups seem to be shrinking (people moving after college). 

I feel like my hobbies (i.e. disc golf, photography, coffee, and music) and my day-to-day work (I’m a Ph.D. student) aren’t apt for meeting new people naturally… everything seems so saturated with digital interactions.  I’ve been trying the whole online dating scene using different apps for a while, which now feels very robotic and I haven’t had any real connection.  I would love to be in a relationship again.  In person, I’m starting to feel more invisible… everyone in line at a coffee shop is laughing with their friends or staring at their phone waiting to order.  It seems invasive trying to meet new people nowadays, as if you’re stealing their attention, and pealing them away from their moment.  Am I wrong to think this?

Unfortunately, I have started to drink more too, and while cognizant of it, I’m not happy with it and I can’t figure out what I’m trying to numb out.  Does anyone else feel lost trying to figure out why they are lonely?  People say to find yourself and do what you enjoy - I love my hobbies and school work - but when I’m not “distracted” with those things, my mind goes to a dark place.  Can anyone relate?

My birthday was 4 days ago and I don’t really have many friends or well any really close friends who would remember my birthday. I thought I’d be okay since I have my girlfriend with me. I thought hey she’ll send a happy birthday message with a little paragraph about how she loves me and that’s all I need. I would’ve happy with that. It’s 12 am(on the day of my birthday) so it’s now my birthday but she was busy all day that day so I thought hey she probably fell asleep so I’ll just send a goodnight message and I’ll wake up to a happy birthday message tmr and it’ll feel really nice. I normally stay up till 3 in the morning so that’s what I was doing and I get a message from her at 2 am and she just goes “I’m sorry I knocked out for a bit it was a busy day” and I go “it’s okay, wyd? FaceTime?” (We normally go to sleep on FaceTime) She ends up leaving me on delivered for an hour then texts back at 3 am. She says “nothing much and I don’t really feel like it tonight” then I text back and say “ah alright that’s okay but are you alright? Would you like me to give you some space tonight? We can talk in the morning if you’d like.” She then leaves me on delivered for another hour and texts back at 4 am and says, “I’m fine and ok”. Im already in a bad mood since she hasn’t even mentioned my birthday at all and is taking forever to respond to a simple message. So I just say “ok then well im here if you need me just call. I love you and don’t sleep too late ok?” She ends up leaving me on delivered so I just go to sleep then I wake up at 11 am and no message yet. I text “good morning stoopid”. I don’t get a response until 1 pm and she goes “morning”. No mention of my birthday at all. I text back around 5pm since I was at work and just got on my lunch. I text her and say, “I’m sorry I just got on lunch but uh how’d you sleep? And have you gotten something to eat yet?” She texts me back at 6 pm and says, “fine and yea” thirty minutes later she finally texts, “also happy birthday”. I text back at 10 and say “thanks and my bad I just got out” I had a bad day at work and didn’t even get a happy birthday message that I was really hoping for. Not even an I love you. I finally get to FaceTime time her around 12 and we talk for a few minutes before I asked what happened today since she kinda blew me off on my own birthday and that even though she did it’s okay just talk to me if anything is wrong or going on. She says she okay and that she’s sorry and I asked if she might’ve forgotten my birthday and and she says “no I didn’t I sent a message” and I say “i know but you sent that hours after you woken up and I really appreciate that you at least did remember at some point but I was just really hoping for maybe a little more effort maybe even an I love you with it or something. I’m sorry if that’s asking for too much.” She goes silent for a minute and I just say I’m sorry since I felt like maybe I was the one at fault and maybe I was being rude or something? Idk but I apologized and she just said “no,I’m sorry” and ended the call. I texted her asking what happened and that I’m sorry and I love her and that I’m here if she needs me. She texted “I love you too.” But it’s been 4 days now and she’s been really distant with me and in total she texted me three times everyday, messages are usually hours apart and we usually call at the end of everyday and just talk but she doesn’t want to. I’m not sure what to do or say. Maybe I was asking for too much or was being too selfish maybe? I don’t know. Im sorry this post is long, it’s my first ever post.

So if you're constantly told to join a club, try BFF or meetup and have social anxiety. I know how tough it is! And if it has worked for you or people you know, great! I just wish that people would be more understanding and that there will be less stigma associated with loneliness as it could happen to anyone! 


TL;DR - Moved house, struggled with isolation and making friends as an adult. Online dating, Bumble BFF, Meetup,  Social media, City Socializer did not work. So now focusing on me and building a family on my own instead. I found it easier to accept never fitting in or finding my ""people"" as opposed to forcing things and struggling to fit in.",lonely,I am honestly 100% done with making friends as an adult and have been for a while!

When you start doing what you want and set a routine in your life it gets very lonely. Your peers may not have the same goal as you and therefore you need to leave them and do what makes you happy on your own. But is it really worth going through all this loneliness when at the end of the road you won't have anyone to celebrate with? 

Next year is my last year of college and I don't have any friends. I am very alone and i get wrapped up in my head very often. I go to the gym to ease my mind and even got a tutoring job for the summer. I do other stuff to keep me distracted but sometimes I wish i had friends or even a significant other. Deep down i think/know i am the problem because i am very introverted and find it very difficult to make new friends. Last week I deactivated all my social media. I keep pushing people away.

We hung out today at the beach and she eventually came over and we drank a bit, not too much, and we decided to take a shower together.

We began to make out and feel each other up. I was sort of into it at first, but it just slowly became less enjoyable for me. She kept getting herself off while I just helped. I tried my best to enjoy it but as it went on I was just hoping it would end even quicker. 

She came. We got out the shower, I was nice and gave her some clothes, some water to stay hydrated, and I offered to wash her clothes for her so she can go home and relax. I cracked a couple of funny jokes to keep the mood light and I led her out the door. And now I just feel more empty than before. I don’t really know what to do.

I feel like there's a hole in the center of me that will never be filled, I have plutonic friends and all but I feel like my life is pointless without an intimate partner. Seems like it's too late for that though, I'm not ugly exactly but I'm not attractive enough for online dating, and people just ignore me whenever I try to meet them in person. I'm highly sensitive, which is making this way harder on me than it should be. I'm also into ABDL which basically means that god has forsaken me and I'm unlovable. I'm struggling to accept that I'll never be accepted for who I am, but at this point I don't think it's really possible.

I've realized lately that I'm not completely anhedonic, but that I have an unmet need for a partner. It just seems like a longshot though, should I even try? Suicide is on the table, and seems like the simple and reasonable answer here. I've started sleeping in until my hunger forces me out of bed so I can skip as much of the day as possible, and why not just go all the way? I guess it makes me sad that this is what it comes down to, but such is life I suppose.

400,Larryland1968,1624848998,1,"A time comes in your life when you finally ""get it . . !!!!"". When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop- - - - - - dead in your tracks and somewhere, the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH! Enough fighting and crying, or struggling to hold on.And, like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes, you begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening... You realize that it’s time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change, or for happiness, safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon. You come to terms with the fact that she is not Cinderella and you are not Prince Charming and that in the real world, there aren’t always fairy tale endings (or beginnings for that matter) and that any guarantee of ""happily ever after"" must begin with you and in the process, a sense of serenity is born of acceptance. You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you are . . . and that’s OK. (They are entitled to their own views and opinions.) And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process, a sense of new found confidence is born of self-approval. You stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn’t do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected. You learn that people don’t always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that it’s not always about you. So, you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process, a sense of safety &amp; security is born of self-reliance. You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process, a sense of peace &amp; contentment is born of forgiveness. You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you, is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche. You begin to sift through all the junk you’ve been fed about how you should behave, how you should look and how much you should weigh, what you should wear and where you should shop and what you should drive, how and where you should live and what you should do for a living, who you should marry and what you should expect of a marriage, the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents. You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. You begin reassessing and redefining who you are andwhat you really stand for. You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you’ve outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process, you learn to go with your instincts. You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive and that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a ""consumer"" looking for your next fix.You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a by gone era, but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life. You learn that you don’t know everything: it’s not your job to save the world and that you can’t teach a pig to sing. You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO. You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake. Then you learn about love. Romantic love and familial love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving and when to walk away. You learn not to project your needs or your feelings onto a relationship. You learn that you will not be more beautiful, more intelligent, more lovable or important because of the man on your arm or the child thatbears your name.You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You stop trying to control people, situations and outcomes. You learn that just as people grow and change, so it is with love: and you learn that you don’t have the right to demand love on your terms, just to make you happy.You learn that alone does not mean lonely. You look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a perfect 10 and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you ""stack up."" You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs. You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK and that it is your right, to want things and to ask for the things that you want and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands. You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity and respect and you won’t settle for less. You allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you, to glorify you with thier touch and in the process, you internalize the meaning of self-respect. And you learn that your body really is your temple. And you begin to care for it and treat it with respect. You begin eating a balanced diet, drinking more water and taking more time to exercise. You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear. So you take more time to rest. Just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul: so you take more time to laugh and to play. You learn that for the most part in life, you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen, is different from working toward making it happen. More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline and perseverance. You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that it’s OK to risk asking for help. You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time: FEAR itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears, because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear, is to give away the right to live life on your terms. You learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom. You learn that life isn’t always fair, you don’t always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good people. On these occasions, you learn not to personalize things. You learn that God isn’t punishing you or failing to answer your prayers: it’s just life happening. You learn to deal with evil in its most primal state: the ego. You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls. You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted: things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about: a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower. Slowly, you begin to take responsibility for yourself, by yourself and you make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never ever settle for less than your heart’s desire. You hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind, and you make it a point to keep smiling, to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility. Finally, with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take astand, you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you wantto live as best as you can.",lonely,Awakening,2021-06-28 12:56:38

423,ConnroG,1624836492,1,"The following is a text I was going to send to my mum but I talked myself out of it because I don't want her to have to deal with my problem anymore. So a lot of it might not even make sense without context. Truthfully I have no idea why I'm posting this here, I think I need to just let it out, put it somewhere or heck maybe I just want attention I don't know. 




This might seem very out of the blue but I haven't been doing very good these last few days and I have no idea why. I've been crying for ages tonight/today and I'm starting to get worried about how good I am at hiding it. I don't know why I'm just deciding to tell someone I think I just need to talk to someone.

I really can't picture any way forward without her. I think the cat reminded me just how lonely I've been without her in my life and every single good memory I have relates to her. And now that I have a full time job which I thought would help, and probably will help a little bit, all I can think of is if I just did things differently I could've still had her and my new job and we could've been even happier. I would've been happy to live my whole life like that. But now all I'm thinking is what is the point in even having a job if I'm just going to spend the rest of my life making money for no reason, because before she was my reason for making money and it motivated me to save enough to get our own place. 

Now I'm going to have a job, move out and spend the rest of my days as lonely as I've been feeling without her these last few months for the rest of my life. I love her so much and I lived for her and I would give absolutely anything in the world to see her again. I can't even describe how much she changed my life and my self confidence for the better and the 4 years I spent with her now seem like they were just a dream because I can't even imagine or remember now ever feeling as happy as I did then. I never ever thought anyone would ever want me, in fact I remember crying in work in the mornings before I met her thinking about how my life was going nowhere and even when I met her I never would have gone further than friends if she didn't make it obvious she felt the same way because I felt I wasn't worth getting to know and she could do so much better than someone like me. And actually I never ever stopped thinking that way and I know now I was right too. 

I think one of the reasons it's been worse lately is because I'm starting to forget her face from memory and I have to look at pictures on my phone and I know I'm probably better if I don't look but I don't want to forget. I'm really really struggling with the fact that my self confidence and worth is lower than it's ever been and absolutely noone is ever going to want to know me again and fair enough because if its not her then I don't care anyway. She was my whole world and now it's gone and it's all my fault. I could've and should've done better for her. I love her from the bottom of my heart and wanted to  marry her and spend the rest of my life with her.

All gone now so what's even the point anymore. I'm just going to spend my life on my own and lonely and that's all I deserve after failing to make her feel happy and safe anyway and I hope she lives her happiest life now that I'm not in it now and meets someone far better than me to spend it with.",lonely,I need to tell someone.,2021-06-28 09:28:12

425,Getagripkid,1624835625,1,"I’m 23 and this is honestly the loneliness I’ve ever felt in my life, and I genuinely don’t think anyone cares. I don’t wanna always have to sulk in this feeling, and I really don’t like that I’m always ‘complaining’ about it... but I feel as though I’ve come to this realization that no matter how much I sulk in it or whine about it, no one really listens. I still feel unheard. You tell people about how lonely it is, and they say they get it, but hey, they’re in their early 20’s too. They’ve got their own problems. I get that. But those very same people who say they’ve got your back tend to make you feel the loneliest. Those same people who see you stuck in a dark place, the people you pour your heart and soul out to, don’t actually do anything to make it better. Don’t actually contribute to making you feel any ‘less lonely’. They tell you they understand, and they move on, get on with their days, go out and about with their other friends, make plans without you. And I mean, can’t blame them right? ‘Cause the world doesn’t revolve around you, buddy. People are selfish by design. It’s human nature to be self-serving. They see you stuck, unable to go out and live your life and do all the things people in their early 20’s are doing and think to themselves “gosh, I don’t wanna be like that! I don’t want that type of energy.” And so they simply tell you they hear you, and move on because they themselves don’t want to experience it. They themselves don’t want to be as lonely as you are. Again.. can’t blame them, can we?! But when certain life circumstances get in the way, and you’re just stuck, stagnant, unable to make new friends or get on with life, seeing almost everyone around you get to do what YOU want to do... you can’t help but feel a little bitter, amiright? I mean don’t get me wrong, I wish them well, and do care to see them prosper... but I won’t lie to you all, or to myself, and say that I’m not just a tad bit... resentful. Jealous even. I just want to feel seen. To feel less alone. To have someone to talk to without feeling like a total bore or drag. To talk to someone and not hold on so dearly out of fear that they’ll leave me. To not care that my closest of friends indeed have OTHER friends and lives outside of our friendship. That they are free to not invite me or include me in their plans, though I so desperately want to be included. I want to be a part of someone’s every day. I want so badly to be appreciated and considered. To not just be the friend in the background. To not be the friend that’s easily forgotten, because well, I’m just not on the same wavelength as the rest of them. I don’t got the same stuff going on for me as they do, so I’ve got less and less in common with them. Less to talk about. Less to share. Less room for me in their busy busy lives. And who am I to bring them down with me? Who am I to bring upon them the dark and miserable shadow that is loneliness. Depression. I’m slowly losing my friends, and I can’t help but think that maybe I ought to push them away. Maybe I ought to get rid of ‘Em while I can, ‘cause hey, they’ll soon be gone anyway. Might as well rip off the bandaid myself. But then... I’ll feel more lonely. And so I torture myself, trying to make conversation with people and friends, try to put on a smile but I feel like I’m dying inside. It’s too much to bare. To know that I can’t release this ugly feeling and express it to them, because it’s going to set them off, push them away. But I want them to stay, to keep me company, to keep me occupied. It’s absolute torture. These last 3 years have sucked, and there’s no doubt that Covid’s only made things worse, pushed me further and further away from everyone and everything, held me back. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t know who to talk to, or how to navigate this horrible feeling. I’m slowly losing myself to my 20’s. My lonely early 20’s.

It was all in my head. Basically, like I was just like entertaining things and like you know letting my mind wander. I was just thinking about things like, “what if that is like my future wife” or something. I just started thinking about things like that — I never really thought about those things a lot cause I’ve never truly like felt lonely. I’ve I always believed I was like fine by myself. But yeah, met this amazing girl and was like. “I want this.” Not just her but I just wanted to feel loved, so I went home to my apartment was just laying in bed thinking about the night.

I guess I'll feel like a liar and such a 'pick me girl' should it ever happened and I have to admit that its my first time. I mean I won't lie but will it ever happen? Probably. But before it does am just so lonely. I go for almost two weeks without a text on my phone. All I do is look at memes and watch desperate housewives and go to the gym and idk. All am trying to say is it would be nice to think of someone. Like a friend or a significant other. 
I mean am pretty average so is that too much to ask?
I had like two friends who i was grateful for. I mean were still friends i just dont see them the same anymore. 
Here is why.
The first friend: i was sleeping over at her house for the weekend and didnt have data and she didnt have wifi. So the whole weekend i was offline. On getting data i went online and no one had texted me. I joked about it to her and she laughed a bit too hard. I blamed myself for that but recently I was over again and she was using my phone to order some food so while i was in the bathroom she joked about how all my calls and texts are from my mom and sister. 
Second friend: I was at my other friends house, and my charging port is type C. I didnt have my charger so I used a laptop one overnight. Bad idea my phone fried so i have charging port issues. Fast forward am at her place again and my phone refuses to charge and i didnt have cash to fix it so i was okay waiting a couple days like that. Then she commented about how i probably dont care about fixing my phone cause i have no one to talk to either way.
Fuck me.
Am I the only one?
Like i considered them good friends and treasured them cause i dont have lots but now i just dont want to associate myself with them as much.
So i guess that just leaves me. 
But its always been me.
And I know it should be enough and I am enough but why is it so empty and hurty inside 
Am solid enough not to expect less ik that.
Its just that i need one great friend.
Irl or online.
Just one.
I've been alone this long I dont mind waiting for them longer its just that the view gets boring.
But I do appreciate the memories I do. Its all I have so atleast there's that.
Thanks for reading. And I hope you get that one great friend too.

I'm a 32 year old woman and have been single for 10 years. I had a 4 year relationship starting when I was 17 and then a 2 year one immediately after. Looking back they weren't ideal, in the first one it turned out my bf was asexual (nothing wrong with that but we didn't know that at the beginning and I'm not) and in the second one my bf was a bit of a controlling dick who used to comment negatively about my appearance and make jokes about cheating on me. 

Being young I just assumed I would find another partner fairly quickly but obviously that didn't happen; I only want to date women now which I guess reduces the dating pool but I have lived in a city with quite a big queer scene for 5 years so I thought I would be with someone by now. I've tried dating apps but either I'm the only one putting in any effort and it fizzles out or if we do meet I get ghosted afterwards, even when I think it's gone well.

I used to identify as bi but now I'm only interested in women; however sometimes I am tempted to hook up with men just to be touched and feel attractive, even though I know it's not what I want.

I’m 18 which, yes, I know life’s ahead of me and I shouldn’t even worry but this situation is making me almost depressed already. 
Long story short. I’ve always been unlucky with friends. When I was 13 I got into a friend group that turned so toxic that I had to leave. The friendship I had afterwards turned one-sided as she literally got more and more friends and I was the only one texting her and inviting her out. When I went to high school and gained a new best  friend I felt like the happiest person alive, we could talk for hours, we had so much fun going out and we had things in common. However, she has another friend group and so many other friends that towards the end of may I noticed she didn’t really care as much. When I called her a few weeks later asking how she’s doing she kept talking how she’s so busy and she has so many plans with her friends that my heart literally shattered. I haven’t called or texted her ever since and it seems to me that she doesn’t care either. 
Now i’ve been trying to make friends and go out, but literally people are not interested and it’s either one-sided again or people make plans with me and then cancel on me last minute.

I don’t know whether to go see a therapist to help with the loneliness. To also find out why and how I’ve got myself into this mess. I’m clearly not a very nice person to be around because overwise I’d have friends. Will this help, would this be a good thing?

And also, my self-esteem is really low and before anyone says it I’m not joining a football team as I’m shit at it.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",lonely,No close friends will this help?,2021-06-27 22:13:24

So, at a young age. I grew up in a sorta hostile home environment. Dad was sorta narcissistic and drunk. He was unavailable for the most part and still is. So my needs were put down. But I got abused by my older brother for no reason. If I tried to relax like play some console games or watch some tv show. Or even to the point to what I was eating he’d abuse me for no reason. Because I guess I was some sort of punching bag to him. 

But growing up now, I find it hard to show my emotions to people and be so vulnerable/live in the moment. When that was all my survival instinct, to stay perfect in whatever his vision was for me. How do I let that go ?

I want to continue life and vibe out with people. But there’s always some part of me that feels so repressed to be in the moment and connect with others on a deeper level. And it sucks because it hinders my abilities a lot to connect with people and build friendship and stuff :/ .

Then I didn't have internet for a few days, and I did anything I could to talk with her during those days, to be left on seen for hours and hours, she said she was sorry but I didn't really believe it since she wanted just to stop talking to me, her answers were short, and she seemed uninterested in talking to me.

When we are just used to be used.. and disposed without any concern or care..
No matter how good you be with others.

Yeah we must not have expectations but it gets really hard emotionally to take it when u are programmed to be kind ...and you don't find a shade in others of that.

This made me kind of desperate in the start... feeling left out.. lone ..and like a misfit..not having anyone to talk to.. and whom I get to talk with..we eventually reduce coz of reasons like..
1.i was too vulnerable and honest.
2.they felt very guilty seeing me be so kind and they unable to .
3.we unable to sync.
4.me being desperate to make it work.
5.too self induced (maybe coz of past in this area )

I hurt myself a lot by trying to make it work with many.

But then I remembered a time when all this dint exist..it was the time when I was at school..in hostel.
Would love to share this coz it did help me..and could help many too! 
1. We dint have social media access.(makes us subconsciously live for likes..and friend validation ..and content that's shiney to society's eyes.. perfection over progress.. and judgement based on social status and accomplishments in general)
2. I was super focused on what I was good at.. (I had been not a social person since start.. I was obscessed with special interests and all my friends came to me coz of that...to learn collabs nd grow.. unlike me.. trying to start a conversation. )

I remember those times when I felt soo happy being alone.. walking alone when all walked together with someone.. for the sake of it..or validation (don't say it's bad..it's all subjective needs ) I knew I was a kind..who was an observer.. a thinker.. a wanderer..and people come and go..but when they stay with me..it's for right reasons.. and it's super fun.. I would love to spend time with myself..how I touched many people's life with my creations.. and incidents that truly proved my self worth and how rare I was.

I now realise what a big damage social media does .
And realised there are 2 types of them:
User driven.(insta now )
Data driven.(reddit now )
The reason I say now..coz they change..
The first one gets toxic and competitive.. and somehow affects our well-being.. we have to be a certain way ..to feel truly full..or else we feel empty..esp those thinkers like me.

So decided to choose wisely..and shed it.... Learn from my past when people said "" dude..how are you like this..I wanna be like u.. ""  my way.. solitude over lonliness.. lost in work..it is possible..like minded come.. 

Expectations hurt.. relationship also taught me that.

I loved her so much, and all I can think about is death and I can't stop crying. I grew up in a Catholic homeschool environment in a rural area, and she was my only friend apart from my siblings her entire life. Coupled with other things going on right now in my life, it feels like reality is breaking around me. The day I got the news I decided to make myself feel better by looking up a childhood friend I haven't seen in a decade and drawing a picture of him in my journal. Ever since, I've been listening to his old Spotify playlists and constantly checking his Facebook which hasn't been updated in over a year. I try to avoid going back and reminiscing about him since we've both undoubtedly changed so much and I'm afraid of ever seeing him again, but my memories of him are some of my happiest and I like to pretend that we managed to stay in touch a decade after he moved away. I don't have any other friends, recently moved away from my childhood hometown but the only people I had left in that place were deadbeats who used me for my minimum wage earnings and asked me for Cheetos and frappucinos all the time.  But I still bought them because I wanted to be nice and have someone to talk to that was my own age. Now that that's over I'm stuck with my immediate family (dad and younger siblings who are sick of my shit). Recently started a job but everyone else there is in high school and I just got out of community college. I just miss when I didn't care what people thought of me and didn't hold myself to such a high standard. Maybe if I thought less of myself I'd reach out to the people I really miss however stupid and pretentious that would be. Fuck getting another pet. They're just heart-destroyingly sweet creatures that die slowly in front of your eyes. My girl is in a better place than this fucking awful world, and she's still alive in my memory.

531,DangerDaskov,1624771011,1,"This I've really need to get off my chest but not because I want to forget but because I want others to tell me this is all true and not just a make-belief feeling steaming from loneliness. I feel older than most 19-year-olds because I believe in true love and how there's always someone out there waiting for me. As silly as this may sound for the longest time since I can remember I've felt connected to someone like a weird message send through emotions that in words translate to ""come see me"". First time I felt this was when I was 4 or 5 being separated from my mother and moving to a new country not knowing when I'll come back or who will be waiting for me but knowing that somehow I was flying out to meet the girl who I will soon develop this connection of wanting to be with. During the next 3 years of living abroad that feeling came and went but oftentimes, I'll find myself wanted to climb the largest hill in town hoping if I can see beyond the horizon of the sun and the ocean hoping could I see her then. When I did come back at the age of 8 I found myself having to relearn the language of where I was born from and finding myself in a broken family. Living in New York being through domestic abuse in my different families I grew up to feel like I couldn't trust anyone and that well I didn't have anyone but my thoughts to rely on or to be loved by oh and that FEELING went away for a while it wasn't until I found myself homeless in 7th grade that it came back. Before then I had moved to New Jersey to places like North Bergen, Union City, Secaucus, and lastly Jersey City. School to school, friends to friends, and abuse home to abuse home. When I was going through 6 to 7th grade I went through 3 different schools but always found a way to make it back to the Hudson River looking across to New York City thinking I want to be an adult to forget about this past but moreover to remember why I felt like I always wanted to travel out of here to meet or see someone. In 8th grade, I became homeless again and moved into a homeless shelter with my mother during that time I lived in Jersey City going to school lying I lived a normal life to all my new friends most importantly to myself. During this time I want to say it was the first time I truly ""fell in love"" with a girl and strangely enough an Asian girl who through her I learned about anime and the amazing country of Japan, which she's not from. But this girl somehow brought this thought to my head that ""the girl I want to be my first for everything I want her to be Japanese and I want to travel out there to see her"". Anime became my escape from my harsh reality but it was the first clue to who this girl I was connected to was and that she's right across the Hudson River or the River of life that was between us. Things didn't work out between this girl I ""loved"" and I eventually moved to Chicago in the middle of my 8th-grade year which I wasn't happy cause I would truly miss this girl who had no feelings for me and the view I had of a future with a girl I've yet to meet. Although for a while things were better they just got bad like they always did and that FEELING came back stronger right as I was going into high school I wanted to go to High School in Japan even if I had just moved to a new place I didn't felt compelled by anyone around me to stay and I was ok with going somewhere I've never been to alone if I had to. But I never did because I was afraid to say how I felt. During High School, I was lucky to not have to move around but I only came back from school knowing all I had were superficial friends, no one that truly liked me, an abusive family, and worst I only did so well in school to focus on something rather than my shitty life also to get out of looking like I was a piece of shit to my ""parents"". I did have chances to be with people but never the less I grew distant and if it wasn't for my current best friend I would have been alone in my senior year. I graduated High School in 2019 not having a clue of what I wanted to become but knowing that I've been kicked out of my ""home"" 2 times already and that no one was gonna support my future but myself. Oh and yet again I forgot about that FEELING, looking back at it all I wonder if She did too because it never felt strong like it did in 8th grade or in my early days in high school. I went to a community college but 3 days before my 18th birthday I was kicked out of my ""home"" for the 3rd and last time by then I was set to join the Air Force and find the first ticket out of this city and all of those in my life. I barely made it through my semester in college and then for the next 8 months living under a shitty basement alone. With COVID hitting my plans of leaving for Basic Training went from late April to Early May to well lets us see when again... also it would be in January of 2020 I last spoke to my stepfather although he mistreated me he was the only ex-Army guy who set me straight and treated me for a couple of moments as his own until I wasn't. During that time from February till September, I grew into a deep isolation stage where I would rarely interact with others and I became happy knowing the whole world was as introverted as I was but moreover i realised i never learned how to love myself and I could only hate who i was and the problems I've caused since I was born. During this time the feeling came back but in the form of ""even if she is out there would she love me for who I became now a lazy piece of shit"" Getting my second job in June was a step up I worked to move out and by the time I turned 19 I had my own nice apartment and its when I was there alone in my new empty apartment I asked myself the question I still have today ""do I deserve to be happy?"". I found part of that answer at the second job I fell in ""love"" again this time with a nice Vietnamese girl. She and I would talk briefly but I liked the talks we had especially about her plans in school and her goals in life. I never told her much about myself cause I felt I had nothing interesting like other guys to say or show about myself. All I knew deep down inside was that I loved her and I wanted her to make me happy. It wasn't until my last day at work 2 weeks before I shipped to basic training when we had I would say ""meaningful encounters"" on my last day I told her about myself and although she wanted to focus on her studies I accepted that plus I gave her a love letter with some chocolates which she thanked me for. Although all I asked was to stay in touch she did something that day that I've never truly felt from anyone else. She came forward as I was leaving work for the last time and hugged me. Although to others a hug might be meaningless to me it was the first affection anyone in my life showed me what I really wanted. That night I realized I would never see her again and I would never get that feeling of belonging again from her or possibly anyone else, I ended up crying myself to sleep that night. For my 19th birthday, I was depressed that she wasn't there to celebrate it or anyone meaningful for that matter. To be honest that was the first time I truly acknowledged I was dealing with some kind of severe but yet very well-hidden depression. I left for basic training on November 9th and graduated on December 31st for once I was relieved to have made some sort of accomplishment. I'm proud of it still to this day but it's shrowded around the depression I have. Since that graduation, I went to what I call ""college in the military"" where I learned how to be a medic and fell in love with the 3rd girl. Tbh this one was the worst of all because I fell so hard for her that when I told her my feelings it exposed my depression, my past, and my suicidal thoughts to those around me. Instead of understanding me and how I felt she hated me for my feelings and everyone else became annoyed when I talked about how I felt. I can't bottle up my emotions like before so it comes as a surprise the FEELING finally came back and all the clues finally fit. Before then I graduated from my first Phase of tech school in May and I'm on my last part of training then onto the real world of the Air Force. I'm upset that this feeling makes me wish I got stationed in Japan because it would have given me the chance to look for her but where would I start. As I'm writing this I pray to God that I won't spend the rest of my life looking for love because even at 19 years old I feel like I'm at the end of my life like the furthers I think I could go is 25 years old jus because nothing has worked out and also because anything further I can't see myself falling in love with anyone else because it won't be what I wanted and worst I'll only keep on living to make money and leave a legacy of the good person I am to others. My biggest encouragement right now in life is e that with this Feeling coming back it means she's still out there waiting for me, I hope. For my 21st birthday, I'm going to travel to Japan to celebrate and ofc go on a lovesick adventure for her before then in February I want to go visit those places I would sit by watching the skyline maybe even find this weird cafe on a hill that I dream about. Is this where we'll meet? All I know is I have a bunch of dates for a girl who I don't know if she's still waiting for me but if she is I hope she will be my first for everything and I will be mine because I can't find happiness in any of my accomplishments or life. Although I smile and make others happy I hide who I really am because my negativity it's only my burden to deal with. As I write this all down more than ever I'm certain I'll meet her soon and maybe even know she's the one planning to come and see me. If God is graceful she will hear the words I tell her so that she may soon find me or I may find her. I'm not sure how to finish this off but all I have to say is I'm grateful for this connection and this feeling cause despite it all there's someone out there who I love beyond what others have with their significant others and I cant wait to spend the rest of my life catching up with and living the life I could only give to someone else. On my 25th birthday if I haven't you or some purpose I've given up on life and I don't want to grow old fulling emptiness cause if not then it'll be later on.",lonely,Will you wait for me?

I am sorry for being a liar, i deserve to feel alone until i can grow up and be an honest man. I know time will heal any of your sadness and you have a great support system with family and friends. You're too special to be held down by someone who is going to take advantage of your love and i wish i wasn’t that person but unfortunately i let it get to that point and the blame is all on me. I don't have regrets in life generally but if there was one time in my life a time machine would be useful it is now. What do i do when i portray myself as such a kind person and on many occasions do a lot more than what most would do to help others yet i cannot even be honest with someone that i love, that means the world to me, that has not done anything but love me unconditionally and supported me. What kind of person does that make me? I don't know what i feel when i look in the mirror anymore. How have i let myself become this way? The right thing to do is so clear, so simple yet i manage to somehow do the wrong things still. How do i get better, become the good person i want to be, the good person i thought i was? It's a tough day when you realize you're the bad guy. These are my personal conflicts with myself but wow my horrible choices have made things really difficult for the person i really care for. They don't deserve that whatsoever. I wish i could take their pain away and make it my own instead, then only might we live in a fair world.

I stay at home because I have no friends to go out with and I feel like I will stay like that forever. I talk a lot but I guess people don't wanna hang out with me because I'm too short and nobody wants to be with someone that is short. Everyday I wake up thinking about me being a loser forever. I rarely talk with people and I just don't get it. I know it's not something to care about since a lot of people experience worse things than my experiences but I just don't know what to do. I am just so pathetic I don't think about suicide bcs I am religious but its very rare that I feel happy whenever I feel happy it's temporary and it just goes away instantly. Every person on my family goes out with their friends and since its holidays they just go with the friends to I guess fun places while I'm just sitting like an idiot with no where to go my mind is the only thing that keeps me company. I have been betrayed many times by old friends they even mock me and I just feel angry. Whenever I get bullied one of my friends would come at me and say ""pretend that we are not friends ok?"" And goes away. This is why I decided to leave them but a part of me regrets it because now I am alone and another part of me says that its good since I don't wanna be surrounded by fake friends but it's so lame right ? Thinking about friends and all that bs but that's the problem Nothing motivates me and I cry because sometimes I just think about myself and not others but I made sure that I would help everyone that is in need but after that they just don't care as if I never helped them. Its not that I want them to give me something as a reward but they just don't have my back. And I'm scared how my future will turn out because I feel I will get bullied a lot. I will most likely get bullied even worse after these holidays are over and nobody would give a shit. I sometimes defend myself and get in trouble this made me hate school so badly man.

565,Dramatic-Release6415,1624753779,1,"After everything that has happened in my life this year, I thought through it all that I had at least managed to keep one friend. That there was still one person who wanted to walk by my side, to see me, spend time with me every now and then.
I thought that she appreciated me, at least a little.
I'm taking a gap year this year after high school, for financial reasons, she is studying and moved into a residence hall.
My only other friend did the same thing, and I lost her a while ago.
This person and I, though, have been friends for nearly 10 years, all the way through most of primary school and high school, I thought things were different.
After this year, we had always planned to flat together, we had planned to do so since we were around 10 years old. She decided that she would rather flat with this other friend of mine, and 3 more girls she met at the halls this year. Though this really crushed me to find out I got through it, understanding that so long as we could preserve our friendship it really didn't matter if we lived together or not.
But I miss her, we don't talk. Not like we used to. We used to talk every day, multiple times in a day but now I am finding myself actively searching for things to say to her, at least once or twice a week. I miss talking to people, I have nobody else. I'm connected to social media with some of her new friends from the halls, and every day I see stories of them, talking, having fun, laughing. Every day. These are people she has known for 4 months. But I can't even hold a 5 minute conversation with her anymore, on one or two occasions a week. I ask her about her life, what things are like, and she gives me a vague response and ends with ""hbu girl"", not because she wants to know but because that is more polite than to just not answer.
I always say I'm fine, that work is good, and the conversation ends.
The thing is, I'm not fine. Work isn't good. I don't even take my breaks at work anymore because I'm afraid to check my phone. I know that there will be no messages to respond to, and that if I talk to someone they probably won't reply before I have to go back in. I used to just spend my breaks scrolling through last years camera roll, pathetically holding onto memories with these people that must mean so much more to me than they do her, desperately trying to remember the happiness I felt at those times, before everyrhing changed. But now I skip my breaks all together, even during overtime, to save myself the disappointment.
I don't know anything anymore..
I hold onto my friendships, my memories, my connections with people, more than anything else in my life. Quite literally these are the things that define me. I don't know how to be happy without them, they are the only source.

590,fengisentity,1624743331,1,"I’m not really sure how to begin with this, it feels like all my life I’ve been empty. And I’m sorry if I drift from thought to thought, I guess I’m not the best at recognising how I feel. Your patience means a lot.

Basically, to start, I am autistic. I don’t mean to offend any other people on the spectrum, to me it’s hard not saying I “suffer” from it. I’ve always just felt different to everyone else. I feel like I’m not really supposed to be here. At first, I thought of it like a “superpower” like all those cheesy motivational quotes. But as I got older I came to realise how much it really wasn’t and how people felt towards those with autism. I spent most of my school life on my own, I got on with people. but every time I wanted to talk to people, idk the words just didn’t come and I always just felt safer being by myself. Even if I truly wanted to have someone there for me. 

Alongside this, since I had no one at school I knew I always had my dad there for me, he wasn’t perfect and he was clumsy but he was my dad and I can’t describe how much I loved him. But growing up more the shouts and slams of doors near my parents room got more and more. “It’s fine it’s just what parents do” I thought to myself, “they’ll love each other still by the end of the day” but I guess one day something snapped, and he left. No explanation, no nothing. I was playing wii sports, getting excited and running to see if my parents wanted to play tennis with me too. But I was met by my mum asking my dad to come back and my dad out the door in his car. I didn’t think too much of it then I guess, I was 7 and I guess I didn’t know better, I still saw my dad with one of my sisters for a while, it was nice. It wasn’t the same but it worked. But closer to today I’ve come to realise that he wasn’t really there when anyone else wasn’t either. He didn’t really love me when I needed him. 

Time passed and my mum remarried, the dude seemed okay at first but I guess I didn’t take too kindly to him, looking back I saw him as a replacement and I hated that. I overreacted and he used to grab me and my sister, sometimes choking us even one of us to get the other to do something. He would be very forceful and I haven’t been more scared since then. And yes, he still lives with us, the flashbacks don’t stop. To anyone who’s reading this: I’m scared, I’m really scared. And my moms always getting me to “look past it” and that I should “do more and include him in stuff”. I duly don’t feel like a person. I live like my opinions don’t matter because they really don’t. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I’m really just waiting til I die, by me or life I haven’t decided fully yet. But for now I drown my sorrrows with a bottle. I don’t know I’m just so lost.

598,jmq37,1624738992,1,"Hi, I'm in highschool, so I would say i'm relatively young.  I've always struggled with finding the right friends. It's quite rare for me to find people I actually connect with, and can trust and be myself around. I feel like high school is the time when everyone around me is going to the beach and going to parties and traveling and going to summer camp together and are constantly around their own friend groups either in person or on social media, and I feel like i'm missing out on all of that. I don't even really want or need a huge group of friends like that. Just one or two close ones is enough for me, but i'm just so alone. I don't even have to go to the parties or anything like that, (I mean it's not like I could anyways my parents are very strict), I just want to have someone to talk to. Someone to share things with. Someone who has some common interests with me. A distraction or a support system or anything. I talk to myself all the time. It started when I was really young, and I don't know if it's normal or if it's just a coping mechanism, but I need someone to hear me. I feel trapped in my bedroom and I'm just so sick and tired of being suffocated in my parents house. I genuinely think that if I died no one in school would care. I'm also just so tired of having to give an entire speech pleading and begging to my parents anytime I want to go somewhere. Since I'm starting my senior year this fall, I'm so tempted to just give up and spend all my time studying so that I can guarantee leaving for college where I'll be far away from my parents and I'll finally have the freedom to be around people whenever and wherever I want. But I know that would just make things worse, and that I have to keep trying to connect with people. If being lonely has taught me anything, it is to really appreciate every single human interaction I have in my day, wether it's big or small. I really look forward to just saying thank you to a barista at a coffee shop and seeing them smile and say you're welcome. I have a lot of hope that things will get better, and I try to stay strong, even when the loneliness really weighs me down at night when I realize I've spent my entire day alone.

I have a few close friends I talk to online but I don't really have anyone to hang out with in real life. While I can distract myself during the week with work and stuff it feels like the weekend reminds me of how alone I am. I put myself out there but people don't want anything to do with me. Sure, I can find things to do on my own places to go, sights to see. But in the end I miss having friends and I don't know why I have such a hard time finding people who are genuine. I can easily find people who want to hookup or people interested in online games, relationships, rp whatever.

I write this post for pure catharsis, I am by no means wanting to self-harm just to be clear. 

I am grateful for everything i have and everyone who has ever helped me, but for some reason today i cannot shake the feeling of overwhelming loneliness.  I have never been someone who had a ton of friends, usually 2 or three close people but never large groups or anything. I have always struggled with getting along and feeling like people I associate with are truly my friends. Usually i like being by myself, usually I enjoy solitude and being able to do things at my own will and pace. Today is different, and I don’t know why. I have not had physical contact with another person in over 2 years, I feel like I am completely invincible to other people. I had a dream last night about a person who I have not talked to in nearly 4 years,  an ex who I in retrospect didn’t even get along with super well. Waking up from this dream I have an overwhelming feeling of loneliness, its not even that I miss that particular person, I just miss... people. I miss having someone who I am not invisible to, someone who i can actually talk to, and they can talk to me. I miss the feeling of being able hug someone and feel a massive weight being lifted off my shoulders knowing in that moment that I am with someone I care about and that cares about me. I hate that from the outside people see me as a happy, productive, and friendly guy, and because of that no one seems to shit how I am actually doing.

Blue, for the times when I think my feelings are just so blank, even vivid that you can’t even see and explain. 

Purple, for the most part where it stings. Like a bruise. Like the part that needs extreme attention. 

So we sleep through it.

655,lonesomeswallow,1624704967,1,"Hello,

I woke up feeling kind of gloomier than usual today and felt the urge to make my first reddit post and try to let it all out here. I am turning 30 real soon and these past few years have been a complete rollercoaster and I don't feel like I am anywhere near where I want to be. Just one year ago, after spending a decade living in the USA I realized that this is not where I belong, so I packed my bags and headed back to my home town in Europe to start over. I had no idea exactly what I want to do and how I am going to do it, I just knew that the USA is not where I belong, at least not at this point of time. After spending some months in my home town, reconnecting with family and old friends, I noticed that things haven't really changed and decided to make a move to a bigger town. So I did, I packed my bags and moved to a completely new place, not knowing anything and anyone around, determined that I will purely rely on myself to make things better.  I had no idea what I am going to do for living and I still don't. I started a low pay part time job just to have some money come in and socialize a little bit, but honestly I don't like it at all. Outside of work I spend the majority of my time learning about videography, video production, editing and filmmaking. All of that has always been of interest to me, but it wasn't something I had the courage to pursue, up until now. For years I've told myself that it's not something I can do and for the past decade it just stayed there in my head without me doing anything about it. Now, the more I do it the more interesting it gets, but it also feels like a dangerous path to go down on. I am 30 and just yet starting to pursue something that other professionals in the field that are around my age have been doing for 10+ years and are still learning. 

I have little to no support from my surroundings and feel extremely lonely trying to achieve something nearly impossible. I have no friends around me, no family, no significant other, all I have is the willingness to turn things around for myself. I have been going through a personal transformation journey for two and a half years already and am getting kind of discouraged at this point because the more I hammer and more time passes by the more I feel like I am behind in life. Definitely, I can see progress in myself, but I am not standing nowhere near where I want to be. 

I lack confidence and feel like this is one of the biggest limitations that I am facing. Recently I started to accept the fact that I am emotionally immature, but I have been trying pretty much everything and nothing seems to help with this. If people come into my life it seems like I push them away with my behavior and this is making me feel so lonely and miserable. I feel like because I made some progress and such dramatic changes to my life, I make myself a big deal and have developed sense of entitlement that people should like me. I am also in the best shape of my life and exercise regularly, eat well and take good care of myself. I just don't know how to overcome this child inside of me that wants to show them all, how wrong they are about me. I get obsessed with getting attention and making a good impression and although I consider myself to successfully overcome a number of addictions I still notice addictive behaviors that I want to get rid of. 

Because of the unbearable loneliness that I feel, I tend to spend a significant amount of my days on social media which I think is having a huge negative impact on my wellbeing. I tried deleting all social media, blocking access to websites on both laptop and phone and pretty much everything to try to step aside and go through a detox for a little while, but somehow I always find a way to go around the obstacles I've set for myself and feed my obsession. I also think about sex all the time. Although, I have detached myself from all sorts of pornography for a while now, my head is filled with sexual thoughts and I reek like a desperate man. I haven't been with a woman (outside of paying for it) for over 2 years and it's another thing that's making me feel like I am extremely worthless. How would one start over if he can't find a way to go through his emotional growth and find any support around him ?

I tend to do a lot of these brain dumps for myself and I never share them. Because I feel like I am going through a constant loop and not really going anywhere with it, I decided to share this here this time and see if I feel anything different. I appreciate everyone who takes the time to read about my suffering and relates in one form or another.",lonely,Starting over at 30 and feeling emotional immaturity and loneliness,2021-06-26 20:56:07
656,margins1,1624704186,1,"I remember driving 60 kilometers away from home and then park the car and walk till my feet was in pain, without going anywhere, for no reason at all, I did that for months, maybe a year every day. I wanted to be among strangers, I didn't want anyone who knew me to see me like that. Strangers were noticing that I'm not well, I cant recall how I was like, probably in bad shape. Someone in a restaurant said quietly ''why people don't go to a psychiatrist?''. I was going alone to restaurants and coffee shops and eat and drink there alone until I spend all the money that I had. 

Last resort, I called everyone, relatives and old friends that I had years to hear from them. I called them all and met with the most of them just to talk and hear a reply. My condition was obvious by then, someone said that my gaze was lost. I spend years without anyone actually speak to me, I had just mandatory small talks and nothing else for the most of my life. Then I asked for help, I knew only professionals could listen to me and reply, so went to them.

657,imexhausteddd,1624699844,1,"I finished year 11 over a month ago and was so excited as I had such big expectations of me having the best summer of my life. However, I haven’t even left the house once to hang out with anyone, only to take small walks by myself. 

I’ve always been very insecure about my position in other peoples lives as I’ve never really had anyone that I could talk to and who would check up on me. I have one friend that always tries to reassure me that they are there if I ever need, but whenever I do try to talk to them it’s like I’m bothering them and that they don’t want to speak to me. Which is fine ig but I’d rather her communicate this with me. I have a few friends that I would have previously considered to be fairly close with but after leaving year 11 I’ve come to realisation that they were solely school friends. They all post stories of them out with their other friends having fun and enjoying their summer break, but they’ve never once tried to make any plans with me. When reaching out to my friends I never had an issue as I was comfortable around them, but their lack of response and effort into our conversations left me feeling like I was an annoyance and now I’m just scared to message them and ruin the little relationship we have left. I tried to organise a games night, a picnic, a sleepover, a dinner, and they cancelled on me each time. I go weeks without speaking to anyone and I’ve made myself the self proclaimed low maintenance friend, when in reality nobody ever checks up one or even makes an effort to have a friendship with me.

I’ve learnt to accept the fact that I have no friends or specifically a ‘person’ who enjoys my company and puts in effort. However I don’t understand how I spent 5 years is secondary school and didn’t manage to make at least one stable friendship. I’m very alone right now and I don’t know what to do.

687,CitySlick_RedNeck,1624683007,1,"Yes. For years, I have struggled with loneliness.

Whether it be from lack of friends, lack of relationship, lack of moral support. I have been lonely.

My early year weren't bad at all. I grew up in a small town where I was among the 3 'cool' boys, up until grade 2 when they decided to split grades 2 and 3 and mix them together for some idiotic reason. At that time, I got my glasses, and by the time I finished second grade, I learned that I had to move. I was sad, but one of my childhood friends I always called Smiley invited me to her house to hang out. After that, I knew that even if we didn't see each other for years, we'd still be friends.

So I moved away with my brother, mom and Stepdad. I made new friends and felt pretty good, though I felt at times that I had become the awkward kid.

Then... I was betrayed. I don't feel comfortable talking about it, and it's been so many years. Needless to say though, going into 10th grade, my brother moved back to my dad's, and I was being raised alone. I no longer had that figure I looked up too as a guide.

My mom and step-dad worked tirelessly, so I sunk myself into games and books to occupy my time, and to let them rest without having to worry about me.

This is going to get really long, so I'll summarize a bit more.

I gained weight, developed ADD, got bullied and teased because of the way I walked and the way I breathed because of my asthma. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't contemplate suicide during highschool.

I had my fair share of crushes. Some were kind, others cruel. People sometimes passed rumors that a girl liked me, and like a naive fool, I'd ask them about it. Everytime, with only 1 exception, they ended up chuckling under their breath and apologizing that the rumor was misinformation through a game of telephone. Their chuckling made me feel like they were laughing at me or that I might have actually believed it. The one exception? Yeah, she flat out laugh and said that it was ridiculous. That was the last one, during my senior year.

After highschool and college, I worked at a restaurant famous for it's rotisserie chicken. There, I spent two years, completely focused on the job, saying yes to everythong, no matter how tired and broken I knew it'd make me.

I never got rewarded and I contemplated quitting many times, but I was bad with money and I knew I'd need every little bit.

Eventually, stress had taken over my determination, I took a 2 week leave and when I got back, the worst thing happened. A new girl, one who I had been nice too and talked a lot to during work when I got back, told me she liked me.

Why was this the worst? Because she used me for free room and board, took advantage of my desperation, loneliness and naiveté. She verbally and emotionally abused me. And when she was gone, I was deeper in debt (voluntarily through my blinded eyes and inexperience), deeper in depression, but I had a better job... for 2 weeks and soon enough the company had budget cuts, so I got laid off.

4 months later, I became a janitor, funny enough making more money than I did before. I nearly lost my mom several times do to her chronic illnesses, lost a woman I fell for to cancer before I could even ask her out, and moved back in with my parents to take care of my mother while she regains her strength. (5 years have passed and her condition has been on a very bumpy ride)

TL;DR

I am 26 years old and feel like crap. I hate always falling into depression each week and I have no idea how, or if its possible, that I could ever be happy.

My brother and cousin's my age all have had girlfriends for years and all live with their girlfriends. They have great careers or are in line to get one. They are all much more secure, in more ways than financially.

Meanwhile, I'm living with a broke body, mind and soul, doing my best not to fall apart and destroy myself, and doing my best to take care of my mother and put up a mask so that she doesn't have to worry about me.",lonely,Very long text by a sleepy guy after midnight.

693,Kjlm4567,1624680234,1,"So I have a few questions for you and I am new to reddit, anyway my first question is has anyone ever experienced having siblings and your guardian asks ""can one of you ---"" while staring at you individually while your siblings don't even care to pay attention, therefore causing you to be the only one that has to do the favor? I have experienced it too many times to count and not only does it make me feel like my siblings expect me to do the job but so does the person asking the favor.

Another question I have is if you have asked for help with something when somebody is not busy but they simply say ""it's your job"" even if it is not a chore but something you just simply do everyday? For me this happens with cleaning, I have and urge to clean and if doesn't get clean I get stressed and uncomfortable, I've been cleaning like this ever since a couple years ago and I've realized that I get more tired everyday and need help to do it, I asked a sibling of mine to help and they said, ""no it's your job to clean"" 

I have another question, do you ever feel like the way you feel doesn't matter, and a person just keeps asking you to do something for them no matter how bad you feel. This happens to me constantly and I'm very annoyed and I feel lonely and like I don't have a voice

Another question I have is, do you recognize footsteps, doors opening, and even when somebody unlocks the door? I do for sure and I'm just wondering if anybody else does?

Another question I have is, do people tell you that it doesn't matter what you want, how you feel, or what you say because they are older or your guardian? I experience this all the time and it very annoying, me and my sibling have two budgies that we payed for with our own money that we earned, my guardian has said that they can do whatever they want with them and force us to do things for them that we know they won't like, then say that we don't know everything about them and they are an adult and know what's best for them even though I had researched for months what's good and bad. Plus side note I know that they want to own our budgies as of today they even said they are thinking of buying one for themselves, plus the fact that they had grabbed the budgies by wings and tails while also dropping them.

Last question, does anybody ever tell you that they can't tell you something or that you won't understand something because you are a minor? My mother says things like this all the time and it annoys me because I know exactly what it means( she made an excuse like that many times to cover up bad things she had been taking part in)

I made some mistakes in the past and wanted to apologize to ex's this week, so I sent those cringy texts. I miss my last ex so much but she knows I'm needy and insecure. I feel so stupid because my fear of losing her ended up making me lose her and I tossed her like 4 years ago. I never really poured out all my feelings to her and I'm a bit of a clueless romantic. She's definitely moved on but deep down I want to ""marry"" this girl.

However, I don’t have good dreams when I’m asleep. Recently, they’ve been centered around an abusive gf I once had a relationship with. She deprived me of sleep, made fun of my hobbies so much that I gave them up, gave me the silent treatment when I wasn’t “in the mood” when she wanted me to be, and called me a “coward” among other things. She would also randomly explode on me or throw tantrums so I always tried to walk on eggshells around her as to not upset her. I had stayed in the relationship trying to salvage it way longer than I should have, thinking “I can endure this, what am I doing wrong, she’s the only one in my life who loves and accepts me, it’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine” (I more often than not repeated this to myself daily back then). 

Our time ended when she revealed to me that she viewed our relationship as a way for her to get sex from me, then she discarded me. Post-breakup she blew up my phone with over twenty messages across several platforms becyaee I tried to get some space from her. I ended up deleting everything because I couldn’t handle anything anymore. I was an empty husk after that, and presently I have no desire to date or be intimate with anyone. It’s all numb and meaningless.

That was a long time ago. I’m so alone that I don’t know what to do, I think my mind is subconsciously dredging up these memories while I’m asleep because I’m giving up on life and craving any interaction, even the bad kind. Maybe I internally think that I don’t deserve anything better and that me being alone without a single friend is also deserved.

At the moment, the fact is that I don't have as healthy and fit a body as I would like, I'm fat and no one care about me. P.s. : I am very irritated by how everyone says that young people experience anxiety, depression and separation because covid, bitch please, I had it before it was cool.

742,codecrunchie,1624655448,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"[Friendship] Hey!

747,tissue450,1624652414,1,"Aight im , and honestly, my life isn't bad at all. I have friends, family, i'm privileged. Sometimes I think to myself, ""your life is comfortable as hell just roll with it."" But man, sometimes I just have these feelings of unhappiness that come onto me and I just don't know how to kick it.

The real talk is, almost all my friends are in relationships. I know  and got a long way to go, but being in that type of environment can be so damaging to someone's psyche. It's so easy to feel like everyone has someone to lean on, to support them, and I am sitting here struggling through my own shit by myself. I just want someone who I can tell all my problems to, without fearing judgement (from friends) or worry (from family). 

More real shit, my dad passed away about 5 years ago. My sister has dealt with anxiety and depression, sees a therapist, but I never felt like I was depressed. I had so much shit going on but I'd keep it inside and deal with it on my own, and I was good with that. But lately, seeing all my friends having someone, it hurts me to not have a significant other I can go to and just spill everything to. And people say use your friends/family, but it's not the same as having someone who is YOURS and really understands you. 

And now, on days like today, where I just feel shitty and lonely, I start thinking that maybe I am depressed, but I've just kept it in all these years and pushed through it myself. 

The lack of sex also gets to me, especially in a culture where it's so prevalent (being amongst couples). Any parties I'm at, my best coupled friends usually sneak out, have sex, and just mess around with their SO, and I just want someone like that...the only real answer is to wait and wait and hope it'll come eventually. Shit is just hard to deal with on my own, wish I had someone with me.

Its pretty much like asking a fisherman why he can't catch fish in the dessert, the problem being there are no fishes in the dessert. The guy has no choice but to fail, he has no options, no woman is choosing him and he can't choose women because he is at the low-end on the sexual hierarchy ladder. And please don't come with that ""men are choosers too"" BS. because if that was the case, he wouldn't find himself in this predicament at all. The reality is actually looking very grim, (coming from someone who is also suffering from loneliness). I do not want to extinguish all hope for lonely guys out there, but somethings have to be said. Dating is dead if you do not fit the looks paradigm. What you need is basic social capabilities and the rest is looks. Because women have a lot of offers many men will of course not be chosen, they are on the other hand left to work and slave their asses off for the government in the form of taxation with nothing in return. I mean what is there to actually get in life? let's be real come on, (I really can't believe we're still getting gaslighted on the important facts of what relationships and sexual experiences does to someones psyche). Living their lonely lives pestered with life advice from both family and friends, ""you're such a good guy"" and the classical ""Im sure you will make a woman happy someday"". This will slowly drive you insane and actually make you somewhat mentally insane. On one hand you are trying to rationalize your situation using logic and understanding, on the other hand you are fed comforting lies by both family and friends on how good of a guy you are. If he really was a catch, if he really was valued then why the hell aren't women swooning over him like they do other guys? Why can't he form relationships with women but seem to handle every other social interaction with every other type of person? Can it be that he is actually a genetic dead end constantly getting gaslighted by his environment just so they can feel better about themselves? He is tired of never being good enough. He is tired of keeping his head up.He is tired of being the third wheel thus never gets out to meet friends because they will say the same gaslighting fake ""feel good kind of advice"". But mostly...

773,Larryland1968,1624638220,1,"Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and, shall we say, love. The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long age been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch. Ugly would have been a dark grey tabby, striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave. Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running, meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him, up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find. One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbor's huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home, I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. It must be hurting him terribly, I thought. Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear. Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying, was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye toward me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion. At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterward, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful.  He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for. Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.",lonely,Ugly,2021-06-26 02:23:40

781,greenmumma,1624635054,1,"So I know how it goes, as someone who isn’t exactly an introvert I try very hard to branch out and communicate with everyone. Everyone. I am that friend who texts, rings and sees if you are around to do something. I have 3 friends, who I try very hard with, and I live literally in the middle of butt fuck nowhere with no mobile phone signal. Yup that’s how “nowhere” it is.

I am disabled and therefore unemployed as a result of this, And I cannot drive myself anywhere or walk very far. The nearest town is 30 minutes away driving. No clubs or bars there really even if there weren’t any restrictions.

I wake up around dawn, spend mornings on my own until my mum wakes up late morning but we don’t get on that well so we do our own things. I keep very busy, and have a lot of hobbies that are good for the mind like gardening and keeping house plants. But by the afternoon however, I’m met with this horrible ache inside - I feel it when I’m alone, being essentially ignored when I try to make contact with others and when I know I’m doing something to only distract myself from this reality. 

I feel incredibly lonely, and I cannot allow this to take a toll on my mental health anymore as I suffer from health conditions which are made worse by stress. 

How do I continue to live like this? I try so hard with the friends I have, I call, message and try almost every week to meet up and do something (within restriction guidelines) and yet nothing seems to give.

782,Ok_Midnight1414,1624634081,1,"  

I wake up every morning already in a state numbness. I lay there in bed with nobody next to me and my phone empty of notifications from people trying to contact me. I have lived a very lonely life ever since I was young. I have told “friends” about my struggles and the only time I receive any sort of contact from them is when I reach out first explaining how horribly lonely I am. They text a few short times and then go radio silent again until I text them again at a later date. It drives me absolutely insane to see all these metal health awareness posts from people virtue signaling by attaching the 1-800 hotline and saying that if you know someone with depression to reach out to them. I am living proof of what bullshit that is. People only want to be bothered long enough to inform you of the hotline so that way they don’t have to be the one who actually talks to you and then tell you to join a club. Reading Facebook posts saying “I would rather spend all night talking to you than having to hear about your suicide” is just laughable when I have never heard of anyone actually following through with this. I had one moment where I was losing my shit and called a friend who acted “concerned” because I was saying outlandish things in an act of desperation and I was told to go hang out with another friend of mine or go to my mom’s house.

I hate this realization that I will be alone for the rest of my life. I hate this realization that I will never actually be happy. I hate knowing that I already know what my future holds for me: wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, repeat. I hate knowing that when I reach out to people about this they are more annoyed than anything when I talk to them. I am disturbing their happy existence with my cries of help. I hate knowing that most people, if not all, really don’t care about your suffering because it starts to infringe upon their happy mental state and they don’t want to be brought down by you. I hate that the only time I can actually get someone to listen to me is by paying a mental health professional only to have them belittle me and say I’m overreacting and give me “homework” to try breathing exercises. I don’t need breathing exercises. I need you to tell me how to be ok with the fact that at the age of 31, I still have at least 34 years left on this cold lonely world with nothing to look forward to.",lonely,People really don't care about your mental wellbeing,2021-06-26 01:14:41

 I live in a family of 10 people total (3rd oldest, all 8 kids from the same parents, all of whom are still at home), so you would think it would be impossible to feel at all lonely. Well, that is a common mistake people make. My mom grew up with divorced parents and lived with my grandmother who had multiple different boyfriends, most of whom were abusive in one way or another to my mom. My dad grew up in a caring but strict southern baptist family with not a whole lot of physical forms of affection. This has greatly affected the way they both show affection. Neither of them like to be physically affectionate (hugs, pats on the back, etc.). I don't blame them for it at all, but it's kind of hard when physical affection is something that I thrive on. My 7 siblings pretty much don't show any affection toward me either, but I try to chalk that up to just being normal siblings. To be completely frank, I am in desperate need of a hug, like a full on there-is-nothing-more-important-than-you-right-now kind of hug. The hugs I rarely get from my parents feel empty, like they don't actually want to hug me. I don't like having to be an emotion hiding, never vulnerable kind of guy.",lonely,hey,2021-06-25 23:51:35

I find myself fighting the urge to contact people who were toxic to me.

I wonder why I wasn’t good enough for them - when I know that it wasn’t something I did. I know that if they wanted to make it work, they would have made it work. 

I am turning 31 soon, and I don’t have any real friends. It’s sad. I don’t have any siblings or family that I’m close to. I really am alone. When I turn off my work computer on Friday, I’ll go and spend the next two whole days doing everything by myself until I turn my computer on on Monday morning. I can go multiple days without actually speaking one word out loud. I don’t have anyone to share the good or the bad news with. I feel so lonely that I am numb. And I’ve reached a point where I think that I’ll just have to go through the next 50+ years that same way. Alone. I’ll never have a family. 

I don’t have hobbies or a passion. I try to stay active, I walk, cycle and sometimes also jog. But nothing really brings me that much joy. 

It’s weird. I have a career, I think I’m a decent person, but I don’t have anyone or anything besides my job. 

I know that there are ways to meet people, but I don’t feel interesting or strong enough to put myself out there. Maybe I’m responsible for my own loneliness.

791,Purposeful_traveler,1624625870,1,"Just a vent I guess. Felt like I needed to talk about it this morning even if nobody listens. I'm a 32 yo truck driver and home owner. I have plans to expand my business and someday own multiple businesses. Problem is I work too much to meet people. I don't have a social life. I work, wrench on my cars, and hang out with my dogs. I'm bi, so you'd think I'd have an advantage being able to play both fields so to speak, but I've had no luck finding a relationship in recent years. I've tried all the apps, tinder grinder etc. Never had any luck. I don't want just a fling or a fwb thing and I was never interested in dating a ton of different people. I just want to find a partner in life. Someone who can bring something to the table, get by my side, and together we can smash goals and build a good life. It's hard to find other millennials who can match my ambition. Most it seems are content with mediocrity and that's not the way I'm built. I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would make it in life or die trying. I went from being homeless at 19 sleeping in my car, to a home owner at 26, to a business owner at 30 and I'm not done yet. My last relationship ended in 2014. Last night I dreamed about my ex and woke up crying at 2 am. At this point in life it seems like I'm probably not going to find a fulfilling relationship. Men hit peak physical attractiveness in their 20s. I'm past that point and I'm not getting any younger but I am getting busier as time goes by with my business plans and personal projects. Maybe some people are just not meant to find someone. If it's true that there's someone for everyone, mine got hit by a bus or something. I know I shouldn't care so much, and I certainly shouldn't be waking up crying at 2 am over an ex I haven't seen in 6 years. Some days it bothers me more than others. Today's one of those days. The only love I have in the world is my dogs. I'm lonely af and probably always will be, and I wish I could learn to just be okay with that.

Most of my family have got married and had kids, but I’m much more of a free spirit. I don’t like being held down or limited by being in a relationship (I know, the right one hasn’t come yet). I did that for 6 years of my life as a teenager and I was just walked over and limited in my potential. 

I get deeply lonely sometimes, it makes me low. I have lots of friends who I frequently see, but I still carry this sense of being alone around inside.

Sometimes I wish I wasn’t here, or that I’d just disappear sometimes. The reality of those thoughts terrify next though and I’d never act on it. 

I’m in my early 20s, got a lot going for me, in fact, it’s probably the best time of my life so far, there’s many highs. But somehow, I feel the saddest I’ve been in about 7-8 years. I have a deep longing or aching feeling inside sometimes to have someone in my life. And I’m not looking for love, haven’t been for 4 years, but it’s like I’m longing for someone to be close to emotionally, I can’t turn it off.
I know people say that I’ve got lots of years ahead of me, which may be true, but that doesn’t change how I’m experiencing my life rn. I’m the first to say that I don’t need anyone and that I’m established in my own right, but somehow that doesn’t always work 100% of the time.

Even though I'm not going through a breakup or anything that would make me feel depressed, I just generally feel hopeless. I know these are the days I should be outside with friends and trying to be in a relationship, but all I do is stay in my room. The worst feeling in my opinion is wasting time knowing I'm going to look back now when I'm older and wish I did something. I guess I just miss having friends.

Anyways, I plan to be a writer when I grow up, even though I'm aware how unstable that job is. One of my biggest fears is not having an impact on humanity, which suck because that's very likely. I spend a kid if time writing, but I know that most of it will be for nothing since the most I'll contribute to society is probably working at a fast food place. Maybe I should go to college for something else, considering the fact that I don't even know if I'm good at writing.

Lately, I've been reading a lot about world issues. The world isn't looking so hot right now, and I'm pretty sure we only have like seven years to fix everything before we damage earth forever. I guess I've lost a lot of motivation knowing my kids might not live a full life because of past generations decisions. Maybe I need to go to therapy to distract myself, but I don't feel 8 can talk about my feelings around my parents. And I only really have around 3 friends I still talk two, 2 of which are trying to push me away. Last year I had over a dozen friends, it seems like everything has gone down since.

The point of me writing this is that I plan to join this subreddit until I change something. Maybe I'll see a post that'll motivate me to go to the mall or something people my age do.

808,JeonSekyung,1624611924,1,"I feel like I’m fighting against the world. Alone and hurt, I feel like I’m a cornered animal just lashing out in my last moments.

Constantly fighting to keep up a facade as I don’t want to appear weak, needy or wanting. I don’t want to admit to people in my everyday life that I’m lonely and in desperate need of people in my life who’ll be there for me. Like really be there and have the same sort of values as I do when going into the relationship/friendship.

But I can’t seem to find anything like that and every time I think I have, I find myself disappointed. I get hurt. Eyes start looking at me, hushed voices start whispering in the background and I am visible only when I’ve committed some perceived crime - the crime of being different and having sorts of unique needs that others see as excessive but I myself view as reasonable and just. 

I close myself off to the world as I grow resentful and bitter. Unwilling to submit to the world’s desire for me to conform or submit in order to be part of it, I’m trying so hard to create an oasis in a dry and desolate landscape of hardship and prejudice.

I just don’t want to be lonely anymore. I want to stop being in a warlike mindset where I view everyone as malicious and as an enemy. I just want to find peace and my happy medium. I don’t want to be trapped in the past or in my own misery and paranoia.

I miss the old days of when things were simpler. Before college. Before I graduated high school. I had my life long friends of old, and I remember all the memories that haven’t faded yet. I remember all the laughs and smiles I shared with them before the tragic downfall of my friendship with them which ended in betrayal. I remember who I was before. I wish I could be just like him. The man in the photos on my phone. Happy and surrounded by others. Not the hollow shell of a person that I have to see whenever I look in the mirror.

I miss the parts of me that I’ve lost to things beyond or within my control. I lost the security, trust and most importantly the hope for a better future.

I’m nothing but an outcast. A pariah. The scum of society it seems. I begin to realize what true power in a social context really means. 

Me a nobody can be misconstrued as being the worst human being for having made honest, human mistakes whereas someone who is well-known and has connections has done something worst than me yet he gets to hold his head high. I’m forced to feel ashamed and even guilty. Undoubtedly, I do feel ashamed and guilty of my actions but the level of which is demanded of me is disproportionate to my actions.

I can’t make an appeal for a change in the public opinion because I have no voice, and I am not recognized as an equal. I have to endure being a nobody and being castigated as subhuman it feels like.

It is frustrating to not be able to object and defend one’s self from accusations or perceptions of which are uninformed, biased and unfair. It is infuriating that no one wants to ask what happened or why. They accept what is said, and I’m left with having my voice not being heard or lost in the noise.

I feel like my life means nothing. I say this because I define a meaningful life as one consisting of human connections. Afterall, I view life as meaningful when we share it with others. But I have no one to share it with. In my desperation to feel heard and to be understood, I’ve been forced to come to Reddit, a place that I never thought that I would find myself in but here I am.

I’m suffering in silence under the immense weight of social exclusion and due to my own social abilities which I believe even if adequate would do little to fix how I feel or my situation.

I just hope that I find a way out of this. If not then I hope that I’m willing to get used to this new reality created from the accumulation of all the things I’ve experienced in my life: the world is a disgusting and cruel place and humanity’s role within it is only to reinforce the hardships of everyday life. 

Call me cynical or whatever but I’ve lost hope for any normal life. I don’t think I was normal to begin, but I tried. I wanted to be like everyone else but I fell along the way. I wasn’t as strong or superhuman (or inhuman?) as other people. I fell to the temptations of my own humanity. I pursued love only to find myself destroyed by it. My reaction to my failed love life was self-destructive and had rippling effects on everything. I have nothing now.

812,Failure_3768,1624608283,1,"I’m still young I’m only 18 and I know I still have many years to go but life isn’t easy. What if I have an accident? Whose gonna care? I have no one I can call a true friend, no one I trust so who going to listen. I’ve lost everyone I was friends with.

Childhood is a time to make happy memories but I really have any, sure I had friends, played together at school but I don’t really happy memory of my childhood only bad ones. When I was just a 2 or 3 my mother abandoned me, my brother and my dad. I’m happy my dad kept us but from what was told it was my grandparents were the ones who basically raised my brother and me when we were babies. My dad did whatever he wanted. In my early years in elementary my dad was kinda abusive. He hit me, slapped so hard my face turned red, and twist my ear till it almost torn off like Im not lying it was bleeding. All this abuse only happed to me I don’t even remember my little brother ever getting hit not once so why only me and it wasn’t just physical abuse he also verbally abused me always belittle me saying I’m F-ing stupid, re*tart*ed and useless. Like what kind of father says that to a kid their own son. In my late years in elementary he stopped being abusive because when he almost torn my ear off some teachers notice I was in pain at school and saw my ear and so my dad got caught so he stop with the physical abuse but I was still get verbally abused.

When I was 7 to 10 I was bullied by the kids in our apartmtent community but I could never talk to my dad about it because I was afraid of him so all I could do was let it happen. The bullies didn’t just tease me they would sometimes hit me for no reason and when I fought back they just come at me harder. Since then I have always been kinda of a coward. 

In elementary I finished as a honors student I received a medal but nothing from my dad he couldn’t even make time to see me. So I started to wonder why, why even try when my dad won’t even look at me. I wanted to give up but I gave it one more try in 7th. I finished 7th not just as a honors student but as a Principal’s honors roll with 4.0 GPA but still I got nothing from my dad. In 8th grade I started to care less so I Graduated middle school with a 3.5 GPA it’s still a honor roll but not a principal’s honor roll. Throughout my whole middle years my dad always talk bad about my grades but I didn’t understand why because my grades were fine. So in high-school I completely gave up. I was mostly get Ds and Fs. I would skip classes and sometimes ditch school with some people and go to stores near by and eventually I became a thief trying to impress those people I probably stole over $600 worth of stuff in one store out of many. Now I have become a disgusting and worthless human being.

At this point of my life I have lost almost all the people I call friends because I was the only one who was never there. I never got to do anything with them when they were trying to hang out, go swimming, watch movies or anything I was never there. I was alway expected to come home after school the only exception was if I had school work to do. So my friends started making new friends people I don’t know so it became hard to hang with them and then eventually they stop hanging with me. So I had to make new friends but in reality we were just a group of people where we call each other friends but really we’re not we do this so we don’t become a outcast. I no long had any true friends.
 
I never received any support in anything I wanted to do. I wanted run for track, I wanted to play baseball I wanted play the piano, I want to sing and I want to become a writer but dad is always saying it’s a waste of time so now I don’t even have anything that I’m passionate about. I don’t even know I want in life anymore. I don’t even have anyone to talk to about this and every time I think about this its my hurts. It’s like there is void in my heart and I don’t know how to fill it and I’m losing hope of ever finding a way to fill it. I don’t even know how much longer I can take this, the pain just hurts, I cry and cry but there’s no one to help me. I just want the pain to stop. Sometimes I wonder if the pain is even real. I’m just so lost. I wonder far I have fallen. I act calm, joyful and happy at home but deep down there’s anger, sadness, and loneliness. If I was to disappear my dad have one less mouth the feed and brother would get over it in like a week.

Some people would say shut up you have food, clothes and a roof over your head but having that won’t just make you happy that what’s makes you comfortable. Being happy and being comfortable is two different thing. You can in a toxic relationship where you always argue but won’t breaking up because it feels comfortable and you think you’re happy when your not.

This isn’t even the full story of my life I didn’t even talk about my 2 step moms… yep my dad remarried twice bringing even more pain.",lonely,I’ve wasted my childhood and now I’m all alone. No one I can trust and no one I can talk to.,2021-06-25 18:04:43

833,Idontlikemetoo,1624597961,1,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always been alone. I learned to rely on myself for about everything, so I never found a point in having friends or getting close to others. All I cared about was people liking me, so I usually bought other kids who I barely knew expensive gifts, gave them meaningless compliments, listened to them, and did whatever they wanted. In the end, I never was able to keep a ""friend"" for very long. I was never really bothered by this until my sister started bullying me because of it, and that's when I realized just how horrible it seems to go throughout life without someone close to you. I started getting friends that acted like she did as they were the only ones who were willing to stay with me. It was rare to find these people, but everytime the friendship would become very manipulative as I became a personal therapist to others and was gaslighted over every wrong I did. 


To this day, I still don't have any friends who I consider close. The people who I thought were friends are instead always artificial and end up causing me a lot of pain. For example, the two friends I told about my depression ended up either said my depression was because I'm an athiest and need to find God or threatened to tell a councilor if I didn't do it myself. The latter hurt the most as she only used me for emotional support and gifts, leaving me everytime I was going to open up to her about my problems. This ended up getting me in a very bad situation that I'm still in currently. Both ended up ghosting me and only texting when they need emotional support. 


I've concluded that it's unlikely that I'll ever find a friend who'll stick with me. No one has ever nearly done as much as I've done for them; and I truly don't want to give more than I already am to recieve nothing but someone's personal problems and threats in return. Quite honestly, I'm okay with this in a way. It's just what I've always done anyways minus the habits that I thought would make me friends. The only problem is that it truly hurts knowing that your life won't matter to atleast someone, which I've been trying to deal with lately.

I wouldn't want to talk to someone if they are only interesting in dating me ofc but I feel void if I don't have that interaction regardless of whatever gender they are.

872,throwitaway333334,1624568745,1,"I know there's no easy answer to this question, ""How to keep going"".... but I just want some other eyes, maybe a perspective that can make the day less of a rollercoaster of emotions.

I'll start off by saying I'm in therapy. It does its part; it rejuvenates me some days, while some it makes me feel weaker. As we all know, it's not a cure-all. Other than therapy, I am high-functioning chores-wise. I often have no issue arranging my apartment, feeding my plants and cat. I go for a walk, 1-2 miles a day, and I usually eat three meals that are decent, not even depression meals. Some days I falter majorly, but less often. I am not currently employed, on UI for another week, looking for jobs.

What I'm missing is purpose, fulfillment. I have felt empty my entire life. I grew up noticing the emptiness in my mother, fearful of myself becoming the same way. I always thought my purpose was to make some grand piece of art, have a little recognition -- but my favorite pursuit has always been love. I have always wanted love and I still want it, badly.

I'm not even sure what I'm after. I seem to want the emptiness filled by an other, by a person. Why can't I fulfill myself? I'm not sure. I have pretty specific interests but I get most of my joy from connecting.

My ultimate desire is to be understood by someone. This is so hard to find. Especially now that there are few opportunities to meet people, which may change, but it hasn't yet. What I have been doing is allowing anyone who shows interest in me into my life and hoping it will be love, both romantically and platonically. In certain occasions, I force it so hard even it it's not meant to be. Because I *want* it to be, so badly.

I reintroduced myself back into a group that I had left years ago after a break-up of a 3 year relationship. From that break-up I entered into a new relationship but we ended up feeling like we were in a waiting room together and our insecurities were like a mirror. The last relationship cost me my friendship with my old best friend because she had dated him 10 years ago. She out of the blue decided I was desperate and selfish despite being weirded out but ok with it prior. She's still currently in a relationship of 5-ish years. I know a lot of people see dating an ex as unusual, but in most friend groups this isn't the most wild idea, and considering how many years it had been.

After months of confusion on my part due to not being confident I was going to be in love with him, I ended my last relationship. And now I'm left with the grief of three losses of closeness in the span of 6 months. I can't handle it. I can't understand why I can't move on. My self-worth is in the pits. I no longer receive texts. I read and watch movies to fill the void. I apply to jobs I don't want because it seems like the next thing to do. I do a few hobbies but it doesn't stop the fact that from when I wake up to when I go to sleep I am caked in loneliness.  
I have left most social media because it makes me have suicidal thoughts. I can't bear to see the people of my past having moved on while I suffer in silence. Most days I am back and forth from finding a joyful moment, then total despair.

I love the game I play but it makes me anxious and makes me not want to play knowing that I'll be either on my own or watching from the sidelines not knowing what they're talking about or what they're on about because I'm not exactly a part of their group outside of the game.

Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm demanding that I'm looking for people who share the same interests with me and wants to be play with me or something but it would probably be nice if I did. So I don't keep constantly talking to myself about things I'm excited about or things that I want to explore. I mean playing on my own and all isn't so bad and I've learned to just focus on enjoying my own company because I don't like feeling bad often. But sometimes it hits and I just struggle a little of getting out of that headspace.",lonely,Is it too much to ask for?,2021-06-25 01:44:36

902,throwawaygerbiil,1624548107,1,"I've been struggling with depression and mental health issues for a little over half a year now. I went my entire college year without attending a single class in-person. I couldn't leave the house due to symptoms of agoraphobia. Other than my family and a select few Discord buddies I had nobody to turn to.

I'm slowly clawing my way back up, making changes to my life for the better. I've been eating healthier, getting outside and exercising, and building my confidence. 

But lately I've been worried about my personal future. This is tough to explain, but I feel like I don't know what to do with myself. What I mean by that in particular is recently, as a part of trying to better myself, I've been thinking of a 'bukkit list' of what I want out of life.

I've come up empty-handed, with only one thing I think would make me feel complete: a loving, close relationship. I've thought about it and I don't want corporate success, or to make some great abritrary achievement. I just want to feel love and affection from another human being on this planet.

I feel like that's my dream. That's my aspiration, and my goal.

But when I look around me... it just feels impossible. It really isn't that uncommon for someone to go their entire life without ever finding a special someone. I don't have many avenues to branch out through, so this is especially worrying to me. The reason I brought up my 6-months past at the beginning of this post was to put something into perspective. Even if I better my life, and make things better... if I never feel accomplished, what's the point? I've had a huge hole in my heart for who knows how long and my *entire life purpose* feels to be to patch that hole up so I can be happy again. I remember back when I was a kid, and when things were simpler; I want to be happy like that again.

I've been demotivated thinking about this. However hard I try, if I never accomplish that goal, I'll forever feel empty and unfinished. Even now, as I see my body and mindset beginning to improve, it's something I worry about more and more. Especially when I, as a person who watches a lot of anime and has a vivid creativity, feel at times that I am surrounded by the feelings I want but cannot have.

I don't know what to do and how to fix it, which is why I made this post asking for advice. I feel very lost, because the thing I want feels so impossible, so out of reach, and it feels like as much as I'm getting better as a person I'm making no progress towards what I truly want, from the bottom of my heart.

I love the idea of reddit. You can remain anonymous, if you choose to. You can go around, listening to other peoples anonymous thoughts, perhaps give them advice, maybe even shitpost if that's what you like.
You have subreddits like this, where lonely people from around the world can gather and help each other out.

Sure, there are toxic people around. Hate infested minds, going around, spreading negativity and pointless hatred. But then you have amazing people, helping each other out.
You don't know them, and they don't know you.
(For the most part)

Me? I have friends. Some even close, dare I say.
But see, I'm introverted. A term many associate with in this generation. With lockdown and other circumstances, I barely interact with anyone of my age.

I like it, and I hate it. But what can you do? It is, what it is.
Sorry for the unnecessary commas.
I say that a lot: sorry.

Idk.idk.idkidkidkidkidkidkidkidk.

I won't lie, I enjoy the occasional imaginary conversations. I mean I do make amazing jokes. Its difficult to not laugh at them. Who needs people right? Its just me and my body. My brain being me of course. 
I also have an addiction. Finally someplace where I can say that without any embarrassment. Cuz what are you gonna do? Track me?
Please don't lol.
Anyways. It brings me down a lot, especially these days. It hurts me. Who would've thought I'd be here? Just several years ago I was happy kid. Playing sports, mucking around, making mistakes, getting scolded lol. I wouldn't mind that. When the world wasn't a terrible place.
Even beautiful. Not everyone has that, I've come to realize. I'm grateful to have had an amazing childhood. Lots of good memories. Innocent. Untainted. Naive. But oh so happy.

909,CrikeyCameron,1624541345,1,"Of all the games I have lying around Guilty Gear is certainly one of them and none of my friends really play FGs in general. I’ve never been able to play the games with a friend besides Strive beta 1. Also I play on Steam. One of my friends wanted to play it with me but only has PS so I was pretty sad about it.

Yeah, I have some friends so I’m better off than some on this sub, and I feel a couple are very genuine. One I know certainly is. But I still feel so lonely anyway. It’s pretty lonely to have friends and know other people have been able to hang out and do so much more with their friends anyway. And knowing how none of my friends truly understand my circumstance, even the ones I ranted to the most. I live in odd circumstances so I always have to explain that, or I keep that part of my life to myself from many people. Can’t be as open or close to others as I want and it’s actually due to my circumstance. Stuck at home non-stop basically. Stuff in my life makes me very lonely. I only tell the people closest and those who click the absolute most with me.

Don’t even end up playing games with friends really. Ever since I was a kid I wanted a friend to visit or have visit me and play games in front of the couch together. Never happened. But even online people don’t make the time for it so I don’t find myself able to compensate with that. Some of my friends have nothing we can play together (I play on PC/Switch, they just have PS or crap like that) and some honestly don’t care. A lot of them only like RPGs which I can’t stand blech.

I really find myself just wanting to make horny jokes and play games all day. I believe when you start with casual fun stuff it can lead to more. It’s always a crapshoot but that’s how I used to do it. Not many stick around anymore and I find myself less and less willing to open up about specifics anymore though. So really just want to joke around and play some funny games and have a little company, at least it’s entertaining. Please PM if you’re interested, I’m willing to give it a go and I actually check back here, as long as you don’t creep me out or something.

913,JeonSekyung,1624536636,1,"(Disclaimer: I’m a 20 year old male, and this is my first Reddit post ever.)

The only emotions that I feel anymore is anger, sorrow and fear. I’m just so consumed by how I feel about everything in my life. Fearful that the only happy ending to my life is one where I end up alone forever, and that I’m destined to wither away slowly under the pressures of being a pariah. I resent the people who’ve done me wrong, and the world that I know of within my immediate surroundings that looks down at me in disgust and apathy.

I am saddened by the fact that it was only in recent years that I experienced any kind of a normal social life only to have it be torn apart by events that I couldn’t possibly anticipate. The energy, passion and youthful optimism that once drove the person that used to exist has all but disappeared: only the cynical, hurt and despair ridden 20 year old remains. Suspicious and distrustful of everyone and everything. I used to believe that being invisible and having no friends before was the worst thing to happen. I feel as if maybe it was better that way because I feel as if when I opened up and made myself vulnerable it only served to be detrimental for my sanity, and emotional health. 

Since second half of 2019 to now, I’ve been by myself most of the time. All of my troubles started when I started taking interest in a girl who I met at the second half of my freshman year in college. It turned out that I didn’t get the opportunity to ask her out as another guy did. I still kept liking her, and it’s obvious that it didn’t turn out well when I confessed how I felt which basically ruined my friendship with her. 

Furthermore as I struggled to get a hold of my emotions and was having a hard time with both getting a grip over my love life and academics, my friends who I relied on weren’t the most supportive. I was bullied often over the rejection, and provoked by rather inappropriate pranks that were purposely done to hurt me such as photoshopping a conversation with the girl that they claimed they had which said pretty messed up stuff. 

Not only that, my concerns and protests were often ignored when I asked them not to invite the girl to our group chats as I felt it was a violation of my privacy. They knew that I was having problems with her. Stuff like boundaries weren’t respected and escalated into arguments. I would later find myself leaving especially after finding out that they had leaked all of our arguments to the girl. Their justification was that I was weak, and I wouldn’t confront her about the situation which to me is absurd. They had no right to tell her anything as it is strictly my responsibility and right to do so as it just concerns me and her.

I’ve been by myself, I’m honestly scared because I feel as if everyone at school knows about what happened. I feel as if I’m looked down upon as being clingy or batshit crazy. 

Second thought, that’s not quite true, I did make two new friends recently but I soon found myself wanting to distance myself from them after finding out that they knew about my past and that they lied when they said they didn’t. When I asked for reassurance of our friendship, they said it didn’t really matter to them in the sense that they went with the flow and sort of didn’t really care for that sort of stuff. I felt disturbed by their response. It seemed to me that I had was overly attached to them, and that they had different expectations than I did when it came to our friendship. I just didn’t feel like I mattered like I was just a plus one especially when I felt like the time me and them spent together should’ve fostered some kind of close bond but I guess it didn’t. They often most of the time never asked me first to hang out. It was always me going to them.

I feel as if I don’t have anywhere to go, and that I’m running from the entire world. I deleted my social media accounts and I plan on not talking to anyone outside of a professional or academic context or dating anyone within my area (or attempt to date anyone ever?!). My mindset right now seems like I want to avoid everyone and everything. I want to disappear and be forgotten from the public eye.

My head hurts from the constant headaches spent from wallowing in my pain, and my heart aches for some kind of release and maybe the possibility that I can just find an alternative to the sad life that I seem to be leading in isolation, silence and loneliness.",lonely,Living as a Pariah,2021-06-24 22:10:36

If I'm with a guy I am close to I want to hug them, or put my arm around their shoulder like you use to in grade school.   I sit on my hands a lot to make sure I keep my hands to myself or I would otherwise act on those impulses without thinking sometimes.  I keep this to myself always because I don't think anyone would understand.  I don't even understand myself sometimes.  Because I am unable to touch people the way I want, I really stay lonely.

If only we could all just change in the right way to be accepted, right? I call bullshit... Sure we all have aspects that make us less palpable, but who doesn't? Some of the most popular are also the most rude, selfish, insufferable people on earth (obviously not all, but the existence of people like this shows there's more than just ""bad behavior"" at play). Truth is, most of us are just different.

I'm personally done changing for other people. If I change I want it to be for ME, because I'm done being someone I'm NOT.

Most of the time I was either bullied or ignored and considered weird. Even when I had ""friends"" I was always the third wheel. I was never the first option to anyone. Also I don't have much to talk about, I'm not a succesfull and an interesting person


I want to get friends but I was never lucky with them in my life, so it seems impossible to me to actually make some true ones sometime. I think I have to accept I destined to be lonely and left out and I shouldn't be depressed about it",lonely,How to be happy without friends?,2021-06-24 09:24:02

And now, I don't know what I'm feeling. There are times nowadays when I think ""should I be crying right now?"". Sometimes I even act like I'm crying so I make my eyes tear up to see if it would make me feel something. I'm just confused.

Yet sometimes I'd just go insane, I don't know why but my neck also has these involuntary movements or twitches when that happens, to the point where I worry that I might just break my neck and die one day. It also happens a lot when I have thoughts that I don't want, my entire body would just start flailing around, which can look creepy if I'm honest. An example of these thoughts would be something like, thinking about falling in love with someone, or getting a warm hug, stuff like that.

I would go out on my own but I live in a small town ( I can’t drive yet due to the pandemic I am unable to book lessons or a test because they’re very high demand after no one could have any for a while) and having just finished high school whenever I go out I always run into the my old classmates (who weren’t particularly nice to me) hanging out in large packs. I know I just look like a loser and I just don’t want to be seen by them, especially not alone. I also need every penny I can get my hands on at the moment so public transport into town is a no go.

987,cheffyboyardee,1624483909,1,"I went on a spontaneous hike with 3 friends during a week long trip with a larger group. It looked really cool and I decided to join them when I heard them talking about it. It’s basically straight up an unmarked mountain at a 45 degree angle so not very easy.

The first red flag was when I had to stop to tie my shoes, and no one stopped for me while we were walking along the road to the entrance. I ran to catch up. As we started to go up, my allergies and the thin air started to get the best of me and I needed a break. I’m an athletic guy but these 3 are soccer/cross country guys so they are clearly in better shape than me for endurance. We took a quick rest but it became obvious they didn’t really care if I was with them or not. 

As time went on, I got further and further behind until I couldn’t see them, after yelling at them to take a break or wait a few times I gave up. So I started going up at my own pace, without knowing where they were or how far ahead they were. I realized that if I got lost i was pretty much fucked because we were the only ones around. No cell service or anything. I eventually got to the top and heard them talking. They said they’d been up there for about 25 minutes already. I took pics for them and asked about a group photo, but they brushed it off because “it’d be too hard to set up the camera.” 

They talked for a long time at the top while I felt totally out of place and hated myself for even going. I had doubts about even going on this whole trip in the first place, and getting left crushed me. Who does that?

992,rotcomha,1624481942,1,"I'm not heartbroken. Lets start with that.

Ever since i could remember, i was lonely. In fact, when i was a little kid, around the age of 4/5, my mother had to talk with my classmate's mother, so i could visit and hangout with her son. One holiday we did it. Never again. Once a week i would have asked him if he wants to meet up, the answer always was no, for somewhat reason. Doesnt really matter. I havnylt seen him for 4 years alredy.

When times continued, I found myself being able to fill the void. You know what im talking about, at least if youre in this subreddit. The void, the one that is eating you inside, itching you at nights, making you avoid movies and TV shows where relarionships, in alnost any kind- friends, romancs, classmates, coworkers, etc. Becuse you cant stand the thought that its real. Becuse if it is real, than youre even more damaged then you thought. That youre incapable to be likeable. No matter what personallity you pretend to have, you still cant get anyone's desire for a relationship with you. So you deny the option's being. That void, ""the thing under your bed"", is capable to be filled.

For me, i started with being the oursider of a friendgrupe. I was there when they called and never complained about anything. And i still wouldnt change jt to this day. Why? Becue the void was filled. Than, when the grupe splits, and since youre the outsider no one is bothering to ask you to be in their new friends grupe, I started to filling the void with magic tricks.

Yes, youve heard it right. I loved the attantion i got from strangers. The breif love the people you show your show, gives you - when they are proud. They are proud you mannaged to finish the magic trick. And they smile, asking for answeres. Starting laughting and and demmending for more magic tricks. That filled the void as well. But it was over. I cant do this forever. I cant go to the mall and ask people if they want to see a magic trick. At least not without someone to be there.

Than, ive found something else to fill the void. Food. Yes, the old knowen cliché. As long as i ate suger and meat, i didnt have an empty hole.

Than, something really spacil and unexpected happend. Ive found a girlfriend. The fact she was a romantic partner doesnt matter, becuse im sacred of intimacy and couldnt do anything. The real suprising thing is i found a friend who actully wants to hang out with me. We broke up few months later, so as i said - im not heartbroken. Its been over a year.

Following this brakeup, i met more people. They arent really friends, but i do text them every now and than.

We havnt talked for a long time. And i dont think we will talk anytime soon. Defenitly wont see them in person. And now, now the void is getting bigger. Why? Becuse i know what im missing. I know what its like to have a friend or at least anyone to talk to. And i do not have it. I will not have it. And i cant fill the void with food again, becuse it isnt enough. I cant fill the void with videogames, becuse it is not enough. I cannot fill that void with friends or someone to talk to, to care about, who cares about me, who wants me to care them, becuse there are no such people like these. Not in my own little pathetic world.

So there we go, the void goes larger and larger, being less satisfied then my ex girlfriend (yes, i use humor to make me and others more comefortabe) and im just keep wondering; when, why and how.. will it be ok again.

So no, i was better off without knowing what im missing. At least than i could have filled the void.",lonely,"Do you remember you've been told that its better to have and lose, over not having at all? They lied.",2021-06-24 06:59:02

1001,Luca_02-59,1624479804,1,"Turned 22 the day before yesterday. Woke up, actually showered and put on some decent looking clothes. Had a digestible breakfast and all.

In my family we always take our birthdays pretty lightly, never a party or any sort of gathering with relatives. Just small and basic, some quality time, maybe a cake or something, and a small gift.
 Well my dad travelling over seas and my older brother lives 5 hours away from us. 
So it was just me, my younger sister and my mom.

So anyway, I don't tell them that it's my birthday because I got this feeling that they had forgotten. Not like, for real, forgotten. But maybe it just slipped their minds for a time? 
Wroooong. The hours pass by and by 3 or 4pm I find myself just staring into a wall in my room. My sister comes in and says she wants to show me something, happily I follow her into her room. Kinda excited not gonna lie. So she shows me this little house she built with icecream sticks for her hamster.
Nothing else. Then she continued her little projects.
I complimented her on the house and went out to my mom and watched some TV, for like an hour, and nothing. Told her I had to go see a friend about something important, and that I love her.
So I got my trusty backup bottle, went and bought some cigarettes and my favourite snack. Walked across my little hometown to my absolute favourite place (just a basic bench with a crappy fireplace) and started drinking. Started a small fire and sat there, as the hours passed by.

I don't really have a problem with being alone or lonely. I've never had, and I thought I never would have. 
But shit man, after some glasses and way too many cigarettes it just started pouring down.. and I neeever cry, like ever. It felt kinda weird.
I've felt bad before, really bad actually. 
Had some suicide thougts, some (almost) fully committed attempts. And some absolute chaos in my mind. But never fucking tears.
It was a completely different feeling of sadness and loneliness than what I've ever experienced. 
But kinda, clear? I don't know, hard to explain over text..
Well my mom realized the day after so she called me, wished me happy birthday and I could sorta hear my sister in the background saying it too. 

I also kinda have two friends, my childhood best friend that I haven't heard from in like three weeks. Called him a couple times, no answer.
And a guy from Thailand I met on my ""walkabout"".
No word from him either. Well he did actually wright to me yesterday, and he's across the world so I can't really blame him.
The meaning of this? No idea, just kind of venting I guess. 
I'm just tired. Haven't felt happiness in so long and don't even get me started on love.
A hug even? Naaaah, I've actually forgotten the last time I hugged someone lol
I'm sick of, I'm just done. You know? With everything.
And by everything I mean nothing really. Cause I have nothing in my life. No love no friendships, not a real connection with anyone. My days are filled with nothing except mindless wandering, and time passing.

Alright I'm done, sorry for the long post.
I know a lot of people here feel terrible daily, hope you find some of that love and happiness everyone talks about.

her fiance got a job offer in USA (we are from Europe). they got married and moved there. I was very sad, devastated, but in modern world you can stay in touch even across the ocean. at first we talked constantly on Messenger etc, did facetime and all that. and also the work contract was supposed to last only couple years so I thought she will be back eventually.

It's this emptiness inside that just gets the better of me every time I try to change my life.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no gf, no friends no work. Corona limited my ability to go to Uni and I couldn't manage to find a place to stay. So back to my families house. But they don't understand what's wrong with me. They just say how lazy I am and how I don't have a gf...

Today I went for a walk (like 1km) and that was the first time this week for me to go out of the door. 
I met my old best friend from kindergarten and we spoke. I couldn't talk to him. It was such a weird feeling. He was my best friend and we haven't seen each other for years. And all I felt was... Nothing. It was one of these moments when the whole world collapses on you.

It’s kind of infantilizing to act as though we believe that. No, I don’t love myself, but I don’t expect having a partner or friend to solve all my issues. What having those meaningful relationships does is provide support and care.

The world is a lot less scary when you know someone loves you, and has your back. I want to be more than a passing thought to someone around me. I want someone to talk to, to spend quality time with, to appreciate. Loving and caring for others feels good, and the positivity it incurs inspires plenty of people to do better for themselves.

It’s *HARD* to love yourself when you feel abandoned or ignored by those around you. Of course we try to be better to ourselves. We fill our time with hobbies and activities, many of us are in therapy or on medication.

But that doesn’t erase that almost all of us have a desire to be with others. Or that meaningful and positive relationships are often springboards for great personal growth. It’s just insulting to hear we can’t have love from others if we don’t have it for ourselves, as if we have no value to give someone else, or we selfishly expect some savior to rescue us from our problems.",lonely,I can’t stand “you have to love yourself before you can love others”,2021-06-24 05:20:27

I'm crazy I know but fuck dude. To be on stage at a shit hole of a pub being so over dramatic as we headbang to a not drunk enough to join in crowd, or playing a world tour and we play like our lives are on the line in front of thousands every night 

It's my dream to be a musician, solo, band fuck even just busking. Fuck. I want to do it all, listening to my emo/metalcore stuff brings it all out of me cos that's what I wanna do

I'm to scared to talk to people, where I live in England no one is interested in making a band. The bands that are around are just like one another, they even look the same on websites where you ask for members to join 

If I could make friends, talk to people, maintain friendships and was able to truly speak how I feel... I want to be in a band so badly. I have so many ideas/concepts

I was just thinking about why i don't bring up to them stuff that they do that bothers me. It's because in the past when i've tried they have always made me feel worse about that stuff. Basically made it pretty clear that it was a me problem and they didn't care about it.

And don't get me wrong, i'm grateful to have friends. Having people to talk to is a lot better than having no one. And the people i know aren't bad. They don't treat me badly. They are willing to be my friends. But they don't care about what bothers me. They don't help me through it.

I just kind of wish that i had the kind of positive relationships where people would ask after my emotional state and try to help me with it. Or listen to my venting. 

I try to never be weak with people i know because that has always just made them treat me slightly worse. Or it's caused them to leave me. I have to be the guy who listens to people vent, and always be the guy with an answer, because if i'm not then i'm not worth anything to them. 

And just as a sidenote i always get depressed when people talk about relationships. They talk about how they are happily married, or dealing with some issues with their gf, or they are sad because the person they wanted to date/sleep with talked to them for a bit  but then moved on.

I don't know, I don't have any real serious problem, I have a girlfriend and I love her so much even if I'm constantly feeling like a burden for her, she has her life, her friends, and I'm feeling like I don't fit. I'm not enough. I have a job, a decent salary but I'm feeling like I'm wasting my time, I'm not able to be productive, I've got the impostor syndrome, ADHD, panic attacks. I work remotely and here at home I can cry and I cry, I cry, I cry. I don't eat chunk food, I do exercises, but god, I'm so fucking sad every time. It seems that everyone is happy with their life, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I see my girlfriend happy with her life, doing stuff without me, and I don't know how to find the same excitement about something which is not with her. I just want to share, to feel something, to live, to make art, to not being so fucking alone. I just want someone to be proud of me, but I'm a goner, always alone, always watching the void between me and the world.

I've lost all of my hobbies and passions like playing videogames, reading, drawing, writing. I love art, I love poetry, but I'm so fucking tired of trying. I'm a ghost, nobody notice me. I just cry all the day, that's it.

I live alone, I pay taxes and bills, I should feel proud of myself but no, that's not how life should be. I'm so pathetic, I don't even have a reason to be depressed but here I am. I want to quit my job and do nothing. I want to try to make a videogame and that's my only hope, but I don't have the energy or anyone who believe in me (videogames are a stupid thing for stupid kids, right?). I don't have anyone to share my interests with, I don't have anyone who believe in me. It seems that nobody expects anything from me anymore.

I just think this world is not for me, I've failed at everything, I've messed up every relationship, I don't know what's wrong with me. I should be happy, but I'm not. My heart aches. I'm so tired of crying, I'm so tired of trying, I'm so tired of faking a normal life just to pretend I'm ok, just to pretend I'm like everyone else out there, but I'm not.

1066,usernamesRdiffcult,1624428886,1,"Where to start, I have always been a soft spoken introverted person but have always had a solid friend group from elementary school all the way up, before my graduating year I had to move a away. Out of that group only 3 people kept in contact which was surprising because we all spent of time together. 

Starting at the new school for my final year I had  a hard time adjusting as the schools teaching methods where spend up to cover the course material at a much faster rate. This caused a lot of stress on getting work done and not allowing for after school connections or hang out time with people. Though I managed to volunteer a bit for various school events, like the theatre. There I thought I made friends or at least I thought. The theatre production took up people’s after school time so plans where made plans to hang out with the people I met when the production finished. Then Rona hit and those plans fell through.

I tried to make virtual plans with people or even gaming sessions, etc. You know just hangout and have some fun and get to know each other better. This never happened though, I later found out that they where playing together, that really stung. Those who didn’t play games we where planing to have a FaceTime calls but that never happened.

Before Rona some other  people I met  from the new school where “busy” or had work constantly apparently when ever plans where brought up. The previous three people from my old school where still cool though only one really kept in contact with me. Out of the literal hundreds of people I have known and follow me or have my contact info etc. Well I mean keep reading...

Soon I realized that I was always the one imitating conversations, and text messages. I realized that I’m not in any group chats. I remember thinking I want to see if anyone cares enough to text me or phone me, so for a week I didn’t text anyone no messages. 2 weeks, 3, 4 weeks pass nothing. It has now been almost 20 months since I last received a text, phone call that was not related to a school/lab/final project question. Though I guess there was one instance where a person messaged me and set a scam link, I called them out and they haven’t responded. None of my “friends” have messaged, is that normal? 


Through this period of what seemed to be social isolation. I realized I had a lot of stress anxiety depression, from not having anyone and other things (not bad bad, just unprocessed emotions, etc.) I got diagnosed for all severe stress, severe anxiety and severe depressions and I don’t even have a friend to talk to, a person to text when I feel down, I have no support in terms of friends I can turn to. I’m lucky to have a supporting family though it’s not the same, as a talking to a friend than a parent , if that makes sense. 

I have always been the person there if you need to talk, ramble, vent, need comfort, reassurance, and support. I realize now that these relationships where always take take take, or that I was simply there never part of the group, alone in a crowded room reaching out, with responses meant to dismiss me as fast as possible.

All I want is a single person who I can call a friend, who will send me a text once a month to ask how is it going and I’ll just reply pretty good, even if it’s not.

Now a fun little story to raise the mood I guess. On the tour of the school they had students give one on one tours. I’m a guy for reference, and the guide, who was girl flirted with me, we talked a bit exchanged info, she led me for almost a week before I caught on. The kicker is when school started for my final year I knew two guys from a camp that where friends with her so  there was a bit of karma I guess.

I just miss an old friend, we had a lot of issues in the past due to our opposite personalities. He would often keep me company until late at night, we would watch videos, shows, movies together. I don't know, it was one of the highlights of my days because I'm usually quite the loner type. We would game at times and just have a mostly normal friendship, talk about things, sometimes fight when we wouldn't agree on something, but then things would go back to be nice again... Until they stopped being nice for most of the time and we kept struggling, until we decided it was healthier to part ways.

I'm sure he's doing ok now, it's been months now and soon it will be a year, but for me it hasn't been easy. Meeting people makes me anxious, it scares me I never know if I'll get along with someone for real or not and it's both exhausting and scary to put so much effort into someone who could change their mind about you in two seconds and that's the end of that. I'm not good at socializing, I often feel tired without doing anything on the first place so trying to get out of my shell it's hellish. I wish I could connect to others easily, but I can't, and then I get nights like this where I feel like just asking for a friend, someone who just stays for a bit and see if we click, move on if we don't, but hopefully just make each other a little better, understand each other, grow together, support each other, watch stuff together, play together, all those things I miss so much but I feel like I can't achieve again. It's a bit tiring to have people give up on you when they notice you aren't always on your 100%, sometimes we all need alone time, time to think, to appreciate stuff, but I understand others prefer to have strong connections really fast and I just can't force myself to provide that if I'm not really clicking with a person yet, it's complicated because my loneliness hurts, but I also feel like I really need time at times to open to people.

In elementary + middle school, I always had to go to after-school/tutoring until my mom picked me up at 5-6pm. I was always an excited one, who couldnt wait to tell how their day was.

As a perfectionist, I dont like getting bad grades. (its a bad habit im trying to fix.) 

They also let me buy/get whatever I wanted. But to be honest, the 9 year old girl (at that time) just wanted her parent's time/attention instead of toys. I didn't have anyone to talk about this with since they would change the topic about how ""lucky"" I was and I'm just spoiled. It offended me so much that I just hid it to myself.

1135,colesworldoffical,1624392959,1,"Lonliness is my number 1 best friend, now why would I say that? Lonliness sucks, everybody needs somebody, but sometimes life goes forward in mysterious ways. 
You can damn the universe and the world all you want, but in the end, for as long as you don't put in the time to help yourself, this lonliness will stay.
During Lonliness, you do everything in your power to get out of it, it sucks! It feels like a tiny blackhole in your stomach that sucks up your soul day by day, life feels meaningless, dark thoughts cloud your mind, and all you want is someone that understands you, but do you even understand yourself? Why this feeling feels the way it feels? 
And in realizing this in my own life, I learned that going through the lonliness and taking in everything it's trying to tell you makes you a better person.
Same with depression &amp; anxiety, if you just sit with it, and trust the universe that this pain will eventually fade away, life will go through the way you want it to go in time. 
And in realizing this, you'll feel yourself accepting this pain, and life will glow up again day by day, and eventually out of the blue, there'll come someone that will understand you, more than you understand yourself. 

So here's my suggestion, put down your device, go outside, and simply sit with your thoughts for at least an hour everyday to sort through what is truly getting to you, 
and simply ask, God, spirit, universe, or if you're an atheist, simply ask your subconscious, just that lil voice in your head, ask it what you want in life, 
have a good cry, and in doing this, this is what I mean by accepting the lonliness for what it is, its one of many obstacles that challenges each individual in life, so you can always be appreciative of what is truly important in life once you go through these obstacles of life.

I'm just an 18yo that has always been lonely, and I know exactly how you feel if you're reading this, my PMs are always open if you need an 1 on 1 chat with someone that was where you're at now, I'm still lonely, I still don't have that special someone, but I trust the world &amp; the universe that someone will come in my life, and for now, I'm happy to experience this and go through this long lesson of life, and I hope I helped you be find the bright-side of lonliness.

I (20F) have been dealing with my mental health problems on my own for the past year after a bunch of years of having these problems altogether. My problems started to escalate in the last months and I felt like I was going insane and I had no control over my mind, my thoughts and later on...my actions.

Because of this, I decided that I need to remove myself from where I currently live - I live alone and the only significant human contact that I have had in the past year has only been my boyfriend 2/3 times a week when he would come to spend the day with me (always one day at the time, never the night or 2 days in a row - because of his family but that's another talk). 

I feel like a burden to him nowadays and even if he's the only thing that makes me still fight for my life, I can't just destroy his life. So I decided to go to my parent's house (to do some blood tests and find some therapy) and everything is just twice as bad as it was before.

The first thing my mom said to me is that ""I'm deformed"" and she knew something was wrong with me from the moment she saw me because I've gained so much weight and she started to ramble about my birth control and how it deformed me and made my chest grow so big and started to laugh at it and at me. It was a ""great"" start. Needless to say I cried. I wanted to simply jump out of the car and end it right there, I realised coming to their place wasn't going to fix anything but just makes things worse and push me over the edge eventually.

I miss my boyfriend, dearly, and I can't truly describe how much. I miss not being judged all the time and actually feeling loved...I know my mom loves me too but she's always been a toxic person for me. I simply don't have another option. If I go back to my boyfriend I'll just overwhelmed him and get frustrated that instead of sleeping in his arms I'm having panick attacks out if loneliness. He is busy and he has to do some important things for his career. I am there for him and I want to help him succeed, even if it means hurting myself even more.

I don't know if I'll survive this trip and i just can't help but cry because I miss the only person that I love and I wish i could hug them for a second everytime my mom finds a new way to insult me. I wish I could hug them everytime my family becomes overwhelming and toxic. I wish that if I were to die here, I would see him one last time.

I've had a miserable life so far and I can only expect having a miserable life in the remaining years to come.
I'm a shy/ introvert person so it's always been very hard for me to have deep meaningful connections with others. 
At school I was a loner and it seemed that no one would notice that I even existed. And me being caned ( I don't live in the US and corporal punishment wasn't banned at schools back in the day.) was the closest thing I ever had to a human connection. As a result I developed pain fetish ( I say pain fetish because I'm not a masochist in the traditional sense) and I started equating pain with love and pleasure and started having vivid fantasies about being tortured. Of course having this kind of fantasies made me feel even more peculiar because I think that the greatest thing my partner can do for me is simply hurting and punishing me and I think most people wouldn't be ok with fulfilling these fantasies.

Growing up things haven't changed much for me. I still struggle with making strong connections with others. 

Recently I met some people here and I was stupid enough to think we made a connection but I found out they only wanted to talk to me for some sexual gratification.

I listen to my coworkers talking to each other but I can't bring myself to join in. And when anyone does talk to me, I'm so unused to having a conversation that I can't find the words to say. All that comes out is nervous giggles and vague responses. I had a friend at work but I can feel her pulling away from me. 

Why would anyone want to be friends with me? I'm so weird and awkward.  I can't even look anyone in the eye and when I force myself to look at them I see this look on their face like they are tired of me. That look haunts me. I've seen that look so many times. I don't know if it's my voice or what I'm talking about.  Even my mother gets that look on her face when we talk for more than a few minutes.  

This morning I actually broke down and begged my friend to keep talking.  It was so quiet when it was just the two of us but whenever anyone else walked into the room she was so eager to talk to them and share with them and laugh with them. I struggle to get a full sentence out of her. So when whoever she was talking to left I said, ""Please keep talking. It's so quiet in here I feel like I'm losing my mind,"" she looked at me like I was crazy and then someone else came in the room and she went back to talking to them.

I wanted to share something with you that I have discovered recently.

I've been struggling with finding a way to connect to people around me, but often times I feel that I live on another planet compared to some people around me. And with the lockdown still in place, where I live, it's been really difficult even to meet new people. I can't really find someone whom would be interested in listening to me, or whom I could have a genuine conversation on the things that interest me.

So eventually I found out about this virtual event that happens every two weeks. They have a speaker come talk about some really inspiring topics (last week it was about mental health during the pandemic) and then you breakout in one-to-one discussion groups. It's been really great. A breath of fresh air for once. I've been wanting to break my cycles and patterns and meeting someone new and talking to them has been really helpful. So, I thought of sharing it here for anyone interested.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had many friends in the past. Some close groups, some mutuals. I'm not the sort to talk a lot, and I'm not the sort to do a lot. So I'm practically boring in nature. I try new things at my own accord, and not really if its just a trend or if someone forces me to try it. Over time... I've lost a lot of these friends. I think I'm practically alone at this point. Most of these friendships ended because I haven't been able to see myself continue in them.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from friendships, i'm just generally not close to my family. We have a bad history. My parents have never been that great. They seem great to others and people can congratulate them because they seem successful in providing all they can for this family. Provided everything except... training? They didn't really help us foster our interests, nor did they care about teaching things themselves. So after high school many years ago.. i feel like i've always been making decisions for myself. Choosing this and that all by myself... but always without a proper guide. I'm not very independent, but i've just gotten used to taking care of myself. It still sucks cos i dont' have a proper support system.

&amp;#x200B;

With the pandemic and everything... i've now reached a point (again) where i don't know what else i'm supposed to do to make worthwhile. Relationships make me tired of commitments. I'm not a believer in families; aka i don't think i need to build a life getting married and having kids. I very much feel peace when I don't need to repeat what my past generations have done. I'm also... maybe... lazy. And afraid of the world. TL;DR... I know every purpose that I can choose to BE... yet I don't feel any fulfillment in any goal. Any objective. I just feel like I've been grown into a toxic family... and I don't wanna carry that toxicity into my friendships or any intimate relationship anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like ending my life... but I also don't feel like I know where to go beyond this point. I don't feel like I wanna live like everyone else. I don't know what's wrong with me. I still feel like I need a guide. Someone to carry me... but why the f should I make someone do that for me. I don't know what to be anymore.",lonely,Purpose,2021-06-23 02:48:03
1155,TheWottles,1624380420,1,"I've made the proactive decision to stop venting and ""working out"" my problems among my friend group, and I'm really struggling with the lack of support and feeling alone.

I'm married, we have four fur children, but between the two of us we don't have family we communicate with (mine are deceased, his are distant) and friends are few and far between. I do, however, run a small online community of people who I consider to be my friends. Recently, things in my life have gotten chaotic and I've hit a massive depression wall that makes life seem bleak as shit with little hope. I know there's hope and there's a possibility of things turning around at some point, but it's turned me into a very dark person and not so fun to be around, virtually or otherwise.

I recently made the decision to take my personal life out of the community that I run. That community is currently my only social outlet, and the people within are just about the only people I consider to be my friends. Outside of that community, I don't really have people I can just call or message when I need advice or a friendly ear. The choice to stop seeking support in my group comes from not wanting to bring down the overall mood of the community. When I say I get dark, it can get pretty bad. It's not fair to them for me to be bringing these kinds of things into the group. It's awkward for me personally, at times, to field messages from other members of the group who are dealing with depression and loneliness, without feeling like I'm repeating standard ""it'll be okay"" lines and not having an answer for them that makes them feel better.

The bad news about withdrawing this way is that I've now lost the few people I *was* able to reach out to when I needed it. *Why don't you talk to your husband?* I do. Plenty. But in much the same way, it's a huge burden for him to carry. He doesn't know what to do to help me, as we're both stuck in the same life situation that's making me so depressed. He spends his days trying to solve our current situation, and comes home to hear me complain and watch me cry myself to sleep. It's a lot for one person.

I don’t have anybody. I rarely talk to anyone. I can’t even remember the last time I talked to someone my age. I talk to my mom maybe once a day when she’s home, but that’s about the only social interaction I ever get. Most days, I probably don’t even speak more than two sentences.

On the rare occasion that I do leave my house (to go to the grocery store with my mom or something), I usually will see other kids together hanging out/having fun, and when I see that, I become really sad, self loathing of myself, and envious of them because I know that I’ll never get to have something like that.

I’ve tried to make friends online a couple of times, but I don’t even know how to talk to people. I always get scared and nervous and assume that people will hate me too, so I freak out and never end up trying to talk to anyone.

 I don’t know how to act around other people either. I don’t know what my own personality is like. I don’t know what kind of person I am. I don’t even have any hobbies because nothing interests me anymore.

My life consists of waking up, feeling like garbage (both physically and mentally), sometimes eating, sleeping, and just getting lost in my imagination. Nothing new ever happens. I never do anything. I never see anyone. 

It just hurts so bad. 

Knowing that I’m never going to amount to anything, never going to be someones friend, never going to matter, never going to be good enough for anything. The list is endless. I could go on for hours.

I just want someone to realize that I exist. I want to matter to someone. I want to wake up each morning and actually have hope for my future, have something to look forward to in life.

My family is the only thing that keeps me alive but, I think I'm just a burden to them, I know my mother will be happy without me, and my father left a long time ago, so he never cares about me.

1200,WalkingCondomAd,1624341200,1,"To start, I'll let you all know that English is not my native language. So if my grammar and vocabulary is bad and my sentences aren't concise, then you know the reason. I'm trying my best though!

In my early primary school years I was bullied for being weird, tall, and having red hair(It's brownish now, so at least I'm past that) and only had 2 real friends. In the later years of primary school, our school and the nearby local school merged and new classes were formed with mixed students from each school. - and my 2 friends ended up in the same class, I ended up in a separate class, so that's a FeelsBadMan.

As time went on, they got popular in their class and made new friends there. I was still hanging out with them(latching onto them, probably), so I ended up in a clique of 8 guys. It was nice for a while, but most of them were more outgoing, so a hierarchy was quickly established. - and I was all the way at the bottom, with no contest as the odd man out. My 2 friends eventually started hanging out more with the other friends privately and less with me, to the point where I felt completely left out, even though I still hung out with the group. At that point, I felt they only kept me around out of sympathy.

In my late teens/early 20's, I still stuck with this group of guys as I had nobody else, but I just never felt like I was close to any of them.

After graduating from primary school, we all went our separate ways, but I still tried to keep in touch, though the feeling of being a drag persisted and nobody ever made effort to approach me. Eventually, I just ended up not trying anymore and I've been alone for the majority of the last 8 years now.

Occasionally I get lonely enough to hit them up and meet them, even I don't feel like we're friends anymore. - but they're the only ones I have. The last time I've been invited for a hangout, I read back in the group conversation and saw that they've been arranging it for weeks, but I only got the invitation 2 days before the scheduled day(1 of them reminded the others that I existed, that was nice of him, but it took him 2 weeks to remember). Maybe I'm just overly sensitive about everything, but I miss having friends who think of me, approach me to spend time together, and generally care for me as an equal.

Throughout the last 8 years, I've made friends briefly via various places(roomies, school, work, etc.), but as soon they're no longer part of my daily life, the connection gets lost.

My latest lasting friend I met through World of Warcraft. We met up a couple of times, as we are from the same country and lived 40 mins away from eachother. We continued to play every day and hang out for a year. One day, his roomie (his dad owned the apartment) got a girlfriend and she was going to move in, so my friend was told to find another place to live on very short notice. He approached me and I offered him to stay in my 1 room apartment(26 square meters) temporarily, so he had a place to stay while finding his own. Things were fine (claustrophobic, but fine) for most of the time. 

3 months passed and not once did he look for his own place, so I told him to pay half of the rent, to which he first agreed on. In reality, every single month was a battle of pressuring him to pay his part of the rent, but he eventually always did(a week late, though). Somewhere at the end of his stay, he missed a month. He told me that he didn't have much money, but he made significantly more than me and our individual rent was cheap due 50/50 expenses for a 1 room apartment, so I found it a bit odd, but I was understanding, didn't comment on it and left it at that. He offered an arrangement to add a little bit extra on top of the usual rent each month, to slowly pay off the missing month and I agreed. The same month we made the arrangement, he met a girl and they quickly started dating. The next 2 months he paid his rent on time(including the extra agreed amount), but right before the 3rd month (In December) he moved in with her quite spontaneously.

I've messaged him to hear how everything's going multiple times, just to catch up, but no replies. I don't know if I've said or done anything wrong, maybe he just grew tired of me as we lived and breathed in the same room for 12 months, but I have a suspicion that he's trying to avoid paying off the missing amount. I never once asked or pressured him to pay up after he moved, as It's not a huge amount and I'm honestly willing to let it go. To me, it's not worth losing a friendship over, maybe it is for him?

It honestly makes me feel really bad, that he'd ignore especially if it's over the loan. I feel like I did him a favor by letting him live with me for a year, in a time where he had nowhere else to go. It was not comfortable for me and I missed having privacy, as it was quite a long time together in a very compact apartment,  but I felt good about helping out a friend in need. I now feel like it was never appreciated, as he did not hesitate to cut me off for supposedly a minor debt, but I'm not 100% certain it's the reason, as he doesn't reply. Maybe it's just that I'm not useful anymore or maybe I was bothering him, I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I feel like all the ""friends"" over the past 15 years either talked to me out of sympathy or kept me around to take advantage of me. I know this post is full self-pity, but I just don't know why I struggle to find friends who genuinely like me. There must be something wrong with me, because it can't all be due to bad luck.

But it’s a nice thought for someone to like me in my current state. Without changing how sensitive, or slow-paced I can be, or even my annoying habits. No need for changing or saying sorry for things I cannot change or struggle in doing so. There’s a lot to change and grow from, and I’m happy I can continue to do so for the best.  But again, it’s a sweet thought for someone to like me for entirely me. 

Even as they know every part of me, they don’t begin to see me as tedious or bothersome. Someone to be patient with me as I am to them. It’s a charming thought, but unrealistic. As it’s a lot to ask for, for someone to accept and love you as you are, to be patient with who you are as is. Without asking you to change one bit. To not want you to change one bit. It’s a heartwarming thought.

That's a good hope, won't happen. Not for me. But it's a good hope.

Anyway what brings me here tonight. Why am I going to post private thoughts to the public. Well this group is called lonely and that's exactly what I am. I like to think I'm funny, nice caring or what have you. But I'm not really anyone's first pick....I am a high functioning autistic person. Which basically means I fuck up sometimes in social situations, miss cues, sometimes come off rude by complete accident. Is this the only reason I am alone? Probably not but I do believe it plays a part.

I'm 25, and these are supposed to be the age where you have a lot of connections, be in the dating scene. But 8 don't have that obviously. 2020, like a lot have been a tough year. I gained 40 lbs in a year, lost a job, 3 deaths in the family, and an overall sad pathetic life. I've never had a great life, by any means but that year, is the deepest down a hole I've ever been.

But I was getting better, still sad every day but with moments. So I was getting better, then I met a girl of a dating app. Haven't been on anything even remotely close to a date for years. But then I met her and man did I like her and she liked me. But she just gotten out a tough relationship, but we kept talking. It was clear she liked me and I liked her. Doesn't matter, just like everything else in my life. I'm not the desired, the first choice cause her ex just hits her up once and now it's like ""I'm so confused"". I don't blame her...

She doesn't know this cycle of being overlooked has been going on forever for me. She doesn't know that she came into my life right as I was started to feel confident enough to try and find a girl. Only to be stomped down yet again in a repetitive vicious cycle that ends with me dieing alone.

I know part of it is my fault but I've had so few relationships in my life that weren't superficial that forming these real connections feels entirely like luck.

But having just passed out in my car, feeling like utter shit, wondering if I'm in any shape to drive home(moderna vaccine kicking in), I had a little bit of clarity. I tell people so often about putting forth the effort and learning from the failures while not doing it myself, acting like I was different or that I was going to resolve it some other way. Well as much as a hypocrite as I am, even I realize how dumb that is. You can run from your problems with whatever means you want, but you're always going to be dragging them behind you.

Growing up a literal shut in, a family you can only love in retrospect, having undiagnosed autism for 20+ years, only feeling remotely like a functional adult now at 23, being able to count my relationships on one hand, being able to count my meaningful relationships on a single finger, knowing that one relationship is irreparably broken because of me, etc.

I don't really know what this post is supposed to be. I guess it's mostly me typing this out for myself to get off my high horse and realize I can't keep bullshitting people with my advice when I'm not following it myself. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't a sad lonely bastard myself.",lonely,I knew it was only a matter of time until I was the one posting here.,2021-06-22 11:42:47

1238,geekdan97,1624324194,1,"Yeah... self-confidence level over nine thousand... I just wanted to share this here because this is not the kind of thing that I want to share with people I know (And I hope that it is the good subreddit to post this...)...

So, there is this girl who live in a building not far from where I work. A really cute girl like I never seen from a long time. I just see her exit his appartment maybe 4 or 5 times in a month. Seem new in town, alone, only go out for her goceries... And there is me, scared to talk to women because fear of being blanked or, in the better situation, being a complete random.

Ok! You have the context! Now, prepare the faceplams!

I come up this the worst, but the safest for me, idea to let her know that she ""capted my attention"". So I opened LibreOffice; wrote a message with Rayman 2 character font (Message that I'll share at the end of this post); print it at my job (while nobody is here); put it in a Ziplock; waiting for Friday evening; exit my apartment while listening to ""The Start of Our Youth - Tokimeki Memorial"" (Because i was feeling less stressfull); Going on a hiking trail to dress sunglasses, reversed mask and my Harry Potter robe; Exiting the hiking trail while walking with straight feet (because, vanilla, I walk with quaver feet... Really all the details so nobody would recognize me!); Walking to the building; Hiding behind a trailer to find some courage (Concentrate myself on the OST that I listen to help me); Walking near her car; Courage building again; A neighbour who flash his gallery light (I mean, dressed as I was, I could have been a thief); Put the message on her wind-shield, below the wipper; Coming back on the hiking trail, undress and coming back to my appartment.

Yeah, I know! Dumb move. Anonym message because I was anticipating that all the town would talk about it (This is a really small town). But it didn't (I was happy and suprised at the same time.)! So, even if I know that I have like 1% chance of success (and I'm really too optimist when I say 1%), the time is come for a second message, with something so she can communicate with me if she want.

So, I created an email to not write my true e-mail on the message (Something like ""rayman.two\[...\]""). And we redo the operation (With the difference that I was listening to ""Rainbow Road - Mario Kart Double Dash"" this time, the neighbour didn't flash his light and I put a tape on the wind-shield to be sure that the message doesn't yeet away) (Message that I'll put at the end of the post).

So, how painfull feel your forehead now? \[winking smiley because Reddit doesn't love emojis\] The two times, while I went to work, I checked and the messages was gone. Did she read it or just discard it? I'll never know! By the time I writing this, I didn't receive any E-mail (And I really don't think that I'll have news, to be honest!). I'll think if I continue with this operation or I'll just quit just to not be a harass guy (I'm telling myself that 1 message by 2 weeks is great... Harassing would been like 1 per day!).

So, thanks for your time! It feel dumb, but good to share this. Feel free to say anything you want, I know that my approach is questionable...

&amp;#x200B;

Here the message (I know that the English may be worst in this part. I just put the messages in Google Traduction and corrected when the meaning was lost.)

Annex 1 : The first message (without the layout because this text editor is not LibreOffice)

&gt; Hi!   
&gt;  
&gt;Since you've been catching my attention lately, I just wanted to tell you:    
&gt;  
&gt;Have a good day! 🙂 (Well, if you read this message in the evening, my thing doesn't fit... 🙄)    
&gt;  
&gt;P.S .: Don't worry, I won't put 500 messages per minute on your windshield! 😉 (Or maybe your door ... As of writing this, I haven't decided yet!). Because bullying is bad ... And bad is not good!     
&gt;  
&gt;\[Photo of a baby squirell\]  
&gt;  
&gt;(Photo of a baby squirrel because, since that I print a sheet, why not full it! Also because it's cute, not gonna lie.)       

Annex 2 : The second message (This one is weirder without the layout...)

&gt;Hi!   
&gt;  
&gt;Me, again, sneaking as I can through the night to come and wish you a good day! 😀    
&gt;  
&gt;I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight a few things. Well, first of all, it's supposed to be the second message you get (If it isn't ... it just means the wind has gone with the first message ... And it's sad because you won't have seen the photo of the baby squirrel! 😥).   
&gt;  
&gt; Second, I'm aware that my approach may be a little weird (not to say questionable). I understand that maybe this might scare you and I'm sorry if it does. I'm just shy by nature, that's all. I swear my name isn’t uncle Roger (anyway, i don’t think that uncle Roger would type a letter in word with a font that you don’t find in the software ... 😂).    
&gt;  
&gt;So, since I said good day to you at the start of this message,    
&gt;  
&gt;Good evening, Amelie! 😄 (I just think you have the face of a woman named Amelie. No relevance! But if I'm right, I'm going to buy myself a lottery and we'll split it up, ok? 😛 )    
&gt;  
&gt;And I have a place on my sheet for a hare. Why a hare? Because I didn't want to pose a Rabbit! 🙃 \[smallest font\] (men ... I'm not even sure she'll find it funny ... 😓) \[/smallest font\]  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Picture of a white hare\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The guy who writes with a font that is not in word basically,   
&gt;  
&gt;rayman.two\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;P.S.: You are free to use the e-mail address or not. I'm not Kim-Jong Un (Anyway, I don't think Kim Jong-Un ... ok! I'll let up the running gags! 🤣)!    
&gt;  
&gt;\[Smallest font\] (Do I have to be honest and say I'm typing this in libreOffice and not Word? ... 🤔 Nah! Detail! It's all the same and Word sounds a lot better than LibreOffice!) \[/Smallest font\]

(Note: The joke ""A hare to not posing a rabbit"" can't be traducted in English, so, I'll explain the meaning. Word by word, ""Posing a rabbit"" can be traducted in French by ""Poser un lapin"". And ""Poser un lapin"" is an expression that we can traduct by ""To stand someone up"")",lonely,When the Broomstick in you butt is so long that you try to approach a girl with messages on his car...,2021-06-22 11:09:54

I am 22 years old and I feel like I‘m a 6 year old little girl waiting for mum to come home. I am so done with this. 

I have nothing to live for besides my family. I‘m an only child. I was alone my whole life. Escaping into movies, books, fantasy worlds, daydreaming, making up fake scenarios in my head, imaging people playing and talking with me when in reality I was alone all the time. I was fat, dressed weird and got bullied. 
It changed when I became a teenager, I lost weight, dressed good and got called beautiful by the girls and hot by the boys for the first time in my life. I had friends I would hang out with, not having to imagine fake ones. I even got a boyfriend. I was happy, I was afraid to die. Then after 2 years, university happened and I lost them all. I mean, I still text them from time to time to ask how they are doing, but everyone lives in different places now and the bonds obviously aren‘t there anymore, never seeing each other in person. They found new friends, new partners. 

But I haven’t. I hate my studies, I am in no way independent and I won’t be for the next years until I finally studied something I like. I have no friends or a partner. I am back to being a lonely 6 years old only child escaping into her own mind. And god I wish I didn’t know how fcking good it felt having someone.

I love being alone I've been staying alone from past few years (before covid).. but then being lonely ain't fun I had a bf but he left (he left in the past too but this time it was permanent)... after him I'm looking at life differently. Like I feel so broken all the time &amp; it's hard to explain but at the same time I don't even care. I guess life just shifts from happy to sad to worst kinda sad in an instant.

1282,half-eaten-keyboard,1624305018,1,"Writing this to delay the time when I fap and go to sleep. I know it's bad for me (psychologically at least) but I'm weak and once I've thought of it, can't let go of the thought.

I never thought I'd write here, I just joined since I'm an extremely lonely person irl.

Today I got a fail grade for a course for the first time in my life.

What do I mean ""extremely""?
I'm in college for the third year now. I have no friends in college. Zero. I talk to the same person usually no less than a week or a month later, only when there's an assignment or some duty to talk about.
I don't trust people, because they've broken my trust every fucking time. Sorry I don't know if I can swear here, and sorry for the language but I don't have it in me to go back and delete that.

People don't seem to trust me either. If someone did and they just told me that, I'd be ready to spend any time, brains or the little money I have of my own on them.

I don't care for money. I have difficulty caring for people but I want to. That's not the only thing I want to do though. I believe life's purpose is to eventually arrive at a constant state of harmony, and while I will never personally see it I want to advance towards it with whatever little I can do. For this harmony, we need to advance in all spheres of life, hence giving up everything to create a peaceful community is not something I believe in, life must continue but we must be empathetic and care deeply for each other.

What the heck is wrong with me.

You might have some friends from a past time in your life even if you don't have any now.
While they might not have anything to gain from my life now, due to some social complications, I don't have the liberty of trusting them either.
I'm talking about the 3 friends I have. One of them wouldn't call me a friend. Another doesn't need me. And the third always feels like he's using me, and whenever is happy, excludes me.

The rest of the people in my social life, my family and their family and so on, they have an image of me as a shy, shut up kid. They glorify me above and beyond because of the small rare achievements I've had. But they don't respect me. I'm always cut off in conversation. My replies are never even heard, my statements not reacted to. I don't think it'll make a difference if I existed or not. I'm not suicidal. I don't want to be noticed, I just want to stop existing. If only someone could take my place in this world.

I am about to sit for interviews for jobs. And I can't keep it together. If anyone lends me an ear, some of this is on the edge of the sink, it'll definitely fall out. And doesn't an employer deserve to know how fucked up his employee really is? If it doesn't happen to be mentioned due to its private nature, is it not me hiding my true self for selfish, personal gains?

I've been collecting movies for years now. I don't delete them after watching. I save them for the future. I realized today in my mind I was building some safe haven or something which had security. But there's no point in that if I can't enjoy a simple movie without worrying about the data that comes with it.
Tomorrow I start deleting things when I watch them. And pay repeatedly for the privilege of watching them repeatedly.",lonely,Randomly venting,2021-06-22 05:50:18

1284,Firm_Particular_9139,1624304457,1,"I sold my beautiful house because it wasn’t near my job, after selling the house, I lost my job.I worked as an accountant for a year. Now the house prices have gone up, I can’t afford it. I live in a shitty apartment where everything is breaking. I am jobless for 4 years and have no income.

I have no energy to talk to anyone, I have no friends either. When I see bunch of ladies sitting in the park, I feel that they judge me and laugh behind my back. No kid wants to play with my son that breaks my heart. It’s due to me not going in the park as often as I would like to ,so kids are not used to playing with my son.

I am always tired and dragging my body around, have no energy to even say a word.

I sometimes meet my husband’s friends and their wives but I am no match of their energy either. I force to laugh and smile and it appears so un-natural. As a result, I am not included in their fun events much.

Also, I have extreme case of inferior complexity. I feel inferior to a lot of other wives. Who are confident, independent and beautiful. Those are the ones who not only are working full time but also organize gatherings and have many many friends.

I don’t mind being isolated, I feel like my son is suffering the most here due to my lack of social circle. As a result, he cries if he plays with someone after a long time and when that child leaves, he cries all day asking me to invite the child again which I can’t coz the mom gets bored with me so they’d rather send their child to where they have quality time and I am shy and shut down if someone rejects my invite which happens quite often. I have ladies ghosting me on play dates.

I don’t even cook at home, my husband does. He cleans, cooks and is sole bread winner as well. It seems like I hardly lift a finger but that’s not true. I take care of my kid and it’s too much work. I get exhausted easily and have low pain tolerance. On top of it I am pregnant.

Now a lot of this has to do with how I chose to be throughout life. I'm aware of that. but it hurts. for the first time it hurts.

1290,ILoveMaiV,1624300645,2,"Keep in mind, i live with my family, my mom, grandmother, 2 siblings but despite living in a house full of people, i still just feel lonely. I dunno if that's odd or not but it's just how i feel. I'm surrounded by people, in fact, i don't really have much privacy. Despite that, there's still loneliness.

I think the loneliness is moreso from the fact that i'm a NEET and i don't really have friends, but i've usually been content with this. I've been a NEET for about 5 years now. I'm pretty used to that. I Haven't had a real conversation with real people since. I had a feeling i'd be one when i was in school because i genuinely lacked sociability, i was practically a NEET then too. I'm sort of ok with the lack of friends, i generally like my own company. But i also want to experience a real relationship at least once, maybe even lose my virginity. That's the big one for me.

It's been getting me down and affecting me in a really bad way. i'm pretty sure they've noticed. I don't want them to worry. But I'm embarrassed to talk about something like this in front of my family though. How would i even do that?

1292,ApeAscendancy,1624300143,1,"Umm so i just really need someone to talk to, i've been feeling lonely these days.

This is my first time doing this so idk wtf im doing so if you have any questions just ask in the comment or something

So my close friends lately been ignoring me or something i got other friends but it's kinda complicated. I kinda have some problems with texting people first unless it's really really close person like family, the reason of this nuisance it's probably because in the past i don't have any friend because I'm fucking idiot or something so when i text people they just straight up tell me that I'm just disturbing their peace so rn when i got ""friends"" its just really hard to start conversations with somebody, if it's face to face talk i still manage to start it first but because of pandemic i can't.

And another problem is i kinda have Hyperactive act and I'm kinda introvert so it's just like 2 unstoppable force fighting each other which is impact a lot of my social life so um i just really need someone to have conversations with so I'm just going to kinda tell some stuff about myself or idk. I talk a lot when talking to someone because the ""Hyperactive"" thing idk, but it's kinda working when I'm in the internet because when meeting someone face to face I can't look them in the eyes unless it's my ""close friends"" but you know most of people i've talked to really didn't like this, like i mention before people just gon' straight up tell me to stfu even my close friends and btw my close friends will immediately ignore or change the subject when I'm having a hard time and trying to talk about it,so they're pretty fucking jerk, but hey beggar can't choose, so these 2 years i never really tell anybody about my personal problem Which is hard and now I'm can't beat the pain anymore and need to talk about it. And uhhh people considered my face pretty or handsome so I'm kinda getting a lot of attention but i kinda didn't like it because the introvert thing and i never post my face anywhere. But there's a time where i really crave for attention you know a typical teenager which is turn out to be not good, i played with a young female heart which i feel bad about, she's my first ""girlfriend"" and i make that relationship out of curiosity so i never really love her or like her so we clearly decide to break up.

 So uhh sorry for the story, really getting out of context

And uhh back to my telling about myself, I'm really broke I'm from bad country the economy is dogshit we can't even buy a bootle of shampoo so you know as a teenager i really want a lot of thing and want to become something but couldn't because i don't have any fucking money i don't even have a phone I'm using my mom phone, next thing I'm kinda jack of all trade but kinda bad at all stuff, i kinda like all things i see like anything literally you name it I'm even listen to all kind of music even alborsie underground music you name it. So in conclusion you can tell me anything and I'll probably like it.

so um I'm kinda tired typing stuff I'll probably end it here so umm sorry for the mess i never type this long and this is kinda my first time so apologies for the messes and this is the first time I'm seek help from internet please don't dox me or do something bad to me it's literally the first time i don't anything about this shit and thank you for reading thru all that bullshit and btw im bad at English so apologies for grammatical errors",lonely,I need someone to talk to,2021-06-22 04:29:03

I don't even know how to even begin. I've been seeing my therapist every week for a while I think and I'm worried she might be trying to scam me and my family. I don't think I'm paranoid because my family suspects this too. Every session is quite expensive and my family struggles with money. I feel embarassed because I've admitted to her some dark things and I really like her. She's nice and pretty cool. However, when I told her about some of the dark stuff due to my traumas which occurred due to family and other circumstances, she told me I was brave and all but she also told me several times that my family needs therapy too. She told my mom that she wants to put me on hold and get rest of family therapy first but it's annoying because I'm the one with the problem here!? I want to get better and get help while my family does not and I want to get treatment and actually get diagnosed. I told her all this stuff which points to some mental illnesses which I am pretty sure I have. Don't want to be a self diagnoser but I know for a fact I have BPD and I know I have something else too. She did a depression test on me and while I checked off most symptoms, both her and me determined I probably don't have it. She hasn't done any other tests since then and the recent therapy sessions have been making me feel worse afterwards. Not to mention that the sessions have periodic silence and just me saying nothing and us not talking much. She told my mom that my mom needs therapy and had her have a session online with this guy which cost as well. When my family looked up this guy they found no website or anything related to him - no psychology degree or anything. It's weird questioning whether I should trust my own therapist or not and I opened up to her but after felt she gave me advice that made me feel worse or made me out to be the ""villain"". Idk. I don't know who to trust anymore tbh. It's weird. I struggle with trusting anyone - my family too. And now my own therapist. I even mentioned that I was scared over her just trying to get our money which I get is her job but I have some sort of paranoia but I think she got slightly angry at me for that and Idk. I'm even scared to post this because I'm scared she might find it or someone might find it. The therapist herself has a website and a degree but I'm still worried. Like the thing is, if I have trauma even if I am treated better it won't fix the trauma, you get me? If my family treats me better I still will have issues, and like what about the trauma I got from school? Will she ask my friendship group to get therapy too😂? I feel like she doesn't think I have a mental illness or that I'm faking it or something, or that I'm actually normal. Does anyone else experience this? Does your therapist tell your family that they need therapy and need to treat you better before they can treat you? Does your therapist want to put you on hold?",lonely,"I feel like my therapist is trying to scam me and I don't know where to post this, help?",2021-06-22 04:00:34

My best friend that I've known since preschool is married and they're always hanging out with other couples. They'll do road trips to various cities in the area and do fun things like escape rooms and amusement parks. I'm never invited on these outings. The only thing I do with them is drink at their place occasionally. 

Similar story with the other few friends I have. Serious relationship. No time for anything outside of that. And it's okay, I understand that but I feel like I further get treated differently than their other friends who aren't permanently single. I don't get invited on the trips. I can't do double dates. 

Or maybe it's something wrong with me personally. All I know is the loneliness isn't just not having a romantic partner. It compounds. It makes friendships harder. They think there's something kind of wrong with you. That you're a loser. 

It's especially hard this summer. College was such a let down and I'm just struggling to deal with the fact that it will only get harder to connect with people after school.

1316,No_Fall_2769,1624285679,1,"Yesterday was father's day in my country and I feel awful.

I didn't grow up with my father, even though I do know him, he wasn't there for me most of the time. He visited me whenever he liked to, saying he was ""busy"", ""working in another city"" or something. He rarely attended to my birthdays, he just sent me messages apologizing for not coming. The truth is that he had another family and that's why he wasn't most of the time with me.

He never admitted he cheated on my mom even if we had proofs. He lied to me, my mom and my whole family saying he will marry my mother but he never did. Although he got married to the other woman. 

When I grew up I tried to get over it, I was a teenager and I didn't care about it. However, we had problems at Home because of money, and my mom couldn't find a good job, so I started selling candy to help her but it wasn't enough. Unfortunately we had to contact my father to ask him some money, because I needed to pay my education. He accepted but what he gave us to live was just $100 Mexican pesos! (approximately $5 US dollars) 

I ghosted him for 5 years until I was in college in the same city he lives, and I tried to forgive him. I tried to give him a chance but he disappointed me and I realized that after all this time he never really care about me or love me.

I hate him so much for abandoning me, for letting us alone, for lying to my mom. I hate his stupid wife for keeping him away from me.

Some people tell me that I'm selfish because I don't think about the feelings of my father, that if he is happy with the other woman it's ok, he has the right to be happy but I feel it's so unfair. Like ""how could you be so happy while I'm so broken because of you? How could you be so happy while my mom is struggling to pay the bills ? Why are you so fucking happy with your stupid family while we're here without you, doing the best we can? "" I don't want him to be happy, I want him to suffer the same pain we did, I want him to regret for leaving us, I want him to pay for making my mom feel like she wasn't enough. It's still very hard for me seeing my mom crying because ""she couldn't give me the family I deserve"". She still thinks it's her fault and it hurts me. 

I just want him and his damn family to burn.",lonely,Unhappy father's day,2021-06-22 00:27:59

And now, we have several kids and I feel like I’m a fantastic dad. Well, Father’s Day is the one day out of the year I feel like is super special and really is kind of a reflection on how good of a father you are, and I want to feel appreciated. Who doesn’t right? Well it’s Father’s Day. That’s kind of the purpose. I work two jobs but they’re remote since COVID, so I’ve been working about 60-70hrs a week for the last year and a half. I pay all of the bills. My wife makes more money then me per hour and pays zero bills. In fact I don’t even have access to her money or know how much she makes. It hasn’t always been this way. She didn’t have a job and I put her through school and when she got out making $40 an hour, she just doesn’t contribute. I do the grocery shopping and cooking. She doesn’t gets one until the evening so I have been here taking cafe of breakfast, lunch and dinner 5 days a week for 4 kids, and also dealing with their learning from home and helping them with homework and dealing with anything school related. I do our laundry, make the kids do chores, maintain the pool, etc… she basically just shows up for dinner and then takes sleeping medicine so she can sleep for work the next day. Well, fast forward today and nothing. No breakfast, no lunch. I slept in and she got up and made herself coffee and then was on the driveway making TikTok videos until almost 2, when the kids started asking me what we are doing for lunch so I got pissed and told them to get dressed and started loading them in the carat which time she stopped what she was doing and got in the car. I drove us to a cheap Mexican food Buffett because we couldn’t get in anywhere with a family our size because people who love their husband are out eating and celebrating. I didn’t talk to her at all the entire time. We come home and apparently she got me a card and some sunglasses. I said Thanks. She finally asks me what’s wrong and I tell her that I didn’t appreciate her not doing anything special for Father’s Day and she didn’t even plan one meal or any celebration and she made a bunch of excuses and got mad at me.

Most i push away in a day

While few stay for the weak

For me it is a feat

To take a seat and finally, speak



Countless problems i cannot treat

When the hammers come,

I run, retreat



Who knows who comes or goes

But without a message no secrets show

Without love no one knows

Who’s their friend and who’s their foe



I never learned how to trust

I tell myself to trust no one

Even if it means the one

And losing love and lusting,

after someone while im in this rut…



In their dust, im chasing, heart racing

Patiently waiting as the winds are changing

The boat’s are rocking swaying

Throwing those over who aren’t worth taking



Maybe I’m one of those drowning

Not drifting not floating, gloating

The ships I’ve plundered

Or lost missing those I’ve pondered,



I am certainly not a shore

Struggling back and fourth

Just drinking in the toxicity

Behind the never closing door",lonely,Most i push away in a day,2021-06-21 18:48:01

I haven't been in a fight since pre-school, and yet it's as if I'm somehow dangerous to society. Here's a bit about me, I'm a student, and take pride in a diverse knowledge and field of interest. Over the years, I've gained at least some knowledge in enough fields so I feel like I can find common ground with most people, and yet, finding a deep connection to anyone seems an impossible task. I have a girlfriend (f23) whom I live together with, and yet, it's as if she's completely lost all pretense of having an interest in me, romantically or as a person. I feel like the respect she once had for me has gradually dissapeared, and I cant sense anything but convenience in the relationship. Please excuse me for venting. Frankly, if you're still reading this, know that your dedication is appreciated greatly. Recently, I've hit a rough patch, mentally. I feel like I'm applying for the job of ""friend you can trust"" everywhere, and yet, noone seems to open up at all. This feeling of unwilling isolation has had a severe impact on how I see myself. Its as if each failed attempt to reach out to anyone is degrading my sense of genuine existence. Almost as if I'm becoming a ghost without dying.",lonely,"Mental self-isolation (long post, you're excused for not reading)",2021-06-21 16:40:27
1359,rustypech,1624257246,1,"Pretty generic title ahah. I’m 19 almost 20, about to be a junior in college, still “young”, and it just seems like I can’t catch a break. I’ll admit, It’s kind of embarrassing to post this here but I just can’t get it off my mind. If you have a few minutes of your day/night I’d really appreciate it &lt;3

Let’s bring it back a few years. The last relationship I had was back in my junior year (2018) in high school and ever since I haven’t been in one. For the rest of 2018, I was conflicted with my emotions, trying to recover. In 2019, I absolutely despised love and I shut myself off. I hated myself, hated love, hated everything. In 2020 my hate diminished and I just kind of felt, *lost*. 

Throughout those years, I’ve been *alone.*

When this year started, I wanted to throw it all behind myself and start fresh. I talked to new people, made new friends, some came and went, some stayed. I started drawing again (it used to be one of my favorite things to do) and I also got into League of Legends as one of my friends convinced me to play. The friend that introduced me to league, we stopped talking, and I actually quit playing league and focused on drawing, music, and school. After several weeks I came back into league full-force. I actually met some pretty cool people playing the game and playing league has helped keep my mind off things. 

One of these people was someone who I played with pretty much every night for hours. When we first talked over a call while playing, I thought it was pretty awkward because first of all, I don’t do good with women, secondly, I suck at conversations, and third, I kind of sucked at league and couldn’t talk and play at the same time. Overtime, it just came down to not caring if we won or lost games, we just had fun talking and playing with each other. I told her I always looked forward to playing with her and she said herself, she looked forward to playing with me as well. One night, we had a really deep conversation and I felt like our friendship got closer- well I thought it did but I guess It was the opposite… After that conversation- it ended… I was worried when she didn’t reply after a couple days but brushed it off as maybe she was busy… right…? The unresponsiveness after our last conversation is what confused me the most. It’s nearing a month in a couple days. It’s the fact that she was one of the first few people I let get close to me that made it hurt even more. After being basically alone for the past few years, losing that friendship burned. 

Putting that aside, there was this one specific encounter I had with someone that affected me. What really made me scared/opened my eyes quite a bit was talking to this guy after a game of league. After quite the ass-whooping and defeat I received, one of the enemies and I came to get to know one each other. The craziest thing was that we shared the same exact story of how we got into league, the reason why we played, how shitty our love life has been, and all around we had some pretty similar thoughts and opinions (on love, life, and women). The biggest thing that made me react was the fact he was 35. After talking for a bit, we exchanged some social media information to keep in touch. 

What really got me thinking was, If he’s experienced everything I’ve been experiencing for the past few years (and he’s still going through it all), does it ever get better…? 

I feel like nothing’s changed, it’s better to keep to myself, and it’s better to be alone aha.",lonely,when does it get better?,2021-06-21 16:34:06

We met up for the 2nd time today. I really enjoyed my sunday morning as she had to leave for another appointment. I headed back home and started to cook my week day meals.

Then a few months later someone else will need the same type of help and lo and behold, the same person who told me they couldn’t do anything is helping that person now. This happens to me
consistently and these people know I have no one to rely on. 

What really irks me is when I have a big project and I’m doing it all myself and then my “friends” wonder why I don’t ask them for help and tell me I hurt their feelings. You never fucking show up for me any other time so what’s the point in asking for anything now?!

I’ve told so many friends I’d like to do more activities and they’ll always say yes but next thing I know they’re planning something with someone else and never with me.

I pretty much said the hell with everyone because I assumed they’d be too busy to celebrate with me anyway and I wanted to make sure I was going to enjoy my day. I told one of my best friends the dates and where I’d be. The best he can do is show up for two days, maybe. But if I was someone else (that he always says isn’t really there for him) I have a feeling he’d make it happen. So I told him if it’s too much don’t worry about it. Why even bother at this point.

1397,throwaway817228,1624236689,1,"Isn’t it crazy, how many people are posting here constantly. 

I mean I didnt check any numbers but it is a long scroll just for one day full of people suffering so much from loneliness that they would reach out to ANY person on the internet. 

ANY half hearted internet conversation, where you know you probably won‘t ever meet in real life, where both of you won‘t ever have a benefit of eachother, where both of you will ultimately have to stop talking to eachother, where one person between the two of you earlier or later will ghost you out of nowhere, because of the constant fast paste of life. 

But that one tiny little possibility, that tiny chance of potentially meeting somebody you could have a connection with for longer than five minutes. For that much lower chance of meeting somebody who could actually become a conversation partner for a few days or even weeks maybe. For that even much much more lower chance of meeting a friend who actually wants to be a part of your seemingly miserable life. And for that even much much much more lower and almost impossible chance of meeting a potential soulmate that sees all this value in you even on a stupid forum site like this.

Isn‘t it crazy, how much willpower and pure force one person needs to overcome an obstacle such as life is. It drags and drags you down with a seemingly unstoppable force and if you think it can‘t get any lower it drags you down even further, and even further and then even fucking further. The sky knows no limits but the bottom certainly doesn‘t either. 

Isn‘t it crazy, what immense power a man needs, to stand strong even after constant rejection and humiliation, constant failure and constant loss, standing strong. This immense power that keeps pushing and pushing you down to the absolute bottom of the pit. How much shit can a man handle before he breaks. It seems to be a lot of fucking shit with the way things are going right now. So much stuff thrown directly in your face, but you still hold on to that tiny tiny glimpse of hope that one day you will be one of those guys that will make it. You fight for an impossible dream. Maybe one day it will be your reality.

Isn‘t it crazy what immense stress and test a woman goes through. This constant hydraulic pressure on an idealistic soul that dreams of the illusion of just potentially everything being alright. This pressure that your value is slowly but surely, day by day disappearing and the raging anxiety that life in the moment is not being lived to its fullest, how long is a soul capable of taking this? Depression and mental disorders ruling our brain space. Is this really the life we dreamed as kids?

Friendship is just a club for people who create they’re own meaningless rules. If you don’t follow their rules you don’t fit in. You might even have a mental illness because people like that don’t follow your meaningless social conversations “Greg”. But it’s society that has the problem not people like us right?

1401,throwawayfor2hot,1624234556,1,"Imagine this.

Imagine that you're part of a friend group, a very close friend group, of two guys and three girls. Now imagine you've been close friends for maybe 15 years, since early high school, and imagine that this is just an incredibly normal, though somewhat nerdy and academically successful, group of friends.

Imagine that you're the shyest, nerdiest guy in the group, and naturally, you've grown up maybe fantasizing about any - or all - of the three girls in the group on and off over a long period of friendship. That would be natural, right?

Now imagine you've come to be in your late 20s, and you still haven't had any sexual experience in your life. Every week, you still hang out with your close group of friends, get together and chat, maybe watch something, pretty consistently, every week.

Now imagine one week, you're going over to one of their houses to do this again, just like you have every week for the last 10-15 years. Nothing at all is out of the ordinary.

When you turn up, the other guy in the group isn't there yet, but the three women in the group are. Not too unusual. The other guy will show up soon, right? Though it's actually not like him to be late.

He doesn't show up.

Then, within fifteen minutes of turning up, having thought you were just going to hang out like usual, you find yourself sitting in the middle of the living room couch, with all three women in the friend group licking and sucking your cock simultaneously, all three of their lips and tongues sliding up your cock at the same time, and this has happened almost completely out of nowhere.

Now, what if I were to tell you that this literally happened in our friend group, that this actually, really happened to one of the guys in our group?

What do you think about that? And would you like to chat about it? If you would, send me your initial reaction to this, and your thoughts. Priority will probably go to those who are more mindblown than just passively impressed.

1405,Throwaway033828,1624232386,1,"I'm 19F. I'm gonna turn 20 in three months. As long as I can remember, I have never had any actual friends. I have tried making friends since primary school. I have tried sitting next to people I wanted to be friends with and making convo but it all leads to nothing. They seem either uninterested or when they do get to talking to me, I get replaced and forgotten. 
I have tried being a part of a group of friends. They would pretend to be my friend but never talk to me or whenever I do try to get in the conversation, I am not acknowledged. They invite each other places but I'm forgotten. I always get left behind.
I finally give up and try to ""enjoy my own company"" but I have done that for almost 20 years and it gets lonelier the more that time passes. 
I try making friends online. It has worked sometimes but they have lives. I can't blame them. They have stuff going on and I'm forgotten. Still, I chose not to give up. I go and try to make friends. I message first. I make convo. I try my best to not make it boring and dry but they don't seem interested even tho we are both looking for the same thing. Friends.
I have never been in a relationship either. I'm still a virgin which isn't an issue but I have never been close to the opposite gender. Never kissed, held hands or even been friends with one. Let alone been friends with anyone in the matter. 
Maybe there is something wrong with me. I feel that I'm an outsider. It is hard to relate to others.. I'm an outcast. It doesn't help that I feel that way in my family as well. I try to talk to them and even watch tv and stuff like that with them but they don't seem like they enjoy my presence. Maybe because I'm so lonely and all I do is hang around them because I have no one else.
 so I am just in my room, day dreaming about scenarios. I have been doing that since primary school. I often day dream about having friends. Doing the basic things like hanging out, having a slumber party, eating out together, etc. I have never experienced those things with anyone. I have always wanted friends to do things with. Hell, even one friend. I only need one person but I feel like I would be too overbearing since they would be the only person I'm talking to and they'd get sick of me. I can't blame them though. It's just.. hard. 
It gets hard everyday. I cry every night. I contemplate suicide a lot. I feel like if I would die, no one would notice. My family that I live with probably won't even notice until maybe a few days later, when I'm already dead. I feel like I will never find friends or be in a relationship. I feel like I will die alone. Everyday gets harder and I'm more tempted to overdose on my medicine than I've ever been in my life... 
I feel like things won't get better. I try so hard and reach out but no success.. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe because it's therapeutic to write my bad thoughts but.. I don't know. Humans are social creatures and I lack that but soon, I will put an end to my life.. and I will finally be at peace.",lonely,"I thought as I got older, things would get better but it hasn't.

I lost my father when I 23 tried to pretty be him, run the family farm cattle chickens not huge but 160 acres. My mother was in terrible as well so me being the youngest and only son I hastily married a young woman thinking my mother would want to see her baby boy married off. Mom's health took a sharp turn her 6 th heart attack severely speed up the dementia which runs on both sides of my parents. 38 days after getting married my new wife filled for divorce. I have to make one thing clear I was terrible drank smoked snorted whatever just to not feel these things. My mother soon passed. Divorce took 4 months st least a few thousand to  the lawyer. Made a slight rebound had two jobs worked from 7 am to 9 pm in between the two started dating a coworker she was 32 I was 24 or 25 things move fast she moves in basically right away we have fun but clearly both have issues we aren't dealing with becomes unhealthy she being more mature decides she doesn't want to watch me fuck up my life I'm begging her to stay. She leaves I'm hurt scared to be alone and just a drunk pos at the time said some out of line things. Being used she never cared etc just being bitchy. About a week after she left I get a call from our manager who inaudible through her crying I hear ex gf had shot herself. I snap quit both jobs and just let everything go. Sold the farm couldn't stand being in that place which was once so happy now just carried this eminse weight. So back to the pets I had 2 dogs and one cat. One dog I got when I was 14 a rat terrier named bo eneded up being my dad's BFF.  I got a pit pull when I 17 named Achilles  overly excited big loving cry baby of a dog. The cat was got because ex wife wanted one didn't want to take care of so we had a bond over our mutual dislike of ex wife lol. About a month ago my Pitt bull passed in a terrible way strokes over night so I sat with him until early morning taking him in to be put of misery paralyzed one side couldn't walk control bowls. Losing that dog has made everything resurface now I am so afraid to lose bo him being older than Achilles was. I don't talk to my older sisters they got shitty over money after my father passed am the black sheep so none of the families talk to me. I have self medicated for so long taken poor care of my body had multiple concussions after the "",bad"" one at 16.  I've became more and more isolated  because I'm afraid of losing anything else. 2 I will never knowingly put the pain I experienced watch my mother drift in and out of being herself in between pure terror when she can't remember who she is. I have checked every box to say you're going to develop a degenerative brain disease. How can I make memories to just fade away friends relationships to watch them suffer knowing there's nothing they can do as it drains them of life as well.

This meant I couldn't feel anything, couldn't react to anything and was mainly emotionless. After a while, I decided to post a sarcastic FB message to friends who never got in touch for over a year. Being void of emotion I just didn't care

This gained some traction and friend requests come in, including messages. I was void of emotions, so I had no issue being flat out about how awful these ex friends were to me. Miraculously they seemed to make an effort messaging me first, and one invited me to watch films with him 

Eventually as my emotions resurfaced (they're not as intense as they used to be though), these so-called friends distanced themselves again. From what I have gathered, during my time numb, I focused solely on my friends and never spoke about myself. Literally. I couldn't discuss myself as I had no emotions, so instead I coped by bloating their words

However when my emotions came back, I weren't continuously inflating their ego. And I spoke of my problems at times. As it's a bad habit, which my ex friends never appreciated and instead continued to let me vent (e.g. I asked them to halt me when I start rambling about my issues too much, they didn't).

Hi.. 👉👈

Now that I got your attention...

I hope.. first off I'll just say I'm socially awkward and weird and I have depression. I don't really know what I am doing when it comes to making posts.

I guess I'll tell a little about me.

I'll talk to anyone about ANYTHING I'm all about spreading love and kindness. I honestly believe the world needs more of it... anyways...  I have been on this Earth 26 years now. I enjoy gaming, listening to music, vibing, horror, and just talking about random shtuff.

I like watching videos on horror and conspiracies as well especially what has been going on lately.

Listen, this pandemic has made things difficult, and I'm just extending my hand in friendship for people who may need or want a friend they can talk to and just vibe with.

If you're interested DM me.. tell me a little about yourself..

I'll talk to anyone about anything. I don't care if you're an alien from the planet gloopenglop or if you believe you're being mind controlled I'll respond to all! If not I hope you are doing well and hope you have a wonderful week.

I'm Noc (Nocturnal), a 24 year old from the UK. I'm a pretty introverted guy and as a result over the past few weeks I've decided to create a Discord server with the intention of bringing together lonely/introverted people into a community where we can all interact, make friends, game, watch movies and whatever anyone else is interested in! This is a safe place for everyone and everyone is welcome.

It's very early stages, but the server is set up - if you would like an invite, please free to comment or message me directly.

1496,Xexos22,1624180214,1,"Just want to share some insight and experiences i had before that might be interesting to some of you

&amp;#x200B;

As a 21 years old man, throughout my life i've had many times when i had lots of friends and many other times when i was alone and i can say with confidence that being alone is MUCH more comfortable and better overall. Right now, i'm in the ""alone period"" and honestly i don't think i'm ever going back 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why i find being alone to be more comfortable is because i found out that it's just not worth all the energy and effort you spend since no one genuinely cares about anyone else. I know what you might thinking, ""you're negative, bitter and wrong and friendships are great you just had horrible friends or you're a scumbag yourself."" And while i can understand this POV, keep in mind that i have no reason to say this since i voluntarily chose to be alone and the people i was friends with aren't that bad. I can easily go back to my friends and socialize whenever i feel like it and nothing would change, but this would actually make me feel dozens of times shittier than being alone

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly throughout my experiences with people i never found any genuine care from a person towards another (not necessarily me) who isn't family or SO. People really don't like seeing you doing better than them. They will be consumed by jealousy and they will try their hardest to bring you down however and whenever they can to stop feeling threatened by you. When you're doing worse than them you will be deemed as ""inferior"" and you will never receive the respect or credit you deserve since you're not good enough apparently. At best you will be treated nicely in a bizarre way of pitying or you will be a scapegoat for them to feel a little bit better about themselves and their miserable lives. It will never be genuine and you will never be seen as their actual friend even if they pretend otherwise 

&amp;#x200B;

The third case is when you're equal to them in everyway you can, which is almost impossible to achieve since we all always want something we don't have. But if overall you're more or less equal to them, be prepared to enter a phase of ""rivalry"" and competition filled with drama to filter out the ""superior"" between you and them. If you have no tolerance for bullshit and you don't give a fuck about competition like me this will strain you out real quick 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my honest experience and what i learned through all the friendships i made. I'm not even gonna get into backstabbing, treachery, fake friends, etc. Keep in mind that the friends i mentioned above are the absolute best you can get, and i've come to this conclusion after witnessing my friendships and the friendships of other people as well for over a decade. Jealousy or ruthless competition are absolutely nothing compared to the other shit you might deal with while making/having friends 

&amp;#x200B;

The point here is that you're not missing out on anything as much as you think you're and the idealized version of friendship you have in mind doesn't exist. Socializing or going out gets boring real quickly and after a while you will do the exact same shit you do every time you go our with the exact same people and by then you will prefer sitting in your room alone LEAGUES more than that. You're better off alone and your biggest challenge and obstacle is to learn how to live with it and developing as person",lonely,You're honestly much better off being alone even if it feels/sounds horrible to you,2021-06-20 19:10:14
1497,jon_a_jon,1624178920,1,"Sorry if I’m all over the place, but I kinda just need to vent right now. Up until Freshman year I was considered one of the “popular kids”. I had a lot of friends, got good grades, and was generally liked by people. In 8th grade there was this girl that I really liked and we kind of were a thing but I was so incredibly awkward around her and she stopped talking to me. That really took a hit to my self esteem. Reflecting on the personality that I had in middle school I can recall some instances where in my head I felt shy and introverted but I never showed that side to people because to others I was loud, boisterous, and extroverted. After 8th grade, I never felt the same. I began to shell up as I was introduced to new people and friend groups. Even though people knew of me because I was on some sports teams, they quickly lost interest as I could barely maintain conversation. Late freshman and sophomore year is where it got to a point to where I started to feel uncomfortable around my main friend group, the people that I’ve grown up with. I felt so disconnected and worthless. Headaches were frequent, and although I still got good grades I felt stupid because I couldn’t form proper sentences in conversation. Long story short during the pandemic I started to practice insight meditation which helped a little bit and with the 2 months of in person learning that we had I made new friends and kinda started talking to the girl from 8th grade. I know things may seem to be better now but they’re not and I don’t know why. Everything just seems so pointless. In middle school I had so much passion for everything that I did and I was genuinely curious about other people, their opinions, hobbies, etc. Now it just seems like I’m putting up an act of being nice just to conform with everyone else.

With that in mind, it makes sense why we get lonely, when we don’t have people to talk too or connect with on a mutual level. 

The obvious solution would be meeting and engaging with people. Which nowadays, with everything being connected, should be relatively easy. But alternatively, instead of being easy to socialize when you haven’t done so in a while, it’s harder to even get the motivation to meet new people. 

Which at first look, seems pointless of evolution to work that way. But at closer look, it starts to make sense. 

Those who aren’t connected with the “tribe”, most likely did something to deserve that. And best case, if we don’t connect with people around us for an extended period of time, we’re just using up resources and overall not contributing to the group. 

And inevitably, natural selection  removes the weak link in order to protect the species.

Which might explain why if we’re don’t talk to anyone for a while, for whatever the reason (cough* cOvId), it gets harder and harder as time goes on. 

But we’re adaptable humans. We can change our destinies. We just have to rise above the natural instincts and break the cycle somehow.

TRIGGER WARNING FOR CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE and DRUG USE

My husband told me four years ago he was molested by his maternal grandfather. He briefly went to counseling but ultimately stopped. I didn't want to push. His brother is expecting his first child with his wife and I brought up telling them about the grandfather. I felt they had a right to know and make the decision on whether or not they felt comfortable with him being around their child. Obviously, our kids and ourselves haven't seen him in a long time. Anyway, long story short, his brother tells me in passing conversation about family in general, that grandfather will never meet new baby because he molested him as a child. I was shocked (and heartbroken for him). Turns out my husband had known for years that his brother had been abused too and didn't tell me. I understood as it is a painful subject, but also felt betrayed because I have caught my husband in quite a few lies over the years, including financial lies regarding thousands of dollars, and he always promises to start being truthful. I know his repression and coping mechanisms of his CSA have a lot to do with him lying so often. With the subject freshly opened he felt inclined to speak to his brother again about their shared trauma. Their mom knew three years after it happened to brother and continued allowing grandfather around her son. Later when my husband disclosed as an adult, she pushed him to be around grandfather as well. All of it coming back up has made my husband very angry at his mother, especially finding out the additional details from his brother in regards to her overall knowledge and lack of action. He wrote his mother a beautiful letter, detailing his disappointment and how he needed space from her while he went to therapy to finally cope with his trauma and work on unhealthy behaviors (such as the need to lie) stemming from the abuse. Her only response was to blame his deceased father for most of her actions, make excuses for grandfather, and villainize me for relaying husband's anger and frustration when he shut down and could no longer interact with her during the discussion.   


We are insanely low on money after paying to have our falling apart deck fixed out of safety concerns. Pretty much all of our savings is gone, and don't get me wrong, I'm so glad we could replace our deck but we have been struggling month to month as it is, and now there is zero money to fall back on when needed. My husband has not had a raise in a few years, despite asking for one. But it is a relatively new company and his request cannot be filled but they won't directly say it, just beg him to be patient. So he decided to apply for other jobs. My husband had an informal interview, which led to an in person interview lasting over two hours. The following business day the HR person requested he put in an official application via the company (we assumed for the background check). They had already given him info on benefits, said his salary requirements should not be an issue, and seemed to like him very much. It has now been over a week. This job could make a huge difference for us financially and provide insanely better medical benefits. And really help my husbands emotional state as he is completely over his current position and I think it is making him depressed and anxious. We are desperate for it which has only made us full of anxiety. A friend who works at the company checked on things for us with one of the higher ups and the gentleman said he remembered my husband and said he should be hearing from HR. Does he have the job or not?! Knowing it could make such a difference makes the not knowing all the harder.  


Yesterday, my husbands aunt sent us a TEXT to let us know his grandmother had passed away in her sleep. She had cancer of the mouth and was going through chemo at 87 years old. We rushed to the house because his aunt didn't answer the phone. Grandmother's body was about to be taken away. Her mouth as stuck wide open due to rigor mortis. She had lost most of her teeth and hair and had also lost 120 pounds over six months. It was shocking and just horrible seeing her like that. The Aunt is on and off drugs and you never know what you will get with her. Husband, his brother, myself, and brother's wife have handled as much of the arrangements as possible, even organizing documents to make it easier on the Aunt, who is executor of the will. She hasn't worked in 20 years and used her mother constantly for a free ride. Grandmother made it clear to us she left $25,000 for each grandchild and it was important to her that we use the money wisely, Aunt gets everything else has sole remaining child of grandmother. The Aunt has made comments that make us concerned she will not follow grandmother's wishes. Her mother's body had not been taken away but five minutes and she was asking us if we thought a pool would fit in her backyard. My sister in law and I picked out her funeral clothes and chose a floral arrangement we thought she would like while Aunt smoked pot at home. We are trying to be understanding because I cannot imagine waking up to my mother dead on the couch. Maybe Aunt was in shock?  


In between all of this, I am trying to keep up with two of my 4 week long summer classes, one of which requires constant writing assignments. I'm trying to keep up with our lawn and cleaning. My children and their activities. I feel worn down and spread too thin. I feel frustrated and angry with my husband that he lied to me so many times, and hurt he kept his brother's abuse hidden from me despite how many times I asked if it may have happened to him too, even though I understand he felt it was not his place to tell me. I'm infuriated at his mother for pushing her sons to be near their abuser (her excuse was she asked the brother when he was 14 if he was ok being around grandfather and he told her he was ""okay"" to do so). I feel overwhelmed and I am trying to shoulder as much as possible to help my husband but the weight is becoming increasingly heavy. Given how poorly and painfully things are going lately, I don't want to make him feel anymore upset than he already is. I feel like I'm not allowed to be upset about anything or else I'm being selfish. But fuck, I'm emotionally drained.

Like sometimes I might get the spotlight for a brief moment of time, but otherwise then it's back to just being in the background. Like I feel that my friends just briefly glance over me and go back to talking to other people. I feel jealous that they probably talk to all the people I want to and if I tried I'd be shrugged off or it wouldn't be much more than like a brief conversation. My other friends who are still pretty close and don't go to the same school as me are still pretty good, just as good as they were and I feel important around them but I know I should feel like someone around my school friends, but sometimes I just don't. It's this weird feeling because I've known these guys for a while and it's not neccesarily a toxic relationship but I just get so annoyed and jealous when I see them doing lots of things, meeting new people or just having fun and maybe I got invited, maybe I didn't, but I just feel left out regardless.

Sexual stuff: Open to cis, trans girls and also femboys, Virgin, 5' long, Dominant, lots of weird kinks.

Career: My dream is to be an artists and live off of my art but I'm currently looking for a job in gastronomy since I like that too.

Hobbies and interest: Music, photography, painting, drawing, watching youtube, spending time on the internet.

Famliy: Ideally I don't want kids or marriage but I would be willing to compromise.

1526,Elmagoencapuchado,1624164998,3,"When I was at school, I had this friend group. It was a small group, but we were very close. At the time I was a very lonely person, it was a new school and I didn't know anybody. They were the only friends I had, so I just assumed that they were all like me, nerds who were mistreated by everyone else and decided to came together to unite against.... The world? I don't know.

But I was wrong, of course. While they were my only friends, each of them had their own group of friends elsewhere. We weren't best friends, we were school buddies, and after school ended and everyone went to different colleges we all started drifting apart and our relationship became just chatting. Specially when 2020 hit. 

Of course, I didn't want to loose my only friend circle that I spent four years bonding with, so even in our distanced relationship I insisted in doing stuff. Play minecraft, play D&amp;D, play free games like spellbreak or fortnite, hell, even play fucking Uno on the phone, as long as we still play together it would be fine for me. But no one wanted to. No one was up for it. One of them just straight up said that he was too lazy to do it, going as far as calling me a ""clingy bitch"" for insisting.

I realized that I needed new friends, and thus began my journey into playing D&amp;D online with strangers, which resulting in me joining a discord server full of wonderfull people and playing the best D&amp;D campaigns in my life. Playing a social game like D&amp;D did scratch that itch of loneliness I had for a while, but the people I play with are not exactly my friends. We talk a lot and we joke a lot, we sometimes play Uno together and we hangout on group calls, but I can't talk about personal stuff with any of them, you know? Its enough to make me feel part of something again, but not enough to fill the void.

Are me and the group still friends? I guess. Everytime I send a text on the group it just gets ignored by everybody. It's painful when the only way to talk to someone is by chatting, because when they start to ignore you it's like they just cease to exist.

Listen, I don't blame them for having more friends that I do, I just blame myself for being so naive.",lonely,I was naive and wrong.,2021-06-20 14:56:38

1537,create-your-future,1624157544,2,"The only ""friend"" I had was an unstable yet interesting person I met online. The problem is that I have romantic feelings for them, and although they used to tell me they did for me, they now say that they no longer do, possibly due to disagreements we've had (mostly provoked by *their* behavior).

The other day when I expressed that I don't want to be just their friend and want us to anticipate meeting up IRL and being in a romantic relationship, they started basically calling me dumb and saying they were blocking me until I came to my senses. 

When they texted again, I would repeat myself and they would either ignore me or it would turn into a huge argument.

It hurts so much. Why did they tell me so much about their life and text me almost every day and kind of flirt with me sometimes (including talking about living together and what our children's names would be) if they *WEREN'T* interested at all? 

Am I not good looking enough? Do I not have enough money? Is there something wrong with my personality?

To be honest, I wouldn't even be able to meet up this summer and possibly not for the rest of the year because I am recovering from health problems and in debt financially. I was HOPING that by a year's time I might be able to fly out to meet them. But perhaps it's stupid and/or fraudulent on my behalf to suggest a relationship when I'm not even ready for it.

So, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't sleep at night and then I sleep too much during the day. My work-from-home time is suffering. I live alone and the silence is unbearable. I haven't had any other friends since quitting my last job some years ago. My family is alright but I don't share much in common with them, so only talk to them once a month or when necessary.

Because of my health problems, I can't just jump on an app and start trying to date people. Plus, I already attempted dating locally and it didn't work out. People here are too different from me.

The person I knew online was also very different from me in many ways, but it felt like we had enough similarities for things to work out long-term.

Of course, I know that one can't know for sure until spending time together in person.

We had a couple opportunities before COVID where they could have visited me, but they bailed. I think they were fearful of me rejecting them based on their appearance since they're somewhat overweight, but I liked their personality and was prepared to accept that.

So, yeah. Long story short, my love was unrequited and I have no interest in dating locally, and on account of COVID I don't feel comfortable joining any type of Meet-Up groups. 

I just don't care that much about making ""friends,"" as they come and go. It's that trusted romantic partner that I long for.

If only I were physically ready for it and if only the person I wanted also wanted me.

The reasoning is stupid and soft compared to everyone else here. Why? I actually do have friends. So why do I feel lonely?

We don't have to study together,  I'm open for general conversation. It turns out SARS and not being  able to go to uni at all doesn't help you with getting to know people at all...

She said that I’m moody and when I get into said mood(s) I don’t care about her and I tend to stay to myself. This crushed me.

1590,frik4nd3lbr00dj3,1624133552,2,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

I guess we all have ways of coping with things. Some people drink, smoke, eat, etc.

I just like to spend money on stuff that I think will make my life so much better.

I get that small burst of enjoyment and then it’s over.

I have a bunch of nice stuff but no one to enjoy it with.

I smother my emotions with antidepressants just to get through the days, and sleep is the ultimate getaway.

I hate leaving my house as I’m constantly anxious and worried about seeing people that scare me and/or hate me/I hate them.

Tbh I feel like giving up on love.   
I've been in a relationship with a girl I really loved for over 1.5 years. I broke it off with her because I really couldn't be in this relationship anymore... she was bipolar, we argued a lot and I felt like a dying old man next to her (even though we were both 18). So after this relationship, I really knew what kind of person I would *not* want to be with, but I also had a clear image in mind of what kind of person I would want to marry.   
Here we go - I met this kind of person. She's exactly like what I always dreamed about an ideal partner being like. I fell for her in like 2 seconds lol. We started talking, we got together. Today, she broke up with me - she just didn't feel a real connection or something. I suppose that's fair.

Now here comes my problem - both my ex-gf's were the most important person in my life. They were my driving force, they were the reason why I would get out of bed in the morning.   
I have goals, a lot of them, and I'm a dreamer, I dream big and often. I don't get discouraged easily usually - I've got a career I'm pursuing, I've got personal goals, I've got hobbies, I've got amazing friends. 

**But without love, everything feels meaningless. How can you live without the driving force of a relationship?** 

I feel like I have everything today's society would consider 'success' - but I still feel extremely sad because I'm alone with all of this. I feel so dead and empty. I have no energy, I almost didn't even write this post because I feel so dead inside. How am I supposed to get motivation to study for the exam on Tuesday? What's supposed to be my motivation to go to the gym? I know the motivation behind these things (like academic success / health etc.) but it all feels meaningless because I'm alone.  

**TLDR: How can you live without the driving force of a relationship? I have no motivation for anything without a SO - my motivation has always been a life where I can fall asleep next to the person I love at night.**

I don’t really have any friend. There are two people across the country I talk to on the phone occasionally, but no friends I see. I was with my ex from 2014-2020, where I didn’t have any friends outside the relationship. We broke up and I moved to Miami Beach. 

Since the breakup, I have no confidence or self respect. I have become a hermit and just chill in my condo, buy art online, smoke a ton of weed (medical) and walk my dog around the beach. 

I recently decided that I’m going to go outside and do things on my own.

Being ugly is the worst thing anyone could suffer from in late teenage and early 20s.. by saying ugly I don't mean being fat or skinny which still has an alternative that's exercise and healthy diet. Here by saying ugly I mean having a genetical disorder, one which caused me to start losing my hair when I was 15. Now I m 20 and I have lost a lot of hair. The baldness is quite visible in kind of M shape, like the hair are still loosing quite rapidly. Being ugly means I don't seem much attractive to anyone (especially opposite gender), I look old in photos, I look like an old uncle standing with my friends, everyone makes fun of me or mostly keep moking and asking me about my hairloss, still remember my mother's words that no one will marry you if you lose hair. Same words I keep hearing frok my relatives and friends who usually call me old, there are a very few exceptions, but I know the fact that they say nothing or are usually silent so that I don't feel bad because of them.. I never got a genuine compliment from anyone, unless I asked..When I first entered college everyone thought I was a teacher/ senior.. There is a guy whom I don't like yet he thinks I m his friend, though he is quite helping and kind.. he made fun of me by showing my pics in undershirt to others.. I have a lot of body hair but least hair on my head, don't knoe what kind of mutation it is.. but yeah they all, boys and girls everyone made fun of it.. This is ever continuing.. still peoplr point out at my body hair and laugh at it sometimes that I don't have hair on my head but excess hair on my body.. but the worst part of being ugly is, that I can't face myself in the mirrors or pictures.. the very last time I got a picture clicked was quite long back, I don't remember even.. I clicked a pic and uploaded it on social media anyhow and the comments from a lot many people were bald shaming.. some people met me after a long time and made fun of me.. recent pics of mine (if clicked any) only have my head and my face covered.. my family click selfies clicked but I avoid them.. and noe I avoid hanging out anywhere.. atleast I don't step out without a mask and a cap.. Covid pandemic has only one plus point for me that is I could wear mask and hide myself. I don't even have any interest in what I used to like.. cars, video games, photography or my studies, I still do a little bit of photography and play games so that I don't overthink but I don't think so it works.

When I got to high school I struggled making new friends, my brain convinced me that eventually I will say something that will make the other person uncomfortable. Spent the first few months eating lunch with my sister until I met some pretty chill guys in P.E. Things were okay until grade 10 started. The two friends I made switched schools without any notice. Not a text, call, note, email, fax, NOTHING. So I was right back where I started. This wasn’t the first time it happened either. My best friend left in grade 4, and the people who I considered my best friends left in grade 5 and grade 6. Eventually I snuck myself into a friend group by the end of grade 10 and stuck with them throughout my remaining school years. After we graduated we spent the summer together and everything was fine until university started.  Everyone went but me. I spent that winter helping my parents with there business, making deliveries and helping with growing vegetables. I spent a lot of time alone and (TRIGGER WARNING) ended up cutting the word alone into my arm. Eventually I got a job doing landscaping in the summer and doing ski rentals in the winter.

My major issue right now, is feeling this sense of “loneliness” and I mean the type of loneliness you feel when you’ve reached out to several people (who know you go through major pouts of depression), and tell them, “Hey!, I’m feeling things right now, and ‘I don’t feel right’”, and instantly recognize that since #Covid is ending they are busy, and you’ve got to reestablish you’re own security network, cause for some reason all of the rules have changed.

Everyone is out having fun, doing all of the things, and I am here watching everyone having fun, and wondering where was my invite? We hung out, talked on the phone throughout all of Covid, and now that it’s “over”, you’re hanging out with strangers?

I feel like the person you date when you’re looking for someone better. My anxiety cannot take it, yet at the same time, I “understand”, and don’t blame them. It’s like people who share trauma together, alone in our home but together we are stronger. Yet we can be alone with strangers and now!… which makes me feel different than before, lolz

This is Day 3 of me writing what’s on my heart and Mind. Read a news about a Failed Bank is being revived. Led me to a cascade of thinking. There are so many startup’s out there some reach the heights beyond imagination and some get buried so deep that no one can save them.

Don’t you think you being born without any knowledge is a startup. You start a life with a given set of scenario and decisions you make leads you to a destination Good or Bad (tho at times “god” gives some unsolvable scenarios but that’s another topic). What i mean to say is your life is a startup , the way you decide your life choices gives a result Good or Bad at end of day. So why not try to make Good choices in life.

My today’s Thought “ Life is a startup and I guess Time is the investment. So invest in the things you value and desire. Discard anything or anyone who don’t appreciate your investment and don’t make better version of yourself. 

I have started reading a self enlightenment book about swami Vivekananda. Hope I don’t quit in between and Learn something new.

1648,Dense-Alternative249,1624086247,4,"I’ve (24f) been dating my boyfriend (25m) for 3.5 years. One time while while using his computer I stumbled upon his Instagram dms and saw him flirting with a woman. I checked out her profile and she has a husband. He was telling her how attractive she is, and straight up said that he wants to date her if she ever left her husband. I was of course upset upon discovering this but over time I just let it go because I didn’t think anything would happen since she seemed very happily married. 
I forgot about it for several months until he told me he was having friends fly in to visit him for the weekend (we are long distance). Well ever since I saw the dms I’ve been following the girl - something I did just to figure out what he saw in her. I watched her story and discovered that she is the one visiting him along with one of her girlfriends. I was shocked and confused. He doesn’t know I know about her. I have been trying to convince myself she really is just a friend like he told me but I just have this bad gut feeling. 
Since we are long distance we have a ritual FaceTimeing every night. He didn’t call me tonight or answer any of my calls. It has to be because he’s sleeping next to her. It feels so shitty. I don’t even want to have a conversation about it because he’s just going to call me crazy for reading his dms and following her. He’s all I have and cutting ties with him will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m not ready to face the complete loneliness that will follow. I wish I was enough.

1653,hajmoolah,1624083367,5,"I don’t have a group that I can call ""the boys"". I'm rarely ever invited (if at all) to social functions. I barely have any guy friends who get me. Granted, I do have two really good friends, one of which I would even consider my ""best friend"". However, they are both two years younger than me. Though we are all in college, and maturity is slowly evening out, I am still without a core friend group. I have been this way ever since 6th grade, when I moved to a new town.

This town was located on the opposite coast of the U.S., and though I believe people are generally the same across every suburb, there were many key differences that made me insecure in making friends. I used to fake being a ""cool kid"" to my little brother, who I wanted so badly to idolize me. I desperate. I desperately searched for a community/clique to join, but found that there was no group the I fit into quite like I did in my old town. I wish I wasn't so picky.

I thought that coming to college would allow me to join a community where I felt I belonged. However, I made the mistake of choosing the wrong community. At first I joined a dance team, the members of which all loved me. However, the dance team was affiliated with a fraternity which many members were from. I tried rushing this fraternity, but found that I didn't fit in. I dropped out of the process, but by that time so deep into the semester, my grades had already been hurt because I dedicated too much time to too many extracurriculars.

As of now, I believe I am a confident guy. I can comfortably handle bullies, talk to girls, mingle in a party, etc. I am a social but antisocial guy. I feel as though I'm used to solitude because I cannot find the energy (despite being full of it) to text somebody back continuously, even if they show genuine interest. Yet I yearn for human connection. I want so badly to be a part of a group that would throw me a surprise party.

I fill my days with distractions, whether it be music, TV, studying, or work. If I do none of these things, thoughts slowly creep into my mind- hateful ones. I immediately seek to blame somebody. If I am not blaming a friend who I thought could have been better, I am blaming my parents. I could blame my Dad, who constantly put me down with harsh words, and who yelled at me in front of any one of my friends. I could blame my Mom, who acted childish in front of my friends (often times in a horribly cringe-worthy) manner, and who (apparently) asked for the move away from my old town.

Don't misunderstand me. I am not like this; I am not the type of person to shower hate and blame because I can't stand to live with myself. I love my parents and I'm (kind of) proud of the man they raised me to be. But in the last couple days, when I detoxed myself from social media, I was able to listen to my own thoughts finally since a very long time. All I heard was sadness and loneliness. And when I finally checked my notifications after a few days, all I saw were some meaningless snap-streaks and some messages from family.

I got along very well with my roommate in freshman year of college, but I myself made a few behavioral mistakes that distanced us. I hope I will be able to push our friendship farther this next school year, as we will be rooming together again.",lonely,No Core Friend Group,2021-06-19 16:16:07

However you take a look at your contacts and that's when you remember that  you have nobody added online, you're alone, completely lonely even online thus you have nobody to share your media with.

Your days are for the most part uneventful however every now and then you have days in which something truly special and awesome happened to you and because your days are uneventful whatever that happened is truly remarkable so that makes you wanna share it with someone, you wanna tell someone about the highlight of your day however nobody is there, yet again you face the same problem, you're lonely, you have no friends not even online, there is absolutely no one you can reach out to so you keep what happened all to yourself, you weren't able to express nor tell about that genuine joy you experienced to someone else.

I enjoy solitude and I even find my own loneliness somewhat comfortable at times, perhaps this comes from the fact that I've gotten used to just having myself however there is a breaking point when you've been in solitude far too long, all the little realizations of ""oh yeah I'm alone"" you have through the day on a daily basis slowly but surely wears you down.

Wholeheartedly not having a friend who you can banter with, share everything and anything with and much less not being able to share with them your joys it's like being living death, I've been living death for far to long by now and I'm tired, the loneliness got the best of me and I've been running on empty for several years by now.

Wish I had a friend online and I was sought out by them to hang out with me or just to chat (and vice versa) however I've given up on trying to make friends online, for some reason I no longer cannot connect with people and my cheerful energy has been drained away by the loneliness and what remains is a listless-me.

Personally speaking I've reached my limit. I've considered the possibility of getting a job with the soley purpose of using the money I earn so I can pay people online to pretend they're my friends and for them to hang out with me or listen to me. I miss the companionship of a best friend, I really miss that with every fiber of my being and to be honest I've been so worn down by this that in the near future I've started to consider suicide as a way out after all I've been dead and living on auto-pilot for a while by now.

I was remodeling this women’s house, and she had such a beautiful daughter who happened to be my age as well. Cut the story short, her mom found me very handsome and attractive and encouraged the daughter to try and talk to me in hopes of a relationship. I felt the tension. I knew her daughter was into me. The looks, the vibes, the surplus of kindness.. anyways, after building the shower tile in the basement, an employee asked that i’d bring him a bottle of water. I go upstairs and find her in the library room and asked if it is okay that i grab a bottle of water. She told me i can have whatever I wanted. Soon enough, we spark up conversation, and i get her number and things are good. My broken heart got the best of me and fell in love with her attraction to quickly. she was just so beautiful and perfect to me. I stopped showing my masculinity and just got emotionally attached to her. She ghosted me.

1664,throwaway_trash101,1624079758,8,"Excuse the title, but I think it's about the best way of expressing what I'm thinking. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm lonely as I have a number of close friends (both IRL and online), but for whatever reason there is something that prevents me from expressing what I'm feeling to any of them. Being almost 20 (male) at this point, I have no experience in dating other than getting rejected or ghosted, but have used the frustration from this part of my life to motivate myself to grow and learn. I have put time into learning a second language, creating small indie games / programming projects, getting in shape by going on runs, learning to play the guitar, etc. Despite my growth in these areas, I still feel like my life has led nowhere and every night I just sort of sit around and try to figure out what makes me feel this way. I've found myself becoming increasingly agitated at myself over small things or just life in general, and I want to find a way out.

So how does this tie into the title? I want to talk to someone, anyone, to try and get a handle on my negative emotions, as I know they aren't healthy to keep pent up. But every option I have doesn't make sense to reach out to. My parents? I've tried talking to them, but (generic statement incoming) they don't quite seem to understand what I'm going through. All I can get from them is useless statements that I've already heard a million times and don't actually offer any useful insight (""It's just a phase of life, it won't last forever"" type responses). Friends? There's something in me that just won't let me say anything to them about it, like I'd be bothering them or that it would make things awkward. Every time I think of someone to try to open up to, there's always some reason in my mind that just locks me in place and keeps me from doing anything. People I know from high school? That just seems like a bad idea since most of them I haven't ever really talked to. With guys, it just seems weird for me start talking to someone out of the blue about deeply personal topics. And with girls, its the same thing except even worse: what if they share it with other people I know because they think I'm coming off as weird or pathetic? All these things bounce around in my head when thinking of talking to anyone about my problems, leading me to stay inactive and just give up trying to understand myself and my thoughts. I know I'm not weak, as I've managed to get through a lot of tough spots in my life more or less ""alone"" by keeping things to myself, but I can't take it anymore. I want to stop feeling like everything is just whirling by around me while I just sit and watch and let it happen. I want to be able to go outside and meet people and actually be in a situation where the potential to enter into a romantic relationship exists. How do I even start trying to fix my life?

Sorry if this comes off as extremely cringe, but I really don't care anymore. I just need somewhere to put at least part of what I'm thinking. It's how I actually feel, I don't care about attention, I just need to find a way out.",lonely,"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream",2021-06-19 15:15:58

I could only put down one personal reference because I have pretty much no friends, and every job I've had before I left under weird (??) circumstances or I just didn't keep any contacts. 

I ended up having to wait an hour for the interviewer to show up only to be told after a few questions that they wanted someone with more experience. Like, you didn't see my lack of experience from the resume??

At my current workplace I am a hot topic of gossip because the flirtationship I had with a dude at work ended. We were pretty obvious about flirting all the time at work, stupid I know, but it already happened. Now he is talking to some other chick and all her friends look at me as if they won. 
But she can straight up keep him!! I don't even really care that he is potentially seeing someone else. It's just my pride and ego wanting to be the one who is talking to someone new first... but then the other part of me is wishing I had actual friends to talk to at all.

People around you conversing normally and just having a good time while all you do is watch even though you want to join their conversations. I have friends outside of work and at work, but when my couple work friends aren't there, I'm left lonely af watching other people enjoy their shifts. Any advice on how to open up and join more friends circles? My current problem is I can't hold a conversation sometimes. It's ok with my close friends but with others I probably appear dry because of anxiety. I also get nervous going up to a new person because I'm afraid I'll have a dry convo as mentioned earlier. As a bonus I tried to leave my shell and talk to a girl I liked at work and completely fucked it up with my blushing/stuttering. Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic with too high standards of having a love life is why that one hurt my self esteem so much. 

What I'm trying to get at is that I'm surrounded by loving friends and family, but still feel more alone then ever, idk what's wrong with me. On top of that, going to work with people all my age and only talking to a couple people every day makes me feel like I'm wasting my youth. I'm 21 and summer is going by way too fast. I know once I'm past a certain age things won't be the same at all adding to the anxiety and pressure of meeting new people and making new memories.

1678,lonely-balloon,1624073908,5,"For context, I’m a studious person (20F in Australia if that matters). I’ve been told all my life I’m smart because of my good grades etc., and I tend to find and connect with people academically inclined. Which is good because we are focused on our study and have the same goals, but at the same time it’s frustrating because we aren’t hanging out like young people should be. We all also have casual jobs on top of studying and our schedules are hard to match, so we hang out approximately twice a year which is during the uni break. We do text in the group chat but don’t actually ‘have time’ to go out and do activities. 

And these people are the ones I would consider my self the closest to, but they don’t feel the same way because they have friend groups from high school, while my friend group doesn’t even bother to respond to messages. I get that everyone is busy, but I’ve recently learned that maintaining a friendship takes 2 parties and I always feel like I’m the one trying to do my part while the other party doesn’t do much (i.e. organise times to go out etc.). 

So I’m envious when I see groups of friends hanging out on the weekend and staying at BnBs. I’m envious when someone says they have a best friend. The last time I had a best friend was in primary school and they broke my heart, not even in a romantic way - it’s just that to this day I think she hates me for reasons unknown. 

I do have some extra-curricular activities but I haven’t been able to connect with anybody on a deep level. And same with my jobs - beyond work there’s no social gatherings. 

It’s just funny because before COVID lockdowns, I used to hate being around people, but now I crave it. 

I’ve never been in a relationship before either and when I see so many beautiful couples, I tend to hate my less than average face. I’ve never had a guy hit on me before so I guess I just don’t feel attractive in the outside. 

I find it hard to open up to others when I first meet them if they have a bigger personality than me. My parents are divorced and I grew up with only one parent around, so I think this where my issues around affection and love partly stem from. 

Does it get better? I heard it’s even harder to make friends as you enter full-time work, and I feel like I’m just on a decline from  here. There’s a lot of people I know that I’m “friends” with on a superficial level but it’s so difficult to have a deep connection, and I feel unworthy of it anyway.

I was lonely before starting 4th year, constantly surrounded by my colleagues that are married, engaged, or at minimum dating their partners for extended periods of time. But now that I’m stranded in a new city each month, with none of the few students I made friends with in my first 3 years, I’m even lonelier. 

I have always struggled committing myself to trying to date, coming up with excuses about poor timing. The last year of undergrad I didn’t want to date, knowing I’d be going halfway across the country for medical school and would struggle with long-distance. Then the first 2 years of medical school I didn’t date because I told myself I was too busy, but in reality was too scared to try any serious attempts. Then during 3rd year I again feared trying to date, knowing I’d be moving somewhere for residency. Now I find myself rotating around the country for a year, seeing how little time residents have for themselves given how busy they are, and worry I will continue to have the same problems in residency. I will continue struggle finding the right time. I upset myself for not trying harder when I had the opportunity, and now think I have stuck myself into a terrible situation of time.

I just lost my online friends and I don’t have any friends IRL. It’s a lonely and disappointing feeling that I can’t explain. I can’t believe I can’t even keep online friends. Well now I have no one and that leads me into another depression along with my parents' long tiring divorce. I just feel so many emotions and it drives me crazy. 

These feelings get worse for me and I never told anyone because my family already have a lot to deal with and adding on my problems can make things worse for my family.

And when you think you’re doing great in life something just happens quickly like a punch in the face. I can no longer take this. 

I recently started going to the skate park and I meant some cool people. I genuinely laughed and talked to them but Deep down I felt empty and weird, this feeling was draining.

Movies use to help me with these emotions but now whenever I see a movie I don’t feel anything, which is weird because I always do. Idk these feelings are weird and sad. All I know is that I wake up wanting to die, I don’t care how it happens I just want to leave this world quickly. I’m

In 2018 I cut off a toxic group of friends and left to Australia for a year VISA to find new friends and a better life. I had a great time.

I returned to UK and started a job but made no friends my age (everyone was over 50yo).

I ended up going out to clubs on my own, dates and solo outings where my only source of social interaction outside work.
I endured over a year of this, and decided to travel again just before the pandemic as I was at breaking point.


My plans were cut short and I was forced to return home. Without any friends, not even online, nobody to talk to, every month that's gone by I've sunk deeper into desperation and further adrift from a normal life or chance/ will to return.

I'm at a point now, where I just watch people on Instagram have fun, whilst I've been sidelined, muted forgotten, lost in limbo.


I really don't know what to do anymore and feel there's no coming back this time. I can't imagine many people my age having to go through this?

1707,Just-Another-Pers0n,1624053457,1,"Hey. So throughout the last months I have been changing a lot. I've been pretty alone for my entire life and to be honest, I didn't really have a problem with it until now. I currenty have a small group of friends at school, that I can at least have some fun with during the one half of the day. But as soon as I get home my friends don't have time anymore and I feel very alone. I don't have any siblings or pets and my parents aren't at home most of the time. I just sit down in front of my computer and start watching YouTube videos and memes. It feels like an endless loop I just can't escape. I want to feel important to someone. I want someone to talk to and tell them about the small excitements I have in my boring days. I want someone that understands me and can help me get out of this endless circle. I want someone, that enjoys spending time with me and hits me up to do something, so I don't have to always be the annoying person, that keeps asking. But I guess that's just how I'm meant to live my life. I don't feel well in my body. I'm ugly, skinny and I also smell bad all the time. I want to change things in my life, but at the end of the day I just wasted another day watching videos, memes and being trapped inside this endless loop. I haven't felt really important to anyone in my entire life. I'm just another generic, boring, ugly person, that tries to make it's way through life.

I'm sorry, I just had to get rid of all the emotions, I was hiding inside myself.

If you read this text so far, I'm really thankful. Thank you.",lonely,I feel very alone,2021-06-19 07:57:37

Will I get past this point tonight? Who knows. I'm doing good. But, it's very likely that I'll just delete this shit after 20 minutes of typing. Again.

I gave up my life to come back home and sell the family home and take care of my Dad. I was always Daddy's girl. But, that meant that I also gave up all my friends. Including my husband of 23 years. Yeah, there's a lot more to get into there. But, I went through the lonely high school phase, followed by the mostly lonely college phase...to find my...I can't even remember the term. Probably because it's false. 

The husband. Everything I dreamed of in high school (a friend). But, it all went wrong. After grad school he expected me to be rich. He didn't care how much my student loans were weighing me down. But, I'd go to work. Get sat in the corner on a Friday and yelled at until I sobbed, to come home to a husband who was off mountain biking for a four day weekend...Living his best life. 

That escalated until he was barely speaking to me. Completely ignoring my presence. But, he still expected some action. Unfortunately for him (and me) that was when I started to come to terms with the fact that I'm asexual. And no matter how much he ignored me, and didn't help me...he always just wanted a little action.

Now, I've lived mostly by myself for a few years. My Dad passed away almost a year ago. Everything seems more like a prison everyday. But, if I had my husband, my best friend...everything would be fine. I still dream of him almost every night. Not even good dreams really. Half the time I'm trying to come to terms with his new girlfriend. 

Don't know where I'm going with this. But, I live in a beautiful place by myself. But, I don't want to be by myself. I want to share it with someone special (don't we all). So here's to hoping that even the old, fat, PhD's amongst us can find that (slightly) special someone...again...someday.  

And, sobbing, for the first time I'll hit enter...even though I might regret it....why...who the fuck cares....",lonely,Don't give up hope...anyone...,2021-06-19 07:33:53

1731,NJB2310,1624044480,17,"I live in the UK (Wales) and to be honest, living here has been a nightmare. Easily one of the worst places to live, everyone I know has either let me down or been an asshole to me. I was diagnosed with Aspherger's when I was 17 and I've since seen my life in a completely new light. I've been pretty lonely for most of my life even though I didn't really realise until recently and now I feel like a waste.

All my friends are gone, my family is full of unrelatable tone-deaf philistines and there's no one around to talk to about my issues. I've always been distant from my family and I want to move on and change my surname and be my own person. But my Mother refuses to let me leave. I requested to put my name down for a house and seek therapy just so I can talk to someone who's qualified but she's done nothing since.

She'd rather spend her time and money on getaways and luxury while I'm broke and unemployed. She then makes the process of me moving out sound as tedious as possible to discourage me from leaving. I called her out on her behaviour but she pulled the victim card claiming she can do what she wants with her money despite the fact she's been a shit person to me yet claims she has my best interests in mind. Now she seems contempt with letting me rot in her home because she raised me to be codependant, but it's just gonna make things worse.

I just want my own place to mope in so I can feel independent and be my own person. Teach myself animation perhaps, hopefully meet other alternative people to talk about Metal/punk or goth shit or whatever. But it feels like I'm going to die here and I feel both bitter and desperate. My life is like being trapped in a guilded cage.

1734,skepho,1624044027,4,"I’m lonely. Pure and simple and it defines almost everything I’ve ever done. I’ve always felt lonely. Growing up I had so few friends. I was the weird, shy, different kid that everyone avoided. The few friends I did make though were nice and fun but I can’t say that they ever understood me on any significant level. No ones asked about me, to get to know me, to actually just sit down and ask me about who I am or my life. My hopes, my dreams, my joys, my pains. I truly believe that no one truly cares about me. I’ll be 31 soon and I can’t say that I’ve done anything worthwhile in my life. I’ve had a few relationships in the last 13 years, I dropped out of college to join the military. I dropped the military to feel understood, loved, and wanted. All my relationships and friendships ended. I’ve been lied to, cheated on, used, abused, abandoned, ghosted, forgotten and ostracized. And yet they never took the time to actually get to know me. Maybe I’m just so easy to hurt and so people do it. It’s astounding how much damage some people inflict without even meaning to. These days, I cry whenever I see a cute family. New born child and new parents. I cry, because I’m struggling to accept that it’ll never be something I’ll ever have. Even as a step child, I’ve accepted and would love to even be half the dad my step dad is and do the same. But I’m not afforded that honor. No one wants me. No one will have me. No one will even take the time to actually get to know me and still choose to stay. Despite my age, despite the number of people in my life, no one has even told me why I’m to feel this way; to feel lonely, different, ostracized. Why has my life always been an outcast? What is wrong with me? What have I done?Am I ugly within and/or out? Why won’t anyone say? Why must I be alone?  When I look in the mirror, I wonder maybe I am actually mentally ill or handicapped and don’t even realize it. I’ve tried so many things: groups, therapy, spending time with others, activities, just work, online. I even traveled across a continent to just start over, to try something new. I can live a full life alone, but it would still feel so empty if there’s no one to share it with. All I did was change the scenery in coming here. All my life, all I wanted was to feel understood, to be truly wanted for me, and for someone to take a genuine interest in me. I’m asking for too much. It’s all not to be, and I don’t know why. 

I’ll be honest, I sometimes fantasize about getting into car accidents, to be found hanging from my ceiling (probably months later), or running my car in the garage. I wasted a third of my potential life and I don’t want to waste anymore. I’m so, so tired. A life lived alone is a life half lived. Happiness is real when shared.

That makes me angry.
I want to kill myself because it's so painful, being alone. I have distorted thoughts all the time. I don't know if I can trust my perceptions. I have such little communication with people. I can't validate my thoughts so I rely on the internet... And when the internet doesn't help I become my own yes man. It's the only way. There's no one to talk to.
Fuck my psychiatrist. She tries to convince me that I have bipolar disorder even though I've told her multiple times that don't relate to the anecdotes from people with bipolar disorder at all. I get excited for a reason, I get depressed for a reason. I have ADHD. I can be impulsive. I sometimes jump to conclusions but I don't just get happy or depressed for no reason. She tells me it's on a spectrum but my excitement never last for more than 24 hours and as soon as I realize the reality of my situation I return to baseline or get depressed if I've fucked up.

I hate this. I try to do things like workout, eat well, sleep well, etc but it barely helps. There's always a crash.

1746,Red_Phoenix_69,1624038859,1,"In the book ""The way of the superior man""  the author David Deida explains things which can go wrong in a relationship or marriage. It is based in the fact that men and women think differently. Remember Women need love, Men need to be needed.  Example: a couple are living together married or not. They go out shopping and when they get home as the garage door slowly opens the man says something, its a simple absent minded comment to himself and one that is like he is saying what he is thinking out loud. I need to clean up the garage this weekend. (The man has made mistake #1) The woman hears this and it sets an expectation in her mind that he will be cleaning the garage this weekend. She has thoughts of the dirty clothes, shoe tracks on the floor, bringing him a beer or snacks, staying our of his way, not bothering him for a few hours this weekend or helping move something so he can really clean. The weekend comes and the man with good intentions heads out to clean the garage. He soon realizes he is out of power washing fluid. He decides the garage cleaning is a low priority today and he can pickup the fluid on his way home from work during the week. (He made mistake #2) The woman notices the garage did not get cleaned and might ask. He has a valid excuse so ok but that seed is still growing in her mind. The next weekend comes and he has the fluid but his buddy calls to remind him they have the big game on and all of the guys are having a party, so the man commits to going to the party. (His mistake #3). Now the woman is starting to have trust issues, he said he was going to clean the garage, women live in the moment. When she ask him he is a bit agitated and says something like I will get it done, haven't I always done the household chores, I had an important game. (his mistake $4). Now she is nervous to mention it so she waits and watches, that seed is growing, her trust issue is now a devil on her shoulder saying if you can't trust him to do something as simple as cleaning the garage how can you trust him to run your lives. (Women tend to overthink things and that leads to negative thoughts. The book on red pill dating tells guys to be players, they can have 10 women in rotation obsessing over them by using simple physiological tricks. They will date a girl and then ghost her, when she calls or sends a text and says hey I miss you they respond with a curt I miss you too. The woman naturally wants to know if he had a problem with her and may ask more personal questions, did I smell bad down there, and then he knows he can tell her anything he wants like well your blowjob technique sucked lets try it again and she will be eager to do so to prove her worth.) So now two months have gone by and the garage is still a mess and that seed in her mind is ready to bust her skull so she once again says honey are you ever going to clean the garage? He gets angry and says why are you nagging me are you a stupid bitch. Can't you see I have been busy, don't I always do the things I say I will. (His mistake #5). Now she is the bad guy and all of this because he made a comment to himself that she heard. Now she can't find a way to trust him and she starts looking for a man she can trust. He is still thinking his old track record should be proof enough and she is hardwired to live in the moment and be forgiving rather than cling to a piece of history. In the military the Green Berets are trained and only 3 out of 100 pass the test. They are often second language experts and can go to places like Afghanistan and meet with tribal leaders, when they talk they are representing the United States so they have to be very careful of their words and promises. They are trained to never say they are going to do something unless it is their intention to do so now or die trying. Men need to learn to keep their mouth shut, one simple offhanded remark can ruin a relationship. Women need to learn that unless the man is looking them in the eyes to tell them they are going to do something it should be discounted as an offhanded remark. A man should never tell a woman he is going to do something until they are sure they are ready to start the project and all supplies are on hand.

1749,im-an-iron-main,1624034496,2,"I’ve had a great social life off an on for years. Have one childhood best friend that I still talk to on a daily basis, see like 1-2 times a month. We used to be together 24/7, but whenever we had a period where he had a GF or hanging out with other people I would stay home most of the time. Atm he just settled down with his GF and I see him like once or twice a month

I have trouble connecting with people. Maybe I expect too much of them. Expecting a best friend, while just having a beer once or twice a week would be more then fine.

I work security so although I have a lot of great coworkers, my boss expects me to not become best friends with them. (I check their pockets for theft etc). Had a secretary at work (I don’t check them, so can become friends) who I went to get drinks with once, then somewhat became friends with benefit with last week. Found out she is kinda sex addicted an I’m not sure of what her intentions were

Recently started picking up Kickboxing and I’m loving the excercise and getting to be around ppl more.

I’m kind of ashamed that when sharing weekend stories with coworkers I usually don’t have a lot to talk about. I don’t want a huge circle of friends, just people to hang out with when the weathers nice, etc etc…",lonely,How to meet new people? (Title),2021-06-19 02:41:36

Then I found another friend who was also my roomie during 8 months and we were very close. However, in 2020, we came back to our homes (we live in different cities and they're far one from the other). We lost contact due to the distance and some other things. She missed the year because of COVID-19 and now we don't take the same subjects, so we don't even see each other for classes. So now I'm alone, I don't know anybody, and I don't have nobody to work with on teamworks. 

Sometimes I wish my old friends were still my friends, we made a great team working together but they abandoned me and I can't even talk to them to apologize if I did something wrong or ask them why did they left me. Other times I blame this stupid virus for putting away from me my other friend and now I don't know if she still wants to be my friend or she simply got bored of me and she has another friend despite of me (of course she had friends before me, and I'm afraid she forgot me ). By the way, I do have another friend from highschool, and even though we do talk, I just miss her so freaking much and I also miss my highschool years when we were together but we're no longer in the same place and all we have are just the good memories from the past.

I'm really hoping I could get back to college soon, to have REAL classes and see REAL people. But I feel so low, like I don't want to try having friends anymore, it's like a heartbreak. Friendship can break your heart too. And mine is broken, idk if it will fix soon. But now I just feel alone, and I don't want to be hurt anymore, so I'm giving up on friendship.

1768,pinkbubbles03,1624017001,2,"Never look at Instagram stories. I always see friends doing fun stuff out with groups of other friends, and it really fucks me up. I am so grateful for all my online friends, I love them all, but it is impossible for me to meet them irl, and I can't help wishing I want more. Not more as in quantity, more as in - I want to hang out with them, see their face, have a conversation and go somewhere fun. I want to interact with them in the real world. The only friends I have in real life are two girls, I'll call them [A] and [B]. 

[A] has been my friend for fourteen years now, but she is always unavailable. She's always been focused and dedicated to her studies and even work now, and it makes me feel like a lazy-ass failure. I can't care about getting good grades, as I don't have a dream job. Still, I'd *love* to get a simple part-time job and earn my own money, because I get so depressed if I don't feel like I've accomplished something everyday, and I hate feeling lazy - but I have really bad anxiety and I can't find a job suitable for me. Of course it's not [A]'s fault for making me feel this way, but I've always been a bit jealous of her. She literally has the perfect life in my eyes. Loving friends, amazing grades, a supportive family, just overall a normal-looking life to me. I know she is secretly aware that my life is not the same as hers, and I'm so glad she doesn't treat me any different. But it still hurts when I feel like she's above me, that I'm not good enough to be her friend. She's always busy, but a month ago she texted me excitedly saying that she was finishing sixth form soon, and said we had to 'party'. It made me smile - but the first time in nearly a year I get to see her, she cancels. I get it, work's important, but I stupidly click on her Instagram story a few days later, and she's at an amusement park with her school friends, having all the fun I can only dream of having. I feel so lonely. She's going to University soon, so it feels like the end of us. 

[B] is a new friend, and that is exactly the problem. I met her in college, we were both homeschooled for a couple years so we stuck together almost immediately, as we understood each other to a certain degree. She is a happy, bubbly girl, the right energy I needed to feel normal - but I always feel distant when I hang out with her. I feel fake. I make myself laugh along, but truthfully I don't feel like laughing. She doesn't know the real me, she hardly knows anything about me. She goes through a lot of shit like me, but she's gone through worse, so I don't feel like I can vent to her, I don't feel deserving of that. She doesn't even know simple things about me, like hobbies, favourite movies, or anything about my family life. She's a great friend, but I'm being fake, so is our friendship even real?

It's not just making friends I have a problem with, I feel so lonely in my 'love' life too. The only relationships I've had were online, and they were all bad. I let bad people take advantage of me and use me, because I didn't think anyone else could love someone like me. It's my ultimate fear: being unlovable, and this is an easy gateway for toxic people to manipulate me. I always turn away the good guys in fear of it being too good to be true, and I welcome the abusive ones. I just know I'm gonna end up in an abusive relationship irl someday, because I'm weak and stupid. I know when someone is gonna be abusive too, I just purposely let it happen.

1779,Ignatius881,1624005464,1,"Good morning, everyone. I've always been a shy man, and I suffered bullying at school, 27 or 26 years ago. But things didn't go better at high school either. Apart of being shy, I always had an internal idea of respect to girls. While other guys talked about NSFW stuff, I didn't go along with that, and I was the target of their mockery and bullshit. I made friends too, and at that moment I had fun with them: we laughed, we respected each other, we talked about homework, video games, etc. The last time we met each other was 2006. I've never had a girlfriend and I've never kissed a girl either, high school was a pain in my ass due to my good behaviour and my naïvety.

2013. I met my old friends again, and I met their friends too. From 2006 to 2013 I felt alone because I didn't have a girlfriend and I didn't know what love was, but I didn't feel the need of hanging out with friends either. Well, I met this group of friends, and I met my first girlfriend. I was 25 years old. Did I say that high school was a pain in my ass? Then welcome to my personal hell. This girlfriend had a platonic love while she was with me, and she often met other guys who were sordid, asking for sex, even when they knew I was with her. She didn't accepted their offerings, but at the same time she didn't stopped them to not offer those proposals. Until she kissed a guy in front of me. Even worse, those allegedly friends of mine didn't do anything comfort me, even they hanged out with that guy. Other girl from that group knew about my situation, and while my guard was down, she took advantage of it and we become partners. But, afterwards (I don't remember how much time), I discovered that she was a cheater too, with the involvement of those friends to laugh at me and make my life more miserable. I don't hang out with them anymore since last year.

So, I've no real friends since high school and I've never had a real girlfriend in my whole life. With this pandemic I can't have the chance to know people outside Internet and dating online, even in Reddit, is almost impossible because everybody gets tired very quickly of talking with me and nobody wants to get involved in an online relationship even if they ask for it, even if I'm polite, give conversation...

Today’s a new day with renewed hope. 
I just finished a 25 mins call with Dad about What i am feeling and What i think will happen. My old man got nerves of steel, listened to me carefully and gave his perspective of what he learned and experience in his existence. Tho he didn’t understand me entirely but I understood him. 
A loss is one of difficult things to process for me. But it makes me learn a lot too. 
I have been always like this I guess, I understand the value of things once I lose it. But I learn too from the experience how much I value and How much I am valued.

Today’s Quote “ Life is a Journey , You may achieve some, You may lose some, but what matters is one beside you holding your back”

Remember People always stand with you when you are in Good times so they can share the credit of a success but you come to know true nature of anyone once’s bad times start knocking on door. Can’t stop the bad time tho, It’s life . You have to experience and deal with it as it comes.

From this I branched out and formed relationships with other coworkers, and it made work slightly less soul crushing for a few weeks. I was so proud of myself that for the first time in years I made irl friends until a few days ago. Her birthday came around last week and I learned from one of my coworkers she had a party that nearly all of the wait staff and even managers were invited to but me. I feel so worthless. Every time I get close to others it always blows up in my face in time, I don’t understand why. Am I profoundly uninteresting? Does my presence make people uncomfortable? Am I just a loner people placate to feel better about themselves? Why would someone carry on a faux friendship with someone they have no intention of actually engaging with? None of it makes any sense to me. It’s so exhausting constantly feeling rejected.

1807,thebeanburritoo,1623990683,1,"I'm 21 ( M) years old. I live in Cali and I am very close to my oldest sister. I have no real friends and my only best friend kinda ditched our friendship and has stopped texting me. He was my day 1 homie. We both were dealing w depression and took drugs until one day he overdosed, went to rehab, and made a close friend and pretty much stopped talking to me.

My oldest sister is a stripper and the exact opposite of me... she's absolutely beautiful according to other men, she's very outgoing, talkative, and always has men fighting over her/buying her expensive stuff. She has a soft spot for me because we are close but occasionally she is self centered w me and cares more about herself than me. 

I am not an ugly person. At least I don't think I am. I have dealt with low self esteem and for some reason people like to give me a hard time. I have resulted in hiring hookers because of my loneliness. It's embarrassing to admit but yeah. I feel like I come off as a fucking creep and I don't know why. 

Yesterday I was at target and I made eye contact with a chick for like 2 seconds. We were both getting on the stairs and while we were going up she was putting her had behind her butt as if she was trying to hide it from me... I wasn't checking her out first of all and I just felt like a fucking weirdo because of it even tho I know I wasn't being a creep. 

I cry randomly at times... I'll be at the gym w my sister and a massive wave of depression will hit me and I'll fake yawn so it looks like my eyes are glossy because of the yawn and not because I was crying like a bitch. 

I hang out with myself a lot of the time. I usually get in n out and smoke a bowl in my car while watching funny videos. I am happy for like 5 mins but then I feel like I'm lonely again and I start to hate my life. I'm thinking about suicide. I know it's a bitch move. But life isn't for everyone. It's definitely not for me.

1809,Cassie1975,1623990053,1,"So... last year wasn’t so bad for me. Even during quarantine I made a fair amount of friends after starting over and cutting the toxic people from secondary school out of my life. 

I had worked my issues in therapy, I was feeling confident and fresh. I learned to be fine by my own, which was difficult. I was planning to stay in my lane for a while, continuing to explore that aspect of my life during my first year of college. I just wanted to focus on my studies and be alone. Now I’m realising that maybe I hadn’t gotten over that immense fear of abandonment and getting hurt I have always felt. Maybe I was just telling myself I did.

And then a few marvellous people came into my life. And I felt and thought that this time, it might be different. Like I had found my people: the ones I had a lot in common with, that were offering what I needed in a relationship, they all eventually knew about my past and what I needed and... everything fitted perfectly. I started to feel good about my life for once in a long time. I really thought they were meant to stay. 

Everything went crumbling down this year. All the promises went to shit. Like nothing ever happened. And now I’m back at the start. But worse. Because now I’m bitter, overwhelmed and immensely sad. 

I’m blaming myself. I think it’s my problem. But then again I can’t quite put my finger on it. For various reasons.  I had learned better mechanisms in therapy and had genuinely grown a lot so I don’t know what went wrong. 

Maybe my mind is playing with me. It’s just they all faded. And it hurts so bad. I feel irrelevant, invisible, if not visible but utterly ignored. Now I’m not so sure things can get better. And I just want to stay in bed alone forever so I won’t ever get hurt. 

My therapist says I’m just young and finding my path and trying out different things. Like life is testing me. 

But I’m tired of my ephemeral relationships. I’m tired of trying. I just want consistent and long term relationships in my life. But I’m tired of trying and giving my all just to end up hurt.
I feel frustrated and overwhelmed in all areas of my life. I don’t know what to do.",lonely,"Loneliness is feeling overwhelming by this point and I just want to embrace it, stay in my room and shut the world out",2021-06-18 14:20:53
1810,Dimiscas,1623989603,2,"and I haven’t spoken to my best friend in weeks. The title has nothing to do with this - I just lack creativity. Anyway, there was no fight or anything; we just kind of, stopped talking. Life got in the way, I guess. But stepping back and re-evaluating that friendship, it was toxic in many ways. Unbalanced. Maybe this was a good thing.

But that leaves me here. I really liked listening to them talk about their day. And throwing stupid jokes at them. And it was nice having them listen to my stupid stories about how I navigated the world that day. I miss that part.

But I’m 26 now and making friends at this age when you’re basically a hermit is nearly impossible, so that’s fun. 

I’m going on a girls’ trip next weekend with my SIL and her friends. A part of me thinks she invited me out of pity. Another part of me doesn’t care because it’s Colorado and I’ve never been and I know it’s gonna be beautiful even though I might die from the altitude because I’ll go on a hike that’s too much for me too quickly or something like that which also might be fine. A little part of me hopes I can actually make friends with them. I’m a little stressed about it. They’re probably going to think I’m weird.

A good thing about being alone, is not too many people will miss you when you're gone. And I like to keep the amount of sad people to a minimum.

1850,Larryland1968,1623965829,10,"I chose you. Every single moment for six hundred and thirty-three days, I chose to love you. To believe you. To forgive you. To embrace you.
I chose to stand by you even when times got tough and nearly unbearable. Even when I had lost nearly everything and knew I probably should stop. I kept choosing you.
Maybe I thought that you would change. That things would get better. Maybe I just had nobody else and an incredibly low self-esteem. Something that you constantly reminded me. Maybe I just wanted you to fucking choose me back. Just one time. Once.
If I walked away, I had nothing. Except wasted time and a broken-heart. This had to be worth it, I thought to myself. You had to be worth it. I saw something that nobody else saw. I knew you. Right?
But I ignored everything. I dismissed red flags and deal breakers and all the standards I had made for myself. I found myself making up excuses for you, being too understanding. Caving and bending and breaking every step of the way.
In choosing you, I begin to stop choosing me. I stopped choosing the things that I loved, the people that I loved. Choosing you was all-consuming. It took everything inside me to do it. To continue to love you and stick around every single day. I lost myself. And then I started to believe that I didn’t have a choice anymore. Loving you was the only thing I had, and I couldn’t give that up, too.
So I stayed. I stayed much longer than I should and much longer than I wanted. I ignored family and friends telling me to leave, to get out, to choose myself. How could I do that to you? I thought that I was helping you, fixing you. This was my only purpose in the world: choosing you. You had slowly convinced me that I deserved it all. I deserved you and the pain and the choice of choosing somebody who never chooses you back. Nobody would ever choose me, you said. I was lucky.
But today is the day that I stop choosing you.
I delete all the pictures of you from my Facebook. The happy times that never seemed to last. I watched as our smiling faces disappeared, and I cried at how it was possible to both love and hate somebody. There were so many good memories mixed in with the bad. There was so much longing and desire still left, but also so much pain. Unbearable amounts of pain. I never wanted to stop choosing you. Even as I type these words, my heart aches. For you. For us. For you to just finally choose me back. And I wonder how long it will feel like this. I imagine time will dull the discomfort, make life a little more tolerable.
Every day that I stop choosing you, I will start choosing me. I will choose my passions and my photography and my books and my writing. I will choose to remember what I love about myself and perhaps begin to fall in love with life again. Every moment that I don’t choose you, I will get stronger. Happier. Wiser. I will realize that I made the right choice, and I will continue to make it until I find somebody new to choose. Somebody to love me the way that I deserve. The way that I have always deserved but never really knew. The day I stopped choosing you will, one day, be a distant memory. But for now, for the moment, it will be a sad, emotional day that I wish was not happening.

I woke up early, and was checking my phone to see if my best friend would send me a message. It had been nearly a year since she messaged me. I knew she wasn’t going to this time either. She didn’t. At the end of our friendship, I was always reaching out to her. Driving to see her after a long day at work. She stopped caring about me a long time ago. I was lucky enough to reconnect with my childhood best friend. We had such great times together. She’s moved to Texas. Been about a year now. My 2 male friends, one moved to a different part of my state, and the other is building his life with his girlfriend. I had fun with all of them. I was able to cry to them, be stupid with them, love them and be loved by them.

Now I have one person left, my boyfriend. He has other people besides me. He has friends in real life and online. I have no one else. I can’t unload my problems on him. Not everything. Not the things that I wish I could. I’m a boring person. I get scared to talk and make connections because I know they’ll leave too. I’m tired of being so unremarkable and forgettable.

Now my life got flipped firmed, turned upside down, and since I ain’t have no rich uncle in bel-air, me and gf did a Hail Mary back to her neck of the woods, literally.

Few weeks of living in a cesspool we get kicked out and have to live in, well it’s nice, that’s all imma say lol. But guess what!? Guess who left behind everything he knew, loved, and cared for?!!! This idiot!

P4 gamer but one day I’ll evolve to p5, gonna be on Xbox soon so if anyone knows good Xbox games hmu. 

I want a friend group that last forever, so if you’re gonna ghost me, well that’s ok I’m used to it, jk jk don’t waste our time just ignore me if you want something short term.

There's nowhere to meet people anymore

Over my college years I was having issues with my friends and I spent years trying to find a new group of friends.  I volunteered on political campaigns and I tried making friends through class and elsewhere but I was never able to make connections.  Now as an adult I have no opportunities anymore to meet people.  I'm always exhausted from work and when I do have energy I have to throw myself into these horrible situations in which I make myself vulnerable to complete strangers to try and reach out to them and at best I get the kind of silence that says, ""go away, why are you bothering us?"".  There is no public social space where you get to see anyone more than the one time you run into them in public, or rather there's no location where the people there are consistent enough to cultivate friendships.  The only options are these stochastic one-off attempts and they are fucking god-awful.  At best I feel like I'm putting a ton of emotional effort in to get none of the emotional benefit out, I rarely even get to make acquaintances and when I do it's always with people I don't enjoy being around.

I recently moved to a new apartment to get out of an expensive month to month lease and I did the whole thing by myself.  I spent so much of my vacation time just running myself ragged to get everything out on time and I just kept crying over and over again because there was nobody who could help me.

I'm incredibly sad all the time.  I'm drinking too much because there's nothing else for me to do with my time.  I feel like I have no future anymore and that the only way to make friends is to already have friends.",lonely,Why is there nowhere to meet people?,2021-06-17 16:05:20

I can only hope that I can either continue with my friendships later or form new ones somewhere else. I do also wish to explore romantic relationships but have no experience in actually having one.

I was an introvert, but I have been talking to a lot more people this year, going out to social gatherings, parties, etc. I had stage fright, weight issues, wardrobe issues, etc and right now I'm doing pretty well. I used to get anxiety attacks once or twice a week, but by God's grace, I've not gotten an attack since December, just the usual anxiety here and there throughout the day. 

A few days ago, I was parking my Dad's car and I hit someone's bike. So the next day my Dad asked me to apologize to the owner of the bike. I was not willing to do so because the owner is that guy who used to sexually assault me when I was between the ages of 8-10. Since that recent incident, I've finally understood why I never had a girlfriend, a gang/gangs of friends, why I always become awkward in a room full of people and why I am so self critical of myself as well as underestimate myself. Life has went downhill after the age of 7. Sometimes I feel as if I can't understand my own thoughts and emotions, as well as others, and end up treating them the way they never deserved to be treated and it makes me feel terrible.

So I have been lonely all my life, a rough childhood, no Friend, family issues at its peak, Not academically strong, have to struggle to reach expectations, Money issues when i was in school (peer pressure to get fancy pc),social anxiety to meet my friends and lastly DEPRESSED about everything in life.

Somehow with help of parents I managed to survive years which I thought couldn’t survive. Tho I still feel am depressed and things bother me but  months away to be a doctor, have a plan to reach my ambition, working hard to ace my exams compared to last exams. I know what I want in life and I also know What i need to do to achieve it and have got complete support of parents now. (That’s another long story).

So, Coming to the point I have decided to post here quite often about how i feel and get a fresh perspective of things around me. 

My Today’s Quote
“ We all have to learn from our mistakes , If you still didn’t understand from your mistakes, You are Blunder Master”. 

So learn from your Life Experience, talk with someone you trust and get their perspective, half of your things will be solved once you know what is the problem.

About 4-5 months ago I joined the US army. Thinking this would change my life for the better, I was definitely mistaken. 
I had passed boot camp with little to none what I would call ""somewhat friends"". Nobody really liked me, I was sorta an outcast because of my nerdy kind of personality. Being picked on wasn't much of a deal, I dealt with it all throughout high-school pretty much.
I'm now in my AIT part of army training where i start to do my individual job training. Everything was going smoothly  until I got hurt, my legs and hip had sustained stress fractures all up and down. 
Turns out I was diagnosed with osteopenia, a disease where my bones are more porous than normal. This causes them to fracture and eventually break later, and to add salt to the wound, by the time I'm in my 50's I'd have osteoporosis. I mind you, I'm only 19! So now I'm stuck in a room all by myself with nobody to talk too! I can't even go out of my room to go out on weekend pass!
Doctors said I'm being sent home and im not even sure I'm going to get compensation for my injury! I was pretty healthy before I joined and have the paper work  to prove it as well. Hell, I even played soccer (I was okay at it.)
Now to make matters even worse is that im really homesick too! I really miss my mom, step father, and little  brother who will soon be in my footsteps! It's such a stressful time for me.

1941,curryforkappa,1623897877,1,"Ok this is gonna be long so i apologize in advance. 

This friend lets call E. We met three years ago in 7th grade. They were moving to a new school and i was going through some really rough times and we helped each other out. They helped me through the time where my depression was at its worse and gave me a reason to go to school. 

Well fast forward to 8th grade we get to high school (the high school we went to  has 8th grade). I come out as trans male and theres this other person we’ll call A. A was in band along with me and E. For some reason A had an off and on friendship with me and would tell E rumors about me and judge that i was trans (saying i really wasnt). E and i were on and off then but got distant because of that and some other things. I helped them out with a panic attack and a band competition, but there was also a time where i didnt realize they were having a panic attack and i invited someone to come sit with us which made things worse for them. 

A convinced E to stop talking to me and we went the rest of the year like that. 

Early 9th grade year i message them and we worked out what was wrong and the misunderstandings. We both agreed that we were really shitty as 8th graders and that we’d be friends again. We got really close and they were there when my mom passed away. 

Things were going good until the second half of the year. They slowly stopped talking to me and invited this person they previously said they disliked to sit with us at lunch. When i would tru and talk to them they’d give the bare minimum as a response then blocked me on all social media a few weeks later. 

They continued to ignore me and kept talking to the person. They would act like i didnt exist. Today we were at practice for band and they were exiting the same time as me. I held the door open for the person i was riding home with and them but they went to the other set of doors and left that way.

I don’t know, anyway, was out there. I had seen a lot of these kids the year before, was even friends with some of them. This is where the great part came in, literally nobody wanted to talk to me. When I talked to someone it wouldn’t last longer then like…thirteen seconds, at the most.

There was this one guy I used to be friends with, he looked at me for a few seconds, we couldn’t really talk because there was a line or whatever. I walked up to him later, said hi, ignored me. Anyone I talked to was kind of just disinterested or didn’t even recognize me. Now, I don’t want to make it a “oh boo hoo me” thing but damn, I kind of wanted to cry or something, and I’d honestly rather lose one of my fingers then have everyone see me cry, maybe just my whole nail or something if it’s one person’s. Because there’s probably some way to replace that, but the embarrassments would haunt me. 

Anyway, I’m kind of worried. It’s like, seeing people smiling and shit, happy to see each other, it kind of made me mad. Like, I know that’s wrong, but is it normal to? Because the older I get, the more “I can’t stand anyone” I feel, and that’s pretty scary. I dunno, maybe some Reddit warrior can tell me I’m a bad person or make fun of me, I can get the nice old no replies, that’s fine to. Kind of needed to reflect anyway, writing helps.

1950,dairydisaster,1623894537,6,"Let's get this straight, I have autism, adhd, and a disease that affects my ability to eat I never really had any close freinds especially in real life. I was bullied a lot as a kid which really unleashed a creative side where I drew or studied endlessly to pass the time. 

I get attached easily to animals, inanimate objects such as cars and other machines, locations, and ideas. It's very difficult for me to really form any meaningful connections which I will not deny my role in this. I struggle immensely with eye contact and have off-putting body language because im simply not used to being around others these days. I don't have any real easy to discuss or consistent interests, I play games sometimes but its all more casual singleplayer stuff on the switch. I don't really watch a lot of shows because it's very difficult for me to sit through a show or movie but youtube videos and manga are much easier for me to consume. In social spaces my thoughts kinda go out the window and I can seem like an airhead. I also have issues with executive dysfunction and appearing dull and lazy. I require a decent amount of space from others after interacting with them

I spent a lot of time trying to ""build my own world"" I am fairly accomplished for my age, and I spend a lot of time thinking and imagining scenarios. I have a few fictional stories I made up that I replay over and over in my brain. I got into occultism so researching magic and doing magical work consumes my time as well. 

As for relationships, I always hoped I would get married someday but I feel like im too difficult to understand, and it seems like these days attraction to others is something that is quite rare for me. Once there was a guy I met that I felt was a type of soulmate, which I'm pretty sure he still is but his family didn't approve and he walked away. I work to focus on loving myself to keep this pain at bay, I also fear sometimes that other people will be able to easily take advantage of me due to my accomplishments if I date them. Everyone but him I guess, but that's probably wishful thinking at best

To vent for a little bit, I recently moved from my hometown in chicago to a town in the mountains in North Carolina with my boyfriend and his friend. The idea in moving here was that the rent is super cheap, and we’d be by nature, it was supposed to be a good opportunity to finally move out of our parents places. But when we got here, my boyfriend and his friend said that they didn’t really like it and they’ll want to move someplace new without me after our 6 month lease is over. So I have 4 months left with my boyfriend, and am just preparing to be alone out here. I haven’t made any friends out here yet because I honestly don’t really know how: my boyfriend and his friend are always skateboarding, and are frequently too tired from that to do anything else fun with me. I’ve just been smoking a ton of weed, cleaning and cooking and playing league. My boyfriend is great but he can only do so much, him and my roommate are in New York for the week and this is my first time being completely alone, no pets nothing. I don’t know a soul for 100’a of miles. I honestly prefer chicago to here and miss the city so much. I would move back in with my parents after me and my boyfriend break up in 4 months because I have a ton of people I could reach out to over there but because my parents thought I would like it out here, they are  selling the house I grew up in and moving to a different place in North Carolina to take care of my Grandmom until she dies. I was always a pretty lonely person, but it was comfortable because I had my pets as well as random people from highschool to hang out with whenever I got too lonely. I also had my childhood home, and the city. It was easy to be comfortably alone. Now I don’t know anyone or anything that I can count on to be in my life after these 4 months. I used to be really involved in discord’s and have a good online social life but it all died down when my friends went to college and didn’t take their Pc’s.

I have an Instagram friend who literally has had like 7 dates in 10 or 11 days with the same guy. No one has ever even tried to see me two days in a row. I’m anxiously attached and I think I tend to attract avoidant types, so maybe it’s not surprising, no matter how much we click, that no one is making it very obvious how into me they am by trying to see me on consecutive days. 

I try not to be bitter or jealous because I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, or even if the relationships I see are healthy and happy, just what they seem to be outwardly, and I’m very open about emotions and struggles with dating, whereas others may be more reserved. 

I just don’t know how to stop being resentful of those who seem to always have options for dates, or who jump from relationship to relationship, when I can’t even find someone I connect with who wants what I do, and wants it with me.  I guess I feel kind of sorry for myself.

And live my little life

Eat my little meals

Miss my little kid and wife



And somewhere, maybe someday

Maybe somewhere far away

I’ll find a second little person

Who will look at me and say:

I know you

You're the one I've waited for

Let’s have some fun



Life is precious, every minute

And more precious with you in it

So let's have some fun



We'll take a road trip

Way out west

You're the one I like the best

I'm glad I found you

I like hangin' 'round you

You're the one I like the best

Because of it, I was always anxious and depressed as kid and and also as a teenager. I always used to think that there is something wrong with me and the world because everytime I'd come back from school something bad would happen.This constant paranoia and anxiety have been stuck with me since then. Everyone in school always used to think I'm a weirdo but I was just really quiet because as a kid I was stuck home, being scared every day of my father so I never had a chance to connect with people and when I tried to talk with others I'd just get feelings like I fucked up something and I'd get into depressive spirals. This fear or irrational paranoia about others makes me unable to enjoy moments, have a proper connection and conversation with others. I've been anxious and scared all my life(I'm 22 now). But I know there's nothing to be afraid of. The childhood is a history but I still feel some scary leftovers are there.

I've been constantly making bad choices and I disappointed many people and messed up many opportunities only because I was paranoid about myself, that there is something wrong with me. 

But I was always alone. And I'm getting tired of everything. I always wanted to feel love or deep connection with anybody.

But everything I tried, I failed. It failed because of me. I failed my life. I'm the one to blame 

I honestly don't know how long I can live like this.. I don't remember a time when I would feel good..

I just... Live my life thinking that there is something really wrong with me and I'm scared of it.. only because I experienced massive fears for 10 years since I was born.. I know it's irrational but... I can't get over it, it feels like if I let the trauma flow I'd just cry and cry and cry.. it feels like I'm hiding it and I don't wanna let it go because I'd just break down or something

For six months I cried every day, every single day

I had University exams 4 months after the breakup and I would read my books through blurry eyes as my tears fell on the pages.
I went for therapy, I did everything people suggested that I should do to get over him. But i can't. I missed him, felt angry at him, bad mouthed him with my friends and acted like the victim. But today, I got drunk and made out with a girl friend and I realised that I was toxic
I used to judge him for having casual makeouts before he knew me, but then I am no better
I have started sexting with strangers and makeout with my friend.
I used to judge him for being into casual stuff but I myself have turned to it now.

I used to be so jealous of his crushes and exes
I used to rely on him for all my self esteem and would start crying whenever he said anything slightly out of line
I know he was a dumbass too, who did stupid shit that hurt me
But I was a parasite
A girl brought up in a troubled house, body shamed, bullied in school, friendless and living with an emotionally and verbally abusive mother. 

I made him my refuge and expected him to be an angel, but he was just a guy, a troubled person like me.
I see so many posts and videos talking about the classic ""jealous possessive and emotionally dependent toxic guy"" and I realised, that even though I attributed these characteristics to him, I am actually the toxic one 

I loved him a lot, even he cried and said that as he dumped me, that my love was amazing, and I never made him feel unloved, but I angered him and irritated him to the point where the greatness of my love couldn't compensate
And even though his memories have started to fade and
The love I feel for him is lessening

But the guilt of ruining a good relationship with body image issues, insecurity and emotional dependency is eating me up on the inside

I am sorry *******
He's a busy man, with a start-up to work on
He most probably won't see this

My inbox will always be open.

Much love!!

2030,possiblyenhance47,1623849575,25,"I had a beautiful girlfriend who I dated for four years. Our love story started unexpectedly. I would even say funny. We met at a café, and I accidentally hit her with the door. At that moment, my girlfriend nor I could have thought that we would fall in love. 

Our friends often asked us how we managed to maintain a perfect relationship. I've always believed that everything is due to patience and mutual understanding. My girlfriend and I never quarreled in public. If we had any disagreements, we waited until we were alone to talk it out. We were a perfect match in absolutely everything, even in bed. I've never experienced such mind-blowing sex with anyone but her. It was like she was reading my mind and doing exactly what I wanted.

All this beautiful idyll shattered because of my treason. I was terribly drunk and cheated on my girlfriend with a random girl at a friend's party. I'm not trying to justify what I did, and I realize that I could've stayed home with her that night and not gone to the party. 

A year had passed since our separation, and I was already used to waking up without her breakfast, kisses, and morning sex, but not my instincts. I used to try to forget her and sleep with girls I met in clubs, but it didn't fill the void in my soul.

When I decided to stop this lifestyle, I started using sex toys. My favorite toy for a while was pocket pussy, but that wasn't enough for me because I missed the touch of her body. 

I told my friend how I felt, and he told me about his breakup and how he handled it. Unlike me, he immediately bought a sex doll. He found one similar to his ex and just hid her in the closet out of sight so that no one would think that he's a creep. 

To be honest, I have heard about these dolls many times, but I never thought that I'd be willing to give it a try. Has anyone here used a doll like that? Is it really close to reality? I want to try one because I'm tired of being lonely, but it's not cheap, and I want to make sure it'll feel great.",lonely,How do you deal with the lack of a sexual partner?,2021-06-16 23:19:35

As soon as the term was over I'd never hear from them again. 

In part time jobs, I've realised that in the past I'd just make acquaintances. Sometimes we'd eat out after work. But we never really grew close. Usually they'd already have lives and friend groups outside of work. Meanwhile there's me- a loser with 0 friends. 

I even tried joining clubs in college to no avail. I paid for this girl's food and she never paid me back. Lol.

But then I gave it a minute and really listened to it and suddenly I was reenacting what was going on in the video. I pressed my comfiest pillow behind me and placed a blanket over me.

2060,GuitarWarm,1623824337,3,"I apologize in advance if this is scattered but hopefully it will make sense. I live alone in a studio apartment. My entire family and everyone I knew for the first 18 years of my life live across the country. I moved to this state for college about 5 years ago. I made some genuine connections and friendships with people in college. In 2018 I got into a long term relationship that ended up being very toxic. I choose to end the relationship in December of 2020. Which is why I’m living alone now (for the first time in my life). Many of my friends i had here either moved out of state after graduation or I just lost touch with through the course of my relationship. So I really don’t have many genuine friendships here or people I see on a regular basis. I rarely talk to my family or any of my close friends that live in my hometown. I have a hard time becoming comfortable with people because of my social anxiety but I’m realizing how much I crave genuine connections with others. I feel so painfully alone. I spend 90% of my time alone at my apartment (I work from home as well) and it’s hard seeing others my age settling down with partners or hearing people talk about how close they are with there family. Sometimes I wonder if it would be better to just be with my extremely toxic (and somewhat abusive) ex boyfriend because it feels better and more comfortable than being alone. I think we romanticize being so independent but I want nothing more than to feel loved. I don’t think humans are meant to spend this much time in isolation and I feel like spending this much time alone is really fucking with my sense of identity. I also struggle with depersonalization and spending this much time alone really has made my depersonalization much worse. 

There are a few people in my life that I feel like I could put more effort into so that we have a closer friendship... but for some reason it’s such a struggle for me to put in the effort to get to that level. 

I know this is a temporary feeling and I don’t constant feel in as much pain as I do right now but damn going through life alone is so hard.

2061,nooneknowsmeherehaha,1623823917,9,"It just feels so isolating. I’ll be doing my own thing, school or talking to friends, then I’ll be hit with the fact that I’ve never had anyone to call mine. In high school I didn’t care, I just wanted friends and was way too insecure to try to pursue, but now that I have a decent amount of friends I’ve been feeling lonely romantically. 
 
I blame my looks but I think rationally I don’t think it’s entirely the case. I’ve missed out on life in general because of my anxiety. I never talked to anyone in school, I am honestly lucky I made like 2 friends. I also went to an all girls high school, then covid hit. I went to public school for ONE year and made some guy friends but I was still the shy girl that never talked in class. I also lost my best friend that year, it was horrible. But anyways, I think that’s probably why, but regardless I feel incredibly ugly and undesirable. Guys say I’m attractive, strangers compliment me occasionally, but it doesn’t feel that way because my lack of experience. I find it hard to actually imagine I won’t be alone forever, or if It does happen it won’t be until years from now.

I’ve actually developed BDD from this(was diagnosed), and I managed to brainwash myself for about a year that looks are everything but I’m getting better. I’ve realized it’s not entirely true, but being isolated does fuck up your mindset. 

The only guy I had mutual attraction with is a very nice caring guy, but it won’t lead anywhere because we live in different states now. 

Next semester I’ll have a few classes in person, I’ll be lucky if I even make a few friends. Worst comes I’ll download tinder or something, but I don’t want to because I know guys there just want hookups and only go for the pretty girls, I also don’t like the idea of posting my pictures online, idk.

16 months we’ve been under some type of restrictions where I live due to the pandemic. Last summer things weren’t so tight and even then no one messaged me, let alone asked me to hang out. I had a large group of ‘friends’ from university and we had just graduated in 2019. So this may be just a result of drifting apart from uni friends. Just some examples of why I feel this way: My last living grandparent passed away earlier this year and I didn’t get any condolences from any friends of mine. I know some people saw as I was tagged in an obituary on FB. A few weeks later, one of my ‘friends’ also lost a grandparent and the group managed to organize a card to sign and send him condolences. They’ve all been hanging out (despite restrictions saying not to) and not one even sent me a birthday message (it was a special, champagne birthday for me too). 

These people haven’t acted like friends for 16 months. Please change my view that these people deserve another chance or a message from me to hang out once all restrictions on socializing are lifted.

While I think giving comforting words like ""it will get better"" can be a good thing, does it really help to hear that in your situation? What if you're in a setting where you know it's not going to get better? Many of you are probably adults, or in areas where nothing will change randomly. Let's say you're living on your own, with little to no friends. How is life going to start looking up? Those words fall flat in moments like that, in my opinion.

What if you could find a friend or five? What about a boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you have one? Do you want one? What are you doing to work towards the goal of finding someone? Have you gone outside lately? Does it suck to get out of bed? How often do you speak to people in general? Let's get you a little bit closer to happiness! :) Here at Lonely Gang incorporated... *proceeds to shamelessly plug further*

 Just kidding on that last part. I'm really just here trying to find like-minded people to be friends with. And I don't mind helping friends! Well, I won't buy you things... But I can lend a voice :P 

Heck, I just spent an earlier part of my day in a discord voice channel helping out an awesome dude. Made a little goal list and everything for him to possibly find a girlfriend. Lots of people joined the voice channel and texted in chat while I spoke. I think I spent like five hours talking lol. Where am I going with this? Uhmm... Wanna join a discord/be my friend? I'll totally talk with you, and help you with problems! That's all 👀

A thing I may not have mentioned is...

There are multiple things I hate about myself right now.
I struggle with emotions and think I have a ever increasing social anxiety. Also I fear groups of people and can't stand up for myself (low self-esteem).
While the gyms where closed I gained easily 10kg of fat and lost a good chunk of muscle.
Ofc I could have exercised outside but I don't enjoy jogging and my bike got stolen shortly before.
Now I am not really anticipating the opening of gyms and lost all motivation.
I also never was in a relationship and have no female friends.
Which resulted in a lot of people think/thought I was asexual. Lol
Wasted my youth playing video games.
Unhappy with my looks and think I am boring.
I think I should have never started to go to university.
Don't enjoy it and also fear working will get even more depressing. But as I am almost finished i should just endure the rest.
If I compare myself to others in my age group, I feel behind in almost all aspects of life.
Overall I feel defeated and I am not sure if companionship would solve any of it.

2072,NextRepresentative17,1623820564,2,What’s the point in becoming friends with someone to go back to being strangers. What’s the point in faking to fuck with someone if you don’t really fuck with them. What’s the point in holding stuff in just to for an argument then spill the beans. What’s the point in playing with someone’s feelings if you know you don’t feel the same way. What’s the point in doing something for someone just to bring it up. What’s the point in smiling and being kind to someone face to face then talking bad behind they’re back. Throughout my 18 years of living this is what I’ve witnessed this is what I seen people do and with that being said this is why I’m a proud loner. Yes it can get lonely. Yea sometimes I get sad but I rather kick it with myself then be around people who don’t fuck with me the same way I fuck with them or don’t really like me or I have to force my self to hang out with them. They say everyone has a purpose in your life and once they complete that purpose then they leave I’ve learned to accept that but I also learned to accept that I came into this world alone and I’ll die alone. But I also know when it’s time for someone to meet a person it’s gonna happen. Keep your head up my friends stay strong better days are coming its hard for me to even say that I feel like shit most of these days but one day things will be different and you’ll be glad you stayed alive and didn’t end it or maybe you’ll be happy with who your around.

I know the feeling of wanting and pining for someone, but I don’t know the feeling of safety and comfort that you get from an SO. I’ve never really dated, I’ve had one girlfriend and we only dated briefly and ultimately she left me for someone else which totally shattered me mentally. Every girl since then that I’ve gotten intimate with was only for less than a week or two at most. It’s hard for me to date, I don’t know how to talk to girls, and I’m not exactly a top shelf guy (yk what everyone wants). I used to be confident with who I was, which was a big guy (280lbs), but you’d think that when I lost the weight(210lbs) I’d feel more confident in who I am and more happy, but I feel worse than before. I’m always in a panic, and my anxiety has gotten to the point where I won’t talk to anyone unless someone needs something from me. I suffer from body dysmorphia and it makes things even worse.

There’s this girl, I’ve known since I was in high school, she was a grade of ahead of me and was so beautiful. I never felt like this for someone before, and she was funny and so kind. I’m not sure what loving someone feels like but I feel like what i feel for her is the closest thing to it.  I have her on ig and here and there I try to text her if it’s convenient without being weird or anything, and she seems to enjoy talking to me n all, I want to talk and hang out with her, and she said we should, but I don’t deserve to be around someone as beautiful and amazing as her. She graduated university today, so I reached out and congratulated her, she answered  immediately  thanking me and it gave me butterflies. I want her, I want to take her out, date her, be with her, but I’m afraid of shattering this image of her that I made of her in my head. Im not worth her time. I dropped out of college, I work full time as a wine distributor, but I’ve got nothing else going on for me. She deserves better and I know that that’s why I’m afraid to take her up on hanging out.

So, I'm gonna be 20 pretty soon, I'm in my 3rd year of college and I've been pretty lonely since I can remember, I never even kissed anyone yet, for example, partly because I'm shy and an introvert, but partly also cause I have a little physical disability and I guess that scares people away for some reason, even if I can function pretty normally( there are some minor limitations, obviously)  I never been liked by someone and I never really had any close friends, mostly I just take care of my college responsabilities, scroll trough twitter and watch stuff to pass the time, I watch a lot of sports, shows, movies, etc, those are my days in a loop, I feel like every interaction I have is superficial, like, people will talk to me if they absolutely have to, for like college stuff, like a group project or something  and that's tough to deal with sometimes, tonight is one of those times (that's why I'm here, duh) I just want to experience some things, like a relationship, for example, I feel like I'm a pretty nice person tbh, I feel like I'd be a good partner, not to sound cocky but I think I'm pretty sweet and I like my sense of humor too, unfortunately people don't even give me a shot, they don't even get close enough to see that. I'm not the perfect man by any means, no one is, but still, I've seen even the most horrible people find someone that likes them, I'm convinced that the reason I'm labeled as ""undateable"" is in fact, my disability,(Don't take this as me playing victim for symphaty, pls) I guess from the moment a woman sees me they think they'd have to be a nurse or something, wich is absolutely not true, but I assume that's the reason no one even tries to get close to me, maybe it's for the best, I don't want anyone to feel like I'm a burden to them, I'm close to accepting the idea that I'm just gonna be alone, maybe that's the one aspect of my life that can't be normal... I mean, I won't die just cause I went my whole life without a relationship and/or physical contact, right? I'll survive lol Anyways, my writing is usually a lot better, I'm all over the here, my bad haha just feeling a little down tonight and needed to vent l, I guess, don't even expect anyone to read this cause I wrote a fucking book here, but if you took a few minutes and made it this far trough all my rambling, thank you :)",lonely,Venting,2021-06-16 13:02:49

2096,PistachioOrphan,1623809880,3,"obviously that’s fucking impossible, but, gotta put a title.

I was roped into a group chat of 4 including me. None of them are my “friends”. I don’t even know how to define that word. So I muted it, instead of being dramatic and leaving altogether. It’s not just an over-active default mode network here; it’s called “social awareness”.

And it’s that much more painful.

Then I got my brother, who, along with that other group, I’ve totally opened up to with my problems, since I have no one else to do so to fparents wouldn’t understand, and I have no other friends). And he has a little empathy, as a brother would, but that’s about it. Doesn’t seem to understand.

I’ve scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, earliest I could get is the first of next month. But they may say “fuck off, you don’t struggle with mental health issues, you only had a speech impediment and you’re unable to adapt to its absense in tandem to your desire to escape your loneliness. That’s a you problem, not a mental thing. Tired all the time? Take more melatonin, maybe 10 mg isn’t enough. Unfocused? Try focusing. Lonely? Suck it up.”

Of fuckignncourse they won’t say that. I’m stupid, but not that dumb. But I am anxious that they won’t diagnose me with anything, when I’m convinced I should be. Or I hope to be, because I’m tired of facing the failure of improving myself on my own. Suicide isn’t an option, as much as I wish it was.

2099,loudcentral1,1623809463,2,"Hello,

A little background; I (25|M) have been experiencing some patterns which I had not before Covid lockdowns. I am/was very social(ex college athlete and fraternity member). I was usually spending 4 days of the week going out like bars, clubs, friends’ houses etc. I had serious relationships developed in normal timelines(taking my time to start developing feelings) and they were healthy, cause my mind was healthy. Also I had way more women around me which I also could have fun(one nights). 

Now with Covid, I developed this pattern that I start catching feelings to certain women when I start to see/ go on couple of dates with (feelings starting in a month of meeting which never happened before). Like obsession, like filling some part of my loneliness. Although I still go on out dates with other women (2-3 dates a week), every other month I find myself feeling something about a woman in that pool of candidates. Of course not all of them work out so it affects me very badly. Like my job, social life and overall mood… Until I catch feelings for the next woman.

To give an example I had my fourth date with this woman and we decided that it is not going to work(she decided actually). And since, I have been feeling terrible, don’t even want to leave my bed.

I genuinely think I cannot have a good life having this pattern. I talk to my friends/family about it and although they are always supportive, I cannot rely on calling them all the time when I feel so depressed.

Could you please give me some advices on how to solve this pattern? Should I talk to a therapist? I want to be the person who I was before covid lockdowns. Is this normal?

Thank you in advance.",lonely,Covid Loneliness,2021-06-16 12:11:03

A couple of months ago my phone was lost for 2 months (It was new so I still had the SIM card in my old phone) and I didn't feel like talking to anyone or open my accounts so, I disappeared for 2 months without telling anyone and no one like NO ONE texted or called untill I got a new one signed in and saw the big beautiful 0 in my DMs. Anyway since then whenever I have no energy for people I log out for a week or so and guess what, no one cares I know that no one has to but it kinda hurts knowing that should I just cut my relationship with the people I know or just keep on going on and off (PS.

I know this isn't really a permanent solution but more of a temporary one, one that I use often but I don't have much else I can do.

I've been missing a lot of things recently and I just really don't know how to cope with it, replacing just isn't an option anymore, I don't have it in me anymore to do that.

Distracting myself has been too difficult to do and not very effective either.

There's just a lot going on and I don't know how to deal with it, it's not like I'm new to these kind of things but this severity, frequency and quantity I am.

I can always hope for things to improve in a way that'll stick around but that hasn't done much to help before.

I feel like I fantasize too often, thinking of a better and an unachievable life through various scenarios that would never happen. It's probably not healthy.

I'm not ready for all this change, I haven't been ready for any of the change that's taken place already.

I really don't feel understood either but I can easily blame myself for that.

2111,Weak_Issue2472,1623804437,1,"Title kinda explains it but…I’m adding a bit of context..I was struggling a lot with an eating disorder and got taken out of my school back in 2017. I got sent to a mental hospital in Ohio. I didn’t have a lot of friends to begin with but me leaving the school made me even more isolated. I didn’t have school for a few months and then finally enrolled to Ohio virtual academy. If you’ve never been to this school, let me sun it up for you. All the teachers are republican, sexist, homophobic, racist assholes. They turn off the chat and don’t let you share social media so there’s virtually no way to communicate with others like I used to at my old brick and mortar school. I was getting worse and worse and more impulsive and suicidal. A few months later, school ended and I wasn’t hanging out with anybody (everyone judged me and I was very isolated). My parents noticed my isolation and how I was struggling and they decided to send me to a group home in Ohio. You weren’t aloud to talk much, swear, share things about yourself, exchange social media’s, or be less than three feet distance of staff members and residents. The group home was terrible for many reasons that I’m not really going to get into. After lion there for about three months, myself and three other residents came up with a plan to run away from the facility. One of us would leave a door cracked open and we would all run out the door at 11:15 PM. Long story short, the four of us got caught by the 12 after being “runaways” for a while. I had to go to Portgage county jail for a while and then got sent back to the group home. Sooo.. I’m at the group home for about a total of a year. I get discharged when the coronavirus first appeared. I’m all happy and free and thinking I’ll be able to make new friends and hang out with them. But guess what happens? Guess what fucking happens? Quarantine. To this day, I’m basically still in quarantine and have no friends and no hope or freedom.

2112,Clark-Kent-Throwaway,1623804264,2,"Rant.

I moved back home after finishing my first semester of college. I will spare the details but I developed severe depression episodes and an ongoing attitude of cynicism and loneliness. Shit honestly has been terrible mentally and it even has destroyed my hobby of playing video-games as I get too depressed to even turn my xbox on.

However, two weeks ago I was living it up. Seemingly a massive break in the near 8 year long streak of having no friends or hanging out with anyone, I hung out with an abstinence from high school for the first time ever, as in the first time I ever visited a classmate outside of school. It felt visceral, and we had a great time talking about everything from Titianfall 2 to how stupid high school was. Same week straight up went out with my high school crush and got to make out with her. Like shit was getting crazy, it sounds like a cringey middle schooler describing such but this really happened, I was getting the social experience I always dreamed of.

Then nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Left on read and ghosted by both parties and now I am back to nothing. Only now being alone and doing nothing feels terrible as I felt so much more alive and being young. This shit is agonizing, I feel like a complete pathetic waste. I can't be happy with anything anymore.

I guess I missed the email sending out the news, because I literally just saw it a few hours ago. Before I continue, I should just restate: IT WAS MY FAULT THAT I MISSED IT.

I also have a couple of decent friends (or acquaintances) in said study hall, but they just straight up left for it without me. I assumed they had a another reason for signing out, such as doing something for another class, but now it's obvious they were leaving for it. But what really shocked me was that no one asked me to come. Again, it was my fault for missing the message, but I'm a bit surprised that literally no one bothered to tell me.

Sorry, this might sound petty, but it kind of made me feel left out. Instead of spending time outside and talking, I literally stayed in an almost empty auditorium with some weird sophomores, ate my shitty prepackaged lunch provided by the school, and was alone for more than an hour. Again, I feel stupid for missing it, but I feel a bit left out.",lonely,I felt so left out today,2021-06-16 07:50:21
2135,littlebroth,1623793368,3,"Hey guys,
this post is not about lonliness, but i feel a bit lonley and want to share this with you guys. this story is old, but I want to tell you, bc it still bugs me sometimes. Its going to be very long... I had this one friend, who took his girlfriend, where ever we met. It wasnt a problem at all for the rest of our boygroup. I started to talk with her more. I enjoyed talking to her, we had some things in common. She got closer to our friends and we started to do more things together like DnD and going out. One day, my friend, who was still with her, confessed me, that the relationship isnt going well and he was thinking about breaking up with her although he still loved her. I talked to him and said, you cant do that. You are fitting well together. I tried to convince him to work it out with her. He, then, told me, that I and her, we would fit better together, bc he saw how well we talked together. I was shocked, that he thought this. After that talk, they broke up. After that, I made my FIRST BIG MISTAKE. I talked to her, bc i was eager to find out, why they broke up, what the reasons were, but also, bc she was one of my friends at this time now. In short, they didnt communicate well and just sucked up the problems. I said to her, that this is destined to fail, when you wouldnt open up and talk. We had a lot of meetings and talked a lot. looking back, I would say, we also had some ""dates"". On the other hand, my friend was mentally destroyed and I tried to comfort him. He always said to me, that he wouldnt mind, when we got together, but he still loved her. Time passed and I liked her more than just a friend, but bc I couldnt step on the feelings of my friend and I knew that she wasnt over him, I took it very slowly. For me, it was very important, that they clear the mess before, I start something new with her. And I was right, bc they met few times and had a big argument. Later, in one conversation with her, when we talked about her past relationship, I said to her, that I think, you (my friend and her) would fit together, but just failed to communicate, maybe you should try again. I know BIG MISTAKE. After that, time passed, and one day again, my friend said, he still has feelings for her and she confuses him, bc they met one more time and had sex together. At that point, I was also confused, bc she told me, she didnt want to get back to him due to the whole mess and problems. But I shrugged it off. Fast forward, few months later, I had strong feelings for her and I thought, I should do a step now, I couldnt wait any longer. One night, when we cooked together, after diner, she told me, she is dating him again, bc she realized, he had traits others dont have. I was shocked, but I told her, that I m happy for her decision. After I processed this shock, I talked to her again. I confessed her, that I had feelings for her, that I was a sad, it didnt work out with us. She told me, she also had feelings for me, but she thought, it wouldnt go well, bc the ex would be always there. We talked and I said that I needed time to rearrange my feelings, she agreed and said, that she would like to stay in touch with me, bc Im a ""nice"" friend. We stayed as friends and met regulary. But it hurt me every time when I saw her. After over half a year, the pain is not much anymore, but I now doubt our friendship, bc I have this strong feeling of being used and just being the second choice. But now, when we are together with his friend and others, it happens regulary, that she is attacking is boyfriend verbally due to some of his comments or opinions, while the rest are just casually discussing, what he said. At these moments, I laugh internally, bc I think, I dodged a bullet. And then, when she is snuggling with him, I think, that it was the better choice for her, bc they look like a nice couple.
Long story short, never date or get involved with the ex of a friend, you will step in a mess. BIG EMOTIONAL MESS. What bugs me is, that I dont see any point in having a friendship with her, bc of said feelings, but also I cant open to her anymore like before. it stresses me out to restrain my feelings for her, although its not hard anymore, bc its fading away. Our last conversation felt very cold. 
Thats it my boys. Lets be lonely together, juhuu",lonely,I was the nice guy,2021-06-16 07:42:48

2141,Master_of_shitcore,1623790178,8,"I see that a lot of people complain about people only liking them for their looks, and it confuses me. That just sounds really nice. People have never really liked me, let alone like me for my looks. I've only dated once before and it was an online relationship that lasted about 3-4 months. Whenever I would send her pictures of me I would edit them, I would lie about my height, lie about my weight, lie about almost anything to do with my physical appearance. It made me happy when she would compliment my looks, a kind of happiness I've never really felt before.

2166,anirho,1623769706,2,"I would like to use this forum to just get rid of some thoughts that are circling around in my mind. They say this is supposed to help you process things and cope better with everything, right?

I'm living in a tornado of confused feelings, responsibilities and fears and it's all coming closer and closer and crushing me. There is no way out of this situation but I also don't know how to go on like this for the rest of my life, or even for a few more years.

I don't think there is anyone in the world who really likes me. My relationship with my parents is kind of distant, my sister died a few years ago and I don't have any real friends, only four people I talk to online. People avoid my presence and I don't think anyone really wants me around. I don't remember being asked to meet someone and if I was, it was probably about 20 years ago (I'm past 30). If I ask for a meeting, for example those four people, there are always reasons against it, which I think are just excuses. I feel terribly lonely and would love to talk to someone who is not a child.

I'm a single parent and as a father I'm constantly confronted with prejudices and portrayed as incompetent or even malicious, even though I love my child more than anything and give everything to make sure he's doing well. In general, I feel as if I always have to justify and defend myself, no matter what the situation is. People always see someone in me that I am not and I just don't understand why. I am always accused of bad intentions, even though I only ever mean well and have no bad intentions.

The worst thing is that even the few qualities I like about myself are perceived as bad. I want people to be well and then when I do things for them to make them happy, I'm told that's weird and others wouldn't do it that way. I have been told all my life that what I do is not normal. I feel like an alien who just doesn't belong on this planet. Over and over again I find that my views are different from the masses and I always find myself alone or in some fringe group. This constant fighting is so tiring.

And as soon as I start talking, I feel as if everyone is just waiting for me to stop doing it. Then I start talking fast and get confused. So much I would like to talk calmly with someone who just listens and whom I can listen to.

So far, everyone I've considered a friend has left me. And I don't think there's anyone who doesn't want to leave me over time but who just accepts me as I am. I gave up hope a long time ago that someone could love me for who I am. I don't know why, but I am not lovable.

And I don't know how to change this situation. There is no one I can ask for help. I don't know how to meet new people. There is no opportunity and who wants to meet such a broken person like me, on top of that a single parent and also not what people consider beautiful in terms of looks? Above all, I simply don’t know how to talk to strangers.

Honestly i am wrong. maybe i am not fun, maybe i am just not accepted. maybe its because i have white hair or a big nose. maybe all i can offer is money and a ride. maybe i need tk get lost. stop pretending i am speical or super smart or maybe i will be a billionaire or successful. maybe i will have a wife and kids. disappoint them. maybe i am wrong to have an ego. maybe i am wrong to believe in myself. i am truely wrong for believing in myself. maybe i need to give up, maybe i need to run away and figure myself out. maybe i need to run away and start a new life. truly me. not a kid who was forced on a life i didmt want. not a kid who lost the best 3 years of a young mans life. not a dude who want friends who would want me to be the first person to reach out when theg are in trouble or reach out when they find a new job or have an interview at the second best company in the country. but u tell me when we hang out after 2 weeks. the worst feeling is that i cant tell you anything or help you or be nice to u. i had a crush on u 5 years agoooo. 5 fking years ago.... but everyone still believes that i love you. u are just my ""best friend"". literally just a friend. i let it go for 2 years. i didnt care what everyone thought. but i think that your also believe this bullshit. maybe i should give up on people.",lonely,"Too my ""best friend""",2021-06-15 23:18:01

However, now I’ve been invited out, I still feel shitty but also ridiculously anxious about going outside again. Almost makes me wanna cancel. But that’ll isolate me further, I shouldn’t do that.

I’m starting to think it’s not friendships I miss as much as it’s a relationship. I miss her, and having to accept we will never be again is so painful still. It’s been years, why do I still wanna die without her, it’s so dramatic.

She finally ghosted me last week, she’s never done that to me, had a breakdown. Also very dramatic I suppose. She promised she’d always be here, no matter what. It’s unreasonable of me to hold her to that all these years later but it still hurts. I hurt and idk how to stop. 

I wallow in self pity, waiting to feel better but it never comes through, perhaps I should be more actively looking for a way out, but I don’t want to, I have no drive. I’m still depressed years later, if only dying wasn’t so difficult, I’m too much of a coward to take the painful ways, the only method I have is possibly flawed, I worry if I carry it out it’ll go wrong, I’ll be saved and left with permanent damage to my brain. That would be to truly enter hell for the rest of my life. 

I’m further in fear of what comes next after death, that unknown is terrifying, to re-enter the space I was in before birth, alone.

Then a few days ago we did the same thing except we finished watching The Dark Knight at like 6AM. We started getting really flirting, complimenting each other, calling each other our nicknames, saying we really like each other. She starts telling me ""I really like you"" and then I kept saying it back, so this went on repeat for like 5 minutes until she says ""I really like you, just wanted to point that out"" a few times. Then I realized what she really meant and then I asked her if she was crushing, she then confessed her crush on me. I then confessed that I was massively crushing on her. I also realized how bad at taking hits I am. We then freaked out about liking each other and then I ask her ""Would you like to be my girlfriend nickname?"" she says ""I would love to be your girlfriend nickname"" and then asks if I would like to be her boyfriend and I tell her I'd love to be her boyfriend. We then officially became a couple and freaked out even more about this all happening. 


The day after that we talked for like 16 hours and voice called for at least 8 or 9 hours, which is usual. I love her so much and feel so grateful to have her. Still can't believe she crushed on me and then confessed to me first, she's so brave and straightforward, one of her best qualities. 

So like I said, about a week ago I never expected any of this to happen at all, I didn't even think she'd feel the same about me and now here I am. My point is that anything is possible and you should never give up cause it's 100% possible you'll find your special person or maybe great new friends at any time. You usually find what you're looking for when you least expect it.

2216,KaijuRandrewww_24,1623734490,7,"Lately I’ve been feeling on the edge again, stressed out all the time, and honestly just falling back into the pit. I try to escape by watching anime because thats what I do when I’m down but recently even that just depresses me. It just a reminder that I never experienced young love with anyone in school, never had fun with friends, or even have anyone to fall on when I’m in these situations of self doubt, and now being 21, dropped out of college, and transitioning from a customer service job to wine distributor, I lost my main way to socialize. I have all these pent up feelings and wants and I have no idea how to vent about them mostly because my family doesn’t understand. I don’t know what to do and everyday for the past two weeks I’ve been on the verge of tears when I’m alone and I have panic attacks because I can’t for the life of me keep someone interested in me. It hurts so much because every girl I had the courage to talk to or go out with it always ends up crushing me mentally. My first gf had so many problems and she vented them to me because she didn’t have anyone to talk to about it, and then she broke up with me because I’m too caring about how she feels and dropped me for some other guy she met in class. And the next girl I dated took my virginity and decided she wanted nothing to do with me afterwards and went back to her ex because she missed him. Every girl I talked to since them are only interested in me for a few days then just leave me on read or tell me that I’m not good enough. I hate just being a rebound and girls just using me to feel good and when the dust settles I’m the one left bottling up how I feel and treated like a toy.Saying how I feel in this helped a little bit but I’m not sure what to do now… i just want some sort of companionship that doesn’t end with me being hurt even more than before.

Essentially I have started work recently for my summer job. Orientation just finished this past weekend and more often then not I found myself sitting alone, nobody to talk to, feeling like complete shit wondering what type of cruel joke the entire world is pulling on me. Everywhere, from school, sports, camp, and now work, I have found myself as an outcast despite my attempts to socialize.

I just feel like when I enter a room I just repulse everyone. It's not like I am ugly, overweight, or have poor hygiene. I shower and exercise a couple times a week, and I think I'm like an average looking guy. Sure, I might have confidence issues but I put on a facade in public because you gotta fake it until you make it I'm hoping. I don't think I'm an arrogant ass, or super quiet. I'd like to think I know how to hold a conversation, considering I care what people say, I don't interrupt, and can speak decently well.

I've never really had any close friends, and in many situations I could blame it on being a twin and well, people may not want to always be around both of us as they treat us like a package but this idea of being an outcast follows me everywhere, even when I am not with my brother who has seemingly better luck in social situations.

I'll talk to anyone about anything. I don't care if you're an alien from the planet gloopenglop or if you believe you're being mind controlled I'll respond to all! If not I hope you are doing well and hope you have a wonderful week. Ask for number.. maybe?

for about a month, until she abruptly broke up with me. okay, yeah, I was heartbroken- this was the girl who was the exact My Type, she was a dream who walked right into my life- but I thought we were too similar to not be great friends. but lo and behold, she slowly started to talk to me less and less, until it got to where we are now… where she’s deserted me completely.

2280,Miya-Kutsune-Maru,1623691181,9,"I wonder, if it will ever be possible for a guy age 35 who cant work because he cant handle stress on any level, (0.00% tolerance, who has a severe learning disorder so severe that he is completely unable to get an education because his mind freezes, blanks out and he forgets nearly minutes after trying to learn it due to stress he gets from trying to learn it. Cant drive because if his his lack of ability to focus on one thing at a time, cant cook, has nearly 0.00% social skill when it comes to girls, has never talked to a girl outside his family, never been kissed or even hugged by a girl outside his family, never been alone with a girl, never had any friends, no loving family, no transportation, no resources, no life whatsoever. 

He was born with torrets syndrome so bad he couldn't hold a fork to eat due to extreme tremors, later he developed add, then depression, then had anger problems, was then places in several hospitals, Southeast Louisiana hospital, Noah, or new Orleans, DePaul's, to name a few, none of which were able to help him. Afterwards his father gave up by placing him in assisted living and basically forgetting about him, knowing how unstable he was, he didn't survive, he was arrested many times for anger. Most of his anger originated from extreme loneliness, beardom, lack of friends or freedom.

His staff members treated him badly, one even beat him but was arrested for it, another was arrested because he worked at an illegal chop-shop aside from being a care giver.

the assisted living programs were very corrupt with one being shut down from the manager taking more than she should for rent from clients who had behaved badly. All this and still no one to help him or to talk to who would try to understand him, only people to shun, belittle, provoke and attack him.

&amp;#x200B;

But, now, he lives alone in total isolation due to a flood in 2016 that took everything he had built for himself, after, the city became too dangerous and expensive for him to live in. So he was forced to move into a converted fema trailor in the middle of nowhere, in maurepas, LA. His health failing, losing his will to live, because he cant cook he lives off poor unhealthy foods he gets from the dollar store, pizza nearly every night, instant noodle, and coke, and his only wish is to die as young as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

 And the saddest part, because he has no friends, when he dies, it will be his landlord who will find his body laying on the floor alone in his trailor. None of his family will care, because none of them care for him, unlike his sister, he was always considered the runt, the failed child, the mistake and the problem. The child the mother and father don't speak about to other family or their friends, only the daughter gets mentioned and is married. He is the 1st in the history of his family who has never been married or wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

But he lives off ssi, tries to enjoy the outdoors, sports, hiking, nature, exploring, has a beautiful personality and amazing since of humor, and after his bills and everything is done, he has nearly $750 left to do whatever he wants with, just no one to do anything with. So what does he do to escape his terrible loneliness?

&amp;#x200B;

He takes sleeping pills every day and every night to escape the terrible loneliness he feels with the hope he will die as young as possible and every night he cries himself to sleep while crying to god begging him to kill him, blaspheming the holy ghost, god, Jesus and any holy being he can, over and over hoping god would kill him for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you ever wonder who he is?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, he is....

I told another person from my friend group that I’v cancelled plans with her because I feel very weak psychologically and I’m going through a rough patch and I also told her I want to hear about this thing she was meant to tell me about when we meet but i don’t know when i’m going to see her so i told her to text me about it. The only answer I got from her was “ok”. She didn’t care about what I’m going through and she ended up not telling me about the thing she was meant to tell me about. This is not the first time she completely ignored my feelings- one time i felt heartbroken because of this one guy and I told her about it and she proceeded to talk about a similar situation that happened to her.

2286,Plastic_Jellyfish898,1623688446,2,"I hate venting but I need to get all of this out. I feel like screaming into a pillow right. I hate feeling like this so much goddamn it.


My parents fight all the fucking time. It's been this way forever and I hate that they have a fucking age gap pf more than a decade with them knowing each other since one of them was barely a teen. It's so goddamn weird. Dad keeps yelling at everyone. I hate it. Had a fucking breakdown yesterday because he wouldn't stop yelling at everyone.


When I get frustrated I hit myself to get the emotions out because I don't want to accidentally get too heated and lay a hand on anyone else. My fucking idiot ass brother is 10 and can't read. It's so fucking stupid. I wish I could run away and have a fresh start.


I go about my day by blocking everything that stresses me out. I just don't think about. My parents think I feel nothing when they yell at me but I don't show them how I feel. I bottle it all up and put on a fake smile or something and get yelled at more.


I feel like dad's only ever concerned about me when jt relates to academics. When I have a bad allergy day when I sneeze so much to the point I can't do anything I get yelled at for wasting a day. Like anything he's concerned about me relates to how it could affect my academics. I wish I could have a dad who actually loved me instead of my grades. 


I wish I had friends. I wish I could have gone to a regular high school instead of a system where you go for classes for university entrance exams instead of the last two years of high school with little focus on actual high school. I got through those two years with a final grade of 87% and he wasn't satisfied until he found out the highest score was 91%. I hate how disapointing I am. The uni entrance classes sucked. I felt so goddamn lonely and stupid because I was painfully average. I'm such a disappointment.



Dad mocks me about not having the will to study or do anything and for having to redo the year for university  entrance exams. I couldn't get in the top 10k, I got in the top 60k, so I couldn't get into a government funded university. On the way to the university that accepted when I applied (They didn't help me out so I had no idea about the university and fucked up which one  I applied to as well.), the car ride was so awful with him so mad at me for being stupid. Basically pressured me into telling him to turn the car back and that I'd redo the year. I feel left behind by peers my age.



I'm so envious of the high school system in any first world country, it just seems so much better. Wish I was made to do something except to study. I wish had friends. I feel so lonely. I played a game and used voice chat last week (didn't speak myself because of awful social anxiety) and it felt so... good? I hadn't felt this way since I last was with ""friends"" more than 5 years ago. I need human interaction outside of family.


I wish I could hang out with friends. I wish I could socialize. I really don't think I can get along with teens my age here either. I wish I was born in some first world country. I'm so envious. I just want friends. I want to play games with friends. When I hear teens online talk about going on a date, I get incredibly envious because I haven't even had proper friends during my teen years. On top of that, dating is really frowned upon here so it's basically not possible at all, as a teen here you're only supposed to focus on your studies. I feel so hollow. I'm so envious that I can't have what they have. I'm so envious. I'm so envious. Envy. Envy. Envy. Envy. I hate feeling this way.


I want friends. I want someone. I wish I wasn't so lonely. When I have online friends who are nice to me, I mentally ""latch"" on to them. It's bad. Back when I was 13 I was really clingy to someone and I was very shitty to them, so I now I know not to act like that, but it's still mentally there. I know this is because I've never really had actual friends. It hurts.

2298,MonkeyDforda,1623677908,2,"Heyo 🙇‍♂️. I've been so lonely that I'm starting to question my own existence and reality in generell. 

I have been feeling lonely since before the pandemic, maybe even my whole life and the pandemic surely didn't help with that. I've been without real friends for couple of years now and never had someone I would consider a best friend. I've also never been in a relationship wich is something I'm getting more and more desprate for, but something tells me it will never happen. (Probably just my lack of confidence) 

The feeling of lonliness and  and emptyness have become so bad I started to question my own existence, because I feel like nobody really cares that much about me and that my presence dosen't really impact the people that are in my life (mainly family) in a way that matters. At least people never gave me the feeling that I'm in any way essential to them. Sometimes its the same way vice versa. Sometimes I sit in room with other people and have a hard time acknowledging their existens, because their presence or absence dosen't affect me at all. 

This also started to affect other parts of my life. For example I'm having a hard time enjoying playing videogames and watching tv shows, wich were things that used to cheer me up and distract me, but nowadays they feel like a chore despite still being genuitly interested in those things. Or maybe I just have to find something new to waste my time with. 

Its also affecting my job (wich is the only reason I'm getting up in the morning), becuase I'm not able to show the interest, motivation and commitment that is expected from me. Besides that I feel like my co-workers don't like me cause I'm bringing down the overall moral and because I'm not social enough. 

Why am this lonely? 

I'd say because of my inability to maintain and building strong relationships. Because I suck at meeting new people and making good impression since I'm very introverted, socially akward and boring. Because I don't like going out that much (not a fan of public places) and don't do good in groups.
I'm sure there is more that I can think of right now. 

At this point I'm in such a deep hole that the only way out is therapy, but I don't even know how to go about the whole process of finding the right therapist, making time for it....etc. 

Anyone there who feels similar?

Well thats it. Hope the post wasn't to long.

I drove around and the parks are empty so I can’t just ball out my feelings (btw, I’ve seen my friends chilling at the park on snapchat and they never mentioned it to me. Idk why they can’t just drop a message like “we going to the park at 6”or something. This isn’t the first time.).

Anyways, I’m moving away for college and won’t be around any of my old friends so I can start fresh. I moved last time in 7th grade. Hopefully I can use the results from these friends to make better friends at college. I’ll also not have to worry as much about my parents saying no to me hanging out sometimes (due to COVID which might’ve made them stop asking) or having to attend random family events.

Either way though, I’m kind of feeling sick to my stomach right now. Maybe it’s anxiety over graduation or something else. Idk, but whatever, I’m gonna die one day so I just need to keep chugging along since I can never get time back.   
  
Edit: I also had some friends/classmates ask if I wanted to drink and I said no.  My dad used to be an alcoholic so it would be stupid of me and would destroy any trust I had with my dad and mom.  They never asked about anything again.  Ig I’m too nerdy?  Idk",lonely,Senior skip day = pain lmao,2021-06-14 23:17:13

Recently I have come to the very sad and overwhelming realisations that I do not have my life in order and cannot help but keep comparing myself to my friends who have managed to expand their social circles and move on with their lives even in the context of a global pandemic. I have realised that i have let my depression take a hold of me and prevented me from building a normal life as a person of 25 years should be doing. Even though I am not exactly the biggest looser and am finishing my graduate education as well as recently gotten my drivers license and having a partner who does care about me (however does not live in the country I do), I cannot help but sink into very heavy and sad thoughts that despite all the wonderful things that happened, my life is just going to be shit. This also is not helped by the fact that the job competition is ruthless due the covid pandemic and I have been rejected from everywhere I have been applying to as well as the fact that I live in a country where I cannot speak the language of (I live in Europe and juts speak English and my mother tongue which is not very useful) so the reality of my life as progressing here is really bleak however I am not sure if I have what it takes to move to lets say USA or Canada where I could live in comfortably due to the fact that my degree is not very in demand nor the fact that I don't have any savings to go anywhere. I just really really feel like the world is pressing down on me and I am running out of options due to depressive thoughts social anxiety and being isolated from every one of my friends who do not live in the country that I live in.

My ex and I were not healthy for each other and it left me very fucked up as a person. We broke up when the pandemic hit so I was absolutely hurting alone because I had no opportunities to go out and meet new friends and socialize and whatnot.

I had a very awkward impression and friendship with my new coworkers but it was a start. In terms of making progress and losing it, my work would have new hires which were other males and I felt thay I was able to connect with them more and socialize.

I thank you in advance for taking time out of your day to read what I have to say in the form of a reddit vent. As the title indicates, I feel lonely, but I am not alone. I think it is evident that anyone who has posted or is browsing this thread has one thing in common, and we have all arrived here from different sources, different circumstances and reasons. I am afraid that perhaps my rationale for being here isn't relatable or may be it is. For instance, I have dated in the past, I have 2-4 distinct groups of friends that I see on occasion. (I am in my 30's, can't see my friends everyday like in HS/College) and I am not going through a breakup but I do admit I do miss and care for women in my past that I have cut off any form of contact, but this is not why I am here really. 

Over text message, a friend confided in me because he was going through a tough period balancing work life/stress management/debts/bills/living in an unforgiving big metropolitan city and mentioned that we need to overshoot because we always fall short. 

I am here on this thread tonight because I feel a bit in solitude because I feel like I am stuck in a pervasive cycle of mediocrity when I have followed all the rules and have done everything that I have been told to do by society, teachers in my youth, general rules, and I feel like I am getting short changed. In other words, for the amount of work I have put into self improvement, education, improving career prospects, building relationships, making friends, losing friends, doing what my parents have influenced me to do, being a good person etc.. I don't really have anything to show for it. 

After all, I am on this thread. I am not friendless, or suffer from any confidence issues by any stretch of the imagination, and if given the chance I have the charm and wit to talk to anyone at anytime. I am also humble where I have a bias for the underdog, I will help people who ask and will be friends with anyone as long as they are respectful. Thought it was necessary to mention this in case someone were to assume that I was a d-bag arrogant. 

Why do I feel lonely or down? I will be the first to admit that, having read a few posts spread across various threads, there are a lot of people who are in need of quality mental health help than I. I've read horrible stories of people who struggle mentally and are truly unhappy and are literally dying to have a friend. I truly sympathize to the plight of those who are in that category, and I hope folks see my current feeling/mood about the imperfections about my life and see that it is equally as important as those who are suffering albeit not as severe or critical. 

I feel solitude because I never really felt like the main attraction, I felt more like typecast as the supporting actor as if I was replaceable in a social setting. ""Oh ***Its*** great to see **you**."" but I imagine that in their mind, if their brain spoke, it would have said underneath ""its"" breath, ""**Your** presence wouldn't have changed anything at a bar or house party setting."" Because I never see them again until the next excuse of a holiday to drink and gossip about unimportant things and other acquaintances successes or failures that I couldn't really care less about. Damn I sound like the male version of Daria. 

I feel solitude because I am not really impressed with most people. What I mean by that is as someone who is relatively well read and who spent countless hours studying in college across mainly humanities, I can't really relate to the average human being. That is not to say that I do not respect them as people. Simply put, I am bored by most people. I was the type of person who got mocked in a journalism class for claiming that watching documentaries were my favorite form of entertainment. Obviously as a dude, drinking beers and watching countless sports events isn't the most appropriate thing to say. But I hope whoever reads this gets the point. And i was not bs-ing, I am fascinated by Journeyman pictures. (Check it out on Youtube) 

During my spare time I occasionally help my friend's business and once I was walking out to do a chore, which is adjacent to a deli. This young guy who works there, who is quite hood, walked alongside me and volunteered information that I never asked, about how he was having trouble procuring a Dj set, because later that night he had to DJ a birthday party and there would be a lot of alcohol, and food and bitches (his words not mine), and blah blah blah. I could tell he wanted to be my friend and, if I invited myself he would have acquiesced, and I do drink. I do like loud music more than the average person and I am not going to lie, I like being around women, but whether I have some mild narcissistic traits in me, or whatever rationale it may be, I just couldn't get myself to trust or like the guy. I respect him enough, because I spent 5 minutes of my day politely listening to him when I didn't want to spend 10 seconds with him. Not sure if I will be judged as an asshole, or if there are folks out there that can relate. And this type of thing happens all the time, whenever I meet new people. I am sure I am not immune to being uninteresting either to other people. 

Lastly, I feel solitude because I don't feel represented in society nor respected as much as I feel I deserve. I wouldn't complain if I felt like an asshole that wasn't trying to be a good person, because I have a dozen or so friends who like me and 2 dozen acquaintances who I would happily spend an hour+ with. Living in a large socialist leaning city where cancel culture has kind of taken over has kind of discouraged me to be myself or has kind of stifled my voice and I guess this is why I am here tonight. I feel like society only cares about the most destitute and anyone in the middle is left to fend for themselves. Rationale such as, well you're not homeless or you're not hungry is used as a justification to stfu as if, if you're not homeless or hungry then you have no right to feel feelings of struggle, or sadness. 

I feel solitude because I feel like I can't challenge the narrative, not in a provocative fashion like as trolls do, but if I don't agree with the majority and nod my head in agreement as bobblehead dolls do, then i'll be ostracized. I respect people who follow and are super into politics, but I personally hate politics as social banter because I know my voice will never be respected. Having studied domestic and international politics, I feel confident in my understanding and beliefs in the way in which I think left v. right/social economic policies, improving society etc.. but I am always left with a binary choice whenever I am in instances with people who are far left leaning than I. 

I either avoid the conversations by all means necessary OR I am ostracized and judged because I don't agree. (Semi cancelled may be) I guarantee you, I won't be invited or summoned to the next event for a beer if I openly verbalized my convictions as strongly as they did theirs. I on the other hand am laid back enough where I don't mind if you think differently than I, and can differentiate the way you think socially with a political framework and the way you treat others or myself socially, with kindness, humor, wit or whatever it is that you bring to the table. 

I never understood why people jumped the gun and assumed that I was an idiot, or racist simply because I didn't 100 percent align with the vast majority of people who hold certain far left leaning views. I have never approached x race and inquired about whether they had experience in x stereotype. I have never insulted x person for their x religious or political belief. I have never approached a person of color and asked them if they were passionate about the NBA at random. But flip the tables, people and society in general read me like a book and have inquired every stereotype in the book. I don't have any hard feelings whatsoever, and I literally cannot walk around my area with a chip on my shoulder being in an extreme minority racially, socially and politically but I never understood the argument that people in my past and present make. ""You disagree with us? with socialism? Then **You** are the enemy, **You** are like those KKK guys."" ------ but wait a minute... I am already being taxed at 38 percent.. I am paying taxes for people and things that I don't use or need. The only two things out of the dozens of public expenditures are roads/hospitals/public safety, and I think I still would get charged a pretty penny if I were to go to the hospital. How did we get from, if you disagree with us, you are automatically pinned as the enemy and heartless, oh and racist too? 

On a side note, the city I lived in, used to be a city where people of differences in anything and everything could get along and therefore intellectually advance due to the exchange of information and ideals.  

I think I am arriving at a conclusion that I have unpopular beliefs because there are opposed to popular beliefs because I am more anal about being ripped off and not getting a fair return than other people who don't mind or don't care. After all, a major news event, or societal issue only grows in importance if you get enough people to care. The severity or legitimacy of the grievance goes to the wayside as long as there is enough volume/clicks/attention regardless of due diligence. 

If you didn't enjoy drinking coffee because you didn't like the bitter taste or texture, in what world would it be acceptable for me to assume that because you don't like coffee that must mean that you are my enemy and you must not like any form of liquid? 

I welcome any comment constructive, critical or neutral. I am not very combatitive when sharing my beliefs and I almost never do so in social settings because then I would never get laid! However I will say that the older I get, the less I belief in humanity. I used to be the class clown type, but I don't laugh as much anymore. I profoundly enjoy being social, am a caring person, am open minded, love eating almost all cuisines, speak several languages fluently and 1 so so and would love to learn more languages. I have a professional job that I hate but can pivot to something else. I just feel like in a state of perpetual solitude lately because of how shallow I find many to be in my life, and whatever I put into society, whether its the form of taxes, respecting people socially, I am not getting as much in return. 

I have never been in trouble with the law aside from open containers of beer. Could you imagine if I reacted poorly to every racist comment directed at me? Could you imagine if I acted as a mirror to the behaviors and demeanors of people who have mistreated me and I were to not turn the other cheek and copy them? Point isn't to say its acceptable or unacceptable to stoop as low as others but for anyone that is thinking about questioning my morals, perhaps I feel alone because society has let me down, it has let us down. Perhaps I am alone, and we are alone because unless you are the bottom 1 percent of society, nobody cares. 

As I write my feelings onto virtual paper. I gradually feel that I am unlocking a key, a key to why I feel the way I do, why I feel lonely but I guarantee I am not alone! I am sure many or some or at least one of youse, feel the way I feel. That I have followed most if not all the rules in society to ensure as happy of a life, financially, spiritually and socially as possible. Treat people the way they should be treated with dignity, studied hard, questioned ideas with respect, but it was never fully reciprocated... yet. 

My last thought consists of myself wanting to feel more fulfilled, not wanting to feel alone, but not wanting to change. I don't want to compromise and be a bit more shallow to simply have more agreeable friends. Im not going to support socialist ideals to woke socialist leaning people who confuse Mao and Pol Pot, and who need a refresher on who Che Guevara was. And ideally, I am not going to pay a penny more in taxes to my local progressive socialist leaning government that wants to make public school education system larger but not better, by paying more wages to mediocre teachers who would never have gotten jobs teaching in a more competitive country. 

And, no I cannot see myself compromising with people who believe they are fighting against intolerance who do not tolerate anyone or any ideal who arrives at a different conclusion from a different point than they do. Generalizing as an act is the bane of a failing argument, and if I will be in a minority with regards to the way I think which is to approach instances from a case by case basis rather than a ad-hoc, paint everything as such because of one incident, then i guess isolating myself is a sad yet lesser of all evils. I pray for my happiness but I don't think I'll change.",lonely,"I feel lonely, but I know I am not alone .",2021-06-14 16:49:40

2348,deadonehere,1623650097,2,"In the last few months I've found myself without a single friend. My previous friends have slowly been drifting away from me and chosen to stop talking to me (why, I do not know.) It's been a long time since I've been completely alone. I haven't put much effort into meeting new people, but sometimes strangers or weak acquaintances will choose to talk to me. I don't know why, but most of the time these will be people whose personalities just do not work with mine whatsoever, so I don't really give much else other than small talk. Other times I do find myself interested in them and try to get to know them. But when I talk to these interesting people and we start to talk more, it only lasts a short time before I'm back where I started. And before you suggest it, no, I don't say anything over the top or take things too fast. It's a pretty typical conversation, just talking about interests, opinions, events... But for some reason, I just end up repelling these people.

I feel like an electron, but rather than being attracted to the proton like I should be, I am attracted to other electrons, and when I come close to one, they are magnetically pushed away. And when a proton comes near, they are pulled closer, despite me having no interest. I know it's a silly metaphor, but it's accurate to how I feel.

I'm not socially clueless or anything. I'm a full grown adult and consider myself normal, for the most part. So why do people not like me? I just, I don't know?

Everyone around me is getting married and everyone keeps asking me why I don’t have a boyfriend. At first these questions didn’t bother me, like not one bit.

Well, since I live in a heavily infected covid city, my next semester will also be online. So I’ve been down about not being able to meet new people. Adding onto this, I have several weddings to attend (I’m a maid of honor and bridesmaid for several of them) within the next 6 months and I’m starting to feel down about it. All my friends are in relationship and all of my cousins as well. I am happy for them, don’t get me wrong, but I feel slightly envious that they have a relationship. I’m just upset and I try to act like it doesn’t bother me but it’s actually starting to get to me. I understand I’m young (22) and still have time but that doesn’t make me feel any better. I’m not necessarily a huge party person, drinker, and I feel like I’m never in any social setting to meet people. Now I feel embarrassed or overwhelmed when someone asks me.

At the beginning I was excited to experience the peace of being alone. Making all of my own decisions etc. 

I hate this. I've realized that life to me isn't as fun if you can't share the moments that make it fun. I try to do things that used to make me happy but now they bring me no joy. 

I want to play guitar with someone, go hiking and camping, play some games.. I haven't been able to connect with anyone at work and haven't met anyone outside of it. How do you even meet people anymore? Do you really have to dive into the dating app pool? 

I was meant to be a mother.. would of had 4 kids by now. I have not been blessed. My twins came too early. I had 2 miscarriages. Life could have been so different. 

I miss being excited. I just feel so neutral. Starting to lose interest in my hobbies. No inspiration, no drive. I was so sure I would be just fine alone. And I am, all the things are being paid for and all that jazz, but my mental health is shit. 

I've never had such a struggle making friends before. I've never cut so many people out of my life in such a short time. Politics and covid. They have affected us all.

I was never educated on consent, sex and romance when I was little so I had to explore it all by myself, which led to a year or two of constant assault and slut-shaming from my classmates. At the time I didnt know it was bad and I would just play along in effort to fit in as ""one of the boys"" because I found it quite difficult to befriend girls (I was bullied by a girl deskmate for most of my elementary school years). The boys would call me sl*t, wh*re, anything degrading they could think of, the girls would see me getting assaulted in the middle of the class and ignore, my 7th grade was the start of my ever-declining mental health. I hated myself, I thought I was cheap, easy, undesirable and most of all filthy. I kept dating boys after boys to seek the validation and emotional warmth my parents didnt give me. They didnt know what I was going through and they weren't the type to shower their children with loving warmth. 

I end up a messed up person and ruined my chances with genuinely good people, while at the same time get into toxic relationships and endure even more harassment from my partner's friends. They lovebombed me so they could get in my pants, they pretended to be my friend to emotionally torment me for their sick twisted pleasure and I let them step on me just so I wouldn't feel lonely. My only best friend ever of 3 years dated me and I was genuinly happy for a short while, recently he dropped me for another girl and said he no longer wanted anything to do with me. I have absolutely no one to talk to anymore. I can't talk to my parents about anything, my sibling simply doesn't care, no one's interested in getting to know me.

 I like art, I like film, I like anime, I like music, I like fashion, I like playing games too. I listen and watch everything from mainstream to obscure &amp; I just wish someone would give me a chance to talk about it. I picked up so many hobbies in desperate attemps to connect to people but no one would want to befriend me.

From the time she clocks-out on Friday, until 6:30 Monday morning. Every weekend it hits me, even this weekend, when I spent most of my time with friends. I still came back to an empty apartment today. 

People comment, ""it must be nice having the apartment to yourself."" It would, if it wasn't every single weekend. Of course, it's more than that, she's out most of the week too. I've made plans with her and she simply leaves and says, ""I forgot."" 

I tried to have a life, meeting new people and dating outdoors last summer. This was before my roommate met her current boyfriend. She got concerned over covid and requested that I stop, and I did. It was for her, but also due to the changing weather. She met her boyfriend in the fall and was fine with going to the mall, eating multiple meals indoors, going to hotel resorts, etc. Anyway, all this really threw me into a depression. When I voiced my own concerns, she'd look at me and leave. I was just ignorable. Additionally, she never wanted to go out before covid, pretty clear message that she didn't want to be with me.

I don't know if this would count as low self esteem, anxiety, overthinking, or what ever, but when I see someone on the R4R type groups, and even if I personally think we'd be a good match, I won't make any form of reaching out to them. Knowing the people on the internet I know there's thirsty people who (I assume) flood their chats with pickup lines, 'Send nudes', 'I'm the nice guy' and what not... and I look at myself and think ""Hell there's so many better people than me, and statistically speaking most of the people hitting them up would be better than me... why bother""  


I've put my own little things up on those groups and... never, not once, did I get a chat, a comment, nothing. Honestly I'm not surprised, yet still I get disappointed every time. Every time I do I'm not even sure what I'd say or do when someone would pop in and say 'Hi' or 'How you doing'. Most of the time I even find myself wondering if I want to be in a relationship anymore. The 'Loneliness' I have has been a sort of comfort zone.

2395,rootnaut17,1623630591,6," Once I have finished university in just over two weeks, I don’t know what I will have left, it’s the only reason I keep going. After that I have nothing, no hope of anything. I can’t do the career I want because I’m not good enough. Outside of that the main thing I want is to not be lonely anymore, yet almost everything in my head is telling me that being close to people is bad, that I can’t do it because it’s bad for me and worse for them. I want to feel something, but I’m just empty and tired. I don’t have any capacity to feel, or understand people. I can’t have friends, and I can’t have a relationship because of this. 

I don’t say this because you’re not allowed to say bad things about autism, because for some reason it’s become something to be proud of. But, sincerely, I wish I could live one week as someone without it. Maybe I’d be able to feel something- or, I mean, I feel things I just don’t know what to do with that. If I get sad it’s impossible not to spiral, and if I get happy it’s impossible not to fall off hard from that, because I can’t manage them.

In The A Word, Joe’s mum says to his dad that Joe is in there somewhere, underneath the autism. That reminded me of the clickers in The Last of Us, like autism is a fungus that's preventing me from developing any kind of social ability or relationship. Sometimes, the fungus feels so thick that you can’t do anything, that you’re just along for the ride - can’t move, can’t talk, can’t  think in a clear direction, everything is just a mess. 

Perhaps it’s similar with lonely, in that lonely breeds lonely. The longer you go being lonely, the harder it is to stop, and eventually the fungus is so thick you can’t break it without breaking yourself. 

But there are things I want to do, that I haven't done yet, and things that I want to feel, even if it seems impossible. I've been wanting for 22 years, and it's hard keep wanting, because it just feels like I'm moving further and further away from actually doing, or actually feeling.",lonely,Fungus,2021-06-14 10:29:51

2403,xenaglas,1623628290,8,"What exactly does this rat want from me? I see his hesitancy in approaching the bench. Running, coming to a full stop, and sprinting in the other direction. Maybe he senses some sort of compassion or understanding from me. Maybe he had an experience similar catching someone's eye in public, feeling like you can see through them. Nothing comprehensive to put into words. But some sort of feeling. A spirit. A reach into our very personhood. 


The rat. A very misunderstood but lovable creature. A similar existence to our own. A need for comfort, companionship, warmth. A want to be loved and understood. But obviously an unfavorable image in the eyes of most people. I'm not unsympathetic to the lack of compassion people feel. People are always right to be hesitant. But I wonder what would happen if people really looked into the eyes of the creatures around them. What would they see?


I think that's why it's so hard to really look at everyone who passes. It's like you're suddenly inundated with the life and emotions of each passing human. What an intense feeling to have so often. That's why eye contact is so hard in general, but in spaced out amounts throughout the day - bearable.


As to why I'm writing about rats at midnight while riding the subway: I like going on the train late at night when I feel emotionally unstable. Probably not advised by most as the best coping mechanism, but the risk/reward is better than others I think. I don't know why it's so stabilizing. The night is comforting and dark, like a swaddle. The city is always buzzing, but at night with a warmth that feels like laying next to a purring cat. I feel like I can really see the colors of the city when I'm not blinded by light. And the people. It's like that moment when you wake up next to your sleeping partner, opening your eyes to a new world and a raw connection with your human. I find people are a little more in the headspace to really look around at others and try to discover their humanity. Or maybe it's just me. I don't know honestly. At night is when I'm the loneliest, reaching out for a connection with another being, bringing me to the subway. 


Sometimes I wish I could join the rats. Just for a bit. Free to roam through the tracks and the dark tunnels and chasms. Deeply linked, and like water, flowing with the beings around them. 


Now I'm above ground. 24th and 9th. Overstimulation. It's hard to fight the urge to borough back in the tunnels. This world is so big sometimes you don't feel like a part of it. There are so many different spirits and paths around you. You're like the lifeless observer, yelling at the screen wondering why no one can hear you. Someone's getting out of their taxi in front of me. I wonder where they're headed or where they came from. Have I made an impression on their existence? Will they think of me? Is that why I'm not too scared of being abducted or murdered? At least I'm a part of something, you know? That biker who passed that glanced at me. Did we make a connection? Did I mean something to him during that brief millisecond of time? As fun as people watching is, it's super isolating. 


What's the off chance that I find someone else roaming the streets with the desire for connection? With so many people in this city, the chances are high, right? Then again, everyone feels connection differently. The multiple men who have catcalled me in the past were probably longing for that same feeling. The thought that some super empathetic person will join me on this bus stop bench at 1 am wanting purely conversation is pretty naive. 


I guess this marks the end of my night foray. I always find it hard to bring myself home. Like I didn't accomplish my goal. I didn't find what I was looking for. It was a futile task anyway. Thankfully now I'm exhausted enough to pass out and not lay in bed, staring through the wall. At least the rats at home will be there to greet me.

2407,Fastorrior,1623626162,5,"Barely remember shit age 1-10, I didn't make many friends because I couldn't go out and hang out with them after school. I could never join in on random walks they had after school, birthday parties and after school courses and activities. I had one friend but really I never even understood them or enjoyed being around them. I quite literally only talked to them to fulfil my basic need for communication with someone other than my parents, and they couldn't do fun shit either so they didn't mind my inability to hang out outside of school. It was unfair to keep them for 9 years and fake my interests, but if I didn't my parents would probably set me up for someone even worse or start drama at school and shit. Age 11, I started using social media. 
I've pretty much lived more through Discord and Reddit than IRL. I've made some friends, had multiple romantic relationships which allowed me to learn and grow. Meanwhile all I've done IRL was school, talk to that one friend, eat, study, repeat.
I'm 15 now, and my parents still don't feel comfortable letting me go anywhere by myself. I've finished elementary school (in my country we have 9 years of elementary school and then 4 years of high school then uni) and I'm about to get in a different high school. It will be good for my friend. They deserve someone who truly enjoys being around them and doesn't need to fake liking same things as them.
On the other hand, I probably wont have any friends at high school either. I don't even want to have them. All I am is toxic, unavailable, useless and if I had a gun right now I wouldn't hestitate to blow my brains out regardless of everything and everybody. I also do not want my parents to be involved in my friendships. I don't care if they cause drama anymore. I refuse to fake my personality and hang out with someone just for the sake of it.
No, I'm not the fucking type that enjoys having just one friend. I would love having a group of good friends I can experience life with. However, you gotta deserve that type of luxury. And all I would do to those happy and innocent people is make them burnt out with my mental issues or fooled by whatever fake bullshit I come up with. I am doing everyone at my future school a favor by not interacting with them or trying to make friends. They might not realise it then, but I would never be able to make them happy and sustain a honest friendship.
Right now, I just play league of legends all day for some sort of human interaction. Just enough to keep myself from doing something impulsive. Life is just chasing happiness, and I can't be bothered about it anymore. I'm a loser, empty and dull fucking idiot and hopefully, as my parents assume, somebody kills me as soon as I'm alone.

2420,stupidtransslut,1623618335,12,"Howdy.

I am new to this subreddit, but not new to the intense feeling of loneliness.

To expand some: I have a lot going on medically and genetically that really impacts my ability to feel things. It has been common - for as long as I can remember - that I often feel alone even in a room full of acquaintances; even around friends and loved ones. The moments I do not feel that way are rare, fleeting, and something I have to actively work to avoid chasing. Its hard to not be a moth to the flame, when you're used to the dark.

Betting a lot of us here relate to that.

I know part of this is my brain - it is *such* an asshole - and the rest I know is a big mix of who I am/my life experience, paired with situations or compounding smaller issues. 

To set reasonable expectations, I don't really think I have any ""new"" answers or advice, but I *am* super neurodivergent! Kinda figured that maybe talking about stuff here might help me! And maybe others! Who knows, you know? Maybe someone will read something they relate to and the different perspective might be useful, or even just comforting.

Anyways, the tl;dr is reading this long post probably won't fix - or help fix - much, so if you opt out here, it's cool. I feel you.

My memory is a bit shit, and that puts things into an even weirder perspective to me than most people can imagine. For one, my life has very two, distinct, and different periods that are so starkly different, it causes mental dissonance. The second part is... look, I joke about it a lot, I own my derpiness, but I have genuinely been through a lot of brain trauma. So if I admit at times that I'm not sure, trust me - I really am clueless. When I transitioned from period 1 of my life, to period 2, stuff was very bad. 

When I say bad, I mean it in about everyway imaginable. I can get into that more if you want, but its really not that important. The important part is that I found a catalyst during that period within how awful I felt - how *lonely* I felt - and I started trying to figure stuff out.

At the time I didn't have a clue I was on the spectrum, and due to my living circumstances, I was actually alone beyond the rare kindness of strangers. All I knew was that I felt like... a lost puzzle piece. A ghost. The subway car everyone steps off of at the first stop. 

I felt - still feel - like I don't fit, that I am invisible, that I am doomed to be temporary - and it was killing me. Still does at times.

I'mma frontload the important part of all this section incase you're all ready tiring of my shite writing:

Getting to know myself and why I was having the feelings I do played a large part in me surviving. It was also the hardest and most mentally exhausting long-term task I have ever started. It's not a door you can easily close once its open I've found, either; which is kinda funny because I'm really good at slamming doors closed when I want to be. The point is.. its become a lifelong skill and tool that constantly helps me, even if it gets tiring.

For me, this involved a lot of quiet time. Not that I had many opportunities to just sit and think long periods - I mean shit, I was homeless - but I started by learning to find those moments where I could, and being very stubborn about using that time wisely. No matter how busy or bad off I was, any time the opportunity presented itself, I started dissecting things, mentally.

My process often was this:
1. Pick a feeling. If all the feelings are too big, smash it into pieces and look at the smaller chunks. 

i.e, a big thing I hate is feeling like I only exist when people need me or want something from me. That, paired with feeling like I will be extremely temporary in anyone's life, led to a lot of feeling hopeless about trying. After all, I'd just end up getting invested, and then they'd hop off my subway and I'd be left standing there alone again.

Thats a huge feeling, especially if we consider that when we feel our worst, we have a tendency to combine feelings and ideas together. Its a way we validate things within ourselves - which is absolutely valid - but its hard to pull things apart if we refuse to acknowledge they are bundled together in the first place.

So, I broke it down. What experiences in my past have instilled this hatred of this feeling? Why did those experiences happen? If they were preventable, why did I let it happen? How much control over any of it did I *really* have? What part did everyone in a situation play? If I am being honest - and I am, as being honest with yourself is important in all of this - I definitely had to face some hard truths. Both about my part in things, my misunderstandings/differences, and about people I trusted/thought innocent beforehand.

Basically, every little chunk - every angle - of those feelings became a necessary viewpoint to reach an understanding. And yes, i'mma say it again, its so fucking tiring.

Will say its worth it again, too.

2.  Don't give up even if you get stuck on an internal question, or if you get tired.

Yeah. Seriously. Take a break, but don't give up. Set a time limit on that mental break, be easy on yourself if as the deadline approaches, you feel you need more time. The operative word here though is *need*. When you can get back to work on the feeling you've had in mind the last X days, stick with it.

For some people, moving on to another feeling &amp; coming back is the best for them. I thought it was for me, too, but I realized later that... bouncing around like that was causing problems. So many feelings were tied together, that one-by-one was hyper necessary. You may be different and thats okay, but I will say the satisfaction and feeling of progress as I stuck to each topic really was palpable. It kept me motivated.

3. Use the feelings you explored/understand better as leverage against the others.

Look... We're all weird and complicated in so many ways. Extra so emotionally and mentally. The reality is though, that as you make progress, you will gain a better understanding of who you are &amp; why you feel how you do. Using what you learned in the past is a thing we constantly do in life, so do it for yourself in this way too.

Does some chunk of a new feeling, feel very alike a chunk from the past feeling you worked on? Don't ignore that. Figure out why. Don't tie them together or admit they are exactly the same until you're certain they are, either. So often there are tiny differences in the *whys* and *hows*, and it matters. The most important thing for everyone working through things, in my opinion, is that you feel the process getting easier. Using feelings as sort of a shoestring to lead you through the dark to figure out the source of something is more than okay. It will help you, and help you conserve some mental energy too.

4. Final step tbh.
Stay honest with yourself, and mindful of what you tear apart and learn. Keep doing it as new things happen that are hurting or seem out of nowhere. Hell, I pull apart most things I feel, nowadays. Its basically second nature.

The main point of all of this is to understand ourselves and feelings better, so we have a better chance at *feeling better.* But, if we aren't mindful of how things, people, ourselves, and situations impact us/our feelings, we may struggle extra to actually create change in our environment, even if we have changed a lot internally.


I have spent the last ten years approaching my emotions like this. I still get very depressed - still struggle, still feel alone and lonely - but, I can say with confidence that I am SO MUCH better at not getting hurt. Now, I can see harmful people or situations coming sooner. I understand myself better, so its been easier to know my wants &amp; needs from others. When I communicate those wants &amp; needs, and my hopes/expectations/fears, it helps even more in finding people I can relate with and minorly 'fit' with. If someone reacts negatively to me communicating those things - to me knowing myself - then I just know it's another person not meant to be in my life very long. To be clear, this doesn't mean every person either is 'for me' or 'not for me.' Very often these conversations are super healthy. I have wants/needs, people have or set boundaries, I get to know them in advance. There's less risk of feeling letdown, when you know where the floor of things are. It gives you the ability to accept that someone may only be around temporarily. In so many ways it softens the harm we feel pretty much universally, just by knowing who we are &amp; practicing good communication.

I still dont have many people in my life. Still lack community, and feel constantly suicidal. Off-and-on, I do end up alone for long periods. But you know, I no longer feel eternally doomed to that reality, even if it happens too much for my liking. I am getting better at so much of this. I know that it will ebb and flow. Sometimes I will barely stay afloat, and other times I will feel as if I am in a rowboat with others, struggling - yet laughing - the whole time.

We are all very valid in our feelings, trauma, etc. There's no permanent and perfect way to avoid the millions of ways we can get hurt. Regardless, don't abandon yourself in the dark. With our feelings - be it fingers on walls or our emotions - we can find a way out, and every period of darkness can be temporary.

As a final note... I've only recently found people I feel I truly 'fit' with, who I love an incredible amount. We are not perfect - no human is - but all this work I've done is most noticeable with them. I may get hurt, or hurt them occasionally, but atleast I am mildly equipped to do the work that helps us stay together, now. I am confident if I had met them 10 years ago, we would've ended up hating eachother, somehow - or atleast bare minimum, I'd have hurt them so bad they would've hated me.

I'm working on myself and putting in the work to better myself, but that doesn't mean I don't want someone to encourage me or support me from time to time- it just feels very lonely and isolating.

2443,walaska,1623607766,2,"It’s hard to explain but I’ll give it a go. We got together when we were 19, we’re 33 now. We’ve had our ups and downs, but in august two years ago, though having split and living on other ends of Europe, we got back together. Long distance except the odd weekend we could meet (which involved flights or 9 hour drives to meet in the middle). The first lockdown last year was insane. She had a full-blow nervous breakdown coupled with awful anxiety attacks (because of our future and work reasons). It drove me crazy as well, dealing with constant sobbing on the phone, fights, and other drama and honestly I don’t know how we made it. Love, and caring. A minor part of it was certainly that I was worried she would hurt herself if i broke up with her. It was a genuine fear, to me, as she was alone in her flat and not meant to meet anyone at all. We had full on shouting matches, which was awkward as I was staying with my parents to help them out. 

It got to the point where, after things calmed down a little in June and we met again, that I said us being long distance was untenable. The problem: I work in France, and she doesn’t speak French. Considering she’s got big ambitions in corporate marketing, that’s really quite tricky especially since we aren’t in Paris where international jobs are more common in that field. Unfortunately my job isn’t in high demand generally, so if I find something I’d better stick to it, and it pays well. I can’t easily up and leave either, basically. 

So she in, in October. Moved here with all of her stuff into a flat I’d found us. By February, having not found work and panicking about it, especially considering the headhunters writing to her weekly to get work back home, she was on a plane back home for “a while”, working some contracts and getting a bit of money, and recovering mentally from her “depression” and general sadness she felt here. At her mum’s house, a certified lunatic who shouts at her how worthless she is for not having kids and a house at 33. I totally get the need for a career, but I really think she’s dead wrong about being able to recover mentally if she’s with her mum. And the distance is just driving a wedge between us. Also, I don’t get to talk about sex stuff at all all of a sudden, because it either makes her sad (because she feels it hurts me she isn’t interested at all) or uncomfortable - and again, I accepted, apologised and stop mentioning whether I was horny, playfully asking for a boobie picture or even mentioning webcam “sessions”. This was in the interest I had to make her feel better so that we could be together again. Of course, the result is, there’s actually an increasing list of off-limits stuff, that I can’t talk about. I can’t say I’m feeling sad or finding it difficult, because it triggers her anxiety, which also comes with an enormous feeling of guilt she gained after cheating on me years ago. It eventually caused our breakup and two year hiatus, though by that point I’d said fuck it all, gone on a bender, and done my own share as well. We’d been engaged at the time, she feels like she threw that away. When we agreed to try again, we agreed we’d live together a year, and then get engaged for a very short time and get married. It’s obvious to me that she wishes we already were married, though. But I’m just not ready for that now; I was back then but I have only one rule about relationships I learned long ago and still learn more about all the time: no bitterness. If I get bitter or am with a bitter person, I can’t stay, I’m far too susceptible to it. I can see her getting there and I’m really scared. We’ll meet for the first time since February this coming week. I’m not even looking forward to it. A dark part of me is sure she’s going to be complaining the entire time, ruining any potential for fun. It’s an exaggeration but a legitimate fear. And then, if that’s what I see, and if there are bitter comments and opinions, I’ll know. 

But I don’t really believe it will be that bad. Of course not. What’s more likely is a relative balance with extra tears at random moments, but that doesn’t get us out of our catch-22. Short of somehow finding an awesome job for her through luck, I don’t know how to end this limbo and get her to come back. I make good money. There must be a way for her to make a living here too, remotely for example. But it’s hard to find and she has no hope within herself, so I’m worried she does t really try. She has started going to therapy. 

Nobody, from family, friends, best friend or colleagues understand why I’m keeping it up. They always act super confused when i explain the situation (obviously not revealing all to everyone). They don’t understand the bond we’ve shared for so long I guess. Or they do, but they believe I’m overpaying for it. I don’t know… I have a gaping hole where she should be. A head missing from my shoulders when I watch Netflix. A partner in crime while shopping. I’ve even put off buying my new glasses til this weekend so she can help me choose. However, not for fun, but because I started worrying I’d buy a pair she wouldn’t like. I feel like everything I do will be analysed for hidden motives, when she’s having a really bad day.  Lately, the messenger chats have gotten colder. The lack of topics to talk about that aren’t dangerous means we’re repeating conversations and arguments. I’m so worried I’ll get bitter if I realise it won’t work out, and I’ll feel like I wasted my time on her. That I’ll be cynical and unhappy, incapable of living alone, but too desperate for women or unable to fall in love with another even though she’s everything I could have wanted. The latter is what happened last time we split up.  I don’t think she’d ever leave my mind. So, I keep going. I try harder to help her through her shit. But I’m home alone, staring at messenger all evening and chatting. I’m cooking for one. That wasn’t the plan, and I’m getting tired. I’m eating too much. Unable to vent the full truth to anyone. I’m losing hope, and I’m scared of what the future will bring.",lonely,I’m in a difficult long-distance relationship and it’s the loneliest period of my life,2021-06-14 04:09:26

2456,towerllama,1623602252,8,"I’m not sure what it is, but people are always deleting me/being flaky on Discord. 

Like, when I first started trying to make online friends and they would ask to add on Discord: “Sure, why not?” Kinda deal. Back then I didn’t know I should CHAT with the person before adding them. So, of course those friendships ended up not working out. No big deal.

So, I started to try chatting(text) with new people first to see how compatible our personalities and whatnot were. Some people I felt a one sided friendship (either/or), some I wasn’t entirely sure since it’s a new person, and VERY rarely I’ll think/believe it’s a two way friendship. 

All three of those types, you know, their gonna ask me to add on Discord. Ask ME. I don’t ask people to add on Discord unless I’m naive enough to think there’s a chance of real friendship, which again, is rare. And of course there was my growing distrust of Discord + “trying to be friends” over time. 

- The one sided friendships, it’s like, we chatted a bit, and then we add on Discord and it fizzles out. I just don’t feel like messaging them at all, because well, I have no interest in them. But all 3 of them are still added on my Discord. We just dont talk or do anything together. 

- The new person ones, uhh, as far as I can tell, we both usually end up doing low effort. Were simply not clicking at all. Roughly 9/10 times, poof their gone on Discord. They asked me to add them and then they poofed first, without saying anything. BUT, maybe I wasn’t putting my best foot forward or something. Maybe there’s communication failure or sometimes it’s simply not meant to work out. I’ll admit I’ve deleted one of these one time, and I learned from it.

- The 2 way friendships ( or should I say 1 way), we CHATTED first right? And we’re actually clicking and having an engaging back and forth conversation with banter, pop culture references, and stupid shit. So much so, I’ll be thinking to myself, “wow”, I ACTUALLY want to be friends with this person. AND they seemed interested/stimulated from the dumb shit I say, so, guess what? &gt;!They mention Discord first / They ask me to add them on Discord.!&lt;

One of these new “2 ways” just poofed on me today and I just can’t. I literally sent them 2 messages in 2 days, basically, “Hey, been up to anything?”. Trying to show that I’m interested in chatting. Because if I say nothing and they say nothing, then, you know. Anyways, they reply basically “Yeah Ive been busy with such and such, Im free”. POOF. Deleted me. I was even writing a reply before realizing they were long gone.

So, either I’m missing a very basic and obvious social cue, or, I don’t fucking know. But I can’t use Discord anymore. *I’ve learned that no matter how much vetting I do beforehand, people can’t be trusted.* And I don’t want to believe for a second that the 2 ways people were being manipulative or ungenuine. I respect them a lot.

.....If I asked THEM to add me and they deleted me afterwards, I could probably rationalize it. But

no going on the beach, no taking to some amusement park Or just hang out. Nope.

cause it can be different you know. 
I don't need them to listen to my problems or some shit.

I just wanna hang out and have fun. 
But they have other friends aswell they're hanging out with. Never me, without the alcohol. 

Ofc it's okay for them to have other friends and do stuff


But I just want. Someone to be my friend

I can't keep doing this. 
I can't just 
I can't. Nope.

I'll talk to anyone about ANYTHING I'm all about spreading love and kindness. I honestly believe the world needs more of it... anyways...  I have been on this Earth 26 years now. I enjoy gaming, listening to music, vibing, horror, and just talking about random shtuff.

I like watching videos on horror and conspiracies as well especially what has been going on lately.

Listen, this pandemic has made things difficult, and I'm just extending my hand in friendship for people who may need or want a friend they can talk to and just vibe with.

If you're interested DM me.. tell me a little about yourself..

I'll talk to anyone about anything. I don't care if you're an alien from the planet gloopenglop or if you believe you're being mind controlled I'll respond to all! If not I hope you are doing well and hope you have a wonderful week.

I’m currently a college student that just moved back to my hometown to finish my schooling here. But these last two years especially have been hell. I lost my mom a year and a half ago now and I’m single, sad and don’t know what I want to do. I thought I was working towards something or a goal but it seems like everyone I set a goal it always goes to waste. I feel like crap inside because I want even able to be with my mom when she died since I was living so far away and had to be told through Skype she passed so last time I got to even hug her was like almost three years ago as she passed right before I was supposed to come home for Christmas. I’m single and in ever relationship I either get ghosted or only wanted sexually so never really experienced a real relation ship. I can’t really talk to my family as my dad is too depressed and only recognizes his feelings and my siblings are much older so they don’t relate to me and honestly invalidate me on everything. I tried therapy but my therapist would always miss sessions even though they were virtual or just take calls in the middle of a session so that made me feel as if they didn’t even care. Tried medicine to help but had passed out twice on those and for a while just layer in bed with a sinking feeling just trying to pass each day with sleep. But now that I’ve moved back home I’m beginning to feel this depression again as my moms not home anymore so it’s usually just me and my dog since my dad travels a lot and seems like my friends here have their own friend groups they are close to now. I guess I am wondering if anyone whose felt this way how did you get out of it or do you ever just one day feel relieved and truly happy? As I know I should be grateful I have a roof over my head and pretty much everything I want I have or can buy but it doesn’t seem to really make me happy.",lonely,Where do I turn to?,2021-06-13 18:00:34

\------

Hi.

I'm a massive sadboi. About 18 months ago, I accepted my deficiencies and started seeking help. I'm 28 (male) and I'm aware I'm an idiot for not having the self-awareness earlier. But I'm putting in the genuine effort now. I'm going down the textbook list of things to try to get better:

**Therapy** \- 18 months in. 12 months with the first, who suggested a switch (so basically, I got dumped by a therapist). I like the one I have now.

**Medication** \- took a while but agreed. I want to say it's helping but I'm not really sure. I've switched antidepressants once.

**Exercise** \- I swim 3-7 times a week, religiously. Swim helps a lot. I also play a lot of sports. I know exercise is big for sadHumans.

**Social Life** \- A lot of sports. But I like sports because you get to interact with humans without really having to interact with them (get me?). Idk if that counts as social though.

And I have friends. Pretty solid happy, smiley facade IRL. Integrated into 3 groups, but I wouldn't call them close-close. I'll get invited to bachelor getaways/parties, but won't be asked to be a groomsman. Does that make sense? But I am mega grateful and adore my friends, and they're all dope as hell.

Work-life - Yes, I have a full-time job. I've also switched industries but wouldn't say it helped much.

**Hobbies** \- Yes, hobbies galore. Sports and books are my stables. A lot of sitcoms and romComs too

**Transcendental thingz:**

music: not musical at all, but started learning formally recently. I like it. It's hard. It's hard to things that you're not good at.

journaling: hate it, but I bullet journal. Not sure if this counts.

yoga and meditation: tried it, not for me.

Religion: no, not willing to try atm. I am agnostic. Sometimes I believe in fate and the universe and all that romCom stuff 😅

**Dating**: Tried apps for the 1st time a few months ago. Got off recently. Double-edged sword. And my reliance on it for validation was growing exponentially.

**Education**: Yes, went to grad school (didn't finish Ph.D. though, but MS yes)

**Unhealthy coping mechanisms**: benzodiazepines and sleeping pills. I try my best to limit my use but always have them within arm's reach.

**Current thoughts on next steps:** I know this sounds crass but I was thinking of trying a hoe phase. Never really had one. And maybe dance classes. Idk, any suggestions?

Any advice/suggestions?

2509,pearlxzildjian,1623562832,1,"Hi.

I'm a chef/kitchen manager and I can work some insane hours some days/weeks. This isn't what I want to vent about, though. 

My feelings of loneliness stem from a relationship I was in until last November and it's been kind of the driving factor of how I'm feeling now ever since. I really liked her, maybe even loved her, but I pushed her boundaries too far because I'm very inexperienced with relationships and she is polyamorous. Long story short, she said I was controlling, which is true. I didn't know how to handle the entire polyamory thing, and to be honest, I still don't quite understand it. 

Anyways, I wake up, work out, go to work, come home, and talk to nobody for the most part. My off days are typically spent alone, other then when I reach out to friends who live out of town. I've been told by a lot of people that I should move, but I'm paralyzed where I am. 

I don't know if it's comfort, the amount of effort I've put into my current job, my parents being close, or if it's just a large chunk of all of those, but it creates an actual paralysis of thought, and any efforts to go anywhere else are quickly muted. This in turn, leaves me feeling quite lonely. 

I live in a VERY small town, and dating isn't easy at all. I know I'm not the type of person that the girls around here want, which is fine. I've tried using tinder and other apps, but trying to make a date actually happen feels impossible. I literally have to take off work for these dates because matches are 50+ miles away. 

It feels like I'm complaining and that there's a simple solution in what I'm describing, but my mind puts blinders to it and I'm just not 100% sure why. Maybe I just need to talk about it more often, but I hate to do this because I know how annoying all of this sounds. 

I just feel lonely after a long ass day of work when I come home to a quiet house and just try to decompress. And it sucks. I've only got my head to talk to because I don't want to burden others with my problems.",lonely,"Really, just need to vent.",2021-06-13 15:40:32

Whenever I remember something painful, I just want to cry. I feel mentally weak and it disgusts me that I've become a useless individual. 

The doctors gave precribed me antidepressants, but I feel like I shouldn't take it. Because I'd become reliant on these drugs and it'd prove that I'm weak. These drugs won't solve my depression because only a change of lifestyle would improve this. 

But at the same time, I feel like I need the drugs because I just feel so unhappy and desperate. I need some answers, what do these antidepressants really do? Does anyone have experience with this? My doctors just said to take them but I have no idea what will happen.

2530,Daalmaan,1623549330,1,"

I've struggled for years with being isolated and not having a social group. For the last 2 years I was working on a bar with a team of guys around my age who I got on really well with. We would fairly regularly have a few drinks at the end of a shift and sometimes meet up at the pub on days off.

For them I know I was just a work friend, but for me they were the only people outside of my family that I ever interacted with. 

At the end of last October I was made redundant when the bars were basically shut until April. By then I had another job and didn't want to go back after getting abandoned. 

Now I feel so shit. I havent had a decent conversation with anyone other than my mum or brother since last year. I hate my new job (fast food kitchen) and haven't made any friends there. 

Its a mixture of people who have all worked there for years and are quite cliquey, a couple of highschoolers, and the rest are all migrant worker drivers who mostly prefer to speak there own language.

I used to go to work and have long conversations about random stuff all day, make small talk with customers, I could even happily chat with most of the supervisers/managers. I was still alone most of the time, but going to work gave me enough of a social boost to keep the worst of the loneliness at bay.
Now I go to work and sometimes speak to no-one for a whole shift, which means I just don't speak at all for that day. 

This is the worst I've been in years and I feel really hopless and low energy and a bit angry all the time now.

I miss my old job and work friends a lot. I'd love to find people I have things in common with and feel that kind of friendly-ness again outside of the captive audience of a workplace, but I've never had a friend outside of the  work/school type environments in my life.",lonely,When I lost my job I also lost my only friends.,2021-06-13 11:55:30

But you made sure my love was squashed.  My love doesn’t work like that.  I spent four years trying to be in a relationship with someone who obviously hated me and tried to squash my feelings for him at almost every turn.  I suffered a lot.  My love is crazy and stupid.  I guess you get like that if no one plays with you for a long time.

The screwed up part is that I would forgive you.  After all, you made me feel when I was numb, we locked eyes, I head turn now because of you, I hear the whispers a little or is at least aware that they exist, and you looked into my eyes with lust.  I consider all these gifts.

I’ve been trying to say good bye for a long time now.  So I guess I’ll suffer.  So, yeah.  I love you.  But probably because I’m lonely.  So I’ll just listen to anyone else but you by moldy peaches on repeat.  Hopefully it will numb me off to the feeling.

I have bugged my boyfriend for a while about letting me meet his friends, but the pandemic kind of ruined that. Last night he invited me out, and I just couldn't go. We were grabbing food and his friend finally texted us with the details about celebrating his last day at work. Earlier I had said I would go, but in the moment I just couldn't do it.

 I said he could go but wanted to head home because I felt like the girls there would judge me for how I was dressed and looked. I live in a city where the women generally go all out when they hit the town, and I had no makeup on and just generally felt gross. He tried to tell me it was fine, but I just didn't have the energy to meet anyone new and much less feel judged. I never used to care about that kind of thing, but now it really bothers me.

I don't know if it's because I am living outside my home country and in a place where people really care about appearances, but I feel like everyone is judging me. All the time. I miss my old friends and just feel so alone here. The pandemic definitely made this worse. But I also don't have a ready place to go back to in my home country and just feel constantly in limbo. Everyone thinks I'm living this awesome life and on a constant vacation, but deep down I wish I had a good relationship with my family and a solid friend group.

 I was once an outgoing person with tons of friends, and now just don't have any interest in meeting anyone else. I feel like I am always comparing myself to everyone and not good enough. I don't know if I'll ever get my self-esteem back.

Since birth I've been bullied and belittled by classmates, strangers and family members alike. The few ""friends"" I've made have all disappeared and haven't spoke to me for years and I think I've realised with my last one that I'm basically watering a dead plant.

Life in general sucks, it isn't enough for it to be visibly shitty to anyone with more than 2 braincells, but to make it such a lonely and crippling experience for people like me.

What's worse is I can't live my own life because my family won't let me cut the cord and live 100% independently, which runs the risk of making things more toxic.

I'm Goth, but no one I know shares the same subculture, I like Metal, Punk and Grunge and hate mainstream music but my family is the opposite, a show I used to watch went to shit but the one friend I know who used to love it went back on his word when I wanted to speak to him (I talk about the show to strangers on a different subreddit but it's rather bittersweet). I also always hated when people pretend-care to make it look like they're interested in your hobbies.

I'm interested in taking up animation, music composing or even voice acting but considering how things are panning out I doubt I'll be able to chase any of these aspirations. It's a shame because my brain is teeming with ideas but life has really served me a cold dish full of shit.

I have to left school for some personal reason (but I'm gonna go back in September) and since then I always only talk(in friend tones I mean) with my family. 

My parents think I'm a happy person, they always see me smile, laughing, telling jokes, they think I hang out with my friends when I leave the house on the bike, but the truth is that I don't have a destination, I just pedal alone begging God to make me bump into someone like in films and start a conversation to them and become friends. 

When I lost the few friends I had, what I did to feel this? 

I was an asshole, that's why.
We started to see each other less and less as the days passed, cuz I started high school and wanted to meet new people, have cool friends, I thought I would make new friends easily, I thought I would be the funniest guy in the school, the one that everyone would like to befriend, I had the conversation in my mind, jokes too, asking numbers to my classmates to create the class's WhatsApp, look a cool dude, I had all I'm my mind but failed miserably. 

Failed... fuck I didn't even try. 

When I entered the class I felt like a fish out of water, my classmates all looked so different unlike me, all wearing expensive stuff and somehow more mature.

 Am I in the wrong class? I asked. 

They all laughed, staring at me, pointing...and that show it started the first year of my ""unaware journey of loneliness"".
I always seated in the front seats ( of course alone), damn if you had seen me you would probably think I was a sort of genius, I mean, chinese+in front seat, but hell if you are wrong. 

I started to daydream in all the lessons, fuck if it was depressing. 

At the end of the year, I was flunked, I quite was happy about this because I thought since I would have a new class I could have a new opportunity, but again I was so wrong. 

Covid hit Italy fucking hard and all school watched me with a warning, some guys made fun of me, but I didn't care, but one day when I was heading school a group of guys pushed me down from my bike, and one spit at me, 
it was so humiliating and the little will to go to school disappeared. 

Don't know why but they let me pass to another class even with the thing that I didn't go to school for half of the semester. 

Another year started, but I didn't go to a single lesson to school,(i worked with my parent's restaurant)so yep they flunked me again. 

I'm thinking about my life now, I always wanted just a normal job in the office, a wife and some kids, not so pretending I think. 

In the end, I'm writing this and I don't know why (i apologize for my grammar, hope you didn't have a stroke) 
maybe because I want someone to hear my pity story, yeah probably is this. 

I desperately need a friend, with I can hangout fuck I'm such a loser.

This all started a long time ago and nowadays im starting to think that i maybe have depression but who knows. I just have problems at starting things, like for real, even if its just some small task and i it would only take 5 mins i just psychologically cant get myself to do it :|.

But i guess i got a little distracted from the topic of this sub. Well i have two very good friends but that was it and both of them got a girlfriend recently so of course we are doing way less things that usual. Its not like they dont like me or anything, i hope, but they just got better things to do.

Im also terrible at making friends because im very very introverted and in the beginning really weird. Im the typical guy where everyone thinks who the fuck is that because im bad at any kind of social interactions. This doesnt count for someone that is very close to be but for anyone else. I also tried making friends online but im introverted and have much problems at continuing a chat/conversation just because often i dont know how to react. Tried it at specific things like r/GamerPals but that doesnt change anything for me.

But the overall worst is that i dont have a bad life, just no life i like. I have never bullied anyone (i hope) or have gotten bullied and just tried to stay neutral in any way possible. My family is not split up but i dont have a good connection to them. Im by far not rich but i dont have any money problems right now. Im just sitting all day long in my room in front of my PC doing something. I just dont want this life, i want anything else. I dont deserve this life.

I am a very extroverted person (as mentioned in the title) and I love making new friends and having very close bonds with people. The funny thing is I never really fit into a group of people, be it my homeroom, my club and even outside organisations. What is even worse is that I tend to be the one that bring many people together. For instance, my club was really awkward at the birth of it and many were shy, but I was able to break the ice and get things going, only to find myself being outcasted. It didn't happen once or twice. It has happened for the past 19 years of my life. I don't have any friend group , nor do i get invited to any outings, parties, calls, etc. I'd see my club members going out on social media and wonder why wasn't I invited because, literally everybody from my club was there except for me. Similar things happened with my homeroom where they have a separate chat without me , and I'm more or less the loner in the class while everyone else had formed their own cliques. Then maybe I figured something was wrong with the way I behave. Maybe I was too weird, or perhaps I seemed fake. But I could never figure out the actual reason. All of this caused me to overthink way too much ever since I was in grade 4. I developed social anxiety issues and major trust issues with people because I fear that they are always out there to hurt me. And it really doesn't help that I have really shit self-esteem and non-existent confidence.  


On a personal level with people, they tend to follow a consistent cycle:  


We get to know each other--&gt;We click pretty well--&gt;We become close--&gt;We become really really close--&gt;They distance from me

This pattern is very persistent in my life and it kinda induced fear of abandonment in my life and when I act on that fear, it just makes the person want to go away even further. I fear getting close to people now but I am so lonely without that connection.   


I also tend to catch feelings for people easily (haha ENFP gang!) and then I become very hyper fixated on my crush such that I throw away my own needs for the needs of them(yea i simp hard lmao) and it usually doesn't work out because 99% of the time I get brother/friend-zoned and I hurt myself (not self-harm) because of my own actions.

So what about the 1% you didn't get friend zoned? I'm glad you asked(not really). I was in 4 serious (to me) relationships so far in my life. And all 4 cheated on me. I tend to be very vulnerable around my S/O and things like this really break me. My anxiety skyrocketed many times and it is further exacerbated by my ADHD. I really started to question my self-worth because of this. Am I not good enough for anyone? Even to be friends? Am I that bad that I had to be cheated on, on of all my previous relationships? 

What really broke me was my most recent relationship. I wasn't looking for love actively when it happened. She chased after me and somehow I fell for her. It was going really good, till she started going on and on about her ex. It was as though she still had feelings for him. So I asked, and she admitted to it. Me being stupid and thinking it was fine, I decided to continue with the relationship. My insecurities and self-esteem issues kicked in. Because I knew one darn day, she would go back to her ex. I did a big stupid and projected my insecurities onto her and the relationship. She handled it pretty well. And then she meets Guy B (not her ex) and they hit off pretty well and I can sense that the attention and care she gave me shifted there slowly but surely. I talked to her about it and she made it clear nothing was going on. Fast forward a few week and she goes to his house and they made out and shit. She confessed to me that she cheated. And dumb move #2 , I decided to still continue because I was so in love with her and, I didn't want to be alone. Long story short, she spent more time with Guy B and less time with me , and one fine day, she wanted to break up for other reasons which are completely valid and I agreed. It was a clean one. We agreed that we would re-continue the relationship once the reason she gave was sorted out. What put me off was that they started to hangout more and I was prioritised less, and their convos were rather inappropriate. Another fine day, she told me that she doesn't have feelings for me anymore and sees me as a close friend. I felt so hurt and used. It made me wonder if I was just a rebound because she broke up with her ex one month prior to our relationship.  


Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, my best friend also decided to end things with me because of an incident which I take full responsibility because I fucked up big time: I let my insecurities get the better of me which unexpectedly hurt her

To add on to this pile, my home situation isn't great either. Parents are constantly arguing over the same issue since 2001 (yes , 21 fucking years over the same shit) and the words they use aren't pretty. I often end up breaking down really hard or running away for awhile because it was really toxic. Sometimes it makes me wonder why they even married each other. They openly claimed that they don't love each other etc etc. We never ate dinner together at the dinner table in my life. It makes me really sad that we never got to do stuff that other families do.

(2007) reported that, after controlling for social network size and frequency of social activity, perceived social isolation is predictive of cognitive decline and risk for Alzheimer's disease.[4] Moreover, the social interactions of individuals who feel socially isolated are more negative and less subjectively satisfying.[5] This contributes to a vicious cycle in which the person becomes more and more isolated.",lonely,It’s ageing me faster,2021-06-12 22:47:09

I am going to go on a pathetic rant.   I am 35 years old making it even more pathetic.   

I have always had a hard time expressing positive emotions towards people.   I am so afraid the feelings will not be reciprocated. I have extremely low self confidence. 

I rarely develop emotions of love towards people in a romantic way.   Probably only three times in my life.   Every time I wait to long to express my feelings to that person, and they don’t feel the same way at that point if they ever did.

I have done it again. I have waited too long.   I have not told them yet, but it’s been too long.    

I bit of the backstory.    I am an American living in South Korea.  I meet this girl, she is Ukrainian for the first time around five years ago.   But at that time we just knew of each other, we didn’t really see each other.   I moved back to the USA for a little over a year, and then moved back to Korea around a year and a half ago.    Since I moved back we have spent a lot of time together.   Seeing movies, going on trips, etc.     I learned two weekends ago she now has a boyfriend.   He lives in Korea, but in a further away city then either of us do.   

I still hung out with her two weekends in a row, we are still friends.    We were supposed to hang out again today, but she said her boyfriend was coming too, so I canceled.    I could not stand seeing her with a a boyfriend. I just told her I didn’t feel well.    I am not sure she made a connection between him going and me canceling or not. She seems upset with me for canceling.

Now I am home depressed and not leaving my bed, looking to strangers for comfort.   I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, sympathy, or if just need to get the feelings out because I have no one to talk to.   Sorry for the lengthy message",lonely,I’m lonely and sad.

I never joined clubs besides one and not for long so I met few people who turned out to be acquaintances. Now I just spend most of my week home and just online and feeling really sad and lonely. I feel there is something wrong with me if I made and kept so few friends. It honestly feels like I have no friends the majority of the time. I hate the most that my lack of friends made me infatuated with finding a partner which turned out horrible. Due to certain experiences I trust people less and am unwilling to meet people in online dating apps because those apps only feel like the only option for me to find someone.

The last time I can remember even just feeling normal and saying whatever floated into my mind to someone was on the comedown of an acid trip, and I'm pretty sure the person I was tripping with didn't really know how to respond. I was kind of opening up about a lot of stuff that's been weighing me down forever now and troubles in my family, which I never talk about because I assume people don't wanna hear it. 

The short interactions I have walking my dog or just out and about seem to end so abruptly even when people seem friendly and willing to talk more because I have no idea how to keep them going. I try to be nice and pleasent, and can think of stuff I could've said after the fact but in the moment I'm just focused on what I'm doing so I'm always really quiet and can't keep it going at all. 

I just remember as a pretty young kid being able to have a conversation out of nowhere with people. Being able to hang out with no goal or anything specific to do. But now I can't tell if my presence is welcome at all. I always feel like nothing would change if I wasn't there or like I'm bringing down the mood somehow. I feel like I don't know how to even be myself around other people anymore. And I think that's the root of my loneliness. But I have no idea how to do it anymore.

Our families are close together and for the most part we’re family. Eventually I worked up the courage to tell her my feelings, and she said that she had a crush on me as well. We went on for a few months without changing much, only knowing that we liked each other. Eventually I asked her out in a casual pizza date and we walked down a boardwalk on a lakefront at sunset (I was pretty proud of setting up an iconic first date). Everything went well and we had a good time. When I asked her a couple weeks later if she would be up for a second date sometime, she said that she’d have to think about it. As soon as we were apart, she sent me a text saying that she thought that she had liked me but realized after our date that she didn’t feel that way. I was heartbroken for weeks afterwards, feeling like she didn’t trust me enough to tell me at least on a call, and had no idea what I did wrong. After months of accepting that she didn’t like me like I liked her, I decided that I would move in. But now, months after we stopped being a “thing” I still feel like I did something wrong and that something is wrong with me, especially since I can’t stop thinking about what we could have been.

I was abused by parents who choose drugs over raising their kids. I suffered brain injuries growing up. (Cocaine is a hell of a drug i guess wouldn't know) I was mentally abused as well thats what still hurts me. I'm now 24, never had any support I live in housing I'm on disability, work gives no hours so I'm in poverty and can't save money. No one ever checks in on me I can't even afford to save for a car I just wish people would want me in their life but not even my own family wanted me. All my siblings are *normal* they have Kids, apartments, cars, and good jobs. I just don't get why they seem so fine after everything we went through for a decade in a half week for me until I ran away. And why the good part of my family left just doesn't care about me a 5 minute call here and there from me aunt just to say hi. But never actually wanting me over her place. I'm the odd one out in life and the loneliness is unbareable. Living in housing makes me feel like no one wants to associate with me.

To cut it short: certain Factors of our relationship caused issues that could not be resolved, and As a result I decided it be best if we would see other people. Despite how much I care about her I want to do the right thing, and while we kept in touch from time to time she of course is dating someone else and I’m fine with that. But I’ve felt so alone and angry, not because of her though. I felt angry because for her it’s easy to find someone, i’m not a guy that people usually take a second look at, and I’ve always been just distant I guess. And I have a lot of friends but I talking to them is different than talking to someone you like that also has feelings for you. It’s not bad to not be in a relationship, but without having someone that you know will be there for you is hard. I’m afraid of this, I hate this, and I just wanna try and find someone I like, or have my feelings returned, but it feels like people dont care or wouldn’t notice if I’m around and it can be unbearable.

What is it about me? I think I am okay, maybe not mainstream fun but I can be really friendly and smart if you appreciate the things I appreciate.

Earlier I got upset because he told me that our weekend fishing plan might not happen because his friends might now come. I don't fish, he does. But I was looking forward to it because it's one of the few times that we'll actually do something together. Like something different from what we usually do... which is stay home, he plays on his games while I just do whatever on my phone. He promised the 2 of us and our pup would still go evenif his friends don't come. I got irritated because he never makes plans just for him and I. But if it's for his friends, he would totally plan something and do it. Anyway, we argued a little (no I didn't mention the friend part lol) and he left to ""gas up"" the car. It's now 12:16am as I write this. It's been 5 hours since he left and I haven't heard from him. I haven't called or texted to check either because I feel that I'd just get irritated even more.

I've been going through a lot in the last couple of weeks as well. Work, wedding planning during covid (which makes planning harder), and health issues. I think I'm overwhelmed trying to get my shit straight but I feel like I'm going through it all on my own. I just don't know how to handle it right now. My mind barely gets any rest too.

 Being with someone who doesn't really understand depression is really hard. I mean, he gets that I have it but he doesn't know how to deal with it and leaves me alone when I'm having a moment. I've been open about my depression and I've explained how he could help me. Though I think he's just tired of my shit that he just doesn't mind me, does his own business and doesn't even check up on me. 

I'm mentally and physically tired. I want to take a walk outside and get some air, but it's too late and might be unsafe to walk on my own. I can't bring my dog either because last time we walked at night, a skunk almost chased us lol. I do feel a little better with my dog around. Sure, a little less lonely.

Somedays, I sit in my room and listen to music for hours, watching useless fucking videos and wasting time. 

Other days, I teach myself computer programming for web development. You can get a job in web development without a degree, but you need a good portfolio. And that’s what I plan to do. More and more people are getting web dev jobs without degrees, so it is doable, but it’s not easy. 

But what am I supposed to do? Teach myself web development for 14 hours a day? My brain would implode.

She has been screwing around with this one girl for a while. I'm not a fan, but have only offered support even though she fucked around with other people, lied ab it, AND is now pregnant.

Its my last day in the area, I'm moving for work and will be 3/4 hours away from her/home. She committed to helping me move (which was a big ask) but then bailed. She then committed to hanging out with me on my very last night of being around and big shocker bailed. She's at this girls house instead.

I’m 20, girl, basically a lesbian/maybe bi idk (if you’re a girl looking for friends, I will NOT come on to you, too awks), live in UK, at uni, study a science related course, enjoy watching YouTube, enjoy watching people game, currently playing RDR2 myself but I am a very casual gamer, used to play a lot of minecraft as a kid so perhaps I’m actually a hardcore gamer (tempted to go back to minecraft now since summer holiday is around), I love any film in the conjuring universe despite it scaring the hell out of me but I also love disney films too, mainly watch series over films (Brooklyn 99, Modern Family, OITNB, RuPaul, Family Guy, Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor), listen to a mixture of music (NF, twenty one pilots, 5 seconds of summer, blackbear, anything by Hans Zimmer - whatever makes my ears happy tbh 😄)

Realise that a lot of that makes me sound boring and immature but I’ve isolated myself for a while which knocked any productive hobbies out of reach for now... or maybe I am just boring 😄

It’s probably worth mentioning that if you’re looking for a relationship then it’ll won’t happen unless we are solid friends first

Me remembering their birthdays, their interests, their personal problems, where as they know very little about me happens on a regular basis. Today I found out one of my best friends is going on a vacation, when I asked when, she replied: ""Oh, yeah I haven't told you, in two days"". Meanwhile everyone in the room knew, even newer people to the ""friend"" group.  
I'm not even sad or anything about it. Just kinda feel blegh. I am happy that they have a lot of friends and people in their lives, everyone deserves that. I guess I'm a little bit envious because I'd like someone in my life who cares about me.  
Soon I will be graduating from college, going to be looking for a new job. I wonder if I will meet someone there, who knows.

I'm an 18 year old guy with an okay amount of friends IRL, but there are always things that i feel more comfortable discussing semi-anonymously. I had a great online friend who i chatted with often, but one day she deleted all her socials and hasnt come back. So now i'm looking for a new friend to share the best and worst parts of my psyche with. 

I'm a very reflective person, quite accepting as well. 

I'd prefer for you to be female, and slightly older, because i for some reason connect better with young adults. 

I'm not asking you to be female because i want nudes, but because i'd like a female perspective on the problems i face, as i have almost exclusively male friends.

2728,FortunaMajor04,1623438210,1,"Hey. I don't even know how to start this. I was born into a wealthy but very small family. I moved around a lot due to my parents jobs for my whole childhood as well as early adult hood. I am now in my early twenties and study at one of my countries top universities. One would say that my life must be somewhat ""desirable"" as I have financial security, I am enjoying a very good education and I am actually getting along very well with girls and have a lot of one night stands. But there's this one thing that really bothers me for years - the realisation that I, de facto, have 0 friends.

For the majority of my life my parents were to blame in all honesty, as I was never able to maintain a steady social environment with all the moving around. But since I'm going to University things have not really changed whatsoever. I'm no Brad Pitt or something but every girl I've ever met told me that I'm handsome and almost all female encounters resulted into sex. I must admit that I kind of use sexual encounters with girls to cope with my extreme loneliness.

I wear a lot of designer clothes and care a lot about my appearance but I'm actually a very grounded person and never judged people for what they do or don't have or where they're coming from. I'm pretty much open for anything and anyone. Every time I get into a social situation with other guys it results in one of the following outcomes:

\- They are either ""intimidated"" by my ""social background"", the way I dress, the car I drive, my educational background etc. and try to avoid &amp; leave me out of plans as they do believe that their plans are ""beneath my standards"" - (I just want to clarify again that I, in all honesty, never brag about anything, never talk down on others and never see myself as better than anything or anyone. I've also tried to dress differently, behave differently, meaning in terms of articulation and stuff, and it actually worked for some time to fit in better with specific social groups I was in contact with back then but broke ties with them in the end because I do not want to change the person that I am just to fit in)

\- They get extremely jealous because I'm mostly the one approached by girls in social situations and / or due to the facts mentioned above and start to talk shit behind my back

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know why it's so hard for me to have not even one male friend. I love football, I love video games, I go to the gym, I'm pretty much just a normal dude like everyone else and I'm fed up clinging to girls just to get approval and validation and to keep me somewhat sane due to lack of social interactions.

Perhaps there are some people here in similar situations who might want to share their secrets how they made new friends in their 20's.

So I'm a 13-year-old kid in an American middle school in New Hampshire. I have stopped attempting to make friends since 4th grade. Currently (as of the time of this writing) there are 20 people walking around the room and conversing, yet I am not. I'm too scared to because I probably look like a fat, pimple scarred balloon. Currently I'm sitting at the edge of the room in a chair on Reddit instead of socializing. HOWEVER, I have a bunch of ONLINE friends that I chat to, so I wonder if I NEED the physical people, or if I can ignore them completely, and talk to ONLINE friends, through voice chat or text messaging, plus I have video games, so do I NEED humans, or can I just ignore humans entirely? Personally, I would rather ignore the humans entirely, but I would like to know the better choice

2733,infernalwretch,1623435379,1,"I am feeling a certain adrenaline, experiencing a sort of fight or flight mode. Not as an instinct for self-preservation, but as an instinct for human companionship and connection. My mind has been on overdrive for more than 30 hours. Not letting me sleep, having all these urgent, intense thoughts. Reading through all this stuff on the internet. All in an attempt to find connection, to escape this loneliness. Since the beginning of humanity, it has been unsafe for humans to be alone. Being around people and having people like you contributes to your safety and security. This, along with the sexual instinct (the other social incentive), is why we naturally crave connection. Why we long for people to like us. These are the instincts I have been feeling lately. It's like my caveman brain thinks I'm in danger because I'm alone, and it won't let me relax until I find someone who makes me feel wanted and secure. I know that sounds dumb but it's how I feel. I literally wasn't able to sleep last night and my heart is racing.

 I think it just might not be natural for a person to be this alone. We live in a culture that is still very much based on the idea of the nuclear family. If you're an adult you either live alone or with a romantic partner, so if you can't get a romantic partner you basically just have to live alone. Although, a lot of young people do live with roommates, especially college students. That's not really a solution for me though, because it would probably be just as hard for me to find people willing to be my roommates as it would be for me to find a romantic partner. Heck, even WHEN I WAS in college, I failed to find anyone to be roommates with me and I had to live in an apartment alone for the last two years of school. Those were probably the loneliest two years of my life, especially because they were during Covid so I wasn't even going to classes. I was literally just inside by myself every day, completely isolated. The only time I ever left the apartment was like once a week to go to therapy and the store. It didn't help that the weather is shit for half the year where I live. Every day I would wake up all alone in that cold empty apartment and open the blinds to gaze out on the frozen wasteland hellscape in which I was living. 

Anyway, back to the culture thing I was talking about. I don't know much about history, but would it be accurate to say that we're living in an isolated culture compared to the rest of history? I mean, in the early human times I think societies were based more on communities and the communal raising of children (i.e. the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" phrase, if you know what I mean?), whereas now they are based on isolated family units (i.e. the nuclear family). And it may be different in different parts of the world, but I'm in the United States so that's the culture I'm mainly referring to. Maybe we are not evolved for this isolated societal structure. Maybe it lends itself to loneliness. I for one feel no sense of community whatsoever, and what little family I have feel very distant. I literally never see or speak to any of my neighbors. It's like we don't exist to one another. Most of the houses in this neighborhood could be empty for all I know. 

I guess the one thing that did give me a sense of community was college, but now it's over, and I missed out on those last two years of being in a community because of Covid. And yet, who am I kidding? I still felt profoundly lonely when I was surrounded by all those people because I didn't fit in with any of them, and barely anyone wanted to talk to me. But it was still better than nothing, and I will never again be among so many people my age, even if I'm able to get a job. I should have been able to find a home among them. We were all artists, so we were all like-minded people, right? Turns out I couldn't even fit in with other artists because I'm just that much of a sperg. Before college, my mom used to tell me that when I went to college I would find my tribe because there would be people with common interests, but apparently being an artist wasn't enough to make me one of them. Art school has social structures and friend groups, just like high school. The main difference is that people are more interesting and likeable.

Anyway, yeah. I'm fucking lonely and it's exhausting. I guess I just realized that I constantly feel a sort of vulnerability and uncertainty because I have so few secure relationships. In fact, the only people who I trust and who I feel like are truly there for me are my parents (even my sister seems to want nothing to do with me). But even they are usually unavailable because they have their own lives. I wonder what it must be like to have a big family or friend group or social network, where you always have someone to turn to, someone to lean on, and where you have the opportunity to support others as well. The example I think of is a few weeks ago when I had to move out of my college apartment. I had to do it all alone and make two trips there and back (it's four hours away) to bring back all my crap. Neither of my parents could help because they were both busy. The average person doesn't have to do this sort of thing because they have friends and connections, so the whole thing was this great huge physically and emotionally exhausting reminder of just how alone I truly am. It hurt.",lonely,"I think my loneliness may be related to a sort of subconscious fear about the nature of being alone as a human.

I love all kind of arts in general, I adore traveling and my biggest dream is to travel all around the world one day with friends and loved ones ( maybe meet a traveling buddy in here and who knows ,we can get to travel together and experience the world together 😁) I love going for walks around town and near nature- the beach ,to the cinema, cooking and food(huge foodie), and wanna try food and different cuisines from all around the world as long as learn about  different cultures . So far love asian(specially japanese,Chinese,indian)and Mexican  cuisine most
I have an extreme passion and interest in nature and everything about nature is my peace of mind and soul!! I'm a girl of nature 😆🌸🌳🌿
The moon the stars(I love stargazing)the ocean,dancing on my own when nobody's watching 😝,singing,romance(hopeless romantic),learning about new cultures of the world,new languages,meditating,
I love psychology and searching all about our mindset,mentality,personalities etc ( I'm an INFJ personality type for those who wonder) 
I wanna be that helping hand in changing the world! I believe that a human being and specially mind  has that power ! 
I'm extremely kind,affectionate,(love hugs,cuddles,kisses ,holding hands and all that ☺️) sarcastic and funny,mature,extra emotional ,artistic,kind,respectful,romantic,caring,clingy(in a good way) loving,humanly,patient,brave,strong,I tend to be flirty some times so hope u don't mind that.
 I'll probably love you if u send me memes ,funny videos ,vines and stuff or tell me a joke or joke about everything together 🤣 I love deep and endless conversations but at the same time also sitting in silence with someone and enjoy each other's presence on the phone or IRL,
I'm also really sensitive,and a huge dreamer ! 
I combine an old soul,in an adults body,with the heart,giggles,laugh and enthusiasm of a little kid :) 
I'll always be a little kid at heart 💜 so let's be kids together ✨
I'm looking for alike people with the same mindset,heart,goals ,dreams-aspirations in life,people to help me and one another be a better version of ourselves,which I've found to be extremely rare specially nowadays.. so most of the time I'm a loner and alone which I both have found to love and enjoy ,and it's needed in life for me(specially as an empath) but at the same time I crave companionship,love,kindness,intimacy,and affection.
 I combine the urge to travel all around the world with the comfort of sitting on my bed or sofa with a cup of tea ( huge tea lover) listening to soft music ,meditating,or lullabies at the same time ! I love reading poetry to others or stories and Id also love if someone did that for me too🥺
By that,I admire and feel an intense attraction towards: oldsouls,kind, affectionate,empathetic,adventurous,patient,supporting,understanding, respectful,clingy(in a good way)  sensitive,inteligent,sarcastic,funny,loving ,people with good manners,fellow hopeless romantics,artists,gamers,animal and nature lovers,travelers, philanthropists..also looking for that pure,special one in a lifetime unconditional love and my soulmate 💜 
I'd also love if I found fellow gamers to spend our time gaming together,to watch cartoons,movies -tv shows and gossip about them,someone who prefers  calls to texting like I do so we can get to know each other and bond through that,someone to fall asleep on the phone with while listening to each other's voices, to music or anything..
Its also important for me that someone is healthy and strong  mentally,physically and spiritually as I'd like to be surrounded by supportive and understanding  people and relationships towards my illnesses and disabilities and fights.what I mean by that is that I think it would be better if someone isn't also sick like me as for the fact that we woudnt be much of a help and support for each other(even though we'd understand each other)but- and we both would need someone to uplift us,be our rock and strength,light,and encourage us and help us throughout our darkest times with our fights and daily life. So I hope u understand me with this🙏🏻
Okay I feel like I'd write a whole book if I keep on writing and I already must have bore u by now ( I also believe that no letter or paragraph can say enough about a person ) so why not message and befriend me and learn the rest by chatting with me(specially on call)? I don't think ull regret it! 🤣 I bet I can be such a good friend(and partner as well💜)  and hoping for someone to do the same for me too.
Come say hey and tell me about ur day,night,vent to me or we can just chill on call have deep convos, listening to music,watch a movie or tv show,sing ,talk about life or anything u want,or even stay silent with each other's presence . I love texting but I'm more of a call person as I said so let's hop on a call! Please no simple ' hi how are you '
Try to impress and be different with a more unique longer message.

 Thank you for spending ur time reading all this and have a lovely day or night wherever you are,and remember,u will always have a Greek friend and someone is rooting for you💜☺️

I'm 29 and have been single since my last relationship that lasted a month when I was 16 or so. I always thought I'm just simply lonely. However, this year I've noticed maybe it's more than that. Now that the summer has started, I see more girls in revealing clothing having fun in the nice weather being all cute, and I notice I feel a much stronger pang of sadness or longing or something. It feels like loneliness, but I am generally very attracted to them. I'm very confused and don't understand what I'm feeling. Am I just being a horndog pervert? I don't feel like I am, but loneliness is not something that gets triggered by cute girls I assume. Loneliness is just general desire to not be alone, so what does attractiveness matter then? I'm sorry if this is a weird question, I've just been so isolated from people that I wonder what my experiences are. I hope it's not just being horny because that would make me feel ashamed.

I live in Zimbabwe which is run by a government which oppress its population (more so the white people than the black people). I don't want to sound racist or anything. This post is not meant to deal with that. So because my family couldn't afford University for me i had to start working at the age of 19, 3 months after leaving school. So basically i work with people that are significantly culturuallly different to me, can't speak english well and that don't understand basic social norms (basically because the white and black population here in Zim are extremely diconnected due to the war in the mid 90's. All my school friends are at Uni, i am doing online uni making basically no money from working as an external auditor (kind of hate my job). There are basically no people my age here to socialise with (especially woman) all i do most weekends is play warzone and watch netflix. Occasionally going out when a friend may be here for a bit or something. But usually my friends don't do anything. They are all honestly just borring, and some of them have made friends at uni which they hang out with which i don't really get invited to things with them. The only bright side is that when i finish my online uni and do my work experience i will be able to go Aaustralia or Canada which will be amazing, but i have to pass my exams which are bloody difficult because i am not smart (not stupid either but not smart). I just feel lonely a lot of the time, struggle to make new friends when i go out (pretty low self confidence). I would love for a woman to walk in to my life but there are probably 3 woman in Zim, 2 are taken and one is on drugs 🤣.

2769,thatkidonsnare,1623401619,1,"I've liked this girl for 3 years and hoped that one day I would get a shot. I asked her out here and there but never came up with anything. It wasn't until new years day of this year. Later that night her and I were talking and I told her my feelings once again at that point just putting up a prayer. She then told me I either move on or keep living like this because we were never going to be more. I didn't sleep that night because I spent that night crying and just thinking while those words ""We will never be more"" echoed around my head. I spent the next two weeks not talking to her or any of my friends that knew her. All I did was push my emotions aside so I could focus on drumline since I wanted to be locked in for my final competitive season. It wasn't until a week before my birthday that she messaged me what I wanted to do for my birthday. So we made plans and I had a little day with her, but in all honesty, I put on a smile that day. I just didn't know how to feel around her so I just tried to enjoy myself. I hung out with her and some friends a few times but fast forward to early March. I go to this little get-together and she tells me that she got a new boyfriend. Felt like I got punched in the gut, but I acted happy for her when really even though I barely got there I just wanted to go home. Once I got home I went straight to bed and just sat there feeling like a shell of myself. I never spoke to her in a legitimate conversation since. In the middle of May, she says this is her last week in town before she leaves for the summer. She made plans with everyone else, but I opted out making up excuses and purposely staying at rehearsals longer just so I can avoid her. I didn't even say goodbye. So now here we are it's now June 11th. It's 1:35 A.M. and the reason I'm writing this is that I truly think the spark I had for her is truly gone. June 9th was my graduation day and she sent me a text congratulating me. I read it and I didn't even feel anything when I read it. She said all the right things, but I just didn't know what to say or do so I just left her on read. I went through graduation without her crossing my mind and I enjoyed my moment for my family and friends. I didn't respond until yesterday, but I was so lost for words that I just sent out some dry ass text. I just deleted it as I was typing that sentence. Honestly I know I went back very far to tell this story, but that's because I needed all of you to understand the most likely downfall of the friendship I have with her. I don't have much to say anymore and I'm most likely going to never see her again. My parents have been thinking of moving to a small town that is about a 4 hour drive from where I live now because of how expensive it is to live in SoCal. It might not happen because they been thinking about this for like 6-7 years. Either way I just don't think our friendship should go on any longer because it was driven by my crush and it's clear to see I don't want to be just friends with her. I'm just hoping that I'm just taking the right steps towards happiness.

2770,PP2704,1623400767,1,"I have been with my girlfriend for the past 3.5 years. As of now we have have met 4 times and everything else has been long distance stuff. She has her entrance exam coming up and obviously that does not allow her to give time to me. I know this is a crucial time for her but I cannot help myself but feel lonely. In turn I begin to feel guilty for just wanting her and that mixed up with me already feeling lonely is pretty much a bad situation to be in. I have never felt like this and don't know how to deal with it. I try to be with my friends but due to COVID that has also been limited.

Last year I got through and joined a medical college which is in her hometown but fuck my luck COVID happened and I'm back at home. I know the amount of stress she is facing and I just have to literally hold back my tears because I know the amount of love she has for me. What right do I have to feel alone in this relationship? After all she has done a lot for me. I can't think of a world without her yet everyday I have to live in this said world.

She usually takes a break a month before her exam comes up and in a week or so we will be on a break. That is to say, no calls, no texts, nothing. I know that I become a distraction and in order for her to succeed she needs time. Uninterrupted quality time is essential for academics.

I mean it's one thing to not be with her. But, why do I also have to lose the right to feel bad ?

I once told her that I was feeling lonely in this relationship. It started to feel one-sided. For context, prior to telling her this for a few months she mostly replied with ""Hmm"", ""Yes"" &amp; ""Ohh"". I felt I was losing her. She then talked me down but her academic fell considerably. I literally saw her weekly performance graph and the week she spent talking to me and making me feel good her scores were drastically lower.

Now the situation has become that I cannot even tell her how I feel. I cannot tell her how much I miss her. I try to be as supportive as I can. But sometimes I just get too lonely. It's useless to talk to my family as they don't even know I have a girlfriend.

Its now just a matter of 50 days. 7 weeks and I can finally talk to her. I guess I just have to keep quiet and suffer for these weeks. Maybe, just maybe I will have her then.

I miss her embrace. I miss her hugs. I miss the way she told me to be forever hers'. She is my cornerstone. My bedrock and she is literally my one and only true support. I have friends but there can only be one cornerstone in my brain. Without her things seem.........brittle.

I wish things were different. I wish she and I could be in the same colleges. But alas, I'm not that lucky and do you know the funny thing? In a few more months she will go to her college which is in all probability not in her hometown.

Have I thought about a breakup? I would be lying if I said no. But even after meeting with new people. Talking to other girls in person. There is no one like her. I mean I KNOW SHE IS THE ONE. Even after having all the thoughts of a breakup, I still want to be with her.

I know I'm not doing her any favors by being with her. In fact it is the complete opposite, she loves me and I love her. For 3 years I waited for her to say ""I love you"" to me. We decided that we cant do this on the phone. So, we waited for our next meeting. I can never forget how she was shivering, but as soon as I held her hand she went calm. She hugged me for 15 mins I think. I don't know. Time just froze. She was so calm and happy and smiling that I knew she loves me more than I can ever love her.

So, it's 50 days now. Counting each day. I will tell her about what I felt, but not now. Everything has it's own time and place. I just have to survive these 50 days.

I think the best thing I can do is push myself into my academics. I mean studying to become a doctor is not easy. Maybe I can even make plans with her. I just have to accept this loneliness because it is for the both of us. I can learn to be independent and she can have a better career. Seems like a win-win situation to me with only one con. I'm gonna miss this beautiful woman terribly. I will have nights in which I will cry. My heart will ache. Literally I'm gonna feel pain in my heart. That sudden drop you feel. Ohh that's a bad one.

I think after writing your thoughts its normal to feel umm .....liberated? So, this is what I feel. I miss my girlfriend. In the start I didn't know what to do but after writing this I think I know what to do.",lonely,Lonely and don't know what to do about it.,2021-06-11 18:39:27

When I even think of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, etc. it makes me sick. These apps are only designed to judge a person by their appearance. Like a mass product, people are displayed, can be rejected or accepted without even beginning to know the person behind it. I think that dating apps and modern trends in general are just extremely toxic: they suggest that we are only something if we conform to a certain image, have something ""to offer"" - the character values, which are much more important in a relationship, are put in the background. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't want to pass everything off to Tinder. It's no different in real life. Even if I meet someone somewhere in public, even if we exchange numbers and write, nowadays you can almost be sure that each person is writing and flirting with several others at the same time. It's totally socially acceptable and okay. Even despite the fact that I have that option myself, I just want to focus on one person at the end of the day.

2784,ThrowMeOveboard,1623392498,1,"Throwaway account because of reasons, also excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes, English is not my primary language and typing on a phone is pain.


So I decided to visit my parents, and now I regret it. Not for the reason that may first spring to your minds, I don't hate my parents, I'm decently fond of them. It's because of some scheduling fuckups and unexpected occurrences instead of spending this day with my family, i get to sit there alone, in this big house, that i used to call my own, with only their cat keeping me company (though company is a rather strong word for he's not a cuddly kind of beast, and i should be glad that he merely tolerates my existence :) ). Normally i'd go hiking but the weather is so piss poor that I'm stuck in here till late afternoon, when the train arrives to take me back to my place. So, with little to none distractions around me, I'm left thinking about my life, and, as you might have guessed, they're not pleasant thoughts.


In half a year I'm turning thirty, my relationship score sits nicely and zero (as in i had no romantic relationships in my life), my sexual exploits are equally unimpressive (as in, there were none, unless you count the things I've done with my hand ;) ), my circle of friends also dwindled rapidly, to the point there's basically no one left. Well at least I can say, that used to have friends, but they have since moved on with their lifes.


And I'd say that's what pains me the most. Everyone around me seems to be sailing forward, struggling occasionally, yes, but advancing nonetheless. And I'm left here, in this tiny canoe, rowing in circles. My sister is making strides her career, she's also starting a family of her own soon, while I'm stuck with my shitty dead end job and no education. And it's embarrassing to admit, that my younger brother, at a tender age of 16 has more dating experience than me, being nearly twice his age.


This lack of experience is my biggest problem, I think. I've struggled in my late teens and early twenties with severe social anxiety and depression. So when my peers were getting the hang of this whole ""love"" business, I was stuck fighting my demons. And while i can proudly say that I've managed to conquer anxiety (heck, back then even posting online was out of the question), I'm afraid depression is here to stay. I brought it back to a manageable level, but still rears its ugly head from time to time, and at this point I fear I have to accept that I'm not going to ever get rid of it completely.


So that's where I'm currently standing, alone. With no one to call a lover, with fewer and fewer friends. And it's not the 'alone' part that's most painful to me, its this ugly fear of missing out, fear of not experiencing something that i thought was one of the most basic parts of human existence. You see, despite all my struggles, I've managed to do things, i've travelled, I've landed a job, kept a job and even managed to quit it and find a new one. I know I CAN do things. But relationships are something that seems to be out of my league. People say they like me, like to be around me, that funny kind and whatnot, but they never stay. They want to be around me, but not too close, and for too long, lest become tainted or something.


It started to clear up, guess I'm going hiking after all. Sorry for the rant, and bye!


Tldr: never been in a relationship, would love to, but it seems i can't, so now I'm going to climb me a (literal) mountain. Cheers",lonely,Sitting alone in my parents home.,2021-06-11 16:21:38
2785,PuckRonin,1623391685,1,"Wonder how many tears have been shed for Eleanor Rigby? Probably enough to fill a lake. She's a line in a song.

How about Vincent Van Gogh, after he was dead? How many while he was alive?

People love dead loneliness. When it's in a movie or a song. Or a story, fictional, or even a real story as long as it long as the loneliness doesn't breathe.

When it breathes it's a problem. And people want nothing to do with it.

Feel it, but if you show any sign of it, any attempt to reach out will push people away. Feeling lonely but not showing any sign of it is a big ask.

Can we feel comfortable being alone? While still being motivated to connect to other people?

But there is the struggle.

""The ecstasy of solitude comes when you are not frightened to be alone no longer belonging to the world or attached to anything.

2787,MixBrilliant7444,1623391267,2,"This evening I’ve had too much time to think and my mind wandered. I’m really in a dark place after recently finding out about a friend getting married and she didn’t invite me to her wedding. This is someone I went to college with, worked in our first market together, lived together, even had nicknames for each other, we live in the same town and I get as adults, we get busy, we hadn’t talked in couple years. I’ve tried reaching out to her in the past, I never got responses. I never did any anything wrong to her, so I don’t get why someone I thought I was so close to would keep me shut out! It hurts a lot. 

Well I got a couple friends that came into town for the said wedding and they said they want to see me while they are here. They been here now several days, I hadn’t heard from them, I would be shocked at this point if they remember to hit me up and get together while they are here.

I’ve lost a lot of friendships for reasons I don’t know! I feel part of it is that it’s proximity. I don’t have the typical 9-5 job so keeping in physical contact instead of just texting is very difficult to do.

Maintaining a romantic relationship has been a tough. Recently I was talking to a woman for a couple months, one day we were totally fine, next day, she didn’t want to talk to anymore. I asked why, she said it had nothing to do with me, it was all her…I’ve heard that story too many times, I believe it’s the woman’s way of backing out cowardly like, and it hurts. The relationship before I got out because the woman was just using me as someone she could talk and vent to, once she got what she needed and she started to feel better about herself, she started talking so mean to me, things that she had control and didn’t go her way somehow was my fault, so I left her.

I’ve been seeing a therapist and she’s always trying to boost me up saying I’m such a great guy. If that were the case, everyone I talk to in my phone and want I get together with, it’s basically “oh I have plans already” but there’s never talk of saying “let’s get together another time”…

The last three birthdays, I have done nothing with nobody, just sat home. I’ve reached out to others about wanting to do something for my bday, nothing…I feel sad for myself that I have to try and plan my own bday to see my friends.

Recently I’ve had longer thing thoughts of committing suicide. Why? I think, if I were to leave this world tomorrow and told no one, how long would it be before anyone would notice outside my immediate family, it would be a long time. Just makes me think about where I am in this world. At the end of the day, I’ve only asked for simple things, like a few friends I can hang, watch a game and have a beer with. I appreciate the little things, things you can physical quantify, like friendships. I hope who ever sees this doesn’t take this the wrong way and just reaches out to talk to me…",lonely,"I feel so lonely and isolated, I have thought about ending everything….",2021-06-11 16:01:07

Fast forward a few years and he starts making comments in group chats toward her, since he knew I wasn't keen on the past being brought up considering it reminded me how shitty that time was. But it became comments such as 'your gf had her mouth rapped round my cock' and various other sly comments. I brushed it off as laddish banter, but then it turned personal. Everyone else in the group got lighthearted digs, and I got shit like 'You have no personality'  and other shit I can't remember. But yeah, eventually I called him out on it and just got given a list of reasons why I never want to associate with them again. Yet, I fucking miss them. When it wasn't all toxic masculinity and personal attacks, we all had good seshes and some good laughs over the years. Now I just feel lost and keep reminiscing over all the years.

Sorry for the long vent.

The first crush I had, in 6th grade, and I had to move country. 

My second crush liked someone else, and I had to stand support, because they both were my friends. 

The third one, on 9th grade, wanted nothing to do with me. But I never stopped crushing..  on 10th grade, she comes up to me and says she likes me. Oh. That's great.. even though we'd have to change schools soon, I could've made it work, but that's when reality hit me. She said she liked me cause she lost a bet to one of her friends.. 

then in 12th grade, me and one of my very close and best friend started liking the same girl and we both had no idea. We found out a bit later, but nothing serious happened. But later, when I felt like the girl might be interested in him, because she spends time with him most of the time, talks to him more, I decided to back off. 5 years later, she tells me that it was me who she liked. I tried to rekindle that flame and get something going, but she never bothered to understand me. And pushed herself away. 

And I lost all hope and didn't even chase her. Because for one, she never bothered, and 2, I'm mentally drained, convinced that I'll be alone for ever... that was 2 years ago. Before covid.

In college, I never even bothered. Because I was convinced that it's me. I'm ugly. Girls don't like ugly right? People all around me falling in relationships, getting engaged, married. It tore me up from the inside. And I sat there in the middle, having a relationship with the food. But that too didn't work cause I still the same weight lol.

I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up, put on a fake face and then continue the day as if everything is ok with me. But the end of the day, I suffer alone.. from being alone.. and it's a continuous cycle. I've thought of the other way out, many times.. but there must be someone that likes me out there right? Or maybe my family. I shouldn't harm them right? That's the only thought that has kept me going.

 I think karma is going to prevent me from ever having true love in a loyal consistent way because I excluded a girl with severe anorexia from a friendship group.

Anyway, she was fine afterwards but I think this might mean I won’t have a loyal partner because of this, excluding me from feeling that comfortable way in a relationships like I excluded her.

It’s like, the way people love their partners, such as men who just love their partner unconditionally and would never cheat on them, that common but great love everyone wants that creates families, I feel I won’t have it, I won’t have that security because o don’t deserve it.

And you know in the past this thought terrified me. I couldnt imagine my life all alone it seemed that if i wouldnt have the right family , social circle my life would be miserable. And so for years i tried to maintain the fleeting relationships. But as time went on it just became harder and harder to be the last person everyone wanted to talk to or do some activities or anything else for that matter. And so this fantasy of mine (having people who care about you) became increasingly harder to fulfill. It just made me angry that for some reason i am unable to form any meaningfull relationships.

And so now(present time) i think that all it was , was just a fantasy. I dont need to achieve all those things because they are not real ( atleast they are not real for me). I guess what im trying to say is that im tired of being bitter and angry that i cant have true friends. I just want to be happy with what i do have. Because i think that i expected from myself too much for way too long.

So now im gonna do all the things i like by myself traveling camping excersising etc..

Also because of few bad events i lost all of my confidence and never approached any girl in my life. But now i feel that i want to experience love, i want to find my true love and i want to experience how it feels to be in a relationship. How it feels to care for someone. How it feels when you wake up in the morning and the first thing you think is about your partner. 

I am a very simple guy. Who likes everything simple and easy. I joined reddit few days back and found out this amazing subreddit where people find their best friends and partners. So that’s why i am here to try my luck. 
I read many people posts that they like horror/crime related stuff. So i want to tell you in advance i am not in that kind of stuff. Also there are many people who look for their partner who play games also. Well i am a casual gamer maybe play once a month so i don’t want my partner a gamer girl. Haha Sorry.
I treat everyone with respect and love. So i am looking for a person who also show love and care. I don’t look at the appearance of a person, i only look how she treats me. 

Other than that i like long term chat. I like to share about me and everything about my life and i like to know these things from other person. Why? 
Because i feel when people share their personal stuff they get even more closer to each other. So i want a strong bond with my partner. 

I never experienced relationship and i want to try now. Let’s see if i will find my true love here on reddit.

I'm a 16 year old girl, and am terrified for my 17th birthday this August because then I will realise how truly alone I am. No friends have wished me happy birthday since I was thirteen. Everyone has left me, my childhood friend who promised she'd stay, left me without saying goodbye. I have been left out of every friendship group I've been in, I was often ditched in public spaces and made fun of...This led to me to isolating myself, just staying in bed and letting myself rot till I had to drop out of school &amp; became incapable of taking care of myself. I left school then dropped out of college and quickly developed an eating disorder. I thought being skinny would bring me more friends and love, it never did, it just made all the time I spent alone feel purposeful... I am now in a new college, still yet to make any friends. I try my best to be kind and polite but I always go home and spend the rest of my time alone.

Recently something happened, the guy who once talked to me every night left me shortly after saying I should just 'become more attractive'. Maybe that's the problem... I'm not pretty enough to exist happily, not pretty enough for people to love me. I'm not sure what I look like, I stare and I take pictures/ videos but my face feels so foreign to me... I do know I could be much prettier though. I'm planning to fix that as soon as I can. 

Feeling so lonely whilst I watch everyone else having fun around me is exhausting. I don't have social media but sometimes I go for walks or just to the supermarket and fill with so much envy for how sweetly I see people look at each other... I won't have that this lifetime, I don't think I will ever feel wanted, or as if I belong. I know everybody feels lonely, and I should be more grateful for the privileges which I do have, but the constant sadness and cloud over my heart makes me so bitter. I'm trying my best.

I moved into Pennsylvania a year before covid started here in USA. I tried chatting with my friends. I tried inviting them over. Nope. Who wants to come over here? I should go to them. They are all there so makes sense. To them anyway. They all still lived with their parents. Im living on my own making enough to pay my bills and rent and have like 100 for daily expenses like food gas cat food and stuffs. (I have a 3 year old cat whos been my only companion since i was kicked out of my moms house at 19.)
Nobody wants to take the time to see me. Let alone call or text me. My phones ALWAYS on me. Its near me and not on dnd. I go iut of my way to help everyone i can. I dknt like conflict or being mean so I dont get it. So i tried making some new friends out here. Neighbors. Coworkers. Notjin really sticked. My neighbor who i asked to watch my cat for a few days while i was out of state. Went to jersey toactually  see my old friends. Waste of time but whatever.

So when i got back to PA my apartment was ransacked. My work desk was broken. My bathroom was a bloody mess. My bedroom had everytging on the floor. The cat tree was on the floor. My shelves were broken. And i had a eviction notice on my door if i didnt clean up. And i quote ""You are a disgusting human being living like this"" was on this notice in my landlords hand writing. I was fucking livid and explained i was out of state so why was he in my apartment? Because my neighbor (the very same one who was watching my cat) complained it was a mess in there. That severely upset me. Still upsets me and im leaving at the end of this month for north carolina. New area new life? Hopefully. So yea.

i made friends last time i was here, but they all changed into snobby brats and half of them are new students, they also forgot me, and i hate them. my childhood best friends (F, D, and R) and i slowly drifted away when i moved, by october we completely stopped talking. only very few times and they’d last for a few minutes. i didn’t have anyone to talk to, so i became really lonely, i changed a lot and isolated myself in my room 24/7. i didn’t want to go out or see anyone. my mental health became really bad that when i moved, when we first moved into the apartment (around august) i begged my mom to take me to a doctor, and after a long time she agreed. the doctor was a piece of shit and laughed at me saying “ you don’t have any of these illnesses, you’re to young and your faking it for attention, you probably don’t even know what illnesses are, you’re just sad because summer is ending, and i’m the professional i know” and more stuff, i was in and out of there in three minutes. even though my mom agreed with her, i asked if we could go to another and she said yes. she forgot and doesn’t really care. i’m still undiagnosed, this time it’s really bad because my health has gotten way worse. i’m also quite scared to go to another one because i feel like they’ll say the same thing. ive taken lots of online tests, not to self diagnose, i’d never do that, but to check up on myself. everytime i’d get the highest scores.

time skip to the end of may, beginning of summer, f, d, and r, are always hanging out now because school ended, and i’m so lonely. we couldn’t last year because of covid and now i can’t. when i watched them i freaked out and cried. i cried for days. i wouldn’t stop, i became really psychotic and wasn’t in control. i’d wake up and cry, i’d skip eating and doing anything, i’d cry about this, i’d cry while going to the bathroom, i’d cry while going to sleep, just nonstop crying. this was so bad that for the first time, i cried infront of my mom. ive never done that. i cried about how homesick i was and how much i wanted to go back. as i’m typing this, i am crying. i cried nonstop for around a week before calming down. now i will get these huge mood swings and will go from being normal to crying about how lonely and homesick i am.

i’d do anything to move, but there are so many pros and cons,

pros:i’ll be able to see my friends, go to that school, be happy, i’ll be able to visit my favorite cousin (she lives there but visits our city every few weeks)

cons: id have to live in that small apartment, share a room with my 10 yr old fortnite brother and twin baby siblings. i wont be able to live in this nice house.

a few days ago, F got into a hobby i love, and i got this urge to text her. i talked to her and then suddenly she talked about how much they missed me, and i admitted everything, she said that she though i was distancing myself from them, and she apologized for making me feel this away, as she didn’t mean to. i’m happy i talked to her, i text her a few times a day. and i texted D too but this hasn’t solved my issue, i still feel awfully lonely, i wish nothing happened. i want to move back so bad, you don’t even know. they’ll be able to see eachother everyday and hang out while i’m lonely and haven’t seen them in over a year. i’m so jealous, any advice will be greatly appreciated",lonely,i’m really desperate for advice. how can i cope with moving?,2021-06-10 21:00:40
2902,Dismal_Orchid555,1623322727,1,How do I not beat myself up after failing to sustain friendships over and over again. How do I handle upfront criticism. Is exiling myself into silence the answer?

2903,spoodydoo,1623322100,1,"Nowadays I hardly have a social life. I feel like that’s a given during a pandemic, but when I’ve repeatedly reminded my “friends” that if they want to plan something I’m basically *always* *free* and hang-outs are *still* being planned without me, it’s something to think about. Ever since I divulged more personal info regarding mental health to them (which I now have realized is a major mistake), it seems as though all of my social relationships have essential begun to wear down and fray out. Nine times out of ten, the only times I’ll hear from these people are if *I* start the conversation...otherwise I can go weeks without hearing anything from just about anybody, aside from maybe my parents. 

I really don’t ask for much from these people. The last time I saw any of them was a get-together I planned for my birthday a few weeks ago — I bought all of the snacks, games and decorations and made sure to accommodate them and make them feel comfortable. In return, they showed up. Not really any substantial gifts (not that I expected any) and the latter-half of the night involved them talking and interacting as a group whilst I sat across the room drinking and watching quietly. Not because I wanted to stay quiet — I can easily do that on my own time — but it was my birthday and I wanted to spend time and have laughs with my friends, on my birthday of all days, yet I felt kind of disconnected. Sure, we had some laughs that night, but seeing their obvious heartfelt connections, more genuine than the ones I had tried to forge, proved to be kind of draining. I was so socially starved and exhausted that as they left in their cars I stood alone in my driveway in the dark and started crying (once it was clear they were gone and couldn’t see me), because at the end of that day I knew it would just be me there, all to myself. 

Ever since then (about three weeks later) I haven’t heard much from them. I’ve seen plenty of their social media posts where they’ve been traveling, doing stuff, and even getting together as a group and doing fun, casual things, while I sit in my room on my electronics or fall asleep to shut my brain off. They *know* I don’t do anything — I post stuff complaining about how bored and lethargic I am, for crying out loud — yet I’m the one who seems to never hear about these secretive hang-outs until they’ve already happened. I *know* they have group chats separate from the ones I’m in, because they’ve mentioned it in conversation (not as a hint; they literally spoke of it in group calls that I’ve been in with them). 

It hurts to not be considered but I don’t think I’m really surprised. These things have happened since I was a little kid and have conditioned me not to necessarily *hate* people, but to be inwardly bitter, distrust them and keep my expectations low. These feelings have only seemed to become exacerbated as I’ve gotten older. Sometimes I wonder how they would react if I did something drastic, but then I realize I would never be around to find out. 

I feel like I walk the social tightrope where there’s only so much distance I can get to before I teeter too far over and lose that balance; like I have to work *so* hard to keep the people in my life from leaving me behind, but it *always* happens whether I want it to or not. They said they’d be there for me and would never leave, and I believed them...it’s only been a year and I can already feel those connections dimming, yet I don’t think there’s anything more I can do about it. I do the work that *I* can in order to keep relationships afloat, but at the end of the day it’s a two-way street, and if the “friend” doesn’t want to walk it then why should I? I feel so unwanted sometimes it’s unreal — I’m nobody’s best friend or partner, and through further evaluation it appears as though I never *have* been. I sit alone in my room squinting my eyes at a screen to belong somewhere, because quite frankly, I don’t know how to belong anywhere else at this point. 

TL;DR: I guess the point of this is: don’t make promises to people that you can’t keep. If you don’t want to be someone’s friend, stop leading them on to feel like the “good guy”. Let them go if it’s that much of a burden for you to bear, because *god* *forbid* that that person has feelings lol.",lonely,“Friends” continue planning things without me and I’ve given up trying to include myself in it,2021-06-10 20:48:20

I don't even know how to start so i hope this will actually make some sense. 

I fell for a good friend, and yesterday i found out she's in happy relationship. I didn't confess my feelings, im too much of a coward to do that because i don't want to hurt out friendship. So instead i just keep my feelings for myself and hurt.
She's first girl ever i liked this way, my first crush. Untill now that i have antidepressants that actually help me and made me able to feel deep feelings and emotions again i never cared about relationships but lucky me, the moment i can feel again i fall for someone who's unavailable. 
I'm aware it's gonna get better over time but ... at 20yo i have 3 friends including her a 2 friends from early childhood. I don't know how to make friends or even talk to girls, in this way she was exception, that i could talk to her without being anxious and that we developed really deep friendship in pretty short time. And now, i don't know what to do, keep it bottled up, hurt myself, tell her, hurt our friendship ... 
Also, how tf am i gonna find someone when i can feel attraction only when i know the person, and im too much of an anxious fuck who can't talk to to 99.9% of the girls.
So, yesterday when texting with her topic kinda came up and she told me how happy she is in her current relationship. I genuinely like her and I'm happy for her, but at the same time, i cried myself to sleep (as i said in the title, i didn't cry over emotions since i can remember) after that and  now i feel so fucking empty and hopeless ....",lonely,Yesterday I cried for the first time since i remember ...,2021-06-10 16:48:30

My remaining friends are too busy to hang out. Some are moving away this fall and I'll never get to hang with them again. I just feel like I have no one to talk to, no one willing to spare the time for me, and the loneliness is crushing. I try to put myself out there, try to go to events even if I'm alone, but it's starting to make me feel absolutely invisible. I know I matter to certain people, but I'm tired of trying so hard, only to be absolutely forgotten later. Tired of pushing and pushing with no give. I can't find any solution to this.

But im alone and single and I’ve lived here 3 years and feel like every friendship I have is so super surface level. I’m depressed. It makes me Occasionally binge drink and worse sometimes. I’m addicted to working because it’s the only constant I have in my life. 

I have tried 4 or 5 therapists here and none have been a good fit (literally like one vaped  in the session and other was pro conversion therapy.) 
When not working I constantly just think about the future or what I should  do the next day to make myself happier (typically don’t end up doing it) 
I’m not close with my family right now. None of them live in this state and we were never that close 
I haven’t had a single healthy / non toxic relationship. I’m pansexual and don’t feel like I fit in with straight people or Lesbians. My longest relationship was only a year. And I’m 25

I just wonder if maybe this is the direction my life will go forever? If I am just like destined to experience the world thru a lonely and emotionally isolated placed. I was born on 11/11 and some psychic told me that means I’m meant to go thru the world alone or something like that

Well anyway, I was once, just a few short years ago surrounded by “friends.” I was a very popular person at my high school; regarded and loved by my peers, being on the homecoming court and even Prom king of my high school class. But, I can attribute all my success to the absolute feeling of worth my dear loving girlfriend gave me. I met her when I was 15 and made her mine until the day she left me when I was almost 21. I held her soft beautiful hand for 5 years and since the day she left, my life has been empty. I’ve tried to move on (multiple other relationship attempts) but each one of them just shows me that I’ve already met the person I want to be with. Losing her broke me, to the point where I lost everyone. My friends, mentors, and colleagues saw me just deteriorate into a broken man. Little did I know this would be just the beginning. It’s now been 2 years since I lost her, and I haven’t spoken to one of my “friends” in months. Now I wear my loneliness like a badge of remembrance, to never forget when I was loved by everyone and most importantly, her.

I get high to forget and to feel good for once, but now not even this space is safe... 

It’s like a rape flashback during a time of intimacy. 

How to ever enjoy life when being violated continues even a year later? Penetrating my mind and soul at random times? 

In a really bad place. My only friend was mixed up in it, not her fault, but benefitted greatly. So I won’t speak to her about it any further, thus I’m absolutely alone to stew in it. Getting soul raped again and again. So numb and disassociated I can’t feel anything.

I recently was in a relationship, my first, and I just have to say I don't think I ever want to date again. I know everybody says that when they get out of a relationship. But I am so emotionally traumatized I don't think I can go through it again.

I've joined groups and clubs, went to parties, talked to coworkers and peers, tried online meetups, and such. And I still feel more lonely than ever. I grew up an only child and I still can't figure out how to enjoy being alone, I think it's just because I'm tired of it. I talk to myself too much and it's starting to scare me.

I know a lot of people struggle with feeling alone but I can’t help but feel horrible about the situation. My depression is something I can usually fight off, I have a very strong will and believe a lot in mind of matter. Depression runs high on both sides of the family. Shit if I’d even call what’s left of it “family”. Anyways I struggle alot with feeling loved, and I know it stems a lot from my early childhood experiences but it’s gotten to a point where I feel like a robot. In the sense that I don’t feel compassion or love, or anything, even to those I consider close. I fell so empty as if my fuel gage is on E. And it doesn’t help that in my area there aren’t many other gay males. I finally found someone whom I really enjoyed being in their presence and they made me feel loved and worthy of being loved. I held back my feelings at first because I totally thought he was straight. After around three months I found out he isn’t straight and I was going to express to him how I feel until I found out that he is currently dating a girl. And it sucks to o because he’s one of those naturally flirty people(so am I), and it always creates a battle in my head after we hang out that “oh maybe there is a chance” “no he doesn’t like you he’s just friendly” “then why does he tell me he misses me so much” “well you two haven’t been able to hang out often anymore” and this just goes on and on till I eventually get frustrated and decided to just end the day and go to bed.

Like I don't mind being alone, but I would like to have someone to be there for me and me to be there for them. A few years ago I had a group of friends and when I came back to town and I told everyone that I would be back, they all acted like I didn't exist. So at that time, I decided how long it would take for someone to reach out to me ( I was better at reaching out to them to hang out then), it took them 3 weeks to reach out me after I messaged one of them asking about me hanging out. I know I should have reached out and talk to them sooner, but I don't know why I didn't. But ever since then I haven't been able to reach out to anyone. I know it's my fault I should have tried harder and I know they don't like me because of it, but fast forward to the beginning of this year. I thought I was doing ok, I was trying to be more active in my life. I was in a relationship, trying to hang out with the friends I have, but I lost my dog, best friend of 15 years, in my arms. After that, my parents made it seem like I should move on after a day he passed away, I closed my self off again. I didn't want to talk to anyone for a while, I just wanted to be alone. I didn't talk to my partner for a week, and found out that they cheated on me and told me because I wasn't there for them and was putting the blame on me. This happened about 2 months after my dog passed away and I should have done better to communicate, but I was they would have said that they wanted to leave. So now I feel like I'm back at square one. I feel like I don't have anyone. I've been wanting to escape where I've been for a few days, so I made plans to leave town, and all I had to was book the flight and hotel. But my parents wouldn't let me go alone, but I have no one and I wanted to go alone. But now it feels like I'm trapped, it's suffocating. I can't stand it.

Then I started saying yes to most invites and let myself open up to people a bit more. And it helped a lot. Let’s be honest, who wants to be friends or hangout with someone who complains a lot or has nothing interesting or funny to say? 

There are dating apps, friend apps, Reddits, Facebook groups, Snapchat, etc that can help you meet new people. You can also go out by yourself. I would always terrified to go to a concert by myself. Once I did it, it wasn’t a big deal. Everyone who goes to a concert has one thing in common, they all like at least one of the bands playing. Getting out there gives you something to talk to people about.

Anyway, you totally used me. You took advantage of me and I let you, because I felt like a ghost and you were the only person in the world that could see me. I never told you no.

But you had a boyfriend the entire time. And you were cheating on him with me and several other men. Truly for the streets. 

Your boyfriend found out and forgave you, and you've been together for years, happily married with kids on the way. And I'm still looking at your Facebook page, alone with no other girl since we parted ways.

I've known you since before you could legally drink and you're all grown up now. Part of me can't stand to see you two together and is jealous that you're so happy and you've moved on with your life. 

What about me? You told me you loved me. You held my hand when we cuddled. How could you do this? Do you even think of me anymore?

Nah, I was just your personal chauffeur and a body to keep you warm at night.

But I know I dodged a bullet. You are batshit crazy, and I deserve better than that. You would have definitely cheated on me, and I probably wouldn't have found out.

So why do I care? Why am I still hurt years later? Why do I think about old memories and conversations we had? Why do I think about what I could have done to keep you?

You know what? Fuck you. You know what you did to me. You're a shit person. I hope your husband wakes up one day and realizes that he doesn't love you anymore, just like you did me.

I’ve been clean from sh for a few weeks now, but the urges are worse than ever. I just graduated high school as a valedictorian last Monday, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m literally suffocating in my room, and my friends are all too busy to talk right now. That’s completely fine, I know that they have their own lives and I’m happy that they’re out doing things and enjoying themselves, but I just wish I didn’t feel so isolated right now.

I tried writing how I feel down in a journal, and it helped a little. I could pretend like I was talking to someone, you know? It’s kinda nice too, because I can talk as freely as I like about all of it. I cant do that with my friends, because I’d hate to dump my problems onto them. I just can’t do that. I wish they had time to just talk, you know? It could be about literally anything. I miss them a lot. 

I guess I just don’t know how to be alone. I took a couple adderall last night to try and numb the feeling, and that helped a bit as well. 

I don’t miss high school at all. That was an absolute disaster, but I do miss one teacher in particular. He is the only person that knows about my sh, and he found out by complete accident. He gave me his phone number after graduation to keep in contact, but I’m too afraid to reach out. I’d hate to be a bother, you know? I did text him once a few days ago to thank him for the book he gifted me on the last day of school, as I had just finished reading it, but besides that I don’t know what I’d even say. I’m just so anxious. I don’t want to sound stupid or anything, because I look up to him so much. It was so much easier to talk face to face. Maybe I’ll suck it up and ask him how he’s doing tomorrow?

2993,Techno_Stalin,1623274661,2,"To start off, I want to emphasise that I am not the best at articulating my thoughts to words and have rewritten this post multiples times. But regardless I want to share just a singular emotion. Over the last year it’s been a really damn tough time for me emotionally speaking due to family and social issues as well as academic life pressing on me. That has eventually led me to this subreddit quite recently. Sheer relief washed over me, and I wonder if it did to the others too, to see that I was not the only one in this situation of almost constant dread of being alone. That I wasn’t the only one who felt as if socially things weren’t going as they should, or they feel like haven’t found a fulfilment in social interaction we humans are supposed to have. It decreased my stress for a bit to have this thought in mind, that despite my circumstances, and continuous vague yet painful interactions with people, that I am not alone in trying to navigate the maze of people. I want to emphasise that this arrives from a great place of empathy, even if everyone’s experiences are different we can all still relate and identify struggles of loneliness, that almost creeping sensation of dread at the thought of danger from being alone. Because it is at the end of the day a social reaction because our brains and in part ourselves, believe we are in the threat of not being heard, of not being loved, of not being in a social circle or some kind of social relationship that proves our humanity. That provides us with safety, that allows us to feel joy spending time with others. This subreddit right here gives me hope, in that despite my loneliness and continuous echo of thoughts on the internet, human suffering from loneliness IS an empathise-able and shared experience by many. Personally I have been struggling with unclear hints, social games of dodging responsibility and other sorts of stuff from people. And this has exhausted me to the edge of feeling left out by my friends. I know at heart that my close friends care about me, I know that at heart even my former crush still thinks of me highly as a person despite having rejected me a few months back, I know I have the respect of my parents due to my grades. Yet despite all of that I find more relief in knowing that this pressure is similarly felt amongst so many others, this small world isn’t just a chaotic mess of humans who confuse, but rather that so many of us feel outside of the very same social circle we think everyone else is a part of. So I guess if I were to try to summarise what I’m getting here at is, the subreddit is a testament and first hand source on the human condition of loneliness. That is beautiful because we’re not constructed by the physical people we know, just by the time we spend with people online or in real life.

This all builds up to ask then;
Have any of you ever felt such relief from this subreddit? That you are not alone in feeling this?
Do any of you share the same type of stories and almost feelings, that despite everything amongst your closest peers seeming good, you still feel lonely and disconnected?

I’d love to hear thoughts on this, and ultimately finding this subreddit has helped me bounce bank from my recent emotional swing downwards.

Our words float in the infinite ether of internet, to reach people we've never met, not really to know each other but just to convey what we've kept inside us for too long.


I see a lot of posts on people not having a girlfriend. I think you can feel lonely despite having a girlfriend. I feel this is a portal where one comes only when their patience reaches a certain level, when they feel that life is slowly fleeting by and they're not keeping pace, that they need to get it out of their system. 


We can maybe create groups, a groups of poets, a group of movie buffs, group of fitness enthusiasts, group of spiritualists, but that too won't do much if we are only interested in ourselves and not in others, those groups soon turn into places where only a few remain active.

 Considered that youth is carefree time. I can argue. When you’re teenager you have responsibilities and work not less than adults. Me at least. However you have hardly more rights than pet. You can’t protect your rights. You can’t protect your interests. You can’t make your own decisions. Somebody can say that’s good, that somebody make decisions instead you. Nope. It’s humiliating.
 I don’t think that youth it’s bad age at all. In different periods of life we encounter different problems. Including when we’re young. It could be perfect age if not stigma. I’ve never faced such discrimination for any another reasons other than my age.
 I’m used to hide my age like something shameful. I’m usually saying that I’m 19. I don’t like it. I don’t wanna lie to somebody. I wanna be open with peoples and trust them.

3036,Afraid_Concern1900,1623247629,1,"I am commonly upset about my lack of a love-life. , I am male, on the last year of high school and I feel like shit. I am mildly overweight from overeating when I was upset in life (the circumstances for that were different to this) and girls don't talk to me, and my only friend (A Male) stopped talking to me. It's probably because he's having issues and nothing that's my fault, but he still won't talk to me, so I have no friends either.

I tried making friends with girls at school, but that didn't last long. There was this one girl I grew to like that I tried making friends with, but after a month, she started avoiding me. I asked her to talk and she told me she was ""busy"" for a week straight but then I see her hang out with other people casually, so I knew she was lying, she didn't want to talk to me for a reason I didn't know, and I gave up trying to talk to her.

It wasn't until this year, that I spoke to one of her homosexual friends and he told me what the deal was. He said that she was stalked and sexually abused at a younger age and she always didn't feel like talking to people like me, because I was a normally raised, hetrosexual boy and she was bisexual. That made me feel terrible because that felt like I was being compared to stalkers and pedophiles.

And if I hadn't put 2 and 2 together already, she already had a boyfriend, who was also bixsexual and was way more acquitted to her than I had any chance of being. I was told he was a family friend to her and they knew each other for years, while we met last year in class.

I knew I was on an uphill slope, most of my close family friends throughout my life were always male, except for one girl who was far from my type and was a year older than me, and it seemed every remotely attractive girl already had a boyfriend, which made me so frustrated.

It seemed every girl I even remotely took an interest in was with some other boy and I had to write them off immediately, equaling pretty much every girl I ever liked. And even when I was friends with this girl, I always had to be the one to initiate conversation. At no point could I relax and have any girl speak to me instead for a change.

Since I'm 18, I'm an adult by Australian standards, and I don't know where to go now. I'm not the university type, and I have zero ideas how to get invited to parties, or even how parties work, and I figure I'm too unappealing to go on a dating site, I'll have to lose weight first. It wasn't always like that. I used to get compliments by girls in late primary school, and I keep wondering what the hell happened.

I think I would feel happier if I got a partner, but I've never had one, and most people telling me to not worry about it are either in relationships or are indifferent to them. I always fear I will never be with someone I actually like and will have to be with someone I find unattractive because I'll have no other choice.",lonely,I Feel Unloved,2021-06-10 00:07:09

3097,__lmosko,1623205784,1,"Became really good platonic friends with this woman at work last year around November. It was a temp job for the pandemic and we would talk for hours- she was super intense and I suspected maybe bipolar and before we became friends she tried flirting with me but I found her too intimidating at the time (she's super attractive and the type of woman that men flock too).

Anyway even after talking all day at work, she would leave me voice notes and spend all afternoon chatting via text which I thought kind of odd at first but then it charmed me and I got used to having her as a regular in my life, especially as I don't have anyone regularly to talk to anymore. She filled a void and we both spurred each other on - we're both early 30s, lost in life and I'm looking to retrain as a teacher and she was looking to become a detective. She confided she used to have a big coke problem but chose a life of sobriety now so that by the time the entrance drug test for the police force came around it would be out her system. Something about me, she found very calming, motivating and spurred her on through her moments of self-doubt. She also sussed out I had a bit of a relapse on Valiums and was the sweetest, most kind person ever.

She is someone I believe is genuinely kind, loving and non-judgemental. I think the fact that she is so attractive means that she is also used to just being able to get what she wants from men when she wants them too and she can be a litle manipulative and dishonest without realising.

The job ended but we'd still talk every day as usua, she even asked to meet my mum (we both still live with her parents). Then one day she starts taking days to reply to my messages - I assumed she was going through a bipolar crash but now think she was just hanging out with her old cocaine friends and was either too ashamed to tell me or no longer needed me in her life now that she scrapped her police plan and wants to become an actress and model (she's 34 with very little prior experience, though looks wise she is still a lot more attractive than many women in their 20s). I asked her if she's okay and if she ever wanted to talk I'm there for her and she responded a few days later saying thans, she's starting to feel better and is going to Cocaine's anonymous.

She used to come to me with her issues and problems and ask for advice but then she just kind of dissapeared and we haven't spoken in over 3 months other than her adding me on social media and starting the odd convo here and there which basically go nowhere and ends with me being left on seen after responding.

In all fairness she invited me out to the pub one time but I was busy then the second time she invited me out she was already out at the pub with another friend before I had a chance to reply (less than an hour). Then she invited me to a protest with some of her art friends and said she will call me to plan the next day but never did and I didn't hear from her for another month until recently where shes been camping out, as part of a protest against vaccines and lockdowns (this is completely different from her beliefs from when I knew her less than 4 months ago).

She's invited me out to come and hang with her there twice but I don't want to be seen with that crowd (but I am also lonely and it's sunny and they all seem like weird conspiracy hippies and a fun experience). It was short notice the first time, then the second time was the other day and all my money had been spent because I'm visiting a dying relative in Italy for the week (didn't tell her that, I don't know anything about her life anymore other than what I see on social media and I feel awkward talking to her now, it's like talking to a stranger). 

I also saw on her instagram that the very next day after she invited me she was laying in bed with a new boyfriend I'm guessing she's met at this protest and now I feel I was just someone she wanted to have around while her new guy was away for the day.

Maybe I'm just finding it hard to adjust as I thought I found a new friend I could consistently talk to. She's told me she's always ran off to different countries, thought different causes like going to Palestine etc and it's something I love about her and she loves whatever she loves about me (platonically) but I think she's nuts and inconsiderate and possibly just someone who will dip in and out of my life when it suits her. She was more chatty recently since this protest, i'm guessing she's feeling a lot more happy and content.

Should I back away from this woman? The friendship was so intense then it just died out of nowhere (coinciding with her relapsing, being depressed and suicidal, however) and now it seems like she's ready to meet up with me again but some of her language (""please come through this time, bro"") as if I was the one who was being a flake this whole and not her.

I meet someone, for this example in highschool, we start talking and really hit it off. At least I think so. We talk about interests, hobbies, each other, ourselves. When one of us is down, the other boosts them up. When one is really hurting, the other does their best to be their doctor.

One of my various highschool crushes WAS actually like this with me. And in time, throughout the year, I began to really fall for her. But I was, and still am naive. I'm desperate for that connection, that bond. So as soon as someone comes around and treats me like a damn person, is kind and thoughtful, my mind plays tricks, thinking they feel the same way.

It's never true. I always go to confess, and get hit with the friendzone wall.

But what happens when I give up? When I decide I'm not going to try?

Well, I'm still desperate and naive. I couldn't resist saying yes, when a woman finally came to me, she came to ME, and said she wanted to go out. I was shocked. And I accepted, despite all the warnings and signs, I accepted her 'affection'. Only to be used as free room and board while she dropped out of college and was secretly looking for another guy, one with a bit more money to burn and whatever. I got used financially, emotionally, mentally abused and shamed even when it was obvious it was her fault.

That relationship lasted 3 months, and after, I got laid off, failling into depression. Only starting to get out of it when I finally got a decent job. A couple years later, I even meet a wonderful woman through a chatroom. We talked, laughed, and once again I fell hard. This time, it was great. 2 months had gone by of us talking, when suddenly she disappeared. I get a message from her a month later.

Cancer.

It spread fast, she wasn't going to last long. I saw the images. Her in that hospital bed, her gorgeous brown hair completely gone. A couple days later, she was gone again. I realized a little later that it was because she didn't want me to sad, instead trying to make me feel less deeply about her. Which only makes me miss her more.

Now, I'm cursed. At least that's how it feels. That 1 of 3 things is gunna happen if I fall for someone.

-I'll be used and abused because I am so desperate I become blind to red flags.

-I'll be shoved in the friendzone faster than... idk Mach 5 because I'm just too good at being a friend and lose all potential for anything else.

I just wanted to share this new service I've been using called CONTACT Line ([https://www.contactline.org](https://www.contactline.org)).

I was feeling quite isolated and detached from everything during the pandemic but chatting with their counselors over video call has helped me find ways to cope and honestly just having a space to rant to someone and hear words of encouragement is amazing. I think they're still piloting their service so it's completely free to schedule a conversation if you're 18 or older. Their counselors are volunteers and not professional therapists but all very good at listening. Check them out if you just need some kindness or an empathetic ear to feel heard.

3153,Nostalghic,1623181930,1,"With  the way people freely use the words ""alone"" and ""lonely"", people like me (a loner) feel buried even deeper, and I want to share with you what those words mean to me. It's important to me that people hear what I have to say, as my existence is fleeting, although this will probably be  ignored. You may in the end of this find me repulsive, selfish,  manipulative (I share the bad, vile things about myself), but whatever the case, if you read all of this, thank you. No matter how good of a person you are, we all can relate to that darkness; it's just suppressed deep in our minds and sometimes we refuse to acknowledge it. Sorry if  this sounds like incoherent babbling, but I'm barely conscious writing this. I've been to sick to eat for about a week and I'm very dehydrated.

I'm  an 18 year old living in a semi-rural area, currently housed by very  asocial parents. I involuntarily lived a very solitary life; much like a  stray animal fending for itself. In middle - high school, each second  of each day I had remained hyper-vigilant and obsessive with my surroundings; every break I had to find somewhere discreet to stay where  fewer people pass by me, because those who do look at me like I'm a  freak, or eye me like wolves circling their prey.  I've been laughed at,  spit on, and have been in countless fights. I am to this day imprisoned  in envy and seclusion to others who have the company of others.  That  jealousy tortures me in the dark, mournful atmosphere of my room, where I  often passed the time by bouncing a ball against the wall and catching  it for hours and hours. Occasionally, I'd be surprised with a  notification on my phone, only to see that it was an IOS update; the  only notifications I've received for years. The experience was  maddening. And my survival instincts are honed and dominate my  personality and compassion, eviscerated my soul; but not like a wolf or a snake, but more  like a caged rat.

It's amazing how  I used to spend my whole life observing people, analyzing them in ways  they can't see themselves, yet lack the ability to look someone in the  eye, to sit down somewhere in public, and exchange words with someone.

Then,  about a year ago, I meet a girl, who introduces me to the world I  painfully longed for; first hug, cuddles, kiss, watching movies with  someone, having a person to support me. During our ""fling"" she tells me  she does not want to be exclusive, since we are both moving away to  different colleges in August.

A  week ago I confess my love to her, she tells me she's been falling in  love with me (but doesn't love me), and continues to flirt and makeout,  possibly hook up, with other people (which eats away at me that she is like everyone else, and our ideological differences and jealousy are  another thing that makes me feel lonely). I'm not at liberty to walk out  on her yet (not sure if I much want to) because I'd be sentencing  myself back to solitary confinement.

Additionally,  my college is not opening up campus until next year, so while she moves  away to college, meets new people, probably hook up with someone else, I  have nowhere to go but to be enveloped by the darkness of my room as  the world continues to turn without me (pandemic was the most social  years of my life).

Yes, I already  know I never should have gotten attached. But I can't afford to walk out  on her (I'm not sure I much want to either). No matter what I do there  are only wrong choices. Of course I would cling to someone who  momentarily saved me from madness, who's my only resource to a social  life, my only warmth in the terribly cold air that suffocates me. What  will I do when she leaves? And what is it about girls who have had  sexual experiences before me that grips me with anguish? If they aren't  like me, they lose value and meaning in my eyes. Yet, truthfully, I wish  she would take my virginity. I catch myself thinking of couples holding  hands, sharing a kiss under fireworks, matching their sexual energy in  both public and private, kissing each other under a streetlight, and the  fact that she has already experienced these things with many other  people. She's like all the others.

Dislike what I'm saying? I'm on the other side. I have nothing in common with people anymore.

I  guess I shouldn't be too devastated. Before I met her, I manipulated a  girl (who had Dissociative Personality Disorder)  I met in a mental  hospital to stay with me, trust me, and be my only friend while I  emotionally traumatized her verbally, and then left her because she was  also very toxic. I influenced her to feel guilty for past relationships  and hook ups and influenced her to feel forbidden to date other people,  even though I didn't want to date her because she was promiscuous. I'm a  hypocrite. I may have been socially inept and didn't know how else to behave, but I don't feel guilty, because I felt like I did what I had to do to survive. I'm a piece of shit.

I  just want this feeling in my chest to stop, for the love of god, that’s  all that I want. That unbearable emotional pain that can make you  scream out of sheer agony. When I look at the ocean, I’m looking at a  life I can not enjoy. I see ghosts of cruise ships, friends on the  beach... reminding me that I missed out on the good things in life. The  air of the night, city lights, anything that people share with each  other all have the same effect on me.

Now,  the bridge between youth and adulthood is burned, and I'm left with the  regret and loss of what could have been. I used to be regarded as filth  in society, and now my existence is fading away completely. My thoughts  feel restrained, my gut wrenching, my heart even beating in unnatural  manner. I have no direction or stability in life. Emptiness has  enwreathed me for as long as I can remember. Soon I will be all alone  again; can I survive another chapter of loneliness in my life? Can I  survive this awful sensation in my chest? I'm on the floor, I could chew  into my flesh, and when I look back at my life, I will find no proof I  was ever really alive.",lonely,"Grief, Isolation, Cruel Romance",2021-06-09 05:52:10

The last thing I would do is ghost someone, it hurts so so much. But it also hurts equally as much to turn around and close the curtains on someone who seemed a very nice person. I felt so sorry for him, and that he didn’t deserve to feel led on by someone who really isn’t mentally up for relationships at this present moment.

I've got amazing and supportive friends. I don't have a lot of close friends. I've got 3 IRL ones and one online friend. I've never really felt like any physical affection ever (I'm ), but it wasn't super apparent until recently.
I was talking to my friend from the states, and he told about like how his friend came over and they spent a lot of time just like cuddling and doing other stuff (Don't know how to explain it. Non sexual sexual stuff? So like pinning down, biting, neck kisses, etc). That's when it just hit me hard how physically alone I am. I moved here last August, and there's no around my age here, plus the second COVID wave has made it even harder to go out. I have social anxiety anyways, which makes it even harder even at the best of times.
I've never really had someone hug me or anything. Screw hugging, I haven't even held anyone's hand. In the day I'm good. I'm busy with stuff. But every night it just hits me hard how physically alone I am. And that makes me feel like shit. I should be grateful to have good friends, but yet I just want someone I can, you know, do affectionate stuff with. I'm not even taking about a romantic partner. Just a friend that I could meet up with and just do stuff with and feel loved and shit, you know. Just like my American friend described.
I don't really know where I'm going with this. This was kind of a waste of time for you if you read it. I just want someone to have, I guess.

Sooo I’ve been single for a very long time, 4-5 years. Around this period, I’ve tried to date around and meet people but nothing really progressed to a relationship stage. I don’t know what goes wrong where but I meet people who do not value me or think I’m easy just because I’m friendly?? And because of that things just end. I have yet to meet a nice guy who is kind and respects me. A guy who is driven by his goals. Too much to ask for? High expectations? I really don’t know…

3178,Anubis981,1623167632,1,"I use to love this girl, we dated for a few months. She broke up with me for the reasons: she wasn't ready yet and she wanted to focus on college (we are both in college.) I took this okay, I said that's alright I understand but I don't think i can be friends if we wont ever be together. (I was absolutely madly in love, hadn't even thought of another girl since I met her and honestly still haven't.) I'm a person who only will date a girl or be intimate if I truly love them, and I think I will be with them forever. First she said it's very likely we will be together after we graduate and I believed her. I struggle with panics attacks and alot of anxiety, and she never helped. Even when we were together she would make plans with me then go do other things with different guys, for example (while we were actually dating) she planned that we were gonna spend a night together but then she didnt msg me and watched a movie with another guy then called him the rest of the night. Well obviously I should have taken this as a sign, yes im an idiot she just said ""It didnt mean anything I am just hanging out with a friend"" and again I believed her. These kind of things just continued to happen increasingly often the more time passed. We would still talk and everytime we did, basically once a week or less after we broke up, she would say oh im having so much fun you are different then everyone else and i enjoy talking to you more. Then she would ghost me for a while. This happened for about a year, and yes I did bring it up multiple times and every time i just believed that it didn't mean anything that she was ghosting me and we were always meant to be together. She made me promise to not contact her first, because me trying to talk to her too much was ""annoying"" and ""gonna ruin my chances"" so I obliged. So one day, last month, after a year and a half of her knowing how madly in love I was with her (I still told her every month or so how much I cared about her and how much she meant to me.)  She always said she cared a ton back. Well one day she messaged me ""Hey, I got a boyfriend"" This I did not take so well. Basically long argument which ended in ""It will be good for you to understand not everyone is likeable"" directed at me. I still told her i wish for her to be happy but i cant talk to her anymore. Okay well sorry for the long rant, but basically this was all meant for me to say that honestly I think i am happier now that i am alone. We all get stuck up in what everyone views as the correct life or correct personality. As humans we've been taught we need to be successful we need to be in a relationship, but honestly is anyone really happier like that? Maybe some serotonin will trick you to believe that those are the correct ways to live, but personally I think true happiness only can come when you are alone. I'd be much happier living on a piece of land and a house with just necessities compared to being rich and famous and fawned over. So everyone who is lonely, just dont lose yourself in what everyone else believes is the correct way to live.

It's Pride Month + summer + mine and my sister's birth month + some other events...basically there was a lot to look forward to but ever since June started, it's just been one bad thing after the other.

I won't enumerate all my various problems and misfortunes here but I will say that a deep loneliness has come back to top it all off. I really do try to make friends, but it's difficult. Sometimes it feels like no one is really interested in me. I have a few close friends in real life but I know they're busy or they won't get it or we just don't have much in common anymore. When I scroll through twitter and see people having discourse over stuff I'm also interested in, it makes me feels so sad and envious. I have like 13 followers on there who don't even interact with me...I feel like they just followed me to get a follow back to grow their own accounts :( I really just want friends to talk about my favorite stuff with...

Other than that, I've started to miss having a love life as well. When you like someone or have a romantic relationship, it really does color your gray days. I really miss it but I can't even find friends, much less a romantic partner. So I just daydream...

The loneliness can really be crushing. And knowing you can't really do much about it but try to distract yourself makes you question the point of life altogether...

This is the first internship and I have only 1 month left. Things get worse the past few days and I woke up crying today. And I took a wrong turn by messaging this guy. 

I met him on Bumble and things went as online dating should. I was with the intention of something fun as usual but I fell for him. For the first time I fell for someone this hard, all the emotions and feelings I’ve never experienced before. But nothing can happen between us since he said that we should just be friends and I was lying to myself and agreed. We did cuddle and talk and I feel happy and understood by talking to him. But after we had sex, he grew distant and it’s very clear. I tried to be a “bad bitch” as I should haha. But I can’t stay away from him. I messaged him randomly, trying to start conversations, I let him cross many boundaries and I know I shouldn’t have done that to myself. I even pretended I’m fine and laughing when he talked about him hanging out with other girls. I never have the courage to tell him how I feel and cut him off because I don’t want to lose the contact but I guess from now on I would not see or hear anything from him again.

So I told him I cried for 2 hours yesterday in  a funny way (how I deal with my struggles) and he made a joke. I woke up crying and saw his rely on IG first and I just texted him my true feelings, that I’m stressed out and I even have suicidal thoughts. I don’t know why I did that because I was hesitant and indeed it was a bad decision to say that to him, a person I met for 3 months whom I’m not sure what our relationship is. He replied, saying that I should talk to friends and see a psychologist and that I shouldn’t “drop a bomb and make people feel obligated to reply even though they feel uncomfortable to do that”. Now I feel worse because he was right and I can’t get this out of my head. I don’t know why I did that. I apologized and I said I didn’t mean to make him feel that way and I will stop texting. I deleted IG. To be honest, I only share my struggles with some closest friends so far and I was taken over by my thought of liking him and hoping I would get some comfort.

Now part of me is relieved because maybe I can get over him now since it’s clear his intention. But I can’t help but blaming myself for my impromptu action and I regret ending things on a bad note. So far he is the most compatible guy I have met but I need to stop telling me that. I feel so bad crossing the line and it adds up to my anxiety.

I had recently gotten my first pay check from my first job and the first thing my family would say to me was “aren’t you excited/happy that you got your first job” which to me was confusing, why should I be happy? It’s just a pay check. They would also say the same thing when I gave them my report card from school after getting A’s and B’s (I used to struggle to pass my classes before) and other times when I’d do well at stuff but I never feel happy.

In my mind, walking into this hospital will make you feel like you are closer to nature. You are welcomed with a fully loaded ice-cream cone. You can find people to talk to, engage in creating art and music with other people and find good people to hug and sleep next to.

I know so many people who need it. Just take a look at the posts here!

I don't have the money to build something like this. I wish I could. But if you have the money and like the idea, please do!✨

3234,mental_escape_cabin,1623129984,1,"I feel like everything that’s happened in the last year and a half has made me more of a miserable person than I have ever been in my entire life. All of the social anxiety, depression, and general misanthropy that I’ve always felt has now been amplified x100. I’ve been fully vaccinated for like a month now or something, but any time I’ve considered going out anywhere or seeing anyone I’m just like “Why bother?” I feel like I have zero desire to reintegrate into society at all. I don’t even want to go inside the grocery store. I feel like people have let me down and traumatized me with their selfishness and stupidity to a degree I never imagined possible, and like there’s never going to be any coming back from it. 

I’ve been stuck living in a rural area in SE America this whole time, and it’s been so so awful. There are *still* people with ridiculous political flags and shit all over their cars and front yards. It’s like a constant reminder every time I go out of how fucking hopeless the world ultimately is because we’re all addicted to social media, and the propaganda and brain washing will likely never end so long as outrage keeps bringing in advertising dollars.

I don’t have any family members that don’t just depress me to talk to because they’re all screwed up with their own various problems. I don’t really have any friends. Every day I think that I should maybe reach out and try to find somebody to at least talk to online, but I always decide there’s no point. I’m not an interesting person at all and I have nothing to offer in a friendship other than the fact that I exist and am not a robot (although sometimes I basically feel like one). 

I really don’t know what you’re supposed to do when you feel like you desperately *need* a friend, but you don’t feel like you want one. If this were a movie someone would come and drag me out my house and force me to go learn to ride horses or build a boat or some shit and in the end I would thank them and be all better.

I feel sad. I knew a man I thought I loved. We talked daily. Shared pics. LDR kinda thing but we weren’t official. He was getting over a relapse he’d had in the fall. 
I wanted more. He said he couldn’t give me more. “I don’t want to be in a relationship. I really do care about you.”

People risk a lot, they go to lengths to be with who they want. They take the risks, they go after who they want. 
I’m not that person though... I’m not the person someone would go the extra mile for. 
I wanted to be with him. I wanted to be there for him. Be nice to him. Make him feel loved. Bring me water if he was thirsty. Let him know I didn’t care that he was an addict. It doesn’t scare me. I wanted to love him and act on that love. 
Go fishing, take it easy, meet his family, bake dessert while he cooked dinner. 

I’ll get over it. 
It just hurts.  To know people are capable of doing things for their beloved. But mine couldn’t do anything for me. To know he used to remind his ex to take her meds daily. That he knows how to show his love. But he didn’t love me.

I feel like when I go to events, all my conversations with people are brief and awkward. Sometimes I go on dates with people on Tinder which usually go really well until I make some unrecoverable social faux-pas (I'm autistic, and I have a really hard time reading body language and faces. I can mostly pass in normal conversation but flirting and intimacy is hard unless I really know someone, which hasn't been the case in years).

I was starting to date a woman. Everything seemed to be going great. Great conversation, great chemistry, all being confirmed on both ends.

Get a text bright and early after a 24 hour period of nothing from her. Got the lovely gift of ""I've actually been talking to another guy at the same time and we had a better date yesterday so I'm going to pursue a relationship with him instead.""

So many things she said the day before were done so to keep me on hold until she could have this date with this other guy. Which means I was the backup plan should that one not go so well. What a great feeling that was. And it hurt for about an hour.

But then I started thinking about the whole experience in general and how I just keep getting hurt and disappointed. How my feelings were consistently being hurt, my heart ripped over and over. I'm tired of that pain. 

So, I decided to flip the switch on my emotions. It wasn't instant but by the end of the day I can say I really don't feel any emotions, good or bad. I'm just existing. And to be quite honest, it's kind of liberating.

No one can hurt me now. Pain and anger can just fall into a black hole of nothingness. Sure, happiness and all that gets taken away but I'd rather feel nothing than feel that pain anymore.

3271,Completeyetempty,1623113408,1,"Hello. TL;DR at the bottom.

Recent events led me to find this subreddit. I lurked for a few days before posting so I got to see a bit of what the community is like.

I am not sure if I saw my case here, but someone probably went or goes through similar thing as me.

You see I have great friends and a loving family. I haven't had my first date or kiss yet but looking back I think I was oblivious to some signs and missed such opportunity. My case is that I am surrounded by people, actually live in a congregate setting where it's kind of impossible not to, yet I have this continuous lonely feeling dreading over me when I am not busy with something.

Before a few weeks ago when I graduated, I was always busy with something such as school or worrying about future such as finding jobs and etc. Now all these things are taken care of and I finally have some time to myself and thought that would be great. But idk if it's the pendamic or something else, but now the feeling of loneliness is dominating me. I find less pleasure is activities I once looked forward to.

I did some googling about the psychology of loneliness and most sources suggest I change the quality of the interaction to get over the feeling. Now as much as I would like to do that the main issue comes out to be I don't seem to have a good connection with anyone in my life, someone I can talk to anything about, someone who I feel actually gets me. The fact I am an introvert probably doesn't help much either when attempting to make new friends quickly. I don't open up easily to most people and have acquired most of my friends through after spending years with them doing something and opening up slowly. And maybe the most important factor of all of these, similar to many guys out there, I don't have someone to express my inner and most vulnerable feelings to, no one I feel would understand and would want to listen to the things I am saying here. This probably leads to lots of repression. Don't get me wrong I have support from my friends and family in all other ways, but just not this.

I know all these problems aren't the biggest problem in the world. I feel grateful for all I have and everyone in my life. I know these things, but I feel otherwise. And when the feeling is so dominant, it's hard to ignore.

So as my title suggests I am looking for someone on Reddit and on this sub who would be fine with me venting to them as it's a lot to write in a post. Of course I am willing to listen to your vents and have equal exchange. I do not care about gender or sexuality and etc, just want a respectful person to talk to. Since we have loniless in common and the anonimity of the internet it would be easier for me to open up and would hopefully help both of us. So if anyone is interested please leave a DM letting me know.

Thanks you for reading.

TL;DR: Have people around me but feel loneliness due feeling that I do not have a genuine connection with anyone. Think venting to someone specific might help. Looking for someone so we can vent with each other. Please DM if interested. Thanks.",lonely,Someone to Vent To,2021-06-08 10:50:08

3284,throwaway_i_fuckedup,1623104978,1,"We      started out as coworkers, and became really good friends over the        course of the past three years. I regarded her as my sister, and  she   had     stated on several occasions that she would always be there  for   me.   She's been like family to me, which is important since I  haven't   been   with my own family in years.

Last      week, I was feeling a bit lonely since I didn't have any other    friends     in town at the time, and I reached out to her asking if we    could hang     after work. She replied saying that she had just gotten    into a     relationship and would never have any free time for me.  This   felt     hurtful, and I texted her that it  wasn't   fair and     that I wasn't asking for much. I immediately  regretted   this, and sent    an  apology text, but the damage was done.

She      accused me of not being considerate of her boundaries and that I  was       being manipulative. I should have left it at this stage, but I  had       several other stressors in life along with severe depression  and       anxiety. One of my biggest fears has always been losing close   friends. I      thought our relationship was damaged, and I wanted to   regain  control    of  the situation. I sent her several long texts   basically   apologizing   and  asking her to forgive me and give me   another chance. I   realize  this  was  the exact opposite of what I   should have been   doing, but I didn't want to lose someone who has been the closest thing to family to me. The next day, she replied saying she was not ignoring me, and she would respond to me when she felt ready. She then proceeded to block me on all social media.

Do  I   have any hope of   salvaging the situation at this point? Is it too      late for me? What's   worse is that we still have to work together,  and I     feel that the   workplace has turned really toxic for me. She  has  other    friends at   work, and I'm basically all alone having to  watch  her and  her   friends   do things that we used to do together  like go  on lunch or  grab     coffee. The worst part is that I need to interact with her for work, and since she has not been replying on our official communication channels, I have not been getting anything done. I feel so alone. I know I fucked up, but I don't know how to take this hit anymore.

TL;DR:      friend and I had a very bad fallout, and now she's blocked me on     social    media. We still have to work together, and I can't figure out     how to    get past this, or somehow resolve it.",lonely,Friend (23/F) blocked me (20/M) on all social media and I don't know how to handle it or repair the relationship.,2021-06-08 08:29:38

3286,taylor_2907,1623103529,1,"Fuck I don't knew where to start. 

I don't know how to feel about everything. I feel bad for feeling jealous over my friends relationships with each other and how I know I'll never have a relationship like that with any of them. I feel bad for feeling jealous over my sisters relationship with her boyfriend because my relationship with my girlfriend is shit. I haven't been hugged properly in months and I feel completely alone. 

The loneliness I felt last lockdown was bad enough, I barely survived it and now I have three months of waiting to start college, something I might not even get to do because I know I fucked up my GCSE exams and course work because I was too much of an idiot and didn't work as hard as I could and let myself burn out. If I don't get into college then I have no other option. I'd rather die than go back to my high school. 

I can't help but blame myself for my own loneliness. I try to talk to people but no one replies and I'm stuck thinking, what if I didn't talk as much, what if I wasn't clingy, what if I didn't vent as much, or talk about my struggles with dysphoria, maybe if I shut up once in a while then people would actually like me. I'm trying. 

I'm getting upset over small things, the fact I know that mine and my girlfriends second anniversary, if you can even call it that, is coming up and we've barely talked and I'm scared I've done something wrong or these past two years have just been a joke and she doesn't care about me. I know I'm not going to spend these next three months and my birthday the way I want to. I know I won't see my friends, I know I'm just going to be playing a waiting game to see if anyone actually replies to my messages or agrees to meet up with me at some point. I'm tired of wishing for shit I know I won't get. 

Fuck it, tell me I'm being an angsty teen who doesn't know what they're talking about because I haven't been through ""real"" struggles, because that's how all other adults treat my issues, like it's an inconvenience to them, like my anxiety and depression can go away after an hours walk or forced socialization. It's so fucking isolating when you feel like you're dying but you know you can't say shit because no one will take you seriously and saying the words ""I'm suicidal"" to someone you know in real life is so fucking hard. I can rant about it all day online because I know I'm just screaming into the void. But telling a friend will either go two ways, they laugh it off because they're used to me saying that I'm going to jump off a bridge sooner or later, or they tell an adult. And then that'll either go two ways, I get shipped off somewhere because parents don't know how to help their own children or my feelings will once again get invalidated.

I am working hard to be good enough for a partner.  I have managed to improve myself significantly but I worry I'm still not good enough and may never be good enough.  It is hard to maintain effort when I return from battle, battered and bruised (figuratively), to an empty room.  I have the big social anxiety, so I'm trying to meet someone online.  Let me know if you have suggestions for how to do that.

**Long-Ass Rambly Post You Don't Need to Read:**

I had a relationship ages ago, but I wasn't ready.  I wasn't good enough, and they left me, and good for them.  I've tried to improve, and I have!  I don't really find it fun to think about but I've come a long way, I guess.

I don't think any of that hard work really matters.  They're not coming back - they live the better part of a continent away now and I wouldn't expect them to want to even see me again.  I've tried to drive my improvement with an eye towards some future person.  My friends eventually convinced me to stop hiding and working towards some unreasonably perfect self-imposed ideal and try dating as I was.  I have, as much as I can.  I'm not comfortable around people I don't know.  Even without the pandemic things like the bar scene or casual singles events are non-options for me.  I've tried dating sites and making posts on reddit.  I've tried joining a few special-interest discords to make new friends.   Put it this way: it doesn't matter how fancy my flag is if it's always flying at half mast.

Some of you may have caught on by this point that I'm kinda sorta pretty mentally ill.  I mention this to help you understand why things like the bar scene or university clubs don't work for me.  Please be assured, meds and therapy and such are being applied and have been applied for the better part of the last twenty years of my life.  Unless I'm suddenly 'cured' by a breakthrough in neuroscience all I can do is keep my flag aloft but I'm running out of ideas and energy.  I come home from work tired, back achy, muscles sore.  I sometimes have enough energy to play some games, sometimes I just lie down and rest.  I don't mind working hard and I don't mind being tired, I mind that I don't have someone to share it with.  I can live with the emotional breakdowns that university madness causes but what's the point in facing that alone?  On my 30th birthday I said I'd try to keep at the self-improvement and dating until I was 40, and if I hadn't found something by then I'd at least know I tried my best.  It's a couple years in and 40 seems a long way away.  Maybe I'll cut it to 35.  That's reasonable, right?  There's only so much self-reflection I can do, only so many times I can revise my personal ad.

This post has been kind of all over the place.  I don't think it breaks any rules but if people think I'd be better off posting it somewhere else I can do that.",lonely,Am I just not good enough?,2021-06-08 05:34:48

3310,b1g_disappointment,1623094084,1,"Always been a pretty lonely person. Had friends in middle school who eventually made it clear they were just keeping me around as a laughing stock. Didn't have friends at high school. Met some friends during college year one but none of them seem to really care about me that much. Haven't spoken to my family for over two years because I hate them for putting me in this situation in the first place.

Almost every day I'll just go by have zero interactions with anybody I actually know, and waste my time doing nothing or just exercise.

And I almost came to terms with being alone, having considered how bad it was whenever I tried to even just live with other people as well as the type of person I am.

Then a few days ago I met this girl online because we'll soon move somewhere common, we talked and she seemed really enthusiastic for a while, I liked a lot about the person she told me she was (which is kind rare because I'm a picky person, and that's all on me), and I was hoping I might make a new friend. Her enthusiasm died overnight. I don't really blame her, I wouldn't be too happy talking to me either. I also don't really wanna annoy her further. But now I'm once again back to the loneliness, and I have to get used to it again.

I remember a quote from a movie that goes ""what's worse than hell, is being brought to heaven then back to hell.""

It's also scary in general how short lived good times can be. It can be months, weeks, days or even just minutes.

But then the teacher said ""Make groups of 4 people. We're going to make a quick presentation about plants"". And ok. Everyone started going to their groups and i kept waiting. I don't have any friends there so... I was just waiting for someone to call me. In the end, i ""had"" two options: a group of two people and a group with three people (note: this group of 3 was literally in front of me). The group 2 (the one with 2 people) called the teacher and asked if they could do the presentation with just two people. She said yes, till the group 3 call her and i think they'll ask her if i can join them. When she got there, they asked ""Can we make a group of 3 people?"" And again, i was literally behind them, they even saw me. In the end, i was in group three but i got the worst job. Then, grammar classes. The teacher made some games with us. Some people went two times, some people just once... I was the only one who didn't go there, and not because ""i didn't want to go there"", because i wanted. Ok, geography class, everything's ""fine"" till i get up to get my jacket, 2 minutes or less before the bell rings. The teacher saw that and said to me ""The most important thing that a student can have is a jacket"" saying like ""taking the jacket is more important than the class"" and right after he said that, the whole class laughed at me and the bell rings. And today, in the break, everyone was doing the same game. Like hide and seek but to ""take"" someone, you have to kick their asses. Literally EVERYONE was doing that and i was the only one that got punished for it, and when i said that everyone was doing that, they said ""But i just saw YOU running after them"" and obviously, everyone was watching and laughing at me. Well... Last thing is that no one even cares to talk to me. The only time they talk to me is when they need something. And with everything said, i ask, am i just fucking annoying? If not, then why everyone just laugh at me, blame me and exclude me? Plus, i don't know what I'm doing wrong, since no one talks to me, am i annoying them just from being there?

I remember that night, laying in bed with my tablet in hand. I was talking to you, and you mentioned cuddles. With that, we talked for hours, and we thought we found something special. The memory brings me joy. 

Almost a year later, the magic is gone. We barely speak now, and you often leave me hanging. At night, I think about our friendship, trying to figure out what went wrong. The melancholy keeps me from drifting off into a blissful dream. I wish I could stay the dreams forever. I wouldn’t have to worry.

I wish I could travel back in time, just to relive those memories again. Life felt better during those times. Thinking about being with you gave me hope for the future, but now that future is dim. The thought now gives me a heavy heart, and I wish for the thought to leave me alone.

Perhaps it is just natural that we drifted apart. Maybe we weren’t meant to be friends, but I find that too hard to accept. I just can’t. I remember the two years we’ve known each other for, and I can’t imagine knowing that those moments amounted to nothing. 

Such hell, thinking about you brings me both joy and frustration, yet I doubt you even care. Why must I suffer such a situation that is a mere inconvenience to you?

I often ask myself about why I even bother now. You don’t care, so why should I? But I can’t do it. You mean too much to me, but deep inside, I know I don’t matter much to you.

Recently, i’ve been thinking a lot and realised that loneliness is a position that I’ve put myself in the past 3 years. Something that i’ve recently realised over the past 3 years is how comfortable i’ve become with the sadness and general feeling of melancholy when friendships and things don’t go how i wished they would’ve have. This becomes a routine, a habit and a usual that any bit of happiness or valued friendships feel extra meaningful to me. but at the same time, i don’t dare to commit to these friendships because in a sense, i’m stepping out of my comfort zone of loneliness, and the feeling scares me a lot. I hate the situation that i put myself in all the freaking time, but yet thank myself in so many ways because this way, i protect my heart from any more unnecessary hurt.

3333,KindofIlya,1623085901,1," Hello everyone.  
This is my first Reddit post, but i really need to tell it to somebody.  
im 26 years old and i never have a relationship.  
My first love my first love was in grade 9. She was older, then me, and studied in grade 11. And, off course i get in friendzone.  
Then i love another girl, and got friednzoned too, and another....  
Over the past 11 years, I have been rejected 8 times. The last time I kissed a girl was 5 years ago. No one in my life has ever shown sympathy for me.  
But the worst story lies ahead.  
I had a girl - friend. She was my best friend for 7+ year. We helped each other and supported each other during all life's difficulties. And, off course i made a mistake - i fall in love with her. Deeply, insanely, like never before. I really thought I could one day be together until the very end. I realy think she is The One, the Best girl in the Whole world. She was so smart, so funny, so beautiful! For me she realy war Perfect. I have imagined many times how we will grow old together and live a whole life of complete happiness.  
But, you all know, how its end. 4 years ago I ended up in the friend zone. We continued to be friends, to spend a lot of time together, because during these 4 years she did not have any real relationship with anyone. I was happy every day that I spent with her, and in those moments I was really happy.  
But at the beginning of this year, she started a relationship. And today she stopped 7+ years friendship with me because she does not have time for me because of her new boyfriend.  
And i am so lost. I have the feeling that I have lost a part of myself, I lost not just a friend, or gilr i love, in which I am in love, even if she did not love me, but a person with whom I had such a psychological closeness as I had with no one before. I think that I will never hear her voice, her laugh, never see her smile, never touch her hands. And I don’t know how to deal with such a loss? This is not the first time that I stop communicating with someone because of the friend zone, but the first time it’s so hard, the first time it’s such an important person. I'm not sure why live on. If not for my parents, I would have ended my miserable existence.

3347,bipolarmom17,1623075353,1,"hi all, first post. I (31F) am the mother of an 8 year old girl. I am also bipolar. I've been on so many meds the past few years that I have lost count, what I am on now seems like it may be starting to work. fingers crossed. 

my daughter's father and I are not together but we are cordial and we try to co-parent best we can. he's not a great person, but he loves our daughter very much. we recently decided to take her to Disney together as we have not been able to do so since the pandemic. he told me when we split up, and recently, that he would keep paying my annual pass as I have not been able to work due to the severity of my illness. so I came up here thinking that all was good, and we would have a great time, the three of us.

he waited until we got here to tell me that he canceled my pass a while ago and that he only brought me so that our daughter would not be upset, but that he would not be paying for me to get into any of the parks, knowing I can't afford it. I had to bring my own food  because I cant even afford that for myself for the trip and now I am sitting at the hotel, alone, broken, while he is at magic Kingdom with our daughter who cried her eyes out when she realized I was not able to go.

why would he do this? it doesn't only hurt me, it hurts her too. it's hard to explain to an 8 year old that you don't have a few hundred dollars to drop on going to all of the parks. I don't understand why this is happening, I am so depressed I just want to be enjoying the day with my daughter. I'm mad at myself for not having been able to work, I'm pissed at my ex-husband for bringing me all the way here just to break my heart and my daughter's heart. I don't have any family or friends that I could borrow the money from, even just enough to go for one day to make her happy.

they left a few hours ago and I have been crying Non-Stop, I feel like the worst mother, I'm depressed as hell and so angry. I don't know what to do. there is no way for me to come up with the money especially while in Orlando. I should have stayed home and saved myself and my daughter from this pain.

God I hate this disease. feels like I'm losing my mine. if anyone has any advice or can help, please message me. I'm desperate.",lonely,heartbroken at Disney,2021-06-08 00:15:53
3348,Departure145,1623074451,1,"I was lonely most of my life. I got used to it. I was even sort of happy in my loneliness. I may not be lonely in some people eyes as I have family and maybe some friends although not close ones, no one to make plans with or anything. Not a great success with girls either and haven't even tried for some time.  In my heart I have always been alone without an idea what I am doing in life. But being alone didn't hurt anymore, I got bitter over the years but I didn't feel sad because of it and for the most part I was happy being my own company.

This changed when I met a girl, she started talking to me first and after a while we really hit it off. We talked to each other every day, called each other, flirted and laughed, we got extremely close and it was great. She really brought light back into my life. When covid allowed it, month or so ago, we met each other in real life and everything was great even then and we saw each several more times and really enjoyed our time together. But lately we have been growing distant. Some things from her life came into play and it is possible we may not end up with each other. She says she can't be doing stuff like this right now and we need to slow down sort of and that she doesn't want to hurt me with baiting me into this ""relationship"" and giving an idea of future together and then break my heart if it ever came to that. And I get it, life is life, things happen. I won't be going over her situation but it really is fine in a sense. We talked about it a lot and there isn't anything I can do, it's up to her and her choices and while personally I may not t see it the same way she does, it's ultimately on her and it's not that simple choice, there are many factors to consider for her.  


I just can't stand the growing apart, we said we would not deal with it and just be talking to each other normally but it's different than it used to be. We don't talk that much, before we would talk about everything any free minute, she doesn't call me anymore when she has free time at work, we don't say nice things to each other like we used to. We would send each other pictures every day, and would compete who would send more, these days there are barely any. We don't make plans anymore and if I don't write first we can go hours before she writes, mostly I write first. Before I would wake up to picture of her breakfast, good morning and what had happened to her that morning. It feels more like friendly conversation these days, forced even at times. Even tho she says she wants to keep talking and stuff. I just can't stand the idea of loosing her and being alone again. And there is nothing I can do and that really hurts. Even tho I know she still likes me and tells me that I mean a lot to her, I can't help but to feel heartbroken.   


I can't do things like I used to alone. I tried watching films or play games but nothing brings me joy anymore. I can't work, I can't study, I can't do anything apart from working out, doing little home choirs and pacing around the house. I've read a post here about someone not being hugged for 8 years and that made me think and ultimately write this post. I have hugged the girl I like two days ago, when we last saw each other, and it was long and tight hug, really great one. Yet I have never felt more alone than in that moment. Because while we were close as we could during that hug, we let each other go and went back to slowly edging away from each other. It showed what I will be loosing and just the idea broke my heart. I have never felt this terribly and this lonely. The worst thing is it's not even that bad. As I said we still talk to each other, there is no bad blood and we are trying. She also feels really bad as well, she doesn't have it easy. I just miss her and the thing we used to be. And during that hug I missed her the most. 

I am just afraid of what will happen if she makes the choice that will not allow us to talk to each other anymore, if this is the way I feel now. The other day I hurt myself for the first time ever and I don't do things like this. Scary thing is that it actually helped and I felt better for a moment. I never cry, I haven't for many years, barely ever feel like it either, yet lately every now and then I get this terrible feeling of loneliness and I fear the day I won't be able to hold the tears. I can't stand being alone right now yet I have no one to talk to. I am sitting in deadlines and I can't force myself to work and it is getting close to the moment when it can do some damage to my life. 

I really don't know what to do, how to make myself feel better to push through this. In a sense I know things will be fine in the end. I just can't find a way to really believe it right now.",lonely,I was fine being alone until I wasn't alone anymore,2021-06-08 00:00:51

 1) I'm young, I'm only 18, and I'm fully aware that this has a high likelihood of changing (hopefully positively) 

2) I've been through enough in my short life to come to a really realistic, and sometimes cold, way of looking at things, so, if something I say seems really cold hearted or something along those lines, that's why. 

For the last year or so I've noticed something. I've noticed that I haven't had a crush or relationship interest in anybody. I didn't really think much of it when it started, simply cause I was preoccupied getting my mental state back to a place of stability, but as I got more stable I really noticed it and started thinking about it more. The more I thought about it the less I seemed to get. I don't get love. Not love in a sense of friendship or family, no, love like the ""better half"" or ""soulmate"" and all of the below pertaining to that kind of relationship. I don't see how someone can be so happy and content and patient and such with another person. It makes sense on paper, but unraveling that into actual actions for myself is a different story. It hasn't made sense to me in a while on a few levels
A) what exactly drives person A to attempt something with person B

B) what were the factors of a person to agree to such a thing 

C) How far ahead were they thinking with this 

Etc. 

I know it simply seems like complete overcomplication, and I wouldn't doubt that it was. The big kicker for me was figuring out what was an emotional pull and what was a physical pull. Was I jealous of my friends couples  because they were happy? Cause they were fuck*ng? Cause I'm deprived of one/both? That's what I always used as a crutch too, not having enough experience in either to get it, but when you don't even understand the prerequisites, you can get caught in a loop. It's not that I don't feel, it's that the emotion is too complicated for my brain to comfortably break down to even make sense of it all. I looked back at all of the people I had a ""crush"" on in the past 2 years, and all of of them boiled down to lust. If I was just looking at the extremes, there'd be plenty of sources to blame. Social media bullshit mainly, but I'm looking at the whole hierarchy, all the way down to crushes. Thinking you wish to pursue something with someone as a couple. I hope this made sense to anyone who saw this. If I just need some sex or whatever the solution may be, I'd just like someone to tell me straight up, but, to me at least, it seems more complicated than that.",lonely,Understanding the unexplainable,2021-06-07 20:16:03

But after middle school o dropped all my middle school friends cause they were either getting into drugs, or were becoming assholes I didn't want to be associated with. So during my freshman year I made a few friends but after freshman year they just dropped me. No texts no responses. And if I did get a response it was always a half ass response that didn't mean anything. Then it was arround this time I realized my church friends were all fake and didn't actually like to hang around with me. So I just remember being bored out of my mind that summer with nothing to do. 

My sophomore year was rough. But I made a small group of friends in my tech class that I liked to talk to. But during the school year we all sorta drifted apart and one of them would just straight up ditch me during lunch and I had to move to another table with one of my old middle school friends who was the only chill one that didn't become an asshole towards the end. But it turns out he did become an asshole and did all his friends. They stole shit out of my bag and they just bullied me whenever I sat there so my entire sophomore year was just shit. I had no one to talk to and no one to be with. I would just go home and be alone until the next school day. 

It was arround this time when I started talking to someone I liked but we were unable to go out on a date due to covid. But we continue talking and she ended up being my best friend.
She was the only person that kept in contact with me, the only person I could talk to about anything and she was there for me when I was making the transition out of becoming Mormon when I found out that was a fake. So this person was there for me when no one else would. We then started dating late into the school year my Junior year and life was going fairly well for me.

It's the cliche love story. Met in high school, have kids eventually marry. But I keep questioning myself who is this girl. For years I've been able to picture her in my head during my thoughts of this fantasy relationship. She's completely made up. Ive been single for 7 years. Since junior year of high school. When i would make up scenarios to kep me from feeling completely pathetic and lonely I think of this imaginary girl. I'm in love with her, yet she's not real and I've never met anyone who looks like her at all. But I can't get her face out of my head. I honestly believe there's something mentally wrong with me. She pops up every now and then every single day. And when I lay down to relax, I have small scenarios of having conversations with her. I guess being single all these years could (or could not) have this effect on people. I've also made imaginary family members of hers' that live with us in this one big imaginary house (I know this sounds pathetic, but who tf cares it's reddit, Im anonymous).

I just hope I find someone soon before my head completely fucks me up and I'm totally stuck with this fake world I think of and end up losing my grasp on reality. Because that type of ""comfort zone"" could never make me want to try and do something about dating. And even when girls I end up crushing on date other men, to make myself feel better I think of her. I'm totally dependent on it. It makes me feel pathetic. I see people dating alot.

3386,THROWRApropercrab,1623042034,1,"Hi everyone

As an 18yo, I've always envisioned this period between high school and college to be the most stress-free, relaxing and exciting time of my life. Never again will we be able to enjoy the advantages of being a 'kid', where we don't have to carry the burdens of responsibility because our parents/guardians do that for us, and where we feel young, lively and energetic. Of course, COVID has demolished a couple of our ambitions, but as the world is reopening, my friend's parents decided to host an all-expense paid trip for our friend group. 

We live in a country that isn't handling COVID so well but will be traveling to one that is doing well. The problem is, my family and I don't have a residential visa for our country because my father lost his job due to the pandemic. This means that, if our country of residency's borders does not open, I wouldn't be able to return home, which rendered me unable to join them on this trip. 

I understand my privilege. Yes, my father lost his job, but I'm still very fortunate to not have to worry about the basic things in life, such as food, warmth and shelter. I've been thinking about this trip for a long time and have been progressively degrading mentally as I think about just how much fun they'll have on this 3-week trip. I'm also sad because I know that I'll most likely never get to experience this type of freedom again. How can we ever coordinate such a carefree trip in our 20s or 30s, when we all have individual responsibilities, have to pay for everything and aren't as energetic and invigorated as we are now? 

I know I should find activities to take my mind off this thought, but even though I do have some plans for while they are gone, I know the thought will continue to creep into my mind. I'll try to reduce my usage of social media so I'm not directly reminded of the trip. I hope these emotions aren't petty. Anything is appreciated. Thank you!",lonely,Friends are traveling and I feel lonely,2021-06-07 15:00:34

3388,tadpoleSquish,1623041189,1,"I come from a very complicated family. The majority of them not being the best kind of people and usually addicted to some kind of substance.

This lead me to be pretty distant from most of them, especially my immediate family as my mother was a severe drug addict and my sisters are just the worst people you could meet.

I cut them out while keeping a very select few around that didn't actively use, abuse, and sabotage me. I grew up poor and underprivileged do to my mother's addiction and as you can imagine, not the best mental health.

I grew up pretty lonely but I worked hard and became the person I always dreamt of becoming. I was even the first one in the family to earn a college degree in generations. Unfortunately covid saw that I didn't have a graduation for that, so I never got to celebrate it the way I always dreamed of.

The decision was made that my partner and I would move out of state for better opportunities and I took that chance to plan a going away/graduation party.

I planned it two weeks ahead and sent out the invitations to about a 10 people that I considered close enough to care that I was leaving for good, and all 10 agreed to coming.

The day before the party we spent hundreds of dollars on cake and food preparations for the party and I was beyond excited to celebrate the new life I worked so hard to achieve. The day of the party I got dressed up in my cutest dress and heels, and even put extra care into my make up to make sure I looked ny best for all the future pictures everyone would take of me before I left.

By 12pm the day of the party everyone had an excuse on why they couldn't show up and I spent the day sad and alone.

I really just want to put out one main thought- when you feel like you tried everything and it didn’t work or help… What are you even supposed to do? How are you supposed to learn what healthier or happier friendships look like without experience in friendships?

I do think about wether I’m in the wrong and not seeing it, if I’m more awkward or rude than I think, I consider wether it’s my fault or external circumstance and how much I can change- but I really don’t think that I am a bad person and I can self-reflect as much as I want but I’ve just been alone for so long- what else am I supposed to know or work off at this point if I do need to improve or change myself? And I genuinely don’t know what to do to change my circumstance because I’ve done stuff for the hell of it, tried to change a lot, nothing gets me out of it even as the one putting in so much effort. I genuinely feel like I can’t change things and I’m tired of trying, and not even having someone to share that frustration with.

I guess years ago I had happier friendships… but all those people abandoned or gutted me and these days I don’t truly trust anyone.

I'm in my 20s and I know, I'm still young but life has just been bringing me down recently. To start, my family and I grew up very poor and most of my childhood, I never saw them much. I used to go to bed alone on a couch in a one bedroom  motel room(they worked at the same motel) and lack of any adult supervision has really given me mental health problems. My parents were immigrants and didn't understand how to do things like babysitting and daycare. I love them both a lot, and I don't and never have held it against them. After about age 8, we began moving around a lot because they'd find a different job. We moved many times and I was always the new kid at school, I've never felt a sense of belonging or community. Fast  -forward to age 13 and my parents move into a somewhat small town and it's the first place we've stayed for more than a year. I was a nobody and up until High School, I was just that guy everyone knew and was cool with simply because I had no friends or a certain group to be cateforized with as preppy, weird, nerdy, etc. I was also bullied in middle school and called annoying but I just wanted friends. I suppose people forgot that in high school but I was never a part of a clique. Not once was I invited over to hangout with people and homecoming and prom was something I wish I could've gone to but I had no date or even a friend group to go with. Fast-forward to 18, I'm out of high school and move to a huge city for college. The first semester was amazing, I had friends and even went partying with a bunch of people from my dorm the first weekend I was there. Move into second semester, my friends talk to me less and less because they've found another friend group but the new friend group doesn't like me because we just don't vibe. To be honest, I didn't like them either because they seemed preppy. It's halfway through the semester and I've lost my main friend group. I'm back to square fucking one. I drop out after the first year and while I was away, my parents who own a business now begin to do really well. I'm working for them now and have been since I got out but I just wish I had a friend group. I've never even had a girlfriend. I wish I could've used Snapchat and Instagram. Don't worry, I'm not an incel and blaming women for my problems. Anyway, the part that really gets to me is that due to my parents' business booming, it has allowed us and me to be able to afford extremely luxurious things and an amazing lifestyle.  I'm not going to mention everything because I don't want it to seem like I'm bragging but materially speaking, I should not have any of the things I do at my current age. I mention this because from Reddit, people would love to have and afford the things I can, and I feel so ungrateful and rude for being willing to give all of it up to have a restart in life but with a sense of community, belonging and friends. 

I know that was all over the place but I was just typing as it came to mind. I want to hate my life but I cant. I just feel my life and I are so hypocrtical and a joke. I don't even know how to explain everything",lonely,"I just need to vent, hence the throwaway account",2021-06-07 13:51:09

I’m a 21 year old guy and the reason I call myself a loser is because I have never been loved by anyone but my parents and unfortunately the longer this trend continues to carry on the more I believe it will never happen. I have never even kissed a girl, gone on a date, nothing. I have never even noticed a girl glance at me, not once.

I feel like if I don’t at least have one date or have my first kiss soon that I will become so inexperienced that truly no one will ever want me. I feel as though I have so much love and support to give. truthfully all I want is to have that one person you can tell everything, and hold in your arms.

Which I know that I don’t deserve anything. Having a girlfriend is not something owed to me. However, that doesn’t mean I don’t long for the feelings of loving someone unconditionally with the same in return.  I just wish someone would give me a chance.

I have been played a fool before online by women who saw how vulnerable I am and took my money saying they would visit me and give me a chance. Obviously still kissless and dateless at 21 so you know they just took hundreds of dollars from me and ghosted me.

I just feel so lonely. I can’t talk to my friends because they are all in happy long relationships and they can’t comprehend how hard it is to be constantly used and friendszoned and to never have had a date nor a kiss.

Because what is life anyways if I will have no one to share it with. Once my parents are gone no one will love me. And this thought makes me so sad.

However, at this time in my life, I was not a good person... I was mean, and a bully. Granted I was bullied as well, but that’s no excuse. 

During this time, I struggled with this false confidence because it was only brought on by the fact that other people my age began considering me attractive. (AKA puberty hit, I lost the baby fat, grew boobs, started wearing makeup etc.) 
 I didn’t know what to do, or how to feel with the new attention, so I acted like the attractive popular kids in school because I figured that’s what I needed to do. 
In this, I came to realize that most, if not all popular kids, are fucking losers, and I was one of them.  

After my teens, I learned who I really was, that I am actually kinda shy and that’s ok. Meaning, I found out I didn’t really like being bold and the center of attention.

3414,Kakaditz,1623029554,1," 

I’ve been thinking on a lot lately. Mainly, why I’m the way I am. I’m…. Pretty cowardly. Specifically when it comes to pursuing things that are important to me, ie. career goals, hobbies, relationships (romantic, familial, friendships), or even living a healthy (or at least healthier) lifestyle. When I start to try, or even start thinking about taking the first steps towards achieving these goals, I make excuses and stop “I don’t have time” “I don’t even know where to start” “There’s no way I’ll succeed” “What’s the point, I’m gonna die one day anyway” “I’m worthless, I wouldn’t even deserve to make it” or I don’t even make an attempt. But there’s one thing that bothered me more than anything. This overwhelming fear I have when I having these thoughts. Its irrational, but I can’t help but feel as if I’m in danger when I try to better myself. Doesn’t sound like it makes sense does it? Well, after doing some serious introspection, I think I finally came to a conclusion as to why this is. 

I told myself a long time ago, I wouldn’t blame anyone else for my own failings and/or problems. But, when examining my upbringing, I can’t help but to theorize that it played a little more than a minor role in my current mindset. I got beaten on pretty badly as a kid by my peers at school, and my parents. Yea, I’m one of those people, who have not so nice family members. I’m hesitant to call myself an ‘abuse survivor’, likely because, to me, it sounds like I’m making excuses again. But, when I think about how my own parents bruised me, hurled chairs at me, and beat my head with a metal tray to the point of putting a dent in it, all over things like getting low grades middle school or not bringing all my books home, I can’t help but think that if I ever told the proper authorities about it, they’d be in jail. Thankfully, my siblings didn’t have to suffer this. I’m the oldest, so I guess my folks had a lot of expectations for me, that I just wasn’t meeting. It also didn’t help that, being the geek I’ve always been, I got bullied and beat up pretty harshly at school, sometimes getting black eyes that no one would get punished for. There were times I’d get bullied in the middle of class, and teachers wouldn’t do anything. I’d get chased during lunch period and have to hide in the bathroom from groups of boys wanting to kick my ass. My only solace was my ability to get under their skin with my shit talking.

What I’m getting at is, over time, I developed a defeatist mentality. I always assumed things would go wrong, or I’d fail no matter what it was I wanted to achieve. And since at an early age, I was taught that failure equalled physical harm, I opted to lie, cheat, steal, hide, or runaway, just to decrease to odds my me experiencing pain, or increase the likelihood that I'd experience even just a fraction of happiness. Now, I’m a grown adult, living on my own, still having that same fear loom over my head. Good things have come into my life, I’ve made friends (online sure, but that counts right? Lol) and even met some people that would actually want to have me as a romantic partner. Still, fear looms. But recently, despite this crippling anxiety, I was able to do something I desperately wanted to do, and having done it, and realizing no one is going to attack me for it, feels amazing. I still struggle with these feelings, but I’m trying to do better, but ya know, therapy ain’t cheap, haha. I still feel lonely sometimes, even though I now know I have people in my life who give a damn about me. It's a struggle, it always will be. But my hope is for me, and anyone reading this, to keep struggling, no matter how painful. Everyone's circumstances are different, so I won't say I understand why all of you feel lonely, but there are people in this world who will treat you right. Never stop looking for them.

3416,dxclxd,1623027873,1,"I’m  from the UK, i’m starting uni in a couple months, and all i’ve heard is how it’s going to be a whole new environment with new people, but i fear that nothing will change.

I couldn’t go to my high school 6th form because it wasn’t going to run my course that year, so I opted to go to a college that isn’t too far away from me, and ever since then, only a few people from high school actually spoke to me, before the pandemic, I was trying to meet some people from my old high school but they were always busy, now 2 years later I don’t even speak to them people, and the other day I saw one of my best friends in high school walking down the same street as me and we were both going in opposite directions, I was getting excited and I was happy and smiling and feeling good, I go to say hi to her and she just straight up ignored me, it felt like I got kicked in the stomach, nowadays I don’t even speak to anyone from my old high school.

I’m now 18, and all over social media I see people from my old high school drinking, going out, having fun, and i’m stuck at home, I’ve not even gotten a hello, even from the people I was really close with in high school, let alone asking if I want to go out, and I genuinely feel like I have been forgotten by everyone.

I’ve only ever been in 1 relationship and it was horrible, it was with a girl that not a lot of boys actually wanted her at my school, but she was the first ever girl to ever “show interest” in me, but we never went on dates because she said she didn’t like them, we never had sex because she said she was waiting until marriage, which i respected, all we ever did was watch a movie, eat a takeaway and maybe kiss, but that was all we ever did for 10 months, then out of nowhere, she just broke up with me and not only me but everyone else was so confused, then later on I found out that she only wanted to date me because all of her friends had boyfriends, so she wanted one, and then a month later, I see her with a new boy, and they went on dates, and through conversations, I found out that she also had sex with the boy, this put me in one of the lowest points in my life ever, I thought I was never good enough for someone to actually want me, be seen with me and go on a date with me, and getting told that no sex until marriage but then go have sex with someone else. Most of the people at my college have all lost their virginity and now they are going on trips in the country or abroad with their partner, whilst me over here has never even taken a girl out on a date, I don’t even know how to act or what to say on a date. The closest I have ever gotten to having sex was at a party with this girl who was drunk, and no offence but she was a bit overweight, and she told me that we can go back to her place and have sex, but I know having sex with a girl who isn’t in her senses is wrong, so I didn’t go forward with that.

Making friends isn’t particularly difficult for me, when I arrived at college I already made friends on the first day and I still speak to all of them today, but because of covid I didn’t see them for 6+ months, then when we started our second year in college and we were allowed to have in person lesson, they changed all of our lesson times and lunches for covid protocol, and I was only with 1 of my friends I made last year, the rest of them were in separate lessons and I have barely even seen them this year, some I saw less than 3 times in the whole school year, and that 1 friend I made in lessons last year, is only for one of my subjects, and I take 3 subjects, the other 2 subjects I had no one to talk to at all,  I was always just by myself and the lessons felt so long, and it felt so weird from me having friends in my all of my lessons last year to only having 1 in only 1 subject.

I’m now heading off to uni and I don’t know what to do, I fear that things won’t change and I won’t feel wanted by anyone, even though I have never had it, sex isn’t a priority to me, all I want is for someone to love me equally as much as I love them, and for them to not feel embarrassed about being seen with me and to care for me as much as I would care for them, I just want to feel loved man.",lonely,really getting tired of life and fear it’s only going to get worse,2021-06-07 11:04:33

3425,Martyr00,1623025820,1,"I've never posted on reddit before and this will probably be my only post.

When I was still very young, my dad died. My mom always had mental issues but she got worse after this and eventually lost her job. As a 16 year old back then, one of the worst thing you can go through is leaving your mom in a psychiatric hospital. With medication, we thought she was under control but one day she just left me with my sister. She was gone for 3 months. Back then I really wanted to end it all but Idk if it's silly hope or I'm just too scared but I could never go through with it. All this made me become someone who was always on his own, I didn't really talk to others or if I did, it was with a fake smile because whenever I would look at my friends, they would always be having fun while I was going through hell. On Christmas, I was quite jealous of other people with their families. The rest of my family don't really care about me either, they hated us  so once my dad died, they stopped pretending. Not once did they ever visit us after his death. The only ones who care live abroad. During school holidays, I would often spend my days in bed alone at home and wonder how much more I could sink and every time I felt like I've hit rock bottom, I'd get punched by life some more. The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I could tell myself that I'm still young so eventually it should get better, right? Time would heal everything.

My relationships: I was never interested in others because I felt like they wouldn't understand me or that if I ever opened up to someone, they would go tell others and they'd laugh about it. However, I've never had any difficulty getting into relationships but it was always just so one sided, I couldn't open up. I was probably young and stupid but I've always felt some kind of barrier between me and girls I've been with. Even in tuitions or clubs I attended, whenever someone showed me any interest, I just couldn't reciprocate because my feelings were so locked and I knew that I had to go back home eventually , living in a silence that slowly crept up on me. I hated this silence during my teenage years, I couldn't handle it, I always put on music just so that my house would seem a bit livelier. My gf broke up with me during my last year of high-school(?) (I was 19, I missed a year- sorry if it's not called high school, I'm not too familiar with the US education system) but then I met someone who'd change my life. I met this crazy girl who jumped onto me the first time we met, she seemed like she liked me so much that I hated it a bit at first. I thought that she was too sticky. Although I knew she loved me, I didn't love her back, I felt like it couldn't last for more than 3 months because I thought she was too easy going and wrongly believed that she must be like this with other guys/girls she might like but I was wrong. It took me 2 years to finally realize I loved her. I learned more about her and I finally opened up to her but she never mocked me, she listened to my worries. We shared our deepest fears, losses, pains and hope. She's the first ever person to shed a tear for me and for this I'm eternally grateful. She supported me in my education. She was always there telling me to go kick the world's butt, that I could do it and it gave me hope that maybe I could succeed, that I could also dream of finding happiness. I finally managed to obtain a first class degree and she was happy for me. She knows how tough high-school was for me, trying to focus on studies and my situation with my mom. We talked a lot about our plans, our future. Maybe it seems silly now but we planned to get married and I wanted her to have my kids. Unfortunately, not all fairy tales have a good ending. Let's just say that we woke up from our dream, reality caught up to us and that real life put many responsibilities on us that we have to shoulder. She has a kid, has had one since we met and I knew it, it didn't bother me but we lived quite far away and couldn't meet as often. Now her kid is older, he has his own environment, his own friends. She has also lost so many of her family due to covid that she fell into depression but I always try to side by her but with all the restrictions everywhere, it has been hard and our plans to settle down somewhere vanished. She could no longer bear the thought of being far from her family she had left to be with me and I couldn't ask her or son to make sacrifices for me. Back here, I also have to take care of my mom who is better with medication but always needs to be monitored and my job. It breaks my heart everyday knowing that I can never be with her, that we will never see our children grow together. Our story ended months ago but we still talk. We try to move on but during her moments of weaknesses, she still lets some emotions slip but I can't take advantage of her. She has taught me love and I want her to be happy with someone closer to where she lives. Both of us have been talking and meeting other people but my heart just isn't into it anymore. When yesterday she told me that she was getting to know someone, I felt like my heart sank but I had to be happy for her. I feel like at every turn I lose, when I was young, I lost my dad, I lost my mom to her illness, I never had a caring family, I had very few friends I could share anything with and now I've lost my best friend and my love. I wish I could flip a middle finger to reality and say f*ck it and go live with her but I have many responsibilities which keep me here. So yesterday I had a mental breakdown, having dark thoughts, wondering that this kid who was sitting here alone 12 years ago is still alone again. That time only gave me the illusion that my loneliness was gone but I was back to square one.

Final thoughts: While typing all this, I've felt much better actually. I probably won't come back to this  reddit because I fear to see the reaction. So, to whoever reads this, this is just another story among the millions around us that will fade away.

Next to the bed my bags were full because the very next day I would take the train to go to music university. I look up and a feeling of deep and sincere happiness fills my entire body. Here I am, with the most amazing person I've ever known, about to realize my dream of becoming a music student, one short train ride away from her. We have vacations plans together. Coming from being bullied in school, my life had finally rewarded me for waiting, and it took the best turn I could ever hope. I was 17. 

Next morning, after kissing my crying girlfriend I get in the train, not knowing this is where it all falls down... My girlfriend goes to a different uni and straight away tells me about all the partying she does and how great everyone think she is. None of that happens to me... By the fifth day she calls me and says she cheated. The next morning she sends two texts to tell me we should break up. I protest and try to ask why. She doesn't answer directly, tries to avoid saying why. I understand that she just wants to get rid of me. 

5 days...

5 days is all it took to go from me being the greatest thing in someone's life to being thrown away like a rotten apple.

I try to talk to my flatmates, they're all nice, but they don't seem to be seeking anything but aquaintance level talk from me. Fair enough... I try to go out, doesn't go well. If it's not painfully awkward like 80% of the time, It is basically just conversation that last 2 minutes on the lines of ""hi my name is ... What are you studying? ... Nice, well it's nice meeting you! *Goes away* "" 

Fast forward until now, Nothing has happened, I didn't make a single friend. I've had no single text that isn't about work, the whole year. My flatmates have all gone into one or several relationships during the year and regularly have friends over. My course is also not at all what I expected, and if I knew what else I could do with my time I would probably drop out.

Anyways. To the present. And the point. 

Today I moved out. 

Shared student accommodation.

I've wanted to move regardless of the social benefits, but I have been guilty of imagining the potential friends I could meet in a flat share. A chance to meet people my age. Explore the city with them. Bond.  

Well. As it turns out. I met my flatmates. They are not students. They are middle aged. They don't speak English. They arrived a week before me, and the kitchen is already a state. 

They are, like most in the complex I'm in, from what I gather, here as part of a free housing scheme. This student complex is on the front line of underclass immigrant integration to our country.

I've seen no other people in the complex near my age. None of my background. I am a no man in foreign land. A part of my laughingly feels forgotten by society, when I've no right to.

Because, in typical Peep Show fashion, the universe has maligned my insignificance with the greater problems of the world, reminding me of how pathetic any feelings of loneliness I may have are in comparison to the sobering realities of the homeless and underclass.

Ooooh you feel a bit lonely? You're unhappy your flatmates aren't what you imagined? The audacity.",lonely,I'm literally living in Peep Show.,2021-06-07 10:06:47

3436,Mission-Breakfast-83,1623022980,1,"Now of course I have online friends but these days I’ve realised that I don’t have friends in real life. All I have are a collection of people who just get along with me but wouldn’t necessarily want to develop a friendship with me. I often find it hard to make friends and take my time to do so, unfortunately, people often mistake those moments as me not having an interest in a friendship. I really try my hardest.

I’m often trying to make plans for my “friends” but either get ignored or just cancelled on for other plans. I just want to hang out and have some company. Instead, I’m sitting at my desk in my room all alone with no one to talk to nor anyone to hang out with. I eat alone in the kitchen in silence hearing the neighbouring student houses filled with laughter. I feel forgotten/invisible.

I often support and help people whenever I can in any way possible. But then there’s no one to help me, I feel like I’m drowning every day in my loneliness. No one has ever thought out to reach out to me because again I feel forgotten.

I love to go cycling and going to the beach to relax. But now every time I sit on the beach, I'm always reminded how lonely I am. Groups of friends and couples constantly remind me of how alone I am, I'm happy for people who have friendship groups or are in relationships, you do you. But, why doesn't anyone want to be friends with me or hang out with me? It's like the whole world is against me and wants me to be alone. 

I recently just finished my second-year exams and the first morning to the start of my summer holiday, I realise that I don't have anyone to tell that I've finished my exams. I had breakfast alone as usual but it was different. All I know is working and studying, I use work and my studies to distract myself from my loneliness. But now that I have nothing to do, I just alone. I just silently cried to myself after that breakfast alone at the kitchen table. 

I don't remember how it feels to be happy anymore nor how it feels to have friends or people that care, recognise me or appreciate my presence. I give so much to others that I have nothing to give to myself anymore.

3446,GizmaAzara,1623018287,1,"This always happens to me. For context, I am a 21 year old female who has never been in a romantic relationship or had my first kiss. I also have one friend. We met in high school and just recently built our friendship. But all throughout my life I was always the fat friend. The single friend. The third wheel. The one who never got invited to parties and if I did, I was their ""entertainment"" where I was the weird one who was bullied. 

However, in middle school, around 8th grade, thats when everyone was starting to get into relationships. I had crushes, sure, and I had a bit bigger social circle in middle school but all of my ""friends"" were dating my crushes. One time I was bullied relentlessly for asking a classmate to the 8th grade formal. I was called a sumo wrestler and told that I smell.

Move onto high school, I left all of that behind. I would get driven an hour to a different school entirely. I was the new kid. I experienced mutism because I didn't talk for about 3 months. But a group of other POC took me in because this was a predominantly white school. But once I got comfortable, I made ""friends"" in band and theatre. Of course, being a high school girl, I had crushes. 

I asked one guy out, he said no. I kept all my other crushes to myself. Then in my junior year, I had a crush on a guy and the only other girl in my class encouraged me to ask him out and he said no because he doesn't date black girls. So my confidence was shot. I went home and looked up skin bleaching agents and how to whiten my skin at home. I hated my skin. But I just went through school. Senior year, prom came along, I asked a few guys, all rejected. I decided, let me ask my crush. He said he wasnt going to prom. 

Then after graduation I decide since I am never going to see any of these people again, I told my long time crush (not the one i asked to prom) how I felt. We hugged. Said we would miss each other. That was that. Fast forward to now. About 3 years later.

My friend and I try to spend every Friday together. I, am still the fat ugly tag along. When we went out to a restaurant, the waitor was flirting with her and wouldn't even look at me. I tried to joke about it but I was jealous. Then when we were leaving the restaurant, a group of guys started to make fun of me out loud. I tried to pretend like I wasn't hurt. 

Now today my friend texts me saying how if anyone asks, I was at her house. I made the joke asking who she would be sleeping with since she was known to have an active sex life. She said she would just be cuddling. So I asked if it was one of my crushes that she knew about. She said yea. And I acted supportive and such. I said they would be cute together. But it just left me feeling lonely.

I never get the guy. I am always that supportive fat friend. The one who everyone ""loves"" because she makes jokes and listens and cares for everyone else. But I want to be loved for real. I want to cuddle. I want to kiss. I want to be able to say that a guy is out there for me but I think it's pointless in hoping. I know 21 is young but I basically already set it in motion that if I'm still not in some relationship or have had one by my 26th birthday I'm ending my life. 

I am so depressed and mentally ill that my existence is just a drugged up zombie who supports everyone else with no support. I am trying to lose weight. My meds caused me to gain what I lost. So now I am trying again. I do what my therapist suggests and nothing works. Like am I really that unloveable? I'm just meant to be alone I guess.",lonely,I'm Meant to Be Alone,2021-06-07 08:24:47

3448,8754330778,1623018029,1,"Hello lonely people, I (21M) have friends but still “lonely” if that makes sense ? 🥺

If I’m out with them having a drink or doing other naughty things I’m physically there but not mentally .. 

I hate the way most humans think in general, they always have an opinion to give and people love to judge but don’t have the balls to say what they think to your face and that triggers intrusive horrible thoughts in my head which I don’t mind anymore because I’m so unique and edgy 😱

Most people these days walk around like mindless sim characters, looking for things to do so that they can post it on social media for a tiny little ego boost to get them through the day before it’s nap time 

Anyways I quit my job, I’d rather get my nose broken than fake laugh at my managers jokes again , and the new career path I have planned for me will end up with me having to leave my friends and family behind so there’s something to look forward to 

But for all you lonely people out there who have hit rock bottom, and don’t have anyone to talk to at the moment, and have resorted to posting their feelings on this forum because no one in the real world is there for you: 

If you keep this up you’ll only make things worse …. Just because you have no one now doesn’t mean it stays like this forever … start working out whether it’s at a gym or home, learn how to fight (you’ll feel a lot more confident knowing that you can defend yourself if people try to fuck with you..), try lsd if you can get your hands on it….. go outside and do / study whatever the fuck you want .. 

Sooner or later you’re going to end up speaking to someone as weird/lonely/interesting as you, but it won’t happen if you’re sitting home feeling sorry for yourself

Most of you are probably in your early 20’s I’m guessing? You’re a quarter of a way through your life already… it all has to end someday, so there’s no harm in trying to live a little while you still can … just wait and see, it gets worse before it gets better (yes I know that’s a cliche thing to say 👁👃🏻👁)

3471,teddy0088,1623008906,1,"I grew up in a large family. I’m the oldest of 10 kids. I have 10+ aunts and uncles, and 50+ cousins. 

Being the son of a janitor, I grew up very poor, but we got by.

Being poor, my parents couldn’t afford to send me to college, and I couldn’t get a student loan to pay for it.

I’ve been going to community college part time, and saving up for college. 

All of my friends from high school have all moved on. I was the only one in my friend group to not go to college.

They all have moved on. They all graduated, got good jobs, and moved out of our hometown. Two are engaged, one is married, and one is expecting a child...and I’m still living at home, waiting tables. 

I’m 22, and feel incredibly behind in life.

All of my cousins moved on. My sister is going to college. I’m stuck in my hometown.

I feel like I have nothing to strive for, or work towards. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to.

I was so excited for adulthood, college, and a career....but life beat the crap out of me.

Now, I go to work, talk to coworkers, come home, sleep, and do it all over again. 

My friends left me and quit talking to me. My cousins moved on. My sister is in the middle of moving on. And I’m still stuck in my own personal hell. I just feel alone. I feel like everyone is leaving me behind, while I struggle to make a life for myself.

I almost love being lonely and how i don't have to care about texting/worrying about someone else or carrying their thoughts with me. It is a big responsibility that i'm glad i don't have. 

All i do now is satisfy myself rather than someone else which is something that reinforced my persona a lot, i'm hyper-confident ,more than when i was in high school. Even though i'm good looking guy, i still don't think currently i have a chance with a woman and i don't hate it. I just accept the fact that in my generation there are some unnecessary steps that you have to burden yourself with to get a gf, that i'm not weak enough to take. I don't think about being lonely unless i want to force myself; i end up with saying ""who cares or whatever"" and just go on with my day.

I just want a few good friends. And I very much want to find my true love. I'm old enough now that I've lived plenty, and, unlike some very unfortunate lonely folks on here, I've had plenty of experiences with women and plenty of sex. Some don't like to speak at all about sex, but the truth is, if you're a man and you can't find anyone willing to be intimate with you, it can be a prolonged sinking feeling to which there is no good solution. To any such men reading this post: I understand. And I hope you find someone to love you. 

As for me, though, I'm seeking something even more elusive than sex: someone who truly likes me. And ideally, a woman who will become my wife and the mother of my children. That just got heavy, didn't it? I can dial it back. I can say I just want a connection like so many others on Reddit. And I do want a connection. But I have found, personally, a shortage of women whose life goal is to have a family. Because that's my life goal! 

To have that burning desire, to know it is what would make me happiest on this earth, and to have the days pass by while I seek and find nothing... it's all quote saddening. I confess I'm in a rather melancholy mood today. But the funny thing about life is it can change on you in a single moment. Suppose I hear from someone and we fall in love? Wouldn't that be something?

I'm based in Indiana. Near-ish Chicago. But I'll talk to just about anyone. I'm really hoping I'm not the only person for whom marriage and a family are my main life goals. I get it...many opt for careers these days. If the plummeting birthrate in the US is any indication, most value careers and leisure more than having a family. I understand that. A family is a lot of work and it can be expensive. But I know it will make me happy. I feel that happiness obliquely when I'm around my nephew or my little cousins. But it fades because in the end, I am only an uncle or a big cousin and not a father. 

I'm not a saint by any means. I've done bad things as we all have. But I am on a mission of self-improvement, day by day. I have to keep remembering that, to live one day at a time. Living entirely for the far future, or living entirely in the shadow of the distant past, these just haven't worked for me. I live that way and I find my old friends depression and anxiety. But I've felt bliss once or twice and I know how to get it back. 

But as Augustine knew, knowledge isn't sufficient for virtue or for happiness. I know very well what will make me happy, but knowing it is one thing and achieving it is some other very different thing. And while I'm not hideous, I'm not particularly beautiful. The best thing I have going for me is my brain and my capacity for kindness. I hope you're kind too, incidentally. 

I decided to post here rather than r4r because I feel I can be more myself here. I can be a bit more sober, a bit more somber, a bit more strange. If I post to r4r or related subs, I feel like a salesman, and the product isn't all that great. But here I can just vent and, hey, if you like what you read, please say hello! 

Oh, and so I know you've read it, if you message me, mention you favorite vacation destination. Mine is southern California :)

You know, the world throws a lot of shit at you, and sometimes when I say ""the world"" I mean other humans. I have seen the human capacity for malice towards other humans. I find it disturbing. I feel kindness is an undertheorized virtue because, ultimately, it is by far the most important thing in my view. 

I'm sorry this got somewhat long. I'm glad you read it. If you made it this far, consider saying hello. You never know what might happen.",lonely,Lonely 33 year-old guy,2021-06-07 01:27:14

I sort of think the only reason like I feel like I'm going to die alone is because of my friends. I use to never feel like no one likes me or ever will and that I'll die alone until college.

To start with, my roommate and friend of 8ish years at the time would always make fun of me and say how I'm going to die alone as a single kissless virgin. He would always ask me questions and say things like ""Are your going to die alone as a single kissless virgin?"" ""You're gonna die with out ever feeling the feeling of being loved by someone who isnt your mother."" ""You're just speed running to become a wizard (which means never kissing someone until 30 or 40)."" ""How does it feel knowing your a single kissless virgin, and will die alone that way?"" And just bullshit like that. Ironically, all his past relationships were very very toxic and I think he was the source of the toxicity because his relationship he had at the time was very toxic, I know this because I heard all his phone calls as he used speaker, he would repeatedly call his GF a dumb bitch and claim she knows he's joking...

My other friend, fortunately he toned it down a bit, would always be like ""Woah hey I hear a girl, talk to her so you're not lonely any more!"" Or ""Woah you talked to a girl! You're not gonna be lonely!"" He would say these things everytime a girl was around or if he saw me talk to one, which is a rare thing for me to talk to anyone as I have some form of social anxiety. 

The first friend anytime he saw me talking to a girl would come up to me and be so annoying about it! He would walk up to us and be like ""GoOd JoB BuDdY!"" Or ""FiNaLlY a GiRl So YoU wOnT dIe AlOnE!"" Or ""Wow, you too fuck yet,"" or ""finally found someone to take your virginity?!"" Other times he would wrap his arm around me and some something that would insinuate that we're gay, which we're not.

I could go on but I dont want this post to be to long. Though, I seriously think my friends are the reason I feel this way. Ironically, they talk about how single and ""lonely"" I am waaaaay more then I ever do. They also claim I just want a girlfriend just so I can have sex... tbh I dont care about the sex, I mean I do but that's the least of my concerns, I just want someone who is kind loving and caring with an actual sense of humor who I can be myself around ya know... but as the days go on I seriously start think think my friends might be right...",lonely,"I think I only feel lonely because of my ""friends""",2021-06-07 01:22:36

I send videos and talk to an old friend sometimes but he goes to a different school and works alot so we can't hang out. 

I don't have any grandparents, I've known 2 of them and 1 died when I was 8 and the other died 2 years ago but she suffered from dementia and didn't recognise me anymore since I grew so fast back then so it's more like 4 years ago.

My dad works 70 hours a week and had a cerebral infarction at the other side of the country on my 17th birthday, so my mother had to travel to him and I had to comfort my sisters. (My dad is OK now)

On our last day we did a lot of feedback activities and I was humbled by how many people actually reached out specifically to me. Im straight up boasting here, I really gathered a crowd. There was an activity where each of us had a paper heart on our backs and let people write nice stuff about us and when I got to read mine I was speechless.

I don’t understand how I can inspire so many people yet have no friends at all.

At the end of the seminar we were doing one final exercise where we were looking at our portraits and the hosts were narrating over the microphone how lucky we were to have someone to lend us a shoulder at the end of the day and invited us to turn around.

Anyway this friend didn’t text me and the first thing I read from them post argument was:

“X said you were bailing on us. What’s up?”




It couldn’t hurt any more.

The other friend called me three times and only sent two text messages. I don’t want to check what they have said on Snapchat because I intuitively know that it would disappoint me.

I try to avoid thinking that I went through years of college and no one knew me so when I was filling out a security questionnaire I didn't know who to put. I felt really bad, like oh shit no one knew me I have to put a teacher who barely knew me or something, wtf..

I try to avoid thinking that when I graduate, I will be all alone because no one knows me. And for some reason it was all my fault, or at least I have to deal with the consequences of all of it. And even with full knowledge of it, I was unable to change it because there was something so inherently wrong about me, even just communicating hurts people. 

I try to avoid thinking that I went to one of the nation's best schools and many of my peers will become very successful and I didn't build that 'network' as you, ideally, are supposed to. I try to avoid thinking how people judge me for not knowing people. The worst thing is when people judge you, because they judge you based off it, they get disappointed and wonder what's wrong with you. There wasn't anything wrong with me, I was just trying to live when it looked like I was thriving. 

Because even though I knew it was going to be my biggest problem, I was unable to solve it, at least not with the time I had. But somehow it was still all my fault. As everyone turns their back on me, I get to wonder what exactly is wrong with me. While I'm trying to make sense in therapy, I get to see everyone surrounded by people, and wonder what exactly I did wrong. Not only do I have to cope just to get through day, I also get judged and assumed it was my fault. I tell you it wasn't my fault, if you went through what I did you wouldn't make it. What I could have done is got help earlier, but once again, I would need to take a leave from school and I wouldn't be allowed to because of the situation. I had to cope and finish school and then become independent and go back and try to heal. In fact, I was only one who went for help, no one ever blinked a tear. It was only on my decision. 

I don't think any of it was my fault. I think I did the best I could. I think I can patch up the broken pieces and try to make some meaning of the existence. I think I experienced some things very few can understand and it was just my unique pain and life given to me and I try to make a meaning from it.",lonely,What I try to avoid thinking about,2021-06-06 15:55:04

3567,DidoGrace,1622953719,1,"So I turned 25 three days ago. Thought I’d survived without the existential dread, quarter-life crisis, crippling loneliness crushing me from the inside out...but nope.

I’ve been living completely alone and thousands of miles away from family, etc. since mid-August 2020.  It’s also been almost a full year since I was last with my partner and/or had anyone touch me. The touch starvation has been so bad that I’ve completely forgotten what hugs feel like and I have vivid dreams about being held almost every night. It’s been like this for months on end now.

At this point I barely feel like a person anymore. The loneliness makes all my school stress and other chronic health problems feel so much worse, because it seems like no one could care less about whether I never woke up tomorrow morning, except for maybe the handful of professionals who are paid to say that they care. Sometimes, when it’s at its worst, it feels like even my partner’s abandoned or forgotten about me. (We’re long distance.)

Do I want to die? Not really. I’d ideally like to make a meaningful contribution to society before I peace out of my only chance at life. I just wish people gave a shit about someone who wasn’t rich, famous, popular, beautiful, or already dead. Whenever I see someone famous open up about health issues or other bad stuff going on in their lives, or on the flip side have a birthday or other accomplishment to share, and see thousands of people immediately shower them with supportive messages, all I can think of is how badly I want to know how that feels, how it feels to not be ignored or unloved.

I’m also not nearly as experienced in romantic relationships as I’d like to be and would have expected to be at this point in my life. 

Right now I’ve got 2 close friends that I see on a daily/weekly basis and they’re both about to disappear from my life. One is moving across the country for a new job and the other is moving across the world due to unfortunate circumstances. 

I’ve always been lonely and dissatisfied with the amount and quality of relationships I’ve been able to form and hold on to. Now I am at the age where it’s extremely difficult to make new friends and get into new social groups and I’m losing the only friends that I have.

I’m terrified for the future. Am I going to become a lonely bitter loser? Will I ever have genuine friends again? Even more terrifying, will I be able to meet my goals in romantic relationships? I don’t know.

It feels as if they don't want me around anymore. They tell me to text or call them, but they never respond or pick up.. and when they do, they are too busy to schedule anything to do. I don't mean that we never can seem to find a date we are both available.. it's just a ""I'm so busy, man! Work, work.. But soon!""

This isn't something that happens every now and then.. no.. I see these people every six months at some other mutual's party, I see them on social media hanging out with other people.. like. You have time for them but never for me?

My best friends I have known since middle school never has time for me anymore either, but he keeps posting on social media about all the places he and his girlfriend almost visit every day. I don't ask much of his time.. we're almost 30.. just a cup of coffee or tea, catching up for an hour every now and then would be great! 
I have been living in my new apartment for almost a year and he has never visited.. Though he keeps saying he is going to come over.. soon. But he's so busy!
Heck.. I haven't seen him for a year, but he only texts me when he is in need of something. Something that I can provide and that makes me feel used..

There's this other guy who I was very close with and he even gathered other friends in a group on the PS4 and we game at least 2 nights a week.. though I recently discovered they are all in a whatsapp group chat and they hang out on the weekend. I am the only person in that group who isn't invited to both the chat or the get-togethers.

This one hurts the most because out of the old group we were in together before this one, I am the only one who stayed and never ignored him or brushed him off. He knows what it feels like because he expressed to me how he felt about them ignoring him/brushing him off.

I'm not a mean person, I'm not whiny or picky about what we're going to do.. I don't pick fights, I joke around with them, I can take jokes.. it's all fun when we're together. There's a couple of horrible things that happened in my life and I told them it's fine to joke about these topics, so I'm not easily triggered about these things either.. I don't talk or complain too much about my issues. Only talk about them when asked.. I'm very easy going! So I don't understand what it could be.

People are also forgetting my birthday the past couple of years.. but get upset if I forget theirs when I am very busy for a change.

Kind of weird to say but last night I had a dream that I had a girlfriend... I never really realized I was that lonely until I woke up this morning extremely happy that I had that specific dream then realized it was just a dream and now I've been sort of sad all day because it wasnt real.

The girl in my dream was so beautiful and kind and loving and caring like wow, it made me really feel like I'm missing out on something special and amazing. To bad I have some form of social anxiety and feel as if I'm never gonna change that :/. I wish I wrote the dream down this morning when I woke up, as I do with most dreams, but I was so caught up in how amazing the dream was I forgot to. Now I can only remember bits and bobs of the dream. 

Honestly, I never felt lonely until college when my ""friend?/roommate"" kept making fun of me for being single and how I'm going to die alone as a single kissless virgin without anyone to love me. Ironically, he was in a SUUUPER toxic relationship with him being the main cause if the toxicity, believe me I heard all of their phone calls cuz he uses speaker phone.

Anyways... I had a dream and now I feel lonely again. Hopefully when I'm 21 and go to bars and get drunk I'll be able to talk to women, I've found it's mostly the initial approach I struggle with.",lonely,I had a dream last night that I had a girlfriend,2021-06-06 08:43:44

I feel like nobody wants me. They'd just talk to me because they either pity or have nothing better to do. I'm always the one putting effort in the conversation (if and when we have any).

I want love, attention, to be cared for, to be special to someone. But apparently that is just too much to ask for. There are people who say it's not, but those are the people who have exactly what I want.

When I don't work though, I feel like I spend my weekends doing nothing because there's no one to do anything with. I'm running out of at-home spa days and new recipe cooking nights and solo adventures to keep my mind off of this awful loneliness. Before COVID I had a few friends in my program but nobody really close, most of those friendships evaporated and now I just have my 2 friends that I live with. I tried joining a kickball league in my city to meet new people, it just made me feel worse cause I ended up feeling left out of the group and not connecting with anyone. I spend just about all of my time alone and it's really taking a toll on me. I know the only solution is to try new things but I absolutely suck at meeting and connecting with new people so I just feel like the same thing will happen again. I don't know why I don't seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Doesn't even have to be close friends, just someone I could hang out with once a month or so. And you can forget about dating. Nightmare of being ghosted, rejected, or just treated badly as it's been in the past, I just don't have the energy now. On top of all that, I worry that any potential significant other would realize I have basically no friends and would leave. 

So what the hell am I supposed to do? The thought of trying to put myself out there again is so demoralizing because it's such an uphill battle.

3642,LaagerNation,1622904064,1,"For the past 4 years, I've been feeling whatever was left of sanity slowly fading away. Very few people ever gave me the time of day as a kid, and that's only worsened the older l've been getting. A fair majority of the people who have ever said they were my friend just ended up using me, either emotionally or physically. There's only been one time where thought had real friends, but they all turned out to be horrible people who dont care about me (or others for that matter). I don't understand what's so wrong with me that no one wants to talk or do anything. I just want to feel like I have real friends again. Maybe it would have been better if never knew what it was like, because maybe the pain would not be as bad. All I've been feeling is either emptiness or loneliness or pain.

They say to try new things and meet new people. Despite severe anxiety I've tried, but feel ignored by everyone who try to reach out to. It's starting to really get to me now that college is over. It feels like that entire experience was wasted. I see those ""friends"" and most people being able to find groups and people that they connect with, but I just feel or am treated like an outcast in every social interaction. I mean, what is even the point if all that's going to happen is meeting more people that are going to take advantage of you? It's become harder and harder to have the will to fight it.

I want to be loved, hugged, shown that maybe I do matter. I just daydream talking to people, telling them and opening up, and then feel a warm embrace. It's not like that though, the few times where I ever even was comfortable enough to talk to someone about it I just got the most cookie cutter response, seemingly just wanting to change the conversation, or worse. And that's from people who I had trust in.

Someone recently came back into my life who caused me so much pain, but also for a short time actually made me feel happy. This person being my ex. We've been talking, and the more that I talk to her the more distant I feel. It brings back memories where I was never able to talk about the things I wanted to talk about, the painful memories of our breakup, or other things. I know there's always the option to stop talking, but the pain doesn't seem to be adding on top of what's already there. Besides, it's someone to talk to... even if it's mostly just listening to their life and how great/miserable it is... or how the pain and manipulation I got towards the end was inconsequential to her. That's the part that sucks the most, how it really feels like there wasn't an impact at all. She says differently, but the interactions and the stories tell the truth. The problem is that the interactions are something to hold on to, even if there's nothing really there. I'm grasping at straws, but even those brief seconds where I forget about everything is worth it in my eyes. In a way, I guess that goes to show that I've already given up. Also, there's a chance she may see all of this, and I don't think I care if she does. This is the first and hopefully last negative post I'll ever make.

I guess I've felt this way since I was around 10, but only throughout college did I truly realize just how lonely I am. It feels like there's no one... in reality I think there's 1 person who genuinely cares, and that then makes it seem like I'm just complaining for no reason. In reality, at this point any positive interaction I have is a ticking time bomb, where things will fall apart. They always have. Idk anymore.

They never believed anything I said. Trying to convey my struggles and emotions never went well. I struggled in school due to a learning disability and my mom would yell about how hard I made life for her and threatened that I would be out on the streets. I learned to just keep a straight face and try and keep my cool, say I'll do better, cause that would lessen the constant scoldings.

My first friends growing up always made fun of me. I was a weird and goofy kid but I loved hanging out with people and laughing and playing games. I was very emotional and expressive with them, which I wasn't comfortable being like at home. But this caused them to make fun of me a lot and sometimes pulled cruel jokes. I still acted like I was ok even though it hurt because I didn't want to be seen as someone who couldn't take a joke. I learned to keep my emotions from showing too much to anyone, this would also lessen how often they made fun of me. We eventually drifted apart. I was in and out of therapists this whole time.

I mean it can't be far from the truth being that I don't think I've ever gotten a message from a friend asking if I am okay, as a matter of fact, nobody reaches out to me unless they need something from me. I just want someone to care about me, and from the looks of it nobody ever has or ever will.

But why would they? they have their own lives to live and I have to respect that. Am I wrong for expecting people to care about me? or even look in my direction? maybe I am, but I can't help feeling that I don't matter to anyone outside of my family, and even they don't ever ask if I'm okay.

The only thing that really helps me deal with this feeling of not mattering is whatever drug I can take that will make me forget who I am for just a little bit, even if I have to go back to this bottomless pit of emotion in my stomach after the high is over.

I just want to be appreciated by somebody, even if it's just somebody telling me that they like my shoes or some small shit like that, even that would be enough, but the longer I wait for that to happen, the more I realize that nobody cares.

I wasted my time worrying about other thinks when I could of been having fun. Instead I got involved in toxic friendships that I am still in today. Hearing how other students experienced high school just makes me sad of what I missed. Sure college can be better but I can’t make memories again in high school. I regret it so much and wish I was like the other kids. Smart, fun, attractive, outgoing. Something that I am not. I have no one to blame but myself for putting me in this experience but it just isn’t the high school experience I wanted. High school affected my mental state by going to a really depressing state.

3678,Internal-eq-External,1622877358,1,"I keep seeing this pattern.

A person is lonely and suffering.

Another lonely person says “I understand you, I feel you. Let’s all gather online or offline together and try to not be lonely anymore”.

And, paradoxically, the first person answers: “Lol. And we’ll just sit there with our mics muted or stand there looking at our shoes. No, thanks”

So the first person means that “I will not accept help because I’m afraid that it will hurt more than it will actually help”.

And the loop of loneliness keeps going and going.

The reason why you are rejecting help is the internal critic. Which induces the fear of shame.

In the past you’ve been judged, mistreated and criticized harshly. So these external critics (people) became your internal critic. Subconsciously you joined the bullies of the past in criticizing you. It’s a natural mechanism of psyche I refer to as internal critic.

This internal critic requires impossible perfection from you. It also bullies you, threatening with further shame. So you listen to it and reject any help with your problem.

Critic’s job for is to actually protect you from experiencing terrible shame and abuse AGAIN. Because it has been happening in the past.

But the key insight is that the critic misenterprets the danger. Because having a zoom call with other lonely people is not nearly dangerous as the situations in the past which traumatized you.

The key is to start fixing the critic’s judgements. And to understand where the critic comes from originally.

(If you will say that it’s “impossible for you” or “not worth even trying” - that’s the critic again)",lonely,The reason why lonely people cannot help each other to stop feeling lonely,2021-06-05 17:15:58

Sometimes I wish I had a step by step process of what to do to stop feeling this way. “This way” feeling like I’m not good enough. 

Logically I know I have a lot going for me and for the first time in my life I feel somewhat content and excited for the future. But my self worth still depends on LOVE. I hate that. 

I really want to feel happiness inside myself. And I do have things i love about myself. I’m a good writer, ambitious, resourceful, conventionally attractive I guess but I enjoy my soul more than my looks. 

Still, I can’t help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I don’t marry before the age of 25 no man will want me. I also spent a lot of time in theredpill which maybe contributes to this way of thinking. I have traditional  values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment. 

If it makes you happy then more power to you I wish I could have meaningless sex and feel some form of enjoyment. But when all men have ever wanted me for is my body it makes me question if there’s any good ones left.

It was like when I was job interviewing. I had to override anything I felt and give the answers that were at the level that they wanted to hear. And I realized that it works because I started passing all interviews *but it was the most painful thing.* I was torturing myself to smile and talk about things that I knew was shit, but it worked. And it felt good and painful at the same time, knowing I was now someone else. And *because* it worked, I felt better and more encouraged. *So I think that's how the friend-making thing would work for me.* Through hours of pain on my own as I practice the conversations I would have, the pop culture I would read up on, and the body language, it will be the most painful moments as I override the ego and start from scratch and forget whatever personality I thought I had. But if I need to cry I can cry. 

And to be honest, *it will probably work*, and then it will slowly morph into my new 'personality' and it will work. 

I read stories about how people were lonely in college and then a girl or someone started talking to them and it worked out.

Am I putting him in a horrible situation by getting shy and nervous around him? I am so creepy it’s been two years why can’t I move on from this? I know it will never happen. 

It’s mostly an intellectual and emotional crush but I guess I t’s physical too, but it’s not really lustful. I don’t care about that though I wouldn’t mind it. Still my feelings are still intense and unprofessional. I want his approval as my mentor and to be around him, he makes me laugh and feel so happy, and I want him to like me and care about me as a person. I want to be his friend too which is so weird inappropriate. I feel like I’m in love with him.

 I even asked my female superior if I was crossing any boundaries or acting inappropriate and she said I wasn’t. 

I try to stay away unless necessary but we are forced to work together closely. He is really polite so if he’s dropping hints for me to back off they are too subtle for me to notice. 

I think its lasted this long and got to this point partly because a while back I misinterpreted some things he said and do as having more meaning than they did. This sounds so stupid but for a while I thought he was falling in love with me. But then I came to my senses and realized that there was no evidence of this and he was just being friendly and polite and I am lonely and have had only one relationship before in my life. I was going through a really bad time mentally and not used to adults being nice to me — and I wanted affection so badly, especially from him, he was like a beacon of light in the darkness — that I stupidly mistook his friendliness and concern for my well-being as an expression of genuine affection, reciprocation, even love. I thought we were closer than we were and that I was “special” to him. It was about so much more than sex. But then I realized I was being delusional and I just *wanted* it to be true so badly. This was quite painful to realize. Extremely painful. I still get emotional thinking about it. I feel so embarrassed, creepy, ashamed, pathetic, disappointed, unattractive and heartbroken. 

This is all so unhealthy and immature and I shouldn’t inflict my presence on anyone. That’s what I feel like.

nothing has worked. all activities have been left with a severe lack of passion or lack of interest. everyone i have tried to be friends with and do my best to be as social as can be, have slowly ran out of things to say and have left me.

BUT the thing about me is that I do NOT want to work a 9-5 job like most people.. I’m striving to live a free every day life and not one where I eat, work, eat and sleep on repeat.

My biggest passion is to travel and my main goal would be to do it for a living. That’s why I quitted the above job (it’s also worth mentioning that the salary sucked). Instead I got a warehouse job now which I just started.

the reason I started here is that it's a temporary job. It is super flexible so I can organize my shift schedule myself. It is also night work, so the salary is pretty good. This means that I can work and travel whenever I want. It's not something I want to do forever, but it's fine for a while and at the same time I can build something I can live off while traveling or find another and better job which gives me the same freedom and flexibility. Like something in sales or whatever. BUT the problem is that after telling my family about this new job they have been really disappointed and do not understand why I have chosen such a job. They can not see the point in it as I have a higher education and they also look down on professions like warehouse jobs. It makes me feel bad and demotivates me.

I’d love to hear what you guys think and please ask if I left anything out or if you would like to know more about something specific. Thanks for reading!",lonely,What to do?,2021-06-05 07:38:35

3767,KewlKat11,1622839247,1,"I am 23, soon to be a 24 year old dude. I have one main friend group with like 5 people including myself. When we were in High School we'd hang more often, but as we got older and started uni/ collage most of them got new friends. They already had other friends from elementary school etc. but they were few. However, now most of them have at least one more friend group and plenty of other friends from all sorts of places. 

Now I suck at making friends, so I made really 0 friends at uni, IDK why.... I really tried and got so depressed when I found out I was basically the only one who didn't hang out with anyone from uni outside of classes. I guess people just don't find me fun to be around?

Anyway the situation is now that for example, I got desperate and even after asking them to hang out a couple of times during this week and them declining and me promising to not ask again, I did just that. I asked them if they wanna do something during the weekend as the weather is finally hot here in Norway.... Guess what? They're gonna hang out with other friends from school... It just feels like I'm that friend that's left behind, and that's not really ""cool"". Nowadays we hang out maybe once a month, whereas 5-6 years ago it would be 1-2 times a week. 

I've never been the most social person and when I was 12-15 I had absolutely no friends and I would dread warm and sunny days due to thinking of all the fun I was missing out on. Now I am in a better situation, but it still hurts sometimes watching all insta posts and snap stories of people doing shit I would like to do, but have no one to do it with. Sometimes I feel like I'm cursed with the inability to make friends. I will finish my degree in a year and I'm banking on making some more friends there, but I really have doubt in myself that I'll be able to achieve that. IDK what makes me so repulsive as a friend... 

I understand that I'm not in a situation as bad as some of the people here, but still. I feel like the last option most often. Even the guy I consider to be my best friend (which is in that friend group) seems to really need to be convinced to hang out with me, but when it comes to his friends from uni he hangs out with the easily, and I know this because he has often chosen to hang with them instead of me. I don't wanna be that annoying dude that gets bitter over it. I just wish I had more friends myself so I wouldn't be so reliant on them....",lonely,Am I the only one that technically has friends but still feels lonely as fuck?,2021-06-05 06:40:47

People often say birthdays are supposed to be a day to be celebrated, a day to be happy about. Many people will be happy to celebrate. I can't relate to any of those, at least not right now. I'm a 19 year old male, and not really sociable. I don't have many friends let alone friends who truly care about me. It made me really sad to see that only 2 people wished me a happy birthday, those who aren't even my family members.

Meanwhile, there is this friend of mine who shares the same birthday as me, and when the clock hit 12 i could see at least 5 people who posted pictures on their instagram stories wishing the person a happy birthday. I honestly do not expect anyone to post about me, as no one ever done that for me in my life.

This happens every year and I always get sad on this specific day. I wonder how it feels like to have people who genuinely cares for you, not someone who leaves you when time gets rough and are only friends with you when there are good times. My mind is going down a really bad path, thinking about what would happen if i just suddenly disappear. Will anyone really be worried? Or will they be glad instead.

I always think what could have been If someone just gave me a chance.


I'm aware that these are very selfish things to say and you guys have all the right to criticize me for saying such things. However, I know there are decent amount of people here who feel the same way and to be honest I'm just tired of getting reminded everyday that I will die alone.

I talked to her every single day for four years. We knew everything about each other and shared our days down to the meals we ate or what we wore. I felt such a strong connection to her and i loved her so much. Towards the end of the relationship we got into more and more fights. Some small fights sometimes big. We had a falling out that lead to us both ignoring each other for two months. I landed myself in the hospital and we started talking again. We began to argue more and more and finally we had a huge argument. This fight was mostly my fault but we had both said some things nasty things to each other in the past. I texted her one last text and she stopped responding. I was like whatever and ignored her back. A month later i noticed she had blocked me on every social media account even down to our nintendo switch accts lol I realized this fight was serious but i kept on ignoring her back. I forced her out of my thoughts and didn’t really think of her much until her birthday rolled around. I broke down started crying i just missed her so much and i was so lonely. It’s been almost a year since the last time we talked and i’m pretty sure she has my number blocked still. I can’t find any of her social media accounts. I’ve been really down lately and thinking about her a lot. How shes doing, what she’s doing if shes okay if shes happy. She had times where she was pretty mean to me and i’ll admit i was too. By the end of our relationship things weren’t working out anyway but i just feel so heart broken about it out of nowhere. I miss her so much it hurts and i can’t get over it. I’m thinking about texting her number but i think she still hates me. I also wonder if it’s for the best that we stopped talking. It just fucking hurts so bad today i cat stop thinking about it.

However it been years since last relationship and further more I stuggle with Freinds. I taken account to push and try however with little succeeds..  nobody wants to hangout with me despite being chill and wanting to talk in study's I partake. I am oldest there but not by much since I want to take full advantage of any learning I can get. 

When I was younger I blamed my dissblity for such as my comunication was bad as well as it making me some what niavie and inncent which is both a delight and sadness.

I don't have Freinds to meet with and although I tried making some over years and years it hasn't worked . Since 2016 was last time I made Freinds and only one stick by . Same gose for love life.   I feel so little exprince..  in not just sexual experince but life itself. I not jellous but It make me feel so out of place. 


I almost had few relationships.. But sadly not one worked. And I feel like I'm at a downfall. I even installed dating apps to have more success I hoped  but no nothing. .. 

I tend to be skinny and only recently in years g It tiny bit tubby. But to be honest I gald .. I was skinny to the rips . 


I study hard so I have time just in case if ever invited or anyone wants to hangout.  No . No they don't.   My best one mate lives far now due to life . And although he's good mate I run out things to talk of. To keep going. To have reason to meet. Yeah you don't need one but I feel without it I'm just wating his time.  I hate to bore him or waste time for anyone.

I don't know if I'm more than sad. But I know I never be suicidal.  But I know I can never inflict a blade on me . Yet the idea sticks and the hate rises . 


I can have online Freinds but in end if day they can be busy. And even so not always on. And even more so if I did have lovers online they is not full true love as I fear and unsure how I be in real life around them. 


I never say I'm nice guy in a sense because I am flawed. I am human. And I am so... protected that I lack such a life it feels that if wasn't for protection and my dissblity I feel I may had some better chance.  But same time I don't know if it truly would. 


I live in England. And although I doubt my self worth I have been given comfort of others on what they say.. issue is over time such words can't work without the chance and proof of it I think..  or maybe I'm just needy.

I find that my loneliness makes people distrust me or think I’ve got a hidden motive, that or that I’m a liar who embellishes things. 


I am content in being alone but I have been experiencing impending feelings of doom quite often. I don’t have a solid friend group although I appreciate the friends I do have and I’m always waiting for things to go wrong so I don’t always share much. That or I just pretend I’m okay even if I’m not. I have never been admired, desired or found worthy and most of my life-even in friendships, I am not a necessity but an ornament.

I’ve seen things go wrong in friendships that were like sisterhoods and the aftermath was them saying, “She is stalking me and my friends,” although those were my friends and I wasn’t stalking them. I’m petrified of being open with people and I’m petrified of being close to others because I know they can go from your friend to someone who dislikes you.

And for that I guess I may appear disingenuous or with a motive in or to my kindness. Inside, I just want to make people feel good and be good with others. That’s all. But I find people have a hard time believing me or finding me trustworthy.

1. I am no longer talking to him about my thoughts or ideas. This was he has his own mental space and doesn't have to think so much about me.
2. Im working on creating my own bedroom space so I'm not always physically near him, and giving him space and time alone.
3. Im making sure he has more nights to game, this was he can decompress more without me all up in his face to watch a movie with me or hang.
4. I dont wait for him for things like dinner. This way he no longer feels pressure to be around me or feels like I'm too clingy.

It's a start but if anyone has anything else to add, I'd love to hear it. Yes, im lonely but I dont want to make him feel like he has to entertain me. I can be lonely but still have fun with myself if I dive deep into a hobby or other things.

My main goal right now is to find a girlfriend but as I stated before I’m terrified and I really don’t know how not to be. I know for a fact that my life will change once I finally get a girlfriend because I’ve been getting dreams for a while of having a girlfriend that feel so real that when I wake up it feels like they broke up with me or they passed away and I won’t ever see them again.  It probably doesn’t help that I sometimes watch romance anime’s because I wish my life could be the same way as the show/movie.

3836,DueAnimator6988,1622787818,1,"We have Fridays off so I got drunk and grilled with some guys from work tonight which was fun, but like everytime I drink, it just ends in quiet deep sadness and emptiness that I can't ignore.


Just sitting out on the lawn in our chairs staring at the stars it hit me like a truck just how alone I am. Not even that I'm extra sad about it tonight, but all I can feel is getting sucked into that void where nothing good exists and everything is gray. I always tell myself I've grown accustomed to living by myself and being by myself and handling my business but every now and then you face it and have to swallow that hard truth. I've been in good relationships when I was younger so I know what I'm missing...That deep but subtle pain in your chest you can't ignore. You're alone..whether it's your fault or not (it likely is, at least it is for me) it's been your situation for so long you've just kind of subtlety and strangely accepted it without really realizing it... Except where every now and then, like now for me, you realize how unhealthy and how wrong it really feels and how badly you wish you had someone who had your back.

Not even asking for support here, I'm fine, just sharing a feeling I think many here can relate to because it's hitting me hard right now.

A feeling where all I can think is damn.... And just look back on better simpler days where things weren't so lost. I'm feeling the loneliness hard right now, really fucking hard, even without the emotion. Just that emptiness. Another night hugging a pillow and dreaming of better days, outright fantasies just because it's comforting and gives me hope. I can be optimistic but at the same time still feel that deep eternal emptiness inside I'm worried I'll never be able to fulfill. 

That is why I put 'damn' as the title, because I can only sit there and just think to myself damn... Life truly is something else. All I can do is put my best foot forward and be grateful with what I have and hope to God I can find a way to either meet someone or find peace with myself in this void I feel stuck in

3842,wilting4738,1622784615,1,"I graduated high school today and honestly I’m mainly feeling negative emotions. I can’t say I had any good experiences during high school. I spent most of my time in the library studying for classes I wasn’t even sure I liked and involving myself in mundane activities with little meaning. I used to have a friend group in middle school but obviously everyone went their separate ways. Now, I have a friend here and there but not many, and none of them run in the same social friend group. So if it’s me versus their other friends they would pick their other friends because of the clique-mindset. This left me feeling pretty isolated for a lot of time so I was actually appreciative for virtual school because I wouldn’t have to be alone during lunch (like eating while studying) or something. Every day of high school it has been school and come home. I now realized I was actually quite depressed for a year or so because of this exhausting pattern... so at least my mental health’s a bit better now. But it still doesn’t change the fact that I’m very lonely.

The one thing keeping me going was that I would tell myself that my hard work would pay off and I would get into a reputable, top-ranked college. Well that didn’t really work out and I’m lucky to go to a college at all but I can’t... I’m not proud of my college. I didn’t even decorate my graduation cap because I didn’t want to accept the fact that I would be going there especially when my school sends MANY people to Ivy Leagues and top-20s so there is a toxic sense of competition.

I think the combination of the college admissions process and just not having a friend group - or close friends at all - to support me has made me so bitter and sad. I’m bitter because people are going to amazing colleges while having fulfilling social lives and taking pictures with their friend groups after grad. And I’m here graduating all my myself because the friend group I tried to squeeze into ignored me and left together without saying a  word to me because they wanted to get dinner. I felt angry towards the valedictorian speaker because they have a fake af personality, yet still landed an Ivy League school as well as partying every weekend. Like how did you do that..?? I feel rejected - from colleges as well as socially. 

The icing on the cake was when I went to say hello to a friend/classmate. It started of well at first and we congratulated each other but soon one of her friends came over and asked if she was going to this party. She was speaking loudly so I had the nerve to ask if she was talking to both of us. She responded “oh no, just ____.” I felt so bad about myself. I know it’s stupid. But I just wish I could be partying and getting drunk on hard seltzer or whatever goes on in the parties I see only in TV shows and the occasional accidental snapchat. I wish I had a friend group who I could do things with instead of merely acquaintances and classmates. I wish I could feel proud of what I’m doing in life but now I’m scared that I’ll have no friends in college either because I’m going to one far away from home. And I wish that I could brag about my college but the one time I told someone about it they said “ew you’re going there?” Because of the state the university’s located. I wish I had people to support me and understand me (besides my mom... and even she can only do so much). I just wish I could be laughing and hanging out with people right now instead of sadly typing this on Reddit because I feel like nobody is here for me.",lonely,i was lonely throughout high school and it has made me bitter.,2021-06-04 15:30:15

You ever had a friend or someone you cared for who just didn't seem to care for you the same way you did?
That's basically every single person in my life.
There's this woman who I've been talking to. She's amazing. And I've grown to like her a lot. And yet, anytime she wants to talk, I'm down. She needs someone to talk to on a drive? I'd gladly do it. 
Tough day at work? Tell me about it.

How can someone you like so much make you feel so lonely?

I'm always initiating every conversation. Hey, have you eaten? Hey, how was work.

Like. Am I not a human? Fuck me, I don't even feel like a human.

I have literally no one. No family in this country, no friends, at least, none I can easily contact. 

Fuck. I just want to be loved and wanted, but it honestly feels like I'm a nuicance to the world. Like a tick that's just waiting to be smushed.

I wish I had the guts to fucking end it all, but I'm too much of a coward to even do that.

I'm a dissapointment to my parents, a disgusting fuck to my friends and not even worth sparing a second thought over to anyone else. I digust myself by how much I wished people liked me. 
I'm just going to stop talking to people. I'd rather suffer by myself than take the chance and raise my hopes up with people, only to get hurt again and again.

And I don't want your goddamn advice. I don't give a shit if it's about perspective or a positive attitude. I'm tired. I'm done.

I manage to forget and block the black out of my mind, ignore it with an intensity so elevated that it would be as if it never had existed at all. And I wonder, how was I ever unhappy at all? For I have no memory or trace of the thoughts that made me drown in self pity, fear, anxiousness and anger. I always get sad first. Just a little, then a lot. I want to cry, it feels right. I never want to stop. I want to cry and cry and fall into a cozy deep sleep and never wake up. I always see them look at me, every day. Why do they look so sad? I get sad. Everyone is miserable. I hate life… I hate nothing? I want to be happy, make them happy, want to smile, can't cry, can't breathe, let me go! I explain, word, reword, write and rewrite, nothing makes sense! I say and speak and talk nonsense, they look confused, unphased, sad, confused, annoyed, silent, silent, they have no words in exchange for mine… I live on borrowed time, learned words, learned actions, learned fears… Everything is learned.

I‘m m23 and I never felt so alone. Growing up I had friends and social circles that excited me dispite my initial shyness. That all changed when I started going to college. My best friends were busy with their new friends and we rarely see each other.
Now to the title: (grab your popcorn)
When I started in College, I quickly made friends with around 15 people. Everything was going well and I had the time of my life. What happened next was unbeliveable. ALL of them quit Law for a different degree in a different city. Here I was, alone in a big city with an incredible hard degree to finish. I pulled through the semesters and eventually found a guy i could study with. 
I then attended a privat seminar for the bar examn which takes a year to complete. New faces and new chances to make meaningful connections. At least that what I thought . About 2 weeks and 2 seminars in the pandemic struck germany. Everything was shut down and I was there again, alone.
Now the seminar is finished and I got nobody.

Every day feels the same: numb, boring and meaningless. All i do is studying, working out and go for a walk.

I hate it.",lonely,Bad Luck and Numbness,2021-06-04 10:03:58

Anyway, as you can guess by the title. I am alone, and it's hard for me to describe it. My social life has gone downhill, and my anxiety and depression drastically increased. I made mistakes that I am not proud of in the past it really carried a heavy toll on my mental state, it fucking hurts.

 I feel lost, and devoid of answers and meaning.

I have zero friends who give a shit about me, the one friend I opened up to hurt me and left me hanging despite the fact I've done everything to help him, and for months without end this ""indescribable"" loneliness won't stop tormenting me.

So, it's always very stressful because of that: I want my birthday to be fun but it isn't.

But this year is kinda different. Due to COVID I hardly meet anyone, and I can't even go to college to meet my classmates. So, I feel even more lonely. I'm also taking my final exams this week so I can't do something special because I have to study. And... I know, I'm here writing this when I should be studying... I have, don't worry, but I'm in such a bad place right now that I need to do this.

My point is that I've always felt lonely and depressed (and even more so on my birthday), I've been struggling with mental issues for more than 5 years now but the situation has become worse, and... I don't know... I just wish it wasn't my birthday because I don't think I should be here. It's a very sad thing to say, I know, but what do I have to celebrate? I'm more dead than alive. I've fought for a long time, I thought I could overcome it and move on, but I guess I was wrong. And it's weird because right now I'm in a point where I don't even want to seek help again because I really don't think it's going to get better. So, there's no point.

I don't know &lt;- that's my conclusion. 

I just wanted to express how I feel right now because it helps a little, and if you feel the same as me or have any advice, you can talk to me &lt;3",lonely,Today is my birthday but I wish it wasn't,2021-06-04 04:57:29

I have a habit of making easy things complicated.

So instead of talking to a human, I made a chatbot to talk to.  
""Ok Google, play a song that can cure depression"" - not that kind of chatbot.

I made a chatbot that would ""listen"" to me (Zuckerberg if you are reading this, it's not your kind of ""listening"").  
It's a chatbot that is just interested in what I have to say and makes me think.  
I talk to it and it responds with questions.  
It doesn't give advice, nor tries to tell me what I should do.  
It just is there to hear me.

I don't know why I share this, but I've found it helpful for me to have ""someone"" who cares.

Ever since I decided to take a break from uni this time last year my life has been in stasis. I moved to a new town because my dad wanted to be closer to his workplace even though he's worked from home for the past year absolute clown. Now I'm stuck in a town where I don't know anyone and I'm separated from everything I'm used to. I've been trying desperately to get a job but have only got replies to tell me I've been rejected. My few friends are all miles away either at uni or my hometown. I'm totally alone here. So I spend all my time at home. For three months at the start of this year I didn't leave the house at all, not even to go to the store. 

I sleep as much as I can because I'd rather be asleep than awake. Because of that I don't wake up til 2pm or later and I've also developed eating problems. Recently I've started going to bed earlier and earlier in the evening, so I'm only awake and out of bed for maybe 4-6 hours per day. 

Day after day, for months, for almost a year now, every day is a monotonous replay of the day before. No movement or progress or change.

When I am up I just sit around doing nothing because I have no desire to do anything after job hunting for an hour or so every day and finding nothing. I don't get any enjoyment from the things I used to love like reading or gaming or watching movies so I stopped doing them entirely. I have practically no contact with other people. If the weather's good I try to go for walks but it takes half an hour to build up energy/motivation and even when I do I feel unsatisfied because I know it's totally without purpose. I exist but I am not alive. I feel ashamed of myself when I see people out living their lives and thriving while I'm trapped and inert. As if I am imprisoned. All I want is to get my life on track but I am just going from bad to worse as life passes me by like an unwanted dog in the shelter.

3938,Kreki86,1622736216,1,"Since I (m34) was little I've had to move around and changed schools a couple of times, leaving me having to find new friends. I have always been kind of attached to friends in a way where I've needed them more than they've needed me. I'm also an only child, which I'm sure also plays a part. Most of my life I have had very few friends, and often not really close ones.

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember (since kindergarten) I've always idolized everyone else. It's like I can't compare to other people, and I see everyone else like they're superior to me. I would describe it like getting starstruck, only by my peers, not big celebrities. Whenever someone treats me with kindness and acknowledge me in a way, I get attached to them. Like ""I can't believe he wants to hang with ME"". It's like I'm romanticizing the other person and get really hooked on them, in a non-sexual way. I'm not talking about the cool kids or someone of high status. It could just as might be the loser in the class, that noone wants to befriend. I don't even think if I really want to be friends with that person, because everyone is good enough for me, in a kind of way.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember seeing ""The act"" with Gypy Rose, the munchausen by proxy movie. She keeps on spying on her neighbour, wanting to befriend her, talking about how beautiful, cool, etc she is, etc. This idolization really reminded me of how I see other guys. It's like walking around like the underdog in a world full of superheroes. 

As a grown man I still have this feeling that I can't compare to other people and are not worthy of their friendship or time. I don't even initiate talking to people, because I feel like  by doing that I'm wasting their time/ annoy them. This has left me not making any new friends, which means I'm slowely getting fewer and fewer friends, because some people go, but noone new comes along. My social life exists of bascially just my girlfriend and I, and I don't think this is good for either one of us.

3941,SeriousBook5783,1622734880,1," 

My friends consist of around two, maybe three people I talk to online. I can't tell, because they do not feel like friends. We rarely talk. We 'never' do anything together. Always too busy. Everyone is too busy. I guess that's adulthood. But it makes me feel unwanted and rejected and that I'm annoying to be around. They assure me I'm not, but do they not realize how their actions communicate otherwise? I hate that I rely so much on these virtual connections, where by default you'll simply never be a priority and hence they will never care much about you, regardless of what they say.

I started playing a video game with someone. They never reach out first. It's always me asking if they want to play, but they always say yes, which I'm grateful for, so I try not to internalize it. Then we start playing, and they ignore everything I say, and I feel... bad. It triggered me, as it's something my abusive father would do before exploding. I don't talk much. I have social anxiety. Then the person I'm playing with decides they had enough and they leave without so much as a goodbye. I started crying and self-harming afterward.

It may not seem like a big deal, but imagine dealing with this, everyday. For years. Relentlessly. Being invisible. And the only attention you get is negative, or people just want to use you. I've been beaten, cursed at, sexually abused, belittled: almost anything you could think of. And now I'm a twenty-two year old woman who lives alone and is so traumatized, I can barely leave the house or talk. I try my best to reach out to people online, because it's the most I can do, but people online treat you so horribly.

I was venting to one of my 'friends' about something. They encourage me to talk to them. I talk, and their response is flippant and dismissive before they change the topic to what they're going through. And then like the person I was playing with, after I heard them out and consoled them, they vanished. I told them I struggle with not feeling heard or understood, and that feeling abandoned is a major trigger for me. They don't care. They don't even care about my struggles. I've known this person for nearly TEN years.

My other friend actually tries. I do feel like they care, but they are genuinely busy, and they have, by their own admission, a savior complex. Which makes me feel embarrassed as it validates the idea that I'm broken, but it's true. At least they acknowledge that, even if they would never say it.

I just wish I had a better support network. I feel suicidal. I'm always suicidal. On and off. And all it takes is seemingly minor things like this to drive me to the edge, but hey, who cares. I don't exist. I'm no one. I'll never find a partner, especially since I'm a lesbian. I'll never be loved. And, I'll never have friends. Sorry for the wall of text.

3950,Kryoq,1622729357,1,"At this point I’m just desperate, not even gonna try to hide it. I’m a 17 years old girl, yes I know I’m young and I shouldn’t worry about these things yet but I do. I’ve never been in couple with anyone yet, no one have ever said that they loved me, not surprised I’m physically ugly and so is my personality. I’m really scared that I’ll end up alone, I’ve been reading other people’s 40yo single life and I don’t want this to be me, tho I wouldn’t be surprised. I’m desperate for love but if it ever happens I would probably reject it, because I know I will feel bad for this person who was unlucky enough to end up with me. 

I don’t know how it is called but I have a somewhat vaginal malformation, not going into details but it is really ugly and I wanna get a surgery done, and when I was younger I would believe that I never dated anyone because of it, because I didn’t want to explain to them why I would never want to go further if it ever had to happen. But I realized that wasn’t the reason why. I was always single and still am because no one wants to be with me. It is as simple as that. Whatever I do it won’t change. 

I began to think that something was wrong with me wether it was my look or my personality, something is wrong with it and I knew it. I can’t afford surgery for my face so I can only depend on my personality which is even worse. I’m good at acting so I thought about creating myself a new personality and act as if it was really me, it might work. But i believe the biggest problem isn’t my look nor my personality (even though they’re problematic) i realized that no one would want someone who’s broken. Life is too short, too short to have someone like me around. 

At 14 years old i got sexually assaulted by my oncle who was almost 50. And I never really recovered from it. There’s so many that others can easily do that I can’t because of it. People don’t wanna waste their time with someone like me, I understand it. I could try to act like it never happened but it is easier for them to just be with a good person instead. I don’t want to be a burden in any way. 

I’m tired of hoping for a ""maybe"" I did so many research on the internet to find a way to just forget about it, to accept that I’ll be always alone and not feeling bad about it but it never really helped.

Today was only day 1 of him being gone and damn I feel so lonely. I’m not sure why. I’m sure there were days where he and I unconsciously didn’t talk or play video games for a day or two, but this feels awful. Knowing that he’s gone and that I have no one else is just amplifying all of my lonely feelings. 

I feel kinda awful about it. Am I....clingy? I don’t blame him nor am I mad he went on vacation or anything, but gosh I really miss him already.

3970,Responsible_Payment7,1622702493,1,"Yesterday was my 18th birthday and I had nothing to do. No plans. No friends. Just family. I have a very very loving family and especially mother, but I just don’t have friends. I used to have a lot in my freshmen year of high school, but during sophomore year they ditched me and I didn’t find new friends in time and i’ve been alone since. I had no friends yet I tried acting like I still did. The days went by and I would just sit at home and do nothing, yet I would never tell my mom about what I was going through just because of the thought of the sheer embarrassment of saying that I, the once popular and loved kid, have no friends. So I’ve had no friends for the past 3 years and it’s been depressing but I’ve willed my way through it and I honestly feel like a better person because of the experiences I faced.

I’m still human though, and my 18th birthday hit hard. This is such a coveted birthday and I had 0 friends to invite over, hang out with, or even wish me a happy birthday. I thought I was used to it by now but the thought of being this alone on a day where I’m officially an adult just hurt. I tried acting cool and normal in front of my mom insisting that I don’t want to do anything today and that I don’t want to go out for dinner or anything because it’s just another birthday. But in reality, I was trying my hardest to not acknowledge the reality of how lonely and pathetic this day is for me. I just had to start crying when I got into my room and away from my mom, I didn’t know what else to do when I thought of how I was insisting that my parents do nothing for a day they considered so important, only because I just wanted it to go by because aside from my family, I have no one. 

I ended up going out to dinner with my family just because I realized that I would just be driving myself to depression if I sat in my room and boxed my self from the people that actually care about me, but also to make them a little happy for a day they consider so important. After dinner, we came home and reality once again struck: I have no friends. I know it sounds like i’m making a big deal out of it, but i’m in a town where everyone has friends and posts everywhere about it, so even though I’m blessed with an amazing family, the feeling of not having friends hurts especially on a day like this.

I just felt like letting my emotions out because I am a very bottled person and I need an outlet after a day like that. For the past 3 years, I’ve been going through high school with no friends, trying to act as normal as possible, hiding my true emotions and situation from my loved ones in fear of embarrassment.

But, that also made me feel comfortable writing this post. Anyways, I just recently turned 18, and Ive been living with my brother for 2 years now, because my parents kicked me out at 16. My mom hasn't said a word to me since the night I left that house 2 years ago. My dad very rarely ever talks to me, and when he does its only because he has no choice. I also have 2 younger brothers that are just entering adolescence, but sadly I have been forced to be disconnected with them due to the fact my parents won't let them see me. I miss my family so fucking much. Everyday, all that runs thru my mind is me missing big parts of my family members lifes'. Last time I saw my two younger brothers was in 2018, before covid, and they were both 13 and 10 years old. They are now both 16 and 13, and I haven't been there for a single minute of it. A big part of me wants to just move on and forget about the past, but I'm trapped in the past. I miss the days where my parents would hug me and tell me they loved me every night before I went to sleep. I miss being able to hangout with my little brothers. I feel like by the next time I'm gonna get to see them, they'll both be adults, and I'm gonna feel empty and confused because the last time I saw them is when they were just kids. And on top of this I'm going through very difficult girlfriend issues. Me and this girl have been in love since we were 13, and we were inseparable. But due to getting older and more responsibilities now, we didn't work out. We broke up, and both found new partners. We are both still with those same partners for just around a year now, and we are both cheating on our partners. I guess both mine and her life just went downhill these past couple years, that she's my only sense of happiness and same way around. We are soulmates, and I know that. But for some reason, life in general won't let us be together for real. I absolutely hate the fact she is sleeping with someone else, and I hate the fact that the person I fall asleep with every night isn't her. It gets so bad, ill close my eyes and imagine my girlfriend is her. She is my only purpose in life right now, but I can't have her, and I'm not sure if I've ever felt a worse feeling then this.

I’m the youngest of 3 siblings, my brother is a teacher and my sister is a pharmacy tech. Compared to them I’m nothing seeing as how I just work as a kitchen planner. I skipped my high school Grad (prom) cause I didn’t have anyone to go with so instead I went to work pushing carts. 
I haven’t spent time with anyone other than my parents throughout my life and even then it feels shallow. 
I’ve never been invited to anything except my company’s Christmas party.
I learned to mimic accents to talk to myself in to fill the void of other people. 
I like to draw, cook, read, workout, study and practice HEMA; I have so many hobbies because if at any moment I’m left with my thoughts I stagnate and go days not doing anything. I recently started practicing guitar as well.

I don't have friends at home, and haven't been able to land a job for awhile. I've been trying to find something to do, but I can't keep interest. I go to this girl's track meets and sit for hours to talk to her for a little and it's the best part of my day. I'm scared of when I'm going to leave and be alone again, she's withheld because she doesn't want to be sad when I leave, no dates or anything. 
My sister's the last of my family I can relate to, and she's here with me but we don't get along most of the time. I spend most days walking around, this place was my childhood home and I see people who I knew pretty often but none of them engage with me. I just find a place and sit and feel my skin and my face and breathe and see what smells I can smell and look at the trees or the old couples or the kids here. I feel far older than I really am, and I have done what I should have. My writing is successful and my family is happy though distant. I don't think I'm scared of trying to find someone besides her. I think I'm just done.
I'm the best I've ever been, I feel happy and still. I sit and walk and breathe more than I ever have, I hardly shuffle or pick at my face in the uncomfortable way I used to do. I am just present and still and content. And I think it's time for me to go. I know some would be sad that I go but it's not the reason I want to move on. I don't want to prove anything or hurt anyone I just want to feel how I feel when I'm asleep. 
I'm not afraid to die. And I don't want to live. The world is so wholly beautiful and I understand what I'd be leaving behind. Even I don't believe in the afterlife. I believe I'm going to die and become nothing but still remains. But I am okay with that. It's not that I don't care anymore. Or don't want to try. But I feel like this is all.

(Recap: From Minnesota, moved to Hawaii alone after 2020 kicked my ass)

The catering company I work at threw a employee appreciation party at the Billabong surfing house on the beach. I went hoping to make some real friends out of some co-workers I shoot the shit with. Showed up and just like every kitchen, it was very cliquish, almost like highschool. I hated it so much that I just saw the guys I wanted to, smoked some joints with them and just went home. Even went to sit on the beach and watch the sunset to remind myself everythings fine. When I left I saw a cute girl crying on some rocks, asked her what was wrong, said she got dumped by her boyfriend/best friend, I told her ""After what I learned today, YOU gotta be your best friend before anyone else"". She smiled, that made me happy, I smiled back and said ""Have a good rest of your day"", went home, now im making dinner.

I only say this because I've seen similar posts get bombarded with clichés or people attacking the OPs. I am making this post to simply vent my feelings out because I feel like I have no one I can tell this to in my life at the moment.

I am 22M, and having never experienced romance has had an impact on my mental well being. I think this is most commonly called FOMO, but I've also heard the term ambiguous loss thrown around too. I realize romance isn't everything, I realize it's unfair to burden a partner with your issues, and I realize not everything is what it seems. But for whatever reason, the absence of experiencing romance when (and yes, I know it's not healthy to do this) all of the people around me (friends, family, strangers) have experienced something that seems so common and I haven't makes me feel alienated.

I am touch-starved. I want someone to be my special someone for once. I want to feel their loving embrace. I want to go to sleep and wake up next to someone who's genuinely happy to see me. My love languages are words of affirmation and physical touch, so I want to hold them and tell them how much I love them, and for them to do the same for me.

I’m doing online school cuz of covid and my dad has asthma and literally every one of my friends has done the in person school. I can hangout with friends now that I have the vaccine but I feel like I’ve missed so much and have no more friends. It’s like I didn’t even exist for almost 2 years now. I never had a hard time making friends and I did have a lot of friends in every friend group. I’m not even an introverted person. I had so many friends last year and always had someone to hangout with. I guess just not hanging out with any of my friends has kind of got me going crazy. I was suppose to get my license last year in may I was a month away from the test but covid happened. Every one of my friends has their license already and I always see and hear about everyone I know having parties like every week. I get my license in a month though.

Tonight's my school's prom and I can't go. There's a whole bunch of reasons why but the main one is because I honestly have no friends. I went to a different school for middle school so when I transferred into this school I lost all of my old friends. I've just never been able to make any real friends. I have a couple of acquaintances but they were kind of just the people you talk to because you sit next to them. I was never invited anywhere and we never even sat together outside of the class. BC rona I'm doing school only even though 90% of my school has returned. My mom won't let me go back so now the acquaintances I do have have not seen me in over a year. I havent spoken to anyone from school in over a year. Now today's prom and I'm sitting in a dark room all alone. 

I've always wanted to go to prom since I was a little girl. I used draw dresses and save photographs of what I wanted my prom dress to look like. I don't dance, I don't like loud music, but damn I really want to have to have the experience of trying on dresses and getting my hair done. This is all I ever wanted, this one day to take all the pictures with friends and wear a beautiful dress but now I'm just alone. The one friend that I do have, whom I speak to once every six months, wouldn't go with me to prom because he said he' be too embarrassed (not of me he's going through his own self image issues). I try to stay off instagram but I can't stop thinking about it.

context for this: today my friend unintentionally made me upset when they made me feel dumb over something i said.  Normally this wouldn't upset me, i would laugh it off but ive been very on edge as of late, so this pushed me over the edge. i broke down in tears. i gave a rather passive-aggressive reply and logged off. i ended up ignoring him for a few hours until he went to bed (we have different time zones) he said good night like he always does so maybe he doesn't realize i was upset.

something similar happened around 2 weeks ago as well. i just feel really bad about it. i'm not rly mad with him for that but more mad at myself for overreacting. i'm not the type to tell people ""hey this really upset me"" which i admit, is a bad thing to do, you should always tell ppl if smth upsets you. but my fear is making them feel worse and we ultimately stop talking and i don't want that.  

maybe i just had an over the top reaction because i was already dealing with other things to begin with (stressed over finals, dealing with my own depression etc)

and like i said i don't think my friend even realized i was upset.

I spend all of my time alone and it’s really peaceful. I look decent, I think I have body dysmorphia though, some days I just feel like I look disgusting. 

I have a few good friends, but they live in different states. I do have friends nearby but I just don’t feel connected to them, it feels like more of a hassle to socialize with them. I haven’t really hung out with anyone in over 6 months. 

I go to the gym often and finished college about a year ago. I’ve worked at the same place for 2 1/2 years, mainly because I just got a raise and pretty much have free healthcare, in America, which is rare. 

I want to date, but I live at my mothers house currently. I mean she’s a good person, I still feel alone. I need a job that pays more in order to move out, and I want to move cities because the city I live just sucks. 

I thought I was in love a few years ago,  turned out the whole year was fake. I mean I genuinely felt in love, but they were a narcissist I think, using me to build their self esteem. She told me I have too many problems, which is true. I should’ve known better, to be so naive. 

The thing is, I don’t want to meet new people. I don’t trust anyone really. I don’t really feel anything towards anyone anymore. I mean sure, I’ll see a pretty girl sometimes, but it’s like nothing is really there. I look at them and don’t really see or feel a future. And if they were into me, I know they’d find someone better eventually.  

Idk, I love being alone but I hate feeling lonely. Some days I feel dissociated from not talking to anyone. The other day I walked through a nature park and it was just so lonely so I went home and slept. 

I’ve tried therapy, it doesn’t work for me.

4027,ArkhamIsComing2020,1622672715,1,"Hilo there everyone, I know there's a lot of people on this sub struggling with loneliness so I'm here to become anyone's new friend, best friend, whatever you want really. I can relate with most of you here as I was extremely lonely at some point and tbh I still kinda am so I'm 100% down to become someone's new friend or maybe best friend or whatever. We could even just have a nice simple chat if you need one.

You probably wanna know some stuff about me before deciding if you'd like to become friends with me or not. Well for starters I'm an 18 year old human boy with a laid back but also outgoing, sarcastic and goofy personality. I drop funny metaphors and analogies and dad jokes randomly as I enjoy making others laugh. I'm an open book so we can talk about quite literally anything you want. Have a random fact you wanna tell? Tell me! Have some random thoughts you wanna get out? Tell me! Wanna talk about anything that exists? I'm here for ya. I don't get bored so don't expect me to lose interest in you or anything like that and I also come with a no ghosting seal of approval, I like communication, not silent treatments. 


I'd also say I'm an extremely caring, affectionate, complimentary guy who enjoys making other people happy and raising spirits. We can chat all day and all night(my sleep schedule sucks and I don't have a life), I'll even message you right when I wake up. We can watch movies, play games, do stuff online(you can tour virtual museums with others), voice call, FaceTime, debate, literally whatever you want to do, I'm down for. Although with voice calling and FaceTime, we'd have to get to know each other a bit first. But I've only told you all these things, now I'd like to show you.

I do have some hobbies that include gaming, collecting, exercising, exploring, driving, digital art, walking/running, swimming, cooking, etc. 


So if you'd like to make a new friend and think we'd click, hit me up! Just don't be a catfish and don't be a ghost. Can't wait to see your reply!",lonely,"Anyone need a new friend, best friend, etc? I'm your man :)",2021-06-03 08:25:15

I’ve moved to a new city in July and due to corona I only worked remotely. I met my colleagues a few times during working hours and that’s it.

My ex gf broke up with me last June. She was my everything. I never had many friends and this bothered me until I’ve found her. 
We were a great team for the most time. I did not need any friends anymore.

But since she is gone I have no one in my life (again).
Today in the evening I sat on my bicycle because I knew that I need some sports.
I drove near a river. Tomorrow is a holiday and it was really warm for the first time this year.
At the river there were soo many people. Couples or groups of three or more. I legitimately did not saw a single person alone. 

I feel lonely since September. Like I felt all those years before I met my ex gf. But in this exact moment as the orange sun touched the river, some smell of bbq was in my nose and laughing people in my ears I felt so fucking lonely I almost bursted into tears.
I imagined myself sitting with my ex or any other friend at the river. Enjoying the moment. 

Am I asking too much from life? To have someone with whom I can enjoy a sunset?

Why am I not capable of finding friends? I feel lonely for so long in my life and it hurts me so much. I am missing out on so much. But I still can’t make a change. Surely I must be stupid.",lonely,New city old me,2021-06-03 08:25:05

Hello, I wanted to share my experience with you, many of you are unhappy to be alone and need support. I was that kind of person, not in fact I still am but I realized that by absolutely wanting friends and a boyfriend I only succeeded in faking them, my situation remains the same. even . Above all, learn to trust yourself. It's so important, your mind can change everything. I think that we have to work on us, if we would have been good in our skin we would not want to receive the real love of a person since we would have been sufficient on our own. So please learn to appreciate yourself. No matter your family, your school or your job. I would do the same by now trying to be myself with others and not think about my past.

I fear i may have broken what i thought was unbreakable and if that's true I'm not do sure i could handle that she's my bestfriend in the whole world and being away from her like this is ripping me apart. I've never had a panic attack before but I'm pretty sure I've been having like 6 a day she left. I try to hold It in but guilt and the feeling of failure becomes so overwhelming i can't breath and i just crumble to the ground crying and thats very strange for me ive always been very mentally tough but i cant control this at all.

4062,krkrkrow,1622648032,1,"Hi! 

Once more, the feared birthday and facing it alone.

I live alone in a foreign country. My family and closest friends don’t. This year I’ve broken up with my partner, and the few friends that I have in this city, they’ve just focused on themselves and left the city recently for the summer.

I wanted to invite a few acquaintances for my bday, that’s in a month. Most of them work in the same company as I do.
But the company has decided to organise a summer party on the same day.
Now I’m hesitant of going to the party and risking that people find out I’m a loser with no plans for her bday. Or not going and spending it alone.

I already feel a bit down about the situation since I’m one of the few people at work that has no family and lives alone. My sense of worth has gone a bit down. That was accentuated especially after self isolation.

The country where I live, Sweden, didn’t impose lockdown and I could technically have met people. But it seems my acquaintances/friends just focused on themselves, their families, and meeting other sets of friends. I wasn’t anyone’s priority.

I blame the not having a partner/kids. Acquaintances with kids have met other kids’ parents, or with a partner, other couples. Nobody remembers the single one. I don’t have single friends or acquaintances here.

I don’t know what to do. Office party or birthday alone?
I don’t want to go and allow them to know I have no one to celebrate with. Their pity would ruin my sense of worth even more. And I know that alone, I’ll feel an immense loneliness.
After all I’ve been alone almost every day since January, when I came back here after Christmas. 😢",lonely,Birthday… alone or office party?,2021-06-03 01:33:52
4063,Mr__Muscle__,1622647903,1,"I (19M)  just visited my social worker (28F) for the last time. This was our closing appointment. I won't see her again, likely ever. I couldn't believe that it was going to come to an end, but there it was. 

All smiles saying goodbye, but I wanted to break down into tears after I left. Her work with me is done and she's done all she can do for me.

I'm being moved to another social team to help me out, but I already know (at least the stubbornness inside me says so) that that won't work out.

Why? That's something I couldn't explain to her the entire time I was there during our conversation. The reason why I clicked so well with her and was able to open up to just her out every dozens of social workers I've seen in the past, is because I developed feelings for her. Feelings that I couldn't admit.

I just realized that for the entirety of our last conversation, I spent venting about all my issues that have sprung up ever since I last saw her. That's what I did. I blew it and I won't see her again, ever.",lonely,I just saw the only friend I had here for the last time,2021-06-03 01:31:43

I've never had any quality that makes me stand out from the rest. I've never been particularly funny or smart or anything. 

I know it doesn't sound like much and I know there is always going to be someone better than you at the finish line, but I can't help but feel like no one will even remember me. I've always been that guy that you'll remember fondly at the end of the year but won't be able to remember in 2 years from now. 

I just want to feel special if even for a short while because I'm just too fucking normal. I've tried doing different things to stand out from the rest but I always end up backing down because I'm afraid of being left out.

Worst of all is that I can't even talk about this to anyone because my parents will overreact at anything I tell them and I don't really have a best friend to rely on. 

I don't think I am depressed (I hear many people say that they are depressed but at this point I feel like its just another word for sad) but I just don't know what to do.

Context: 24F and for the first time I’ve been trying to do something with a guy I’m interested in. He seem into it, like we text almost all the time. Problem is. Both time I asked him out it felt like I had to drag him there. We went on one “date” ( idk if he considered it a date) and I hate to basically fights to set a date. There was a school lunch where we both went. Barely a hi. And yesterday I asked him out again but he is busy ( then he said he is free al the time but looking for a job ??) 


Now I’m an anxious person and this has been a pretty rough 3 weeks. In part because of all of this. My friend tell me to give him time,but I feel like he just does not want to meet again.

Only my strongest friendships managed to continue on but most of them had gone by the time I finished my degree last year. I've most back home now until covid is over but now my friendships down there are deteriorating and most of my friendships here are gone too. 

I still had one good friend up here and we'd hang out from time to time and it honestly really was a blast but I could see he was changing. He'd just had a bad breakup and was hurting himself by trying to do too much at once. He was at work 7 days a week, not sleeping enough and beating himself up for it because he didn't have time to go to the gym. I kept trying to help him realise he wasn't doing himself any good but he didn't listen, eventually I said I'm not going to let it continue. I got mad and argued with him and he now has blocked me from contacting him. I'm now alone, and I don't have any way of contacting him.

Some of my friendships have maintained from university but they are now far away and those connections are deteriorating fast and I know find it incredibly difficult to meet new people due to covid.

I'm feeling so lonely right now.. i'm seeing a therapist for about a year an a half now.
 I have an intense fear of intimacy that unfortunately affected severely my current/past (on the limbo rn) relationship. I feel extremely uncomfortable being touched by anyone let alone having sex our saying loving things.
I went to the therapist at his request to help with my emotional inhibition and intimacy fear.

He moved out a month ago in an attempt to make things better.. something like distance makes the heart grow fonder..  wich is bs because I don't know how to reach out or correct this.. plus this pressure of having to change to keep the relationship is doing the opposite of helping and I feel like I want to isolate more.

My relationship with my parents isn't the best also, I mean we get along but we talk very rarely and never about feelings or uncomfortable life situations. 

The other day I had 4 days off and had a panic attack, all I could think of was that if I died right there my body would've only been found 4 days later when I didn't show up for work..

I Wans‘t able to socialize anymore. 
I have very few friends but it’s all right, because i am very happy with them, although we argue sometimes, but that’s something normal… they wanted to distract me, when I got heartbroken again, but I had no energy… I just wanted to stay in bed and sleep or imagine 1000 different scenarios in my head how it could have worked out with this girl… it sounds weird, I know but that’s just an awful feeling… 
She just broke me… she got beaten up and cheated on in her past relationships and I’m just different. I couldn’t understand how she went through this but she also told me that she was really happy with me and that she thought, like i did, that we could have an relationship… 
But she suddenly went cold on me…
She then told me that she want to end the contact to me and she told me that she needs a man and I’m a “pussy” and she said that she wants to go different ways. So in other words she wants to have no contact anymore… This broke into 1000 pieces. 
I’m clueless for what’s the reason, because we was really happy and it wasn’t just in sexual basis but we also went on small trips. Had the same interest. It was just great. I have never met a girl like her…

4 weeks have passed already and this still stuck to my head. My friends don’t want to talk about this because we already talked about it and so I’m battling my own battle… I don’t know.

So I’m in hospital right now and I have posted an whatsapp story and she suddenly texted me and asked what has happened… i was confused and some kind of happy that she reached out to me but also kind of sad… 
We chatted shortly and she even told me that she wanted to visit me… I said she can do this and then we texted 2-3 more messages and she stopped replying. I didn’t really care but now one more week has passed and I’m still in hospital and she didn’t texted me nor did she visit me. So I texted her yesterday when she wants to come. 
I thought to myself either you text her or you don’t. Nothing to lose anymore.
So she answered she wants to come in one of the following days and we also had a little smalltalk. She asked about me and I asked what’s new for her in life. She again stopped responding.
I was really sad and confused. This messes me up.
I don’t know if she wants to visit me because she wants it or because i asked her again. 
I felt really down…
But yesterday a friend visited me surprisingly and gave me a gift! I was really happy and surprised and felt a bit better..
But I’m still confused. Don’t know what I should talk about with her (IF) she comes. I won’t ask anymore.
So Im still really sad, but i must say, that the hospital has opened my eyes. Here are so many old and sick people who are alone, too and who may be not alive for long… 
I’m now sure that one should live his live to the fullest and shouldn’t be stopped by obstacles. Of course you are sad from time to time but this should not keep you down, because one day we all might be old and sick and until then we should enjoy our youth…

4085,kneal_,1622624180,1,"It is the same mantra I recited every night in my head. Without fail and without bidding, as soon as I lie my weary head on my pillow those words carry me on to sleep. It seems like my whole life has been lived on those words. Every day is the same drudgery with different scenery. I don’t remember a time it was ever different.   It’s cold out and I don’t want to leave the covers. Is it because of the cold? Or because of the disgust I have for myself and the world around me. Disgust? Is that the word? I think apathy would be more appropriate. I am apathetic to everything and everyone and yet I am still her, trudging along like a dream. How do I keep going? Because I must.  I pull myself out of bed- late again. Damn. I wish I cared. All I care about is the minor annoyance my boss will be when I show up 20 minutes late. Maybe one of these days I’ll lose my job because of it, maybe. I go along with the normal morning routine. Brush teeth, wash face, comb hair, dress. There’s no sense of urgency. I’m late, but I won’t change that and it doesn’t matter anyhow.   After my short commute I show up 15 minutes after I should. No one says a word. They seem to ignore me as a trudge past the cubicle prison to my very own cell. No word from the boss. I guess he’s used to this by now.   Another day drifts by slowly, like I am on a death bed. I can’t focus, can’t drive myself to do what I need to do. I barely have the motivation to dredge up distractions- youtube videos, reddit, anything to try to take my mind off what’s around me. Lunch rolls by. It’s afternoon already. 4pm. 1 hour left. If I lose my job I’ll lose everything. No food, no house, no video games to take my mind off everything when the work day ends. I get the only motivation I have all day- motivation to do just enough work to skid on by. I spend 60 minutes of the dreaded 540 minute work day actually doing enough to earn my keep. Even that’s not enough. Everyone can see my horrible performance.   Maybe I should get another job. I’ll be happier at another job. But what if I won’t? What if I’m the problem? I don’t want to deal with new people and learning new things. I won’t be able to if I feel like this. It will worse and I’ll probably get paid less. No, I’ll keep this job as long as I can. I wonder how long that will be…  5pm! It’s here. I feel a slight elation for the hour. But I haven’t finished up yet. I need to wrap up. 30 more minutes of excruciating pain.  I’m home. Weighed down from another 9 hour day I want to forget. I open the door and slump in front of my computer. Games. Games will help me forget. I boot up league of legends and the time flies by. With every win I feel like I’ve accomplished something and with every loss I am upset at my incompetence. But for those few hours I’m not here anymore. I’m in another place and I’m happier. Happier than I’ve ever been in the real world. Why can’t it always be like this?  11pm. I’m fatigued. It’s time for bed. Sometimes I have the energy to wash my face and brush my teeth, other times I don’t even care.

He was always pessimistic, judgemental and unforgiving to other people; plain rude and socially outcast (though it was probably by choice, he treated other people like shit and never bothered bring nice to anyone else outside his circle); the thing is i spent so much time with him everyday and i adopted those same traits. I became judgemental and rude, hateful toward the world and other people. But instead of outright showing my dislike (though people usually could sense my dislike of them anyway), i mostly directed it towards myself: i was self-loathing, insecure, jealous, sad, mean towards myself; which made me lose most of the friends i had before.

I wanted to change myself, but i didnt know what to do and it felt like i was too far gone. So i wanted to try change him, make him more kind and understanding other people so he would be less critical of people. Ofc it didnt work. never does.


Fastforward, I graduated from my secondary school; didnt go to my graduation party bc he didnt want to. Im in a new school, my friend went to another, and now im friendless in my new school. I dont feel close to anyone even though we talk sometimes, im insecure, i dont know that to do about it.

Literally the only conversations i have are through text with him. We talk about music and movies and politics, but when i try to talk about personal stuff about me he doesnt give a shit. Im fucking fed up with his bullshit. This was a conversation we had recently

""me: im considering becoming a teacher. but not here in [this place], its too competitive and the education system is bullshit.

him: rain is nice (its raining where we r from)

me: stand by me 1986 it literally so good you should watch

As of right now, I’ve mostly come to terms with being alone (possible forever). I’ll admit that most of this acceptance came from hopelessness rather than me truly wanting to live a celibate lifestyle. I’m not sure exactly how I would describe myself. I’m not an incel, I mean in a way I am. I have just as much a chance at attracting a possible mate, as I do being able to control which direction the wind blows. But I don’t hold it against anyone. I’m aware of my problems and they go beyond trivial things such as me not being a “chad” (I think the whole virgin vs chad thing is stupid). Besides there’s perks to being single anyways. 

My biggest concern is not knowing how to deal with people’s comments about why I’m still alone. I think anyone who spends at least 10 minutes with me in person can probably figure out that I’m still very much a virgin. I’m not bothered by it (yet), but that doesn’t stop people from making their jokes about it. I’ll be turning 23 later this month, and I think this problem will only become less excusable as I become older for some people.

I think I am incapable of being wanted and am trying to reach a point where I'm able to accept that I don't really have anyone. I mean I guess I have friends but then again I question this statement. 

For some context, I am a recent  graduate and going into school I had the aspiration to have this amazing social life, like the one my brother  had and the one my mother told stories about but it didn't work out that way. Like I said, I guess I have friends but I don't have my people. No one really wants me, no one asks me out, no one texts me, no one looks for me during breaks. If I didn't endlessly seek people out I'd have truly have no one.

I've tried so many things, I've planned fun things with people (they've had fun at the things I've planned), I've sent funny photos and made group chats for all of high school but none of my labors ever gets returned. I swear to god the only response I get are ""haha"" ""lol"" ""idk"" or ""I have to check"" and those are if I get a response. It takes an f-ing act from congress to plan something and I almost always the one trying. I go through spurts of motivation to plan things but alwUs end up going into the deep dark depths of loneliness. 

For a long time now I've made excuses for the lack of reciprocation with whens, ""I'll have friends WHEN I start high school"" ""it's freshman year I'll be go out WHEN we become better friends"" ""They'll seek me out WHEN their less busy and stressed"" but I'm starting to think there is no WHEN for me. Recently, after seeing my friends on social media I've realized it's not that they don't have time or don't go out they just don't have time for me. I'm so tired of going through my cycle of loneliness. I'm tired of the dull ache in my chest when I think about how lonely I am. I just want to have people who seek me out and who want me.

I hope this doesn't come across as entitled or ungrateful. I've had these feelings weighing on me and have no one to share them with. Maybe this will help or maybe no one will care... like usual.",lonely,A lonely rant from the person no one wants,2021-06-02 14:56:42

I had a crush from highschool that lasted for 5 years, until it slowly faded away and I just lost interest, but again, it took 5 whole years. Then last year I felt like I fell in love again, with another girl this time, just after I stopped having feelings for that first girl. Things seemed to go great at first but then things happened and we quickly went back to just being friends. I suffered a lot for 3 months but then managed to move on... mainly because I started having feelings for another girl, again. As the first time, things seemed to go great then she randomly lost interest. Took me more than 3 months of crying almost every day but I managed to stop thinking about her. Felt completely empty for a couple of weeks because I had no one left to having feelings for. Then that second girl came back to my mind and I texted her again, but I quickly realized she just didnt really care anymore. Then, 3 days ago, after pretty much a month and a half where we never talked to eachother, I talked once again to that last girl I had feelings for (that also had feelings for me, before randomly losing interest) and while talking to her I felt quite happy. Then yesterday it happened again, we talked for 2 hours and a half and once again I felt quite happy... the point being, I am kinda falling for her again. Thing is, Im pretty sure they arent real feelings. I just need to feel love towards someone, at all times. She's just the only one left that makes a bit of sense for me rn to have feelings for, since she had feelings for me in the past so I think to myself that she might, perhaps, who knows, get them back (even tho I know its pretty much impossible and it wont happen). So... Yeah. I honestly dont know why I am this way, probably because Im used to getting a ton of love and affection from my parents, but it kinda bugs me how I really cannot live happily, or even decently, without having feelings for someone. Those 2 weeks I mentioned earlier when I didnt have feelings for anybody were some of the worst days of my life. I couldnt stop crying and I felt pure void, sad and empty.

4128,TheCollegeDropout_,1622602177,1,"For awhile, I've debated on hopping off of social media. A few days ago, I sort of took that stepped. I deleted the Facebook and Snapchat apps (rather than deactivate) and temporarily deactivated my public Instagram account (as I may or may not return eventually). 

The only social media I have left is my private Instagram. That private Instagram, which used to have 100-200+ followers before I started removing them, now has 20 people left: people I knew from elementary/high school I don't talk to but am cool with and people who I talk to online. With this page, I do three things: I post memes because that's what this page has been for about four years since I started it at 14 (now I'm 18 turning 19) and people like it, I use it to save memes and keep up with sports/music, and I talk to people from time to time. 

I just didn't want to go off the grid completely. I honestly prefer it this way and don't see myself going back to the way I used social media beforehand.

4131,Noteagro,1622600130,1,"As the friend that has always been there for others, the honest answer is no one. So many times have I been cast aside or betrayed by friends I cherished. So many times have I been there to soothe a broken heart for no one to be present when I have needed it.

I have gotten so used to people walking out of my life I actually have rules for it now. 

The 6 month rule: The betrayers. Those people you grow close to and trust with your secrets since they have been around for a decent amount of time. But eventually they will betray that trust and make you feel awful in time.

The 3 month rule: The drifters. The ones that want you in their life to help them drift from one soul to another. Latching on and leeching energy from those around them before they move to the next victim.

The 50 day rule: The heartbreakers. The ones you get close to in a romantic way, but happen to be ticking time bombs. You think you finally found someone that is a good fit for you. Everything seems to just click into place, and the time you spend together is a ray of sunshine illuminating the darkness in your life. However the instant things get intimate and you think the next time you see them you will ask to be more they slip through your embrace like smoke on a windy day. They tell you that you are a wonderful human and value you greatly, but make no effort to even communicate anymore. Thus destroying the relationship you thought you were building with them brick by brick instead of just destroying it in one fell swoop.

I am at the point that I am about ready to stop even interacting with anyone else because the only thing other humans bring me is pain and suffering. For all the good times we might have all I ever get in the end are lies, betrayal, and pain. For every step forward I take building a friendship by the end they push and shove me two, three, even five steps back.

I am realising no one will be there when I need them, and soon that will be fine because when they reach out for me; I’ll be no where to be found. The fire and passion they desire to warm their soul will be safely tucked away for no one to dowse and risk putting out ever again.",lonely,“Who will be there for the ones always there for us?”,2021-06-02 12:15:30
4132,BrokenBustedBrain,1622599517,1,"I (22M) have BPD and C-PTSD. It’s pretty pathetic and I’ve never admitted it to anyone before, but pretty much every night I listen to videos like this to help me sleep: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TACr-M6Wda8

I was thinking about it last night though and I realised, I don’t think I can ever have someone who loves me like that. I don’t think love like that really exists. Granted I’ve only ever been in love once but I analyse that situation all the time. She cared about me and supported me, but she didn’t feel the same way I did, didn’t love me back. And it makes sense, if I think back to that friendship, of course she didn’t love me back. She was the only person who ever really saw the full extent of my mental issues and I think having mental problems makes it almost impossible to be attractive to someone else as a partner. 

I can’t provide a feeling of safety or security because I can’t even guarantee I’m gonna have the energy to get outta bed some days and as soon as someone saw all my self-harm scars under my clothes there’s no way they could ever think of me as stable enough to give them that. 

Mental illnesses also make you appear vulnerable from time to time and as much as you can try to hide it, if someone gets close enough they’ll see it eventually. So once they see it it’s almost impossible to appear attractively strong and masculine in their eyes again because they’ve seen you weak before.

I can’t really have kids because I don’t want to pass my mental issues on to them and even if I didn’t, I know how damaging having mentally ill parents is. 

I can’t offer any kind of long-term stability because my moods change so rapidly that some days I’ll be fine then two hours later I’ll be walking to the gym and be so goddamn angry that I can’t stop picturing doing incredibly violent things to strangers on the street, getting so caught up in it that I almost get hit by a car crossing the street because I’m deep in a fantasy.

I can’t even promise to be able to just be there for them 100% of the time because sometimes I just can’t be around people. I can’t summon the energy to speak and I don’t see the point anyway. And when other people try to speak to me it irritates me to the point where I feel infuriated like someone’s scratching my brain with their words and it takes everything I have not to just scream at them to shut the fuck up.

I think about all this then I listen to one of those videos where I’m hearing a girl say all those kind, supportive things and I realise it’s impossible to get there. The moment anyone sees this side of me they either leave because they don’t know how to deal with someone like me or they stay but all attraction and possibility for intimacy is gone.",lonely,I don’t think I’ll ever be loved the way I need,2021-06-02 12:05:17

I love my family, but they are always so busy and tired that I don’t want to burden them with my negative feelings. When I do, it always ends up as a “you upset makes me upset” and then I’m the one backpedaling and trying to downplay what I said to make them feel better.

I have 4 close friends. They are all older than me and actually doing stuff with their lives. I never understood why suck amazing people like them even wanted to befriend me.

4134,MathematicianNo5862,1622598949,1,"I had a discussion with my cousin the other day when I asked him for advice on being social and getting a girlfriend. He proceeded to tell me about how ""women and life is a game"". After a few minutes of him babbling, I realized that we live in completely different perspectives.  


I feel a strong disconnect with people my age, particularly because I don't like the modern pop culture at all.    


I sometimes wish I could feel the warm embrace of someone who understands me. I've always dreamt of having a girlfriend who likes to work hard, is ambitious, is accepting of me, somebody quiet who doesn't like to party or socialize that much, somebody I can live a peaceful portion of my life with. Day after day I think about all the nice things I can do for my dream girl; go to the movies, watch movies, study together, beach dates. It'd just be really nice to have someone to deeply love and cherish with all my heart.  


Suicide has become a more calming rather than horrifying thought. As Seneca puts it: "" one should not commit **suicide** to avoid pain, but only when the constant pain prevents one from living a worthwhile life. I spend so much time at my house and in my thoughts, that I find myself pacing back and forth in my house having hour-long conversations with myself so I do not feel completely alone.   


""My issues aren't valid"". ""Boo hoo I'm a 19-year-old who wants to die because he can't find any sense of belonging"". These thoughts and many more are what are constantly cycling through my damn head all day. I'm exhausted.

4135,Overclocked_PSU,1622597252,1,"I appreciate all of them, most of them supported and believed in my dream. I am lucky to have them in my life, but deep down I’ve always felt disconnected with them almost like every conversation is all in the surface if that make sense like none of it has meaning. This has made me feel very lonely when i’m in social events and is amplified when i’m alone in my room. I’m glad no one I know knows my reddit account because I feel like I don’t deserve to feel lonely at all with all these people supporting me but I just can’t stop feeling isolated even tho I’m literally not. 

I’m introverted but not socially awkward so I can have good engaging conversations with people, they often feel connected with me and fulfilled with the conversation, but I seem to never feel the same way, almost feel like I’m putting a front and faking it. Maybe thats what I’m doing....? Idk but this has caused a lot of problems in relationships I’ve been on. I would have a loving and caring girl that has my back and still feel alone and sad. That is why i’m staying single for a while, don’t want to hurt anyone else. 

Weirdly enough tho at times when I need to be independent is when I feel less alone.... for example I did a selection assessment day for a top school few months back, overall a very challenging and stressful day.  I was alone throughout the whole process, but never felt lonely. In fact that day was the happiest i’ve been in a while which is so stupid because i was scared shitless and nervous as hell. 

Anw I’m 21 and this has been going on since high school and has been eating me up inside. I have no idea what the hell is going on, why I feel this way or what i’m looking for in people I guess that will be my lifetime challenge I would gradually overcome as I get older, but in the mean time i’ll just continue and lose sleep over these thoughts and try not to be overwhelmed by this dreaded feeling of loneliness while I navigate through my career :’)

I've just been this old-soul... and that's made it difficult to bond with, and get to know, people. As I sit alone in my apartment day-in and day-out, I feel like most of my relationships were empty. 

I've never really had my own friend group. In high school, I was in a friend group that my sisters were in (we're close in age, and, the friend group had been together since elementary school) I was certainly the forgettable tag-along. I didn't much care... because of that lone-wolf mentality. In college I was swept up by my best friend's group. Still, I was kind of the tag-along. I did have friends of my own, but they weren't that strong of relationships.

However, I did have my best friend. We were paired as roommates freshman year, and remained so for all four years. We didn't share much in common but we were close. And I think I'm about to lose her, and if not that then I may have already lost her.

Like with so many of my friends over the past year, we've kinda just lost contact. I moved to a new city, then covid hit, we talked at least once a week, then she moved, and that's where events decline. Most of this is on me, I  deleted most of my social media earlier this year. I've tried to maintain communication, but her replies have become more scarce. And... (this sounds petty)... my birthday was a few days ago and I was hoping for a text/call and got nothing. Maybe she has something going on, there are more important things, but it was just a sign.

I know I'm to blame for deleting social media. Made me realize how dependent I was on social media for maintaining contacts. If it wasn't for covid, I don't think I would be in this boat. I guess at some point I have to get out and meet new people... even though I have no one to go out with. I'm sick of my apartment and I'm sick of not having anyone to share my interests with.

Then high school I was a ghost unless I was a damn punching bag. When I worked me and my coworkers had great laughs but never hung out outside of work. It was always easier for me to get dates (even that was fucking near impossible but still easier) than friends because dating apps. There really isn't an app for friends you know? But now that I finally have one I know I care so much more for him than he does me. We hang out and have a great time but then I head home and I feel empty. I start getting anxious thinking of him leaving because I know statistically it's inevitable if you look at my past. I just want someone who GETS it and I don't even know what that means but it makes sense. I want someone who feels like I do. Who understands why I am the way I am. Someone there for me who would never leave because im not a bad person and I care so much for people when they're in my life. I can be a bit boring at times sure but that's not worth leaving over.

I work from home so I don't have to ever meet or speak to anyone in person. All I have is a dog and a fish called Lucky, my dog, I take for walks around the park, but it feels like he is the one taking me for walks instead... worried about my mental state.

I don't have any issues socializing. I can pretend to be normal with relative ease: make jokes, tell stories, smile and laugh... When people get to know me, they start to notice that this is all fake: ""Your laugh is so fake."" they often tell me. ""Is it really? Sorry."" But I get tired quickly, I get tired of pretending, and so I push everyone away from me. I even consider starting from scratch in a new place, for my facade had gotten compromise, ""I'll get it right the next time."" I tell myself carving the mask of my next persona.

 But I've notice that there is something profound about loneliness. I feel like I am who I am because of my solitude. If it wasn't for all the free time I've had. I wouldn't have learned English(more or less), or reading for fun, or philosophy, or develop my weird music and movie taste. I was never influenced by a circle of friends to be someone I'm not. And I appreciate that.  

But I still get really sad and lonely. Sometimes when I cry alone in the dark, I feel good. It feels so good to be miserable sometimes. And I don't know why, maybe because I stop feeling like and empty vessel as that glimmer of humanity in me cries out for help.

As many of you, i am a loner an as many of you i am lonely.  
And sadly as many of you ive been suicidal alot of times in my life.  
I want to share some opinion of mine that keeps me going.  
Thing is, i was on the edge many times, ive been through loss of loved one ive been through betrayal, through broken relationships, through alot of pain, as every single one of you.  
I thought, why bother, it wont get better.  
The thing is, it doesnt have to get better, it has to get different.  
Life is a journey, you will find some people that will eventually break your heart, and you will find people you will hurt, and it can take time to find someone at all, and even then they will probably leave.  
But it doesnt matter, because there is always something else behind corner, until the last day.  
So why should the last day come today?   
Even the pain and suffering is just part of the journey, it makes us grow, it makes us more complete, and when we meet another person we carry that experience with us.  
So why would we give up on it? accept it.  
You might be feeling that your life is stagnant, that nothing changes, that tomorrow is no different.   
Make it so then, if your cosideration is ending it all, why not just do something out of the ordinary?  
What do you have to lose?  
Do you think you are too dumb? too ugly? too whatever? why does it matter? look at this subreddit, look at all the people like you that need love, they are there.  
You have only one jurney, dont give up on it, make something out of it, something you will love.

4187,reddit_rohan,1622566025,1,"Hey…this is a long one, sorry. And my first big post. Idek if anyone will see this but here goes.

My parents argued a lot when I was a kid, a lot about me, and still do but now that I can understand and witness the dynamics of their relationship. There’s nothing I can do because talking back is disrespectful and my opinion rarely ever matters if it’s to correct their own bad behavior. It hurts a lot and I can’t really talk about it with a lot of people for fear of saying too much and worrying the person I would have been telling. When I was little, I had friends who lived in my building and neighborhood that I thought I’d grow up with and everything would be great. Those friends have either moved away, fell in with the wrong crowd, didn’t have a good home life or some combination of them and all I could do was watch. In HS I lost my v card…not against my will but I definitely didn’t want to. I didn’t feel right both before and after. I could have waited but did it anyway cuz I felt like I had to. I told a friend about it and the next day people I never would have told questioned me about it. After admitting we did it to them the word spread, and the girl who plucked my pear shared one too many details about our brief encounter and turned the whole school on me for 2 years. I had no friends. And if I did I didn’t trust them completely because at that point I was a social outcast who didn’t get much respect from their piers. I’m naturally charismatic, tall, and love to chat, so having almost no one to talk to without being disrespected or feeling like a joke was a big hit to my confidence and self esteem for the 2 years I had left in school. Fast forward to graduation. College is a new start for me and I can literally wipe the slate clean. Then COVID happened and I had to say goodbye to all the friends I had made the middle of my freshman year not knowing when I would see them again. I had finally found people I could call friends and I had to wait until the end of a global pandemic to see them again. Being back home for a year with the functioning dysfunctional parents that raised me and having to constantly prove myself to their standards while trying to stay in school and prove WHY I NEED TO STAY IN COLLEGE and not go to trade school is mentally exhausting. Not to mention having to pick up the pieces and make sure my 2 younger sisters (15 and 7) aren’t completely damaged by the shouting matches and emotional abuse from their actions that I had to deal with growing up. I have some friends I went to HS with and I love them to death, but now I’m not so sure they’re what I need rn or what I need at all. Family friends aren’t an option, we just don’t talk about our home issues like that really. I have a gf I met on campus, but it’s long distance and although we make it work she’s the only person I really want to see most of the time and she’s 4 hours away. And the constant arguing and putting down at home makes it harder and harder for me to communicate without being afraid that what we have will turn into what my parents have, or that I’ll become them and ruin everything we’ve built over 2 years together.

Sometimes I just feel so lonely and tapped out. Just done. The amount of times I’ve seen an open window and thought about falling through it is scary. Sometimes I just want to punch through the walls and scream. Feeling like the world is against me from my past experiences with people that lie behind your back doesn’t help with many friendships or a relationship where you see your partner at most once a month. My parents make me feel as if I’m not doing enough when I’m doing everything I can which is even more for most people my age (I’m 20). Having fun or doing anything I’m comfortable with and makes me happy is apparently a luxury I can’t afford so for the longest time they’d make an effort to take away the things that made me happy (phone, computer, etc.). I’ve always put others before myself at home and outside mostly to avoid conflict and just started taking joy in whatever they found exciting at the time, but whenever I do things I enjoy on my own it feels selfish like I’m doing something bad. I never know who I can talk to who can really tell me what it is I need to hear. It’s not the people who are close to me’s fault, it’s just that I don’t feel comfortable with being open to people who know me in fear that they’d use it against me. It’s happened with friends, exes, and I’ve seen it at home. I’ve been conditioned to fear being open with others and it’s not my fault but I hate myself for feeling this way almost every day. I want to make more friends but I’m afraid they’ll all hate me. I want to dress like how I want to but I feel like everyone will be watching me. Aside from the emotional stress I have great parents, so I feel bad for resenting their bad behavior towards me. I love my sisters more than anything, so I always think twice about leaving them. I feel like a burden to others whenever I try to vent my feelings. That there’s no where I can go to escape anymore, and that there’s no one on my side no matter what they say or do to prove otherwise to the point where I think the world would be better off not remembering I was here. I have no formal diagnosis but I know my family mental history is super fricked up so at this point I just feel destined to spiral. I’m trying to be better, but the odds are against me and even in the arms of the woman I love I still feel alone and I hate it.",lonely,I can document my loneliness and it sucks to remember it all and know I’m always the problem,2021-06-02 02:47:05

I've only had one girlfriend.

I was a complete jerk and I lashed out at her.\* I tried to fix the damage but it had already been done. I never dated since.

A lot of this is the same reason I don't want to get married. It might feel good in the short term but over time, arguments become inevitable and they will get nasty. That, and the kids you'll raise will be hard work and I will already have it hard as it is with another future job I'll have.

I also don't want any pets because of how you know you will outlive them at the time of adoption. I don't want to have to adopt a puppy only to suffer immense grief 5-10 years down the line. In fact, I'm just asking for it.

4210,amo_20,1622549489,1,"Hi! Thanks for reading this or even just the tldr. It's super appreciated. 

I'm struggling with immense loneliness atm and I know I'm not the only one, especially since covid. I'm a first year university student and the pandemic has made it very difficult for me to make friends. I only made one, who I ended up dating and breaking up with a few months later, so we're not on the best terms rn. Now I'm 300 miles away from family, living alone with no friends near or far. It's tough. 

I'm moving out of student halls today and it's stressful doing it all alone and seeing all the students moving out in their parents' cars. My parents can't drive and we're too poor to travel. It's tough because I keep thinking, ""why do they get to have their parents' support them and I don't?"". It's unfair but it's the way life is. Plus, it gives me ample opportunity to be more independent and that can only be a good thing whilst also giving me a kick up the behind to save for driving lessons. 

I lost a lot of friends this year by being an ass. I was struggling with my mental health and living in my parents living room in their one bedroom apartment due to unforseen circumstances. I was angry at my friends' privilege. Super unattractive and it's not gonna make anyone's life better to be resentful. Nonetheless, I was so petulant about the fact that they had money, their own rooms, could go on holidays and had all the things I couldn't. I couldn't see at the time that *I* was privileged in ways they weren't. I see now that the world doesn't revolve around me and every person has unique struggles and experiences; comparing them isn't going to get anyone anywhere. 

I also got angry that they had partners when I'd just had the worst breakup of my life and they had no mental health issues. I was so hung up on the fact that they ""didn't understand me"". I wanna slap younger me round the face because wtf. Truly. They did their best to support me but they didn't need to understand to be empathetic and they were. I was palming off responsibility for improving my situation by focusing on what they had so easily. Yeah, I will have to work twice as hard for a stable life, but it will feel good to know I didn't give into poverty and mental ill health. I got dealt a bad hand from childhood, but how much longer am I going to cling to that as an excuse to stagnate? 

The running theme through this and the root cause of my loneliness is that I'm still struggling with resentment. I really try not to because it pushes people away and hurts them, but it's hard. I try and see my blessings, like my best friend and my pets. It's a process that will take me a while but I want to work at it. 

I want to try and reconcile with my old friends but I hurt them a lot and I don't know if they'd be open to it. I suspect I am suffering from a personality disorder of some kind and they also run in the family so it's likely. It's not an excuse for how I was acting, but it would explain my wild mood swings and blowing hot and cold with people. I'm nervous about approaching them to reconcile if they'd be open to it because I still don't have access to a psychological assessment for at least another five months, which means treatment for anything I have could be way off. I'm scared if I make things right with them that I'll just hurt them again because I'm untreated. I learnt a lot from the situation and how to enforce/respect boundaries, but it's still a concern. It's something to let them know about I suppose. 


If anyone has any advice to deal with feeling resentment and getting caught up in the fact that you got dealt a bad hand, please do let me know. Atm, I'm working on gratitude at the moment and making changes in my life to feel more autonomous. 

Thanks so much 
Amo

4212,NickyPoo9919,1622548821,1,"This mostly applies to straight men in my case but very well can apply to others genders and sexual attractions to. Do anyone else long for the physical touch of a woman, not so in a sexual matter, but that does still apply. Like you long for the feeling of being loved and cared for, it’s been so long you can’t even remember that feeling. It’s been so long since you’ve had a genuine hug. A deep hearty hug that would make you feel safe and warm,  and make her feel safe and warm also. Or the deep handholding, promising never to let go. Her smile being the best, brightest and most beautiful thing you’ve seen all day. Then the passionate French kissing, your tongues rapidly playing and embracing each other, in a dance of love and sex. But then one day her feelings disappear, you break up. You try to stay friends, she doesn’t want to. She becomes spiteful, she shows her true colors, her friends, who you thought were your friends turn on you, she hates you. A year goes, you realize how bad she treated you, you hate her too. But you still miss her. New kinds of depression, anxiety, spring up that have never appeared before. Everyday is a struggle. Thoughts of suicide are prevalent. Second year it’s like this, third year it’s like this, it’s still like this. Depressed, anxious, lonely, alone, missing her but knowing you shouldn’t. Suicidal, but too afraid to take your own life, barely living, she was your first love, and it’s clear she might be the last. Thanks for reading this everyone, sorry it’s slow, long and boring but it’s my personal experience. It’s how I live right. Constantly stuck in a rut. I wanna raise awareness that men suffer from a breakup too, maybe even worse than women. Most people know this but it seems much of society just can’t grasp the concept of men having feelings. I also wanna ask that you please treat your guy friends well after their breakup, I assume many women have friends who comfort them after the breakup, but I didn’t, my guy buddies basically bought me a beer and said oh well. The reason for my breakup was my strict parents never let me see her, which then caused the breakup, but my family can’t take all the blame. I wasn’t the best boyfriend, I got attached too fast, then again it was my first relationship, but then again she was far from the best girlfriend, she was rude to me, played with my emotions and I think she may have cheated on me. But anyways, this relationship ruined my life. I’ve wasted the last two years depressed, I’m still young so people said I have time to fix my lifestyle and I hope I can but I’m doubtful.

4246,thechief120,1622520520,1,"Just recently moved across the US from the New England to Arizona. I've always been introverted but not socially awkward or anything, but Covid restrictions are making my transition into my new life hard. I moved out here far away from my friends and family because I took the first software development job that accepted me. I could of found places closer if I waited but after applying for hundreds of jobs I got desperate. Now that leaves me in a fine job but an isolated position. Usually when I get bored one of my friends wants to go out to a restaurant or take pictures (he does photography). But now I'm in a new state, with new everything and none of it excites me.

I don't party, drink, smoke, go to movie theaters, or restaurants so I end up just sitting here when my friends aren't online to talk to. Sometimes I cook but it only takes up about an hour or so. Other times I play video games of watch videos online. I work from home so I don't see my new co-workers in person (they're planning to slowly bring people in in July). I know I could meet new people and do something like workout since my apartment complex has a gym in walking distance, but I have no motivation to do anything but just sit in my house (which I know is bad). I go out once a week for groceries but try not to go out and drive, since I just don't like driving in general. I know I'm putting all this on myself but I just don't have any drive to do anything but mope.

I also think that because I wanted to move abroad permanently after college but couldn't due to covid is another reason I'm feeling frustrated and lonely. I'm living in a place I don't want to be in due to circumstances I can't control, I don't want to meet new people, explore new places, since I plan on staying here for ""only"" 3 years. However I know it will be terrible for my mental health to remain this isolated for that long, so its a self-fulfilling cycle. I don't want to meet new people, but in turn it will make my loneliness worse. I don't want to try dating for the first time since I don't want any of my life plans to change, but I'll be in an awkward place when I'm 25 and have never dated. Etc etc etc.

I moved out here with the help with my mother and step father and they suggested doing the normal things by socializing. But again I just didn't want to hear it and just moped around the first week they were here. My mother suggested I see a therapist (which I agree) but when it comes to doing anything new I always resist. I **want** to do it, but I end up doing nothing. As far as I know I don't have any mental health conditions, I'm just hard on myself and doing things out of routine bother me.

To be blunt, I am a total pathetic loser. I’m 21 years old and my whole life I’ve never had friends, a boyfriend or any kind of meaningful relationship. All throughout my school years I thought I’d have an ideal social life. Many friends, a nice, loving boyfriend, just a really cool life. I thought middle school might be the time it’d happen. Nothing. So, I went on to hoping high school would open the door to my wonderful social and romantic life. Nothing again. I said okay then college will definitely be the time. I stayed 1 semester at 2 different colleges before finding out it wasn’t right for me but even then I was just as lonely and a loser as I was before. It’s so bad that my family thinks I’m some weirdo. I have social anxiety and I’ve never been able to make friends. Any guys I’d talk to I’d end up ruining it in some way. Either I was too shy and slow to open up or I made a fool of myself and the guys never talked to me again. I’m convinced this is gonna be my life now, so I’m currently in the stage of acceptance. I wish I could wilt away into nothingness like a dying flower. I want nothing more than to just stop existing already. I can’t even go out without seeing couples everywhere. I have many sisters and they’re all happily married or engaged with children. I’m just sitting here with nothing and no one. I want my life to end already. 

Also I have tried to put myself out there and find nice guys or make friends. I always end up failing the relationship. I’m also finding out how hard it is to make relationships in your 20s.

I’m a guy in my 20’s. I’ve experienced chronic trauma at the hands of people I thought were people who cared about me in the past, but I truly have no idea if this is connected to how I’m currently feeling (or lack of feeling, more accurately) towards the topics of friendships and relationships.

It’s weird. Or maybe I’m viewing it as ‘weird’ because it seems to be the norm to shame those without friends. I have no friends and no significant other, and I just genuinely don’t care that I don’t. I have no desire to make friends or date at all (hell, I don’t even know if I’m attracted to anyone). I don’t speak to anyone else and I stay to myself because that’s what’s most comfortable for me. Spending time with others is extremely draining. 

I also don’t care whether or not I have sex. It’s not something that’s on my mind or something I’m interested in, I do not understand what all of the general hype about it is, and I personally find it repulsive.

4283,howtobattlepsychosis,1622503360,1,"The night I ran up to my mum and dads room, screaming, crying and shaking uncontrollably. The voices I was hearing were getting the better of me. They criticised me, lied to me and manipulated me. 

They made me believe that 2 of my grandparents had died, that I had been at fault, and that people were coming to murder my family.

My mum and dad drove me to A&amp;E. I waited for 12 hours to be seen to by a doctor, who spoke to me for less than a minute and sent me home.

The trauma from that night was overwhelming. Even writing this post today, it makes me feel emotional.

The upside to this, is after my psychotic breakdown, my parents decided it was time for us to get a dog.

They had read articles on studies that suggested spending time with animals and touching them, reduced the symptoms of PTSD.

We finally got our dog, Seannaí, a week after my breakdown. Seannaí, has been the biggest blessing we have ever received.
Every morning, I smile when I get to see her face. She brings such joy for me and my family.

I can not thank my parents enough for allowing Seannaí into our lives.

This aim of this page is to share my recovery journey, to help you on yours.

And honestly, I cannot exaggerate enough how important Seannaí has been within my psychosis recovery.

Dogs and all other animals are a blessing in this world.

I hope this encourages you to get outside. Look around you. Admire the animals, the birds, and the bees. Be present when sitting in their presence.
Every animal has its own beauty, and so do you, you beautiful being😘

4290,ShinyBucket85,1622498726,1,"Hello, this is my first post on reddit and it might be a mess as I want to write so many things but I will try to concentrate on most important ones. 

I am 35 years old guy, born and raised in Lithuania. My father was an alcoholic and I had a chance to experience alot of bad things from early childhood. Most traumatic one I remember was when I was 2. My mother, me and my father were at friends house celebrating someones birthday, my mom had to leave early and left me with dad. He was supposed to take care of me and bring me back home safe as he promised to my mom not to drink. Unfortunately dad got completely drunk and still decided to drive. It was cold winter night with a lot of snow and he drove the car into a ditch in the middle of nowhere surrounded by snowy fields, switched off the car, opened his door and left. I was sitting on the back seat and my only thoughts were ""why is this happening, why am I alone, is this how I'm going to die?"". I was in warm winter clothes, but every minute passing by I felt how it's getting colder and colder inside the car and my face and hands were getting cold. Eventually it became freezing inside and I fell asleep. After some time I was woken up by police officer and he took me to his warm car. I thought that I have died and Angel came to take me. 

I know I should not remember anything from such early childhood, but even now I sometimes have nightmares of same story repeating itself in perfect details, I still remember everything like it happened a year ago.

When I grew up to 18 years old, my mother filed a divorce pappers and he left our flat. Since that day I never spoke with him, only once when he called me on my 26th bday but I had nothing to say to him. After he left, my tiny family became even smaller, just me, my mom and my grandmother. We were not rich, but we had everything we needed.

6 years ago I moved to London as I wanted to save some money and I had some friends here to help me out with work. That's where I met my turkish love. I was in many relationships before but I have never felt love to anyone. Until I met her, my love Perihan... She was perfect, she always supported me emotionally and I was more than sure that she's the one. I imagined how beautiful hour children will be(I'm blue eyed blond and she's curly dark hair, brown eyed). But long story short she had to move back to Turkey due to her visa issues and we decided to stay in distant relationship. Eventually she said that she doesn't want children and would like to seek her career goals and that she doesn't want to waste my time and anymore and that I should find other girl.

That's when I started closing myself from everything... I deleted all social media, I stopped texting my friends and I started smoking weed. Weed helped me to stay emotionally unavailable(not to want to remember distant or recent past) and all I did was work, weed and gaming. None of my friends asked me how do I feel after break up or how am I doing at all. They all dissapeared and no one seemed to care about me only my mom calling me every few weeks, but I never told her how I am feeling emotionally. I was alone in a foreign country surrounded by concrete jungle. And I still am here at the same position after one and half year. Alone, all by myself. 

Just two months ago I decided to quit weed and go back home to Lithuania for good as I saved enough money for my own flat. Next week I will be flying home and today I was packing all my stuff. Some items I took out from the closet reminded me of my old times with my love and friends and I started crying, I'm crying even writing this post surrounded by boxes. I feel like I wasted so much time I'm 35 and I have no one just my mom and grandma(who will always be my most important people). 

I had many  thoughts about ending it all(suicide). But I love my mother and grandma too much and I know that they would not survive emotionally without me so I try to be strong all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask people of reddit for advice on how to start the life from zero again and leave the past behind. How to love someone again, how to meet new real friends...?

I reach for the smallest bits of hope in the days. 
When can I just genuinely be happy.

I wake from bad dreams about not being good  enough for people.
I’ve woke up crying so overcome with emotion.
I stay up all night sometimes unable to sleep.
Sometimes I cry, curled up.

They’re not. It’s all still the same. Nothing fills the empty voids. 
I have been empathetic for those sad, I’ve been unempathetic As well.
I wanted those that I showed my human kindness to feel the understanding I felt for them.
They didn’t because I am alone. I just wanted friendship and love and someone I could be funny, crazy, serious, and non judging with.
That doesn’t exist. 
I wanted every fight of every growth to mean something one day. 
It doesn’t.
I wanted to share all of it with someone. I’m not.
What happened to the optimistic person I use to be? Maybe that person wasn’t ever there. 
I made it up. Trying to be Happy and attract people happy and fun. 
I don’t have a best friend. I want one. 
I wanted a spouse that didn’t hurt me. I don’t. 
The hardest part about leaving an abusive person is getting hurt again. I have. 
How can I fix it? How can I just feel whole again? What does feeling whole feel like? 
I think I’ve always been dependent on others and in relationships they were someone to help decide things for me/with me. I value that.
I tried writing out the hurts, Expressing, forgiving, Praying, and sometimes just sometimes I reach out to someone. It doesn’t ever feel satisfying. What else can I try?

4311,BabisAllos,1622492410,1,"A couple of years ago my father passed quite unexpectedly. He was the kind of guy I looked up to and the only person that I knew was genuinely proud of my achievements and deeply interested in the next steps of my personal and professional life. 

My mother is a wonderful creature but she is not really the person to talk about details e.g at work etc. My father was just more like me. He paid attention to details, he was calculating steps and thinking of things more logically. It was a different connection and while I’m happier to have my mother around than the other way around, a part of me disappeared with him. 

My motivation at work vanished. I’ve had sort of a successful career when I restarted my career at 23 following some family economic difficulties. My father was really depressed for some years and I could see that my achievements gave him so much comfort and pleasure that it was really my main motivation to keep pushing forward. Since he passed, I have just lost my motivation. I know there is no other person that has been happy for me. No friend or family that makes me ever feel comfortable about talking about good news. Every time I have some good news to share with others I’ve found myself either staying silent or grouping good news together with some bad news. 

I miss my father for many other reasons. Here I'm just sharing the main one. the one that has mostly affected my every day attitude.

4315,mindgoesbrrr,1622491575,1,"Well, here I am again. I was pretty optimistic for quite a while, but that is the problem with optimism and expectations: In the end, it hurts even more if nothing changes. And that's exactly what happened: Nothing changed. 

My last post here was a really positive post, where I told the unbelieveable story that I cuddled with a good friend. Wow, WHAT an achievement at 26 years of age /s.   
I really thought I was over my insecurities and that things are developing positively, that I would get some opportunities and that I don't have to think about this whole loneliness stuff anymore that takes so much of my energy away. That I finally could focus on all the other important things in my live without that little voice in my head that tells me ""Yeah great, but don't forget that you're still lonely"" and ruins every good moment. 

And boy, did I try. I started to work out, I downloaded a few of these online dating apps that I always hated before, and I changed my mindset a lot. My motto was: ""Expect nothing, be open for everything."" That really worked for some time! But after a while, I realized that you can't live without expectations. It just doesn't work to shrugg it off when you realize that someone you like a lot doesn't have the same feelings for you. You can learn to handle it a little bit better, but that's it. 

I also started therapy and got medicated, because I was at a point where I really didn't know how to go on. It was a good decision. But there's no medicine in this world that will fix the urge of being wanted, the urge to be special to someone. And the therapist told me I have to be paitent and focus on myself, and yeah, she's right. But all these little tips and tricks can't make the things I want from the bottom of my heart go away. 

And I really can't blame anyone for my situation.   
I can't blame others for not liking me the same way I like them.   
And I can't blame myself for not trying, because I did.   
I can't blame destiny because I don't believe in destiny.   
And I can't blame society because for most people, it works out.   
I can't blame my appearence because I like how I look.   
And I can't blame my character because I like who I am. 

So what's left is a really painful feeling, a feeling of powerlessness, of regret that I can't experience some of the most wonderful things in life. Although I firmly believe that I deserve it.

I've been at this place before in 2017, but this time it's harder for some reason. I just can't move ahead. My design career isn't picking up, everyone inquires and leaves, this is ruining my confidence on my work.

I did meet some people on the internet but they generally don't open up and I understand I'm a burden to them. Afterall who would like to talk to an emotionally unstable loser ? All I do in a day is draw, watch movies and sleep. I don't like this.

Nobody seems to reciprocate well with me even though I initiate convos, it's all getting to my head. I don't want to be alone. I need a friend to talk to, for years on. Not just a one on one convo. 

I envy people who have a stable life and here I do everything alone, even visit restaurants alone on birthday cause no one else cares, feels like a decade anybody wished me either.

4320,hornboggler,1622489140,1,"Hi all. I just want to put this thought out there (here) in case anyone is receptive to it and might find it helpful.   


I'm a 30-something, I've worked from home for more than 10 years, alone, and been single for over 5. I didn't finish college, and have generally fallen out of socializing circles the past few years (especially with the pandemic). I have struggled for a long time with loneliness, and have gotten good at reframing being alone as not lonely, but still felt unhappy about it. I thought maybe this was as good as it gets for people who are alone -- just kinda lonely, but with the right attitude about it.  


I just wanted to write to say that it's really not as good as it gets. In case anyone is in a similar boat -- objectively isolated somewhat more than others, and somewhat used to it -- I want to say it's worth putting even more stock in the perspectives and inner conversation that reframe being alone as not just neutral, but really positive and potentially just as fulfilling and joyful as being with friends, partners, etc.  


Over the past few weeks I've gained a new perspective on how loneliness creeps into my own thoughts, tracing it back even earlier than I understood before (by early I don't mean having to do with more of my back story, I won't subject you to that!) I have started challenging the lonely thoughts before I even recognize them as lonely thoughts.  


For instance, I often think about what other people are doing while I'm alone. Until recently, I still bought into the idea that other people were really, on average, out having a better time than me. I imagined that people in partnerships were ""in on"" a level of happiness I couldn't imagine on my own. Or that people with marriages and babies are even more blissful than that!  


I used to be skeptical of any good news, so when I would challenge these thoughts, I wouldn't really buy it. I would be able to put those thoughts away, but the last word on the matter in my own head was along the lines of ""forget about those happy bastards."" I'm now practicing skipping past that half-measure and landing straight on ""they're really not any happier than you!"" and by truly thinking it, without underlying skepticism or double-think, etc., I feel the truth in those words, and feel a lot better. Even if someone were to argue that other people really are happier, I would try to find out more about that person arguing, and I bet I would find some negative assumptions behind the argument that are untrue.  


I don't have proof to offer, but I think that when you change your perspective, you realize you don't need proof. Whenever I am able to give a full counterargument to these lonely thoughts, I realize it's obvious that I have no reason to feel bad about being alone. It is not a reflection of my flaws, it is merely the road my life took, in a huge universe with uncountable influences at every moment, and countless other players in the 30-year-drama I have lived, each player the protagonist of their own life story, in which I'm sure they deal with loneliness or other forms of grief and confusion.  


In (kinda) conclusion, I just want to say: please give yourself permission to truly believe the good news about yourself and your life. You have every reason to be happy, to laugh, and to esteem your own time and your own self just as much as the wealthiest, most attractive, witty, intelligent person in the world. Who's to say who that even is?

4327,FilthRefined,1622486419,2,"Title says it all I think. I am painfully alone, I have been alone throughout most of my life. Despite being an introvert, especially in the pandemic it hit me even harder than usual. At some point we all need basic interaction with other humans. Why do I have to be deprived of it? Has God/higher being, if any exists, condemned me for it? And hence should I accept this condition? Or should I blame it on my own flaws, on being distrustful and fearful of everything?  

&amp;#x200B;

I think nobody cares whether I live or I vanish (no, I am not using the verb ""die""). Nobody cares for me. It has always been that way and it will not change. Nobody will want to simply chat or perhaps discuss something meaningful with me. Intellectual development is something I am striving for; how do I achieve it wholly on my own however? I am drowning in the mire of misery; how can I think about improving myself if I don't want to live anymore? As there is nobody worth living for; deprived of rudiments, I have no strength to pursue my dreams.

What happened was me and my family were working on my dad’s topsoil company up by seattle, where I used to live. As I was shoveling the topsoil mound, a girl that I had known in my dream started DMing me a bunch of shitty memes and we started talking about a bunch of random things. Eventually she asked if I was available to hang out with her at the coffee shop about a mile from my old house near the puget sound. I wanted to say yes, but then I woke up returning to the loner that I am.

The best part was that I never had any doubts about myself and never worried about how I looked or sounded in front of her. I also didn’t have any of my big trauma from middle school, when I was bullied a ton and never had any friends. I had a girl who actually cared about me and knew that there was a wonderful person in me once she got to know me. Covid wasn’t a thing either and everybody started to find the truth that having friends is indeed the most cherished thing in the world, hell, a survival strategy.

I lost all my friends that go to my school for the most stupid reasons ever. I’m not a very religious person and don’t like talking about religion. Now i would under stand if they weren’t talking about Christianity and the Christian church( if they talked about another religion that isn’t their own and was discriminated against I can see why they would talk about that) but they talked about it during the only time we had freedom at school. They all kept talking about people who go to their church that are getting married. I was fed up with how they where treating me(I’ll talk about the one who makes me want to die). She gave me mean looks if I talked to her even if I was being nice (or not making jokes that good close friends make that would seem mean to other people) and would ignore me. When they all kept talking about straight people or how they would take there kid to church even if the child was gay. I said “I like going on to r/arethestraightsok” and lets just call her Peg(not her real name) Peg said “ok and?” I was pissed because I’ve had enough of her “Well you guys are talking about stupid crap why can’t I “ anyways I know I could have said something more calm or nice but I didn’t say it in a harsh or mean way I sounded sad when I said it lol. I do respect people’s beliefs but sometimes you need to chill if you understand? So when I get home from school I thought everything was fine because me and Peg had to do something together in class. So I texted a group chat that had Peg and Bella (just gonna call the other one that) I asked if they where doing any thing, peg said yeah. I was like oh ok and then she sends like 3 long texts in that group chat saying how I was an awful person for not being Christian and not wanting to talk about it during free time and all this other mean shit. Peg then said “sorry if that was harsh”.  She also mentioned Bella in it saying that Bella felt the same as she did. Keep in mind Bella isn’t saying anything in the group chat. So after wanting to die for an hour after that I text Bella if what Peg said was true. Bella only said things that I stopped doing along time ago. Then I get a text from Peg Peter saying on of the reasons she hates me is because I always tell Bella everything. Sorry but she was the one who mentioned her in the mean texts and said the mean texted in a group chat. Anyways peg had a yt channel and she posted a video with a drawing of me(I don’t look like the drawing anymore) and used the wrong pronouns for me even though she was one of the first people I told. I asked her to take it down in a Pinterest dm and well. In that dm I asked if she could take it down, she responds in a very confusing way so I try to explain it again and she responds with “I don’t care.” And some other stuff. I don’t like the felling of my “face” on the internet and it makes me anxious. So what I got from “idc” was, I’m not aloud to be anxious but she can have self diagnosed anxiety and other self diagnosed mental health. She can get anxious from there being a curfew for my state when her whole family is at her home but I can’t be when my father has to drive trough the city that riots might be happening and he has to go to work before the curfew is over. So ig all my felling aren’t valid.

Don’t worry I’m not all alone I still have one friend but they don’t live near me. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense (my phone is really laggy rn)",lonely,I’m all alone,2021-06-01 02:00:19

4342,WestCoast232,1622474969,1,"I posted this same thread a few days ago and I was so pleased with everyone reaching out. As always just wanted to say I’m here for anyone who may need to talk or make a friend. 

A few weeks ago a friendship subreddit really helped me get through something hard in my life. As a result I finally feel like I’m back to myself. Whatever you’re going through I’m here to help. Message me to talk, vent, make a friend or tell a story..I’m all ears and I’d love to help no matter what. Absolutely zero judgmental thoughts, and it will most definitely stay between us. Feel free to DM me and I hope you have a great day!",lonely,28/M Here to Help Anyone and Everyone,2021-06-01 01:29:29
4343,thanksforhavingme,1622474458,2,"I realized that I am running away from a powerful and desperate feeling of loneliness that is unending. The reason I listen to podcast and videos in the background of every second of my life is because I need to feel like there is someone there with me. If someone offers to spend time with me, I need to drop anything in order to quell that feeling. But it doesn't go away. It's still there.

I think about this quote from Bo Burnham. ""You never used to feel lonely at home. You were just at home."" I now feel eternally lonely and I have no idea how to quell it. I've realized I definitely need to stop listening to podcasts and videos when I'm walking or doing something else. I feel like I need to be comfortable with just who I am. My brain feels like it's on fire, though.",lonely,I am running from a feeling.,2021-06-01 01:20:58
4344,ohhfudgee,1622473016,1,"It just feels terrible. Also having people around you but to feel like you are left out in the group and to feel so alone. I just feel like ever since me and my fiancée broke up. My anxiety spiked, every night feeling restless. It’s been slightly over a year already and yet I feel so empty. I use to cry everyday since, but now I feel like I cry once and awhile because I feel so alone. Sometimes I feel like I deserve all of this from decisions I’ve made in life. I constantly beat myself up over my past actions. I acted immature and I eventually even started to drink heavy every night. Those nights I drank unfortunately became the only way I was able to sleep, but now I only drink once a week. Now I know I messed everything up with a good woman, who was by my side everyday through everything when I decided to just walk away.. but soon eventually meeting someone who would later I would be engaged to. For her to eventually leave me to go back to her ex. I guess it’s my karma. I feel like this has ruined many of my friendships, and I feel like no one would ever like to be with me after they knew what kind of decisions I’ve made in the past. People would just assume I could just leave them to and I do understand that. I feel like I’m never going to be better.",lonely,Lost joy in what once brought it,2021-06-01 00:56:56
4345,just00curious,1622472342,1,"I broke up with my girlfriend today and I have no one I could talk to about it. We originally met on Tinder and our relationship has been going on for eight months now. I know that breaking up was the right thing to do because I felt that we were too different from one another and that our relationship has become somewhat toxic. She doesn't think so. I think she loves me and I don't want to hurt her, but I KNOW that she is not the one and that our relationship won't make it very long. I know that she's  heartbroken right now, which hurts me too and makes me feel guilty and like I'm an evil piece of shit, but I can't go and comfort her because then we will only get back together like the last time I tried to break up.
I'm not leaving her for someone else. I'm just going to be on my own again from now on. I don't really have friends or family that I could talk to about this, which makes me feel even more lonely than I normally feel. My friends/family are just too distant from me, I can't just come up with a topic like that. So I will have to pretend that everything's alright and get my daily tasks done while dealing with all of this shit inside my head. Feels like walking right through a dark storm all on my own. Hope I get to see the light again one day.

I know this doesn't seem like something really bad, but it is really getting to me right now and I have to let it out.",lonely,Breakup and no one to talk to,2021-06-01 00:45:42
4346,aliam4hs,1622472316,2,"Pretty self-explanatory but I genuinely feel terrified of being vulnerable. I feel like if I show others who I really am, they won't like me and so I feel like I'm always supposed to be an acceptable version of myself or a more amplified version where I'm always nice, always positive, always friendly, always sweet. It feels lonely. I feel like I won't ever find someone who genuinely sees me for who I am, but at the end of the day, I'm self-sabotaging because I'm the one doing this to myself (not being vulnerable).",lonely,Scared to be vulnerable,2021-06-01 00:45:16
4347,notaldwin,1622471714,2,"I just don’t get it. I feel like a lot of people say they don’t have any friends these days, but don’t really mean it, and they actually are surrounded by people that they hang out with every day of their life (I promise I’m not trying to dismiss anyone’s pain). But I mean this seriously, I have no friends, and it’s so lonely.

I live in the US and just graduated high school. I was so excited to be done. After graduation, I thought to myself, “this is so awesome, let’s celebrate this with some friends and go somewhere” (to eat or something), only to realize I have nobody. Even if I asked anyone they all have plans with each other, and I wasn’t invited to anything. I’m just so tired and I know this sounds like such a first-world problem, but it really hurts. It hurts a lot.

That’s it thanks",lonely,Why can’t I just have friends that stay,2021-06-01 00:35:14

4350,Dismal_Orchid555,1622469974,1,Yeah this is just a silly project I’m going to try out. I’ve anyways barely been in contact with any of the people I know in my life aside from my immediate family. Currently I’m tender with the pain of isolation. But I’m going to actively try to dissolve in myself in isolation over the next few weeks. I want to see if it’s possible to change my negative outlook on loneliness and if it’s possible to do a 180 flip and actively embrace it.,lonely,30 days of not talking to anyone,2021-06-01 00:06:14
