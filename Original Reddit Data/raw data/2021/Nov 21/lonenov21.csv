5,Infamous_One_3240,1638271930,1,"Is there such a thing as toxic masculinity? I bring it up because i was recently accused of being so and I've come to realize that it may be the root of all my problems...

I don't open up to anyone I haven't known for a significant amount of time and outright refuse to accept help from other unless I'm in dire need. I close myself off to literally everyone and as a result have never been in a committed relationship and have nobody I can truly call a friend.

My OP was in response to getting a hug for the first time in literal years from one person that I completely forgot about until a few weeks ago...and I just want to say how good it felt. Embracing another human being and actually feeling a sense of security is one of the best things I never knew I was missing.  It makes me want to cry that I can't do that every day like others can. I talked to her about it and she said all my problems could be solved if I found a SO but knowing me and my current schedule theres no way I'd have time to treat another person like a SO should...hell I'm working at 2:30am on a Tuesday it would be like having a pet that you only see at the very end of the day

But all that being said I'm not willing to change...I hate myself for it but I'm putting myself through school and making enough to sustain myself for now so on the outside I don't see a problem. But deep down I just want to be wanted...I'm tired of starting all the conversations with those I call my friends and stringing them along just so I don't have to face how lonely I have become. I lust for someone to be there for me...to have my back and support me more than just saying ""you can do it"" every few months just to make sure I don't kill myself. Looking at myself I don't see the man I wanted to be, instead I see a lonely, selfish POS who is too afraid to talk to anyone but some internet stranger in fear of getting hurt.

I've favored the idea of putting all my feelings in a bottle and stuffing it way down inside myself because 'men don't express feelings'. Because I see expressing myself as a sign of weakness and therefore put off this emotionless vibe that fundamentally works but leaves me wanting more, wanting someone to notice me...

I thought about the idea of therapy but immediately declined the opportunity because 'men don't need help' and I just find myself going in circles...I want to change but the concept of masculinity was drilled into my head as a kid and I just can't...and after seeing some of the other posts on here about people with real problems I bring myself to overshadow them...I'm forcing myself to write this because I want help, I want someone to talk to that might not be able to relate but can at least understand. I hate myself for thinking that I can make it alone is going to prove anything.

But maybe I'm wrong...I have some family nearby that I talk to on a semi weekly basis. I mean I'm not failing any classes and my job is more relevant to my degree than anything else in the area. Going at the pace I am now ill have a nice car payed off by my birthday and can start saving for property or a house down the line... but what's the point of all that if there's nobody to share those things with. I want to vacation out west sometime soon but what's the point if I can't enjoy it with someone else? I have these back and fourth arguments in my head between 'I'm ok' and 'I'm not ok' but just end up crying myself to sleep every now and then when additional stresses come into play.

My husband is sleeping next to me and I’ve never felt so lonely in my entire life. The past 6 weeks we’re having issues and he said it’s best for us to separate.

This summer I moved across the world for him. I have no family or friends here. And he was my best friend and I still love him deeply.

We barely talk. He’s working a lot. When he’s not, he’d rather walk the dog and be at peace on his own.

I am so lonely I cried to my esthetician the other day. I cry now. There are days I cry for hours.

Meanwhile I’m searching for a job and feel like a fucking failure. My confidence is all gone.

I have no car so I can’t really move around a lot. I bike sometimes (force myself). Yesterday I went to the beach after 5 weeks and I hated how everyone was with friends and family having good times and I’m this freaking alone weirdo.

Even when I go to the supermarket I use only self-check out because I don’t want to talk to people. Actually I’ve been avoiding everyone I care for because I can’t tell them what’s going on and I don’t have the energy to pretend everything is ok.

Before this happened we were trying for a baby. I’ve wanted kids for years. Now I’ll probably never have one because the thought of someone else touching me makes me vomit.

If we separate I’d probably isolate myself in some god forsaken village… 

And to think I was this girl full of life… I have been through so much (father disappeared for 9 months only to be found murdered in a lake) and pulled myself and my family through it all with a head held high… 

But when it comes to him I don’t have that strength to move on. I know I’ll never feel full again, even if I was to win a lottery…

20,Cookiecuttermaxy,1638259919,1,"Maybe just me, but as someone who's not in an urge to compete in the rat race of society I thing this has given me a different perspective on this totally, ok so yes to some extent I still want to pursuit a healthy relationship with a woman, I really do. Marriage is a different question altogether, but a nice, healthy, compromising, but definitely workable, relationship with a female partner is still one of my life goals. Problem is, both genders do get the short end of the stick in the modern dating scene


But I think the problem relies on this: People today want instant gratification and the path of least resistance, and relationships are not immune from this. Most relationships now are focused on being hedonistic and not really practical or realistic, everyone has high ridiculous expectations. So I think then this makes relationships turn a blind eye and become unfulfilling, boring and de-stimulating for a lot of people in the long run. Hook up culture also plays a part, but it is a distinct discussion altogether. So now not only are relationships lasting less, I would argue it has become more of an all or nothing type of situation rather than one with any kind of probablity. People expect so much out of relationships they instead become a liability rather than a rite of passage in someone's life. Also, nothing really executes their loyalty in a relationship anymore. Everyone's always looking for a higher up, both genders included. And last but not least, nobody wants to be themselves in a relationship anymore. Everyone seems to want to be someone they're not, this creates an image of depersonalization for the other party and makes them think you lack self assurance.",lonely,"Relationships look so boring, and unfulfilling nowadays",2021-11-30 19:11:59

28,jet-why,1638255535,1,"(((Ridiculously long post/vent?))) Im 22, and I’ve been in a lot of long term romantic relationships. I always try to reach out to people to try and make friends after the relationship I’m in breaks down, but it never feels the same. 

The last major friend group I interacted with went separate ways when i was around 15, and since then i am so uncomfortable around people who want to be my friend, even more so if they are affectionate. 
I don’t know how to have platonic relationships anymore, I actively avoid seeing people that I’m DYING to be around, I feel like I am not a complete human unless I am being loved romantically. I can’t function alone, I’m always the last person standing in a relationship because I am so willing to settle for anyone that will stick around. 

It’s been about a month since the most recent breakup (pathetic lmfao), and each time it happens my heart goes through hell. I hate myself. I want to love so badly and I wish I could give it to myself but god I fucking hate myself. I let my guard down again, my mind told me this would happen, but I was too infatuated to care. Dopamine go brrrrr

I think I am so unlikeable that anyone that tries to get close is trying to hurt me or sleep with me (or both xd), friendship seems impossible. I can’t stop myself from shutting myself away, the anxiety around platonically hanging out with someone makes choosing to stay alone the easiest option.

I’m trying to change. If I don’t get better I am going to kill myself, I had some stupid “I need help” attempts when I was younger but this time it feels real. The acceptance is happening, I can feel myself slipping and I’m desperate to hang on. 

I am so lonely. I live in constant fear of friendship but I still dream about the sleepovers I missed out on as a kid. I dream about dressing up for halloween with a group of friends, and having people take photos of me because they want to remember me. I don’t think it’s too late, my mom always tells me I’ll find my people one day and it’ll click. I really hope I’ll have it one day.

I didnt mean for this to go on for so long, but this is something I don’t ever get to talk about, and theres a lot of thoughts in my head about it. 6:50am, finally calmed down enough to sleep i think.

Which makes my grief all the more pathetic.
I’m tormented every night with thoughts of my children, so far away.
It’s impossible to not deliberate over how much I am missing them, it is quickly creasing my face.
I’m told over and over I must focus on me, “get better” or “get stable” so I can see them again.
But when I’m told this I can’t help but think that not much consideration is paid to how difficult this is to do when I’m unable to even be near them.

Video calling is how I interact with my young daughters.
While it is nice to be able to see their faces, at the end of each call I am left dejected and my day is over as that was the high point.

My whole life everything has been a struggle. I’m not a moron by any means but I have always had difficulty navigating, managing my time, my money, and my responsibilities.

It’s been a decent convo the first day then just quiet. Why can’t they just tell me they aren’t interested. Just reinforces the feeling of being unwanted. My best friend moved across the country. I talk to her occasionally but she is busy and has a family. I just go to work which I hate but it’s pretty good money. I want to quit but I have no degree. I joined the military, never really connected to anyone and got out and work for the military as a civilian. I want to go to school. Just have no drive and part of me just wants to disappear. I’m 27 and never had a girlfriend, my parents were great, raised me well but didn’t show affection the way I think I needed and it just sucks. Still not getting it and I live alone. I do have a lizard 2 snakes and a bunch of fish but the feeling isn’t there. I just want to be loved, held, cuddle but all I got is a empty bed. My headspace is just getting worse. I feel like I’ll never find the one. I’m very introvert, I don’t go out much, dating site obviously doesn’t work. No one is gonna miss me. I’ve impacted no one. If I pack up and just disappear nothings gonna change. Pretty much every friend I’ve made has left at some point.

It's so lame and cliché to say ""oh no one understands me,"" but it sure as hell feels that way. I don't feel understood. I don't feel cared about. It's not anyone's fault that I feel like that. 

Well, I guess a part of me is still wounded by losing my old friend group. It's been difficult to build friendships and trust again. Growing up, I had a new best friend every year. They all just moved away and of course, I kept I touch the best I could. Though, you can't replace real quality time with someone. The kind where you're sitting on the floor of a desolate JC Penny, using sanitizer to clean earrings you just bought from Spencer's, and laughing about whatever dumb joke that was said. God, I miss her so much. 

And those little things out of my control. I know I can't do anything to stop someone from moving, hell, my senior friends won't be with me next year. I've had to constantly adapt, adapt, adapt that I've never just had a rock. She was my friend of 5 years. I went to every birthday party, she was the only one I'd spend my birthdays with. We used to walk home together everyday and I still remember how she said we should take selfies every time we'd get to the corner and it was her house right there. I wish we took more photos. I wish I treasured it more. Losing her, losing them over a misunderstanding, a miscommunication, I wish it never happened and I still had them. Why is life so cruel? I have to adapt once more.

Distance learning sucked so hard. Grades were shit, I was so lonely, and I was stuck in a toxic relationship. It was really a ""if I leave, I will genuinely have no one."" That ends, I join Discord servers to feel things, I meet people who I spend the rest of my break with, and then they fade away with my ever changing life.

So, here, now, the present, I'm taking Japanese because I liked media and the culture. Though, a language is a for communication. If there's no one to communicate with, what's the point? I just can't connect. I've no clue where to speak to Japanese natives and use skill I'm learning. It all boils down to struggling to connect.

48,Impressive_Step_4388,1638247875,1,"I’m a 19M who despite being the one everyone goes to and everyone thinks your amazing and funny still feels lonely on a romantic level. Throughout high school where I had most of my interactions I’ve been in multiple encounters with girls. My first true relationship which almost ruined my life. I’ve been told directly and through my friends how girls have felt about me. If they told me it was after the feelings were present and when other people told me about it the girl stopped feeling that way for whatever reason. 

Why don’t my encounters when trying to begin a new relationship work? Well I’ve been told one answer that still doesn’t sit right with me. It was from a girl that liked me for a while. She said that “your personality is addicting when your in a crowd but when you try to talk to girls one on one you turn into a different person.” Ive always felt I’ve been myself whenever I talk but it just seems like no matter what I try to do or change something messes up the “talking stage” with girls for me.

I’ve always been a romantic like I love love. But sometimes it seems I’m cursed to be addicted to that feeling that I attract the opposite. My friend told me maybe I need to go to different areas and meet people. So I’ll give that a try but I’m not sure how it’ll go. It’s sad to say but whenever a girl is “attracted” to me I kind of don’t care..? Because either I have to carry the convo in the start and they think I’m like crazy over them. Or they don’t get the person they see when I’m with my friends. Which would be true because why would I treat a girl I just met like a guy I’ve known for 4+ years you know? 

Anyways any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks for listening

(Also I’m not sure if it comes to attraction because I’ve had the girl’s friends and my own tell me some girl thinks I’m cute and I’m a pretty normal looking guy just a little shorter.5’9 I’ve pretty consistently been rated an 8 by others even though I feel like a 6.5 myself)",lonely,Is it too soon?,2021-11-30 15:51:15

I started college last year and honestly it was extremely hard. My roommate was my only friend there and I really missed my friends back at home. I would cry all the time, and I was so miserable. It's a miracle that I was able to get through that first year. But then I met him. He had posted on the needafriend subreddit and he just seemed like a really interesting guy. So I messaged him and we hit it off right away. Honestly at that point I was only really looking for friends, but about four months after we met I caught feelings and so did he. So he asked me if I was interested in a long distance relationship, and I said yes because I had fallen so deeply in love with him already. Things were honestly great for the first nine months. We had amazing chemistry and I really thought that I would marry him one day.

But then about nine months into the relationship he stared to become very distant and a little cold towards me. Every time I asked him what was wrong or tried to talk about it he would tell me that he was acting like that because he was stressed or that we were okay. So like a complete idiot, I believed him. It went on like that for two months. During that time I was the one that would initiate everything romantic in our relationship. (Like saying I love you or telling him that I loved him more) I literally cried every night for those two months because I felt like he didn't love me anymore and that he felt obligated to tell me that he loved me.

Then one night as I was walking home from a particularly hard ochem midterm, he texted me saying that we needed to talk. I knew immediately that he wanted to break up with me. I literally turned to a friend that I was walking home with and said ""He's going to break up with me I just know it"".  So I raced home and called him on discord. He looked so guilty and that's when I knew for sure what was about to happen. He kept taking deep breathes and saying that he needed a minute and then he said ""As you know, our relationship hasn't been as strong as it was before, and I think it's time for us to consider breaking up or trying to work through our relationship"". I immediately started crying and said ""So basically you want to breakup and you're just trying to be nice about it?"" and he said ""yeah."" My heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest. I couldn't stop thinking that he had fallen out of love with me, and I was the idiot that stayed with him even though it was clear that he didn't love me. A few more words were exchanged after that before I said ""bye"" and hung up. It was definitely one of the hardest things I've been through because I kept blaming myself. I kept trying to figure out what I did wrong to make him not love me anymore.

But after talking to my sister and some friends, I've come to realize that it wasn't my fault and that I did nothing wrong. I gave him unconditional love especially during the two months he was distant with me. I helped him through everything ,for example, I stayed up till 2 am making him a gen chem study sheet because he didn't know any of the material, and he was stressed that he would fail his final (this was also during the time he was being distant) and he used me, gaslit me and lied to me. He literally told me that he ""loved me the most"" after I said that I loved him more the day before he broke up with me. He told me that our relationship was fine/ made excuses whenever I asked him to put more effort into out relationship. This whole thing has left me so heartbroken. (This happened about two weeks ago) I really just feel so stupid for staying in that relationship even through he refused to put effort into it after I asked him to. He also asked me to do things that I was not comfortable with and would keep asking even after I told him I was uncomfortable but I'm still trying to process that.

I'm on OkCupid but the people on there are not really messaging me and I'm a bit picky when it comes to picking the right guy online. Anyways. I don't have any friends in real life and I'm embarrassed to tell my online friends about how I hate being single because they can't help me at all about it besides giving me relationship advice.. I can't find people in real life because I can't go out much and I can't get a job because my parents won't allow me to. 

Out of boredom and feelings of helplessness, I joined this new dating app to find locals in my area and it turns out it costed money for people to read the messages that you send them and what made me quit this app right away was when this old man liked away and favorited me even though he was a couple of years older than my father. How disgusting was that. In his profile it said that he was looking for a slim petite young Asian. Meanwhile I couldn't get rid of him on my page so I randomized my profile by randomizing details about who I am and what I liked, I changed my name to deleted user, changed my email to a dead email, and since I couldn't delete my account I just disabled it.

My point being said here. It sucks being single. It probably sucks being single because you know for a fact that you're not that unattractive looking but you can't get anyone in real life because you're not really out there in the world, even though you don't lack the skills to start being in a relationship with anybody. And for me I just can't find anybody. I don't want to be alone and I want someone to like me for who I am.

Ten months ago I got into another relationship, but this time decided I wasn't just going to be a doormat. This time it was going to be a partnership. And that's what it is. He cares about me. My family loves him. I love him. But I'm not enough.

He's never said it. My parents have never said it. My sisters have never said it. But I know its true. I'm a burden. I've told them this before and they'll care for a day and then give up on the conversation. It's not worth their time. I try to keep it to myself now. But I've found myself crying everyday for the past two months.

Why are dating apps the bleakest shit on earth? The dating landscape has changed so much in the 5 years I've been out. It seems nigh impossible to connect with anyone, and the connections that are made feel hollow and disingenuous. I've made contact with one person through dating apps, and the last contact I had with them was asking them out almost 3 days ago, and nothing since. I wasn't by any means a player or good with getting people to date me in the first place, but now it seems more dire than ever.

Am I meant to be alone? Is this my penance for all my horrible deeds? Am I unlucky? I have so many questions, but no answers. I feel like all I can do is simply just move forward with life, and be happy with who I am and let things come and go as they happen. Still, the loneliness I feel is intense and real and I want it to stop. I have so much outward facing love and affection to give, but it falls into the void. I'm facing upwards at a monolithic structure of sadness that I have to climb, yet I can't take a step forward. My future is shrouded by a deep fog, and I'm scared to step into the abyss before me, all alone. 

I think that in time, all of this will give way to a great clarity that will guide me forward in life. At this moment, however, it's scary to think that I may never make it out. To quote my favorite line from The Haunting of Hill House (I know the book, but I'm quoting the show lol): ""I am home, I thought, and stopped in wonder at the thought. I am home, I am home; now to climb.""

159,nightingale264,1638212531,1,"I think this is not normalized enough. Loneliness is, unfortunately, inevitable. Throughout my experiences and people I have connected with, I believe that no matter who you are, what you have, and where you are in life, loneliness can creep out and fill your head with dark thoughts. The same with depression, anxiety, and being suicidal. I feel like you can be the person who has the most friends and be the richest, yet still be depressed, anxious, lonely, and suicidal. It's not because you don't have someone to talk to, it's because you're uncomfortable and don't want to. It's not something you should be blamed at, because being comfortable exposing your vulnerability is incredibly hard, whoever you are. And I strongly believe in this, just like I strongly believe this is not known enough.

I am here, anonymously, asking all who read this, to not judge people based on their exterior skin because beneath all that they may need help and you may be the perfect person to do it, because you realize it sooner than everyone else, and perhaps, because you understand it better than everyone else. But most importantly, when people are opening up to you (which is already difficult for them to do), don't tell them things like;
""But you have so many friends, how can you be like this?""
""But you have so much money, how can you be unhappy?""

When in comes to mental health, there's no buts. They don't want to be like that, and more often than not, they know and they fully understand that they have more than others, they have so many things to be grateful for, and that there are so so many out there that have less. However, what they need is for us to assist them not just realize it, but to live it. Because these dark thoughts, they're poisonous. And i have seen it myself, those dark thoughts, they creeped into your mind at your most vulnerable moment, without you even realizing it.

So instead of judging them, help them. Instead of talking about them, talk with them. You know they have so many things to live for, make them believe that and live that beliefs. I have seen too many good people succumbed to this dark path, and they never deserved it. No one ever deserve to be left alone, judged, mistreated, when all they want is to be listened to, assisted.

161,AndrewIsBest69,1638210306,1,"3 years ago, after switching schools, I met a guy, for the purpose of this post, I'll call him James.

James was a really cool guy. And we became really good friends, perhaps he became my best friend. The start of the downfall began when I showed him one online multiplayer game.

I discovered this game on YouTube and it was a game with a really small community, so small that pretty much anyone could get to know the developers. After playing it for a few weeks, I said to myself: ""Let's become a part of this"". So I filled in a moderator application form and what do you know - I got accepted.

When James found out, he wanted me to help him with the application too - there was no reason why I shouldn't, so on the lunch break at school, I helped him with it. The game was a bit bigger by now, but not by much and he got accepted as well.

The game started growing rapidly and pretty much only the moderators known the developers and other moderators by now. It was cool to watch it grow and think about how different things were in the early days. Later that day, I got a message from the main developer that I was kicked out from the moderator team for no reason. I've already known by now that this is the end of my friendship with James... and I was right.

We still talked in school and that, but he started meeting with the game devs and other moderators by person and fairly frequently - like twice a week, he went across a third of the country.

I switched schools after 2 years yet again. He was still my best friend for almost a year after leaving that school. But then, I decided to go meet the game developers with him. It went okay, they were actually nice people, however, I urgently needed to leave 1 hour earlier than him due to family reasons and James became so upset, for some absurd reason he ghosted me.

That's how I lost my best friend a few months ago and my life has been shit ever since. And it's completely my fault, if you look again at the begining of this story.",lonely,Best friend lost after 3 years,2021-11-30 05:25:06

In my perception, I'm only chasing moments now. Since I've lost so much people who used to be so important to me, all the times I have spent with them are all haunting me and making me regret that I've spent my life... a significant portion of my days... on making my relationship with them work. To be fair with them though, I know that I had my own shortcomings which made me lost them little by little... Now, I only wish that I should have spent more time with my family. I love my parents so much and theyre getting old everyday. Next year, they will surely be older and... I don't know what life holds for us anymore. I could imagine how much easier my schedule could have been in the past if I just allotted it exclusively to my studies, my family, and some friends. I should have not desired keeping more people in my life, and I should have not even attempted getting into a romantic relationship that was all one-sided and only left me with a broken heart.

I'm not excited for Christmas and the coming New Year... because a lot of pain still and will continue to linger. I don't see anything bright in the future that used to be promised to us.

Not long after that last hug i started to feel down and gained a lot of weight. This was a period i had 0 contact with girls and learned how it felt to be the ‘ew’ kind of guy. But like 2 years ago i started losing weight and lost 75 pounds. I started gaining confidence and tried online dating. This destroyed the great feeling i had. But long story short.. I’m sad because I have the feeling I’m just cursed and will never experience that great feeling of liking each other.

170,No-Leadership-5118,1638207205,1,"Trigger warning: This topic discusses suicide.

At first, it's okay to say you're having these thoughts. It's brave. And people will not generally ghost or slow fade you if you come clean with these thoughts...ONCE.

However, I have an acquaintance I met in a chronic pain subreddit who exchanged numbers with me and has, no lie, expressed suicidal ideation two dozen times in the last year. She has said it 3 times just this month. And I really fucking resent it.

I am somebody dealing with depression, PTSD, addiction, and chronic pain myself. I deal with suicidal thoughts too, but when people ask how I'm doing, if I'm not well I simply dodge the question. I will not burden them over and over.

I am in no position to be somebody's free therapist as I'm dealing with the same condition she is. She has a fucking husband and I'm single with nobody to talk to in person. I've spent countless hours offering ideas and she disregards all of it. She's petrified of getting worse, as am I. But I am risking it and putting my body through torture via multiple surgeries (4 this year)

In that case, all she's doing is dumping on me, and here I am afraid to ghost her or say goodbye because what if that's the tipping point that sends her over the edge? I've never even met this person but can't bring myself to do it. But truth be told I do not want to talk to her anymore.",lonely,Cutting off emotional vampires,2021-11-30 04:33:25
171,No-Leadership-5118,1638206242,1,"32/M. Between the pandemic and some long term health problems I have stuck inside in total isolation for the last 20 months, and really sick for the last year. I live alone.

Naturally I gravitated towards the internet and over time got about a dozen phone numbers. Over time it just became too much. With family and friends that I know in real life checking on me every day or every few days, answering and trying to maintain cyber friendships with a half dozen people I'm unlikely to meet has become more of a chore than anything.

Basically all of them are struggling with my same disability which is very debilitating. One of them has been dumping her suicidal ideation on me for months like it's free therapy (I am not trained to deal with this and it's taking a huge toll on me), one of them I tried to escalate romantically and was rejected but she ""values my friendship so much"" as she goes on dates with other guys and talks about it openly (I'm really not interested in being a woman's daily texting buddy as an early 30's single man. A lot of straight men are not wired like that long term). One of them are the most dry, boring conversations you can imagine that I have no reason why we're still talking.

Many days I just want to hit the reset button and block all of them. I've tried to execute a slow fade but fall back into old patterns and have a long conversation with them. I hate just ghosting people because I'm sitting here believing they'd actually care and be trying to reach me wondering if something happened for months. One of them frantically told me that when I went a few days without replying.

As I make some strides in my disability I can see myself having some social life again this time next year, I want to trim the fat out of my phone to only the people I could call and get dinner with on an hour notice. In some ways I have anchored these people in my mind to this disability and will always be disabled as long as they're there.",lonely,Ever want to hit the reset button and block everyone?,2021-11-30 04:17:22
172,meat_beater_420,1638205271,1,"So for a very long time now, I've had crippling social anxiety and extreme need for validation from people around me. 

It was a disgusting feeling , felt like my own body wouldn't listen to me, eventually I became very apathetic, antisocial and cynical and I lost all motivation  which I believe was my own wierd defence mechanism  also my body does this thing where it jumps into fight or flight when interacting with women.

 It's been like this for almost 4 years now tried all the meditation and workout for years with no result, still yearn for a ""genuine"" friend or a lover but my mind's been warped to suspect that everyone is trying to mess with me so I never formed a bond with anyone  and when girls talk to me despite sounding normal my entire body begins quivering like a scared rabbit  so they stop talking after one or two interactions because of how hard it is to talk to me.

But then yesterday I met this girl in my bus who I see every now and then, she sat next to me and I talked to her for some odd reason, despite the usual body tremors I've never felt so glad to have felt normal, we had quite a lot in common and the conversation felt so genuine and satisfying despite talking about dumb shit I felt so giddy and still feel it even now, been numb for years and I finally understand that I've been missing out on something like this for so long,I felt so motivated I ended up studying the whole day when I normally couldn't even last half an hour ,feel like my life is finally on the right track.

Clearly I'm in love with this girl but I'm scared this won't last what if she thinks I'm wierd and all this ""finally getting on track"" bullshit was nothing but a sick dream that the world designed to laugh at me and my misery , right now I've aldready accepted that it won't last and that it'll be too unusual for me to talk to her again. But I'm glad I experienced something I've not done for so long that I don't even remember how it felt ,this alone is satisfying and I won't mind if she just stops talking to me and none of this works out, this memory alone will be good enough to help through tough times.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I miss having friends. I kinda forgot about that idea and I understand if you don't wanna make it permanent and just wanna talk while you fall asleep or talk when you are bored. I'm here. 

I won't promise you to take your pain away, I won't promise you that it won't hurt. But, I do know that things will get better. I also know that I will be here with you until you get strong and we will go through it together, as friends.

Well, message me if you'd like to talk or if you'd like to make a new friend, if possible even a best friend.

I am expected to be happy and satisfied with the world as of now until I'm thrust into the turbulent vortex of working life and am expected to enjoy my time during youth. Yet I don't feel anything. 

Why must it be this way? I look around at my peers and they seem genuinely happy. They have friends and cars and money and all the luxuries one would expect of a high school student. Meanwhile, I have not fostered a meaningful and genuine relationship in my 17 years of life, have no job, and don't even have a stinking driver's license.  I often ponder whether my boredom with life has something to do with the people and places I'm around or if I myself am simply a boring and uninteresting person. 

Schoolwork is so incredibly boring it drives me to the point of tears, I'm so alone every day I may as well be a ghost, and I don't find joy in almost anything. The only thing I have is playing music and even that effort only gets so far until I stop enjoying it. I have nobody I can share my interest with and spend my time alone.

Then a little over a week later she starts to go dark for several days without even getting a greeting back. Had like one day of better talk before another period of silence and the last thing now said was on thanksgiving and that was only a few messages. Even when we agreed to meet up there was silence on what time though we had already had a place in mind. 
During the long periods of silence I really realized how alone I actually am. I looked forward to all our chats and the stuff I normally did before just felt boring and lonely now.

I just want a friend. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere. Like someone cares about my existence and would worry if I suddenly disappeared or got injured. Like I'm welcome in the city and community that I wake up to each morning and I'm actually present and a part of it.

But as I’m sure many others have noticed too, after you hit 30 you don’t really make new friends anymore. You have the friends you made in school and other social gatherings in your youth and it seems close to impossible to make new ones later so you better make sure you don’t lose them. I’ve recently realized I’m losing mine.

As we all are hitting our 30s, life is getting more serious and busy. People are getting married, having kids, are busy with their jobs which means they’re going to spend the little free time that they have with their significant others. And that’s fine. I’m happy that life has turned so good for my friends, I wish nothing but the best for them all. But as someone who is not living a life like that, I’m starting to feel really lonely since I have no one to talk with these days. Like I said, I’m an introvert and prefer to spend most of my time by myself but I’ve always stayed in touch with my friends. We would talk daily, play games together, go out drinking together. I realize now that even though I am a loner I still need those human connections to balance things out.

TW (suicide)

Hello to whoever is reading this at 3 am. Please consider messaging me because I am bored and wide awake cuz of weed withdrawals and need someone to talk to. Don’t care who, or what (if you’re that damn squirrel who took the rest of my Nutella sandwich while I was using the restroom yesterday I want to have a couple words) you are, just want someone to talk to. Thanks!

So yea. As title says I got kicked out about a week ago out of my parents house. Im 18 and don’t have enough money, or even a job atm (fuck you all grocery stores in America), and I can’t find an apartment to live at, so I’m couchsurfing at my buddie’s house and haven’t had any luck in finding a new job either. 

Recently I was sent to the ER because I OD and had a seizure in the hospital, and was after sent to a psych ward for about a week. They switched my medication and so far it’s actually doing pretty well, and haven’t had any bad side effects from it (lexapro if you’re wondering). Sadly tho even tho I’m doing alright now, even tho I’m in a pretty shitty situation, I can tell in about a month or so I’m gonna be right back in the same shitty place. 

One of the (many) downsides I have right now is that the buddy im staying with has severe depression and anxiety (not a bad thing and I totally understand what he’s going through so don’t come at me), so he’s pretty hard to deal with when he’s in one of his funks. He’s not an asshole at all when he’s in that state, one of the nicest guys I know, but I don’t do good with other depressed people, especially when they’re suicidal.

I also got addicted to nicotine since I got kicked out  and luckily haven’t had any withdrawals since I’ve always had enough, and not looking forward to when I eventually don’t. I don’t even have weed because I used to go over to my buddies house because I don’t have a bong, partially because parents would find it, partially because of the smell it would leave in my house. And now since I don’t have a car I cant do that. I got high last night tho luckily, and that’s one of the reasons I’m having a hard time sleeping is cuz after I smoke my body naturally struggles to fall asleep faster, even after one day of being high because I used to smoke everyday.",lonely,"Need someone to talk to.

Four and twenty years ago
I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like a devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets me so
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman, can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes the sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease",lonely,"4+20 - Crosby, Stills, and Nash",2021-11-29 16:55:33

She always took her anger out on me instead of the person who did so many horrible things to her (from taking her innocence to choking her while threatening to kill her family). She's one of the main reasons why I never want to be in a relationship again. She pretended to love me and constantly say ""I love you"" at so many random times, (She never meant it more than half of the time, I could tell). She used me to try to move on from one her ex's but it didn't work because while we were ""dating"" she admitted to still having feelings for him which hurt. While we were ""dating"" she also said that love wasn't real, so like, why the hell are we dating then? She was such a handful to deal with and I'm glad that she's not in my life anymore; however, she lives in my head rent free. I hate her so much that sometimes I just.. idk, wanna k her. Overthinking turns to overknowing and I now know every reason why she treated me like absolute shit. I wish nothing but the worst for her. She can go ahead and continue to surround herself by toxicity and constantly bash herself for everything, I couldn't care less anymore.

P.S. this was a 16 yrs old(me) and 19 yrs old(her) to 17yr and 20yr friendship/relationship while being long distanced. She's a pedophile.

Not scared of being lonely/alone,
When there's no one here beside,
I'm ok being my own,

The nights are so quiet,
But I'm doing just fine,
Staring Into the fire,
Sipping this glass of wine,

Pick up my guitar,
And I play a sad song,
Try not to think about all that went wrong,

I drink down the last drop,
I'm just trying to be here in dim light,
Only my shadow beside me,
I think I'm a little too drunk,
To be this damned eloquent,
But dig deep enough,
And the words are never spent,

When the morning comes,
All the dark light has shone,
This place is still quite,

I ring the bell, grab my bag and get off at my stop. I see people staring back at me, with awful, twisted up looks on their faces, and groups of teenagers judging me for being alone on the bus on a Friday night with my grocery bags. It doesn’t faze me, I don’t experience emotions, I have Schizoid Personality Disorder, and PTSD, the combination leaves me to sit blankly and stare at people. I haven’t felt lonely in all of my life, but what is it to blend in? Or to not blend in? I’m thirty-one, the only people I talk to regularly is my mental health team, that consists of three people, plus nurses if needed; and then there’s my support worker.

284,AndrewSpMoPr,1638150977,1,"I'm sorry for this post, just needed to vent before going to sleep. So I 24M virgin at that point ordered a prostitute. Never had a serious relationship my whole life. I feel like I was at my lowest point here which is funny considering 3 month ago I actually thought things started to get better. I was hired for a really good job in a big company. I tried Tinder and other apps seriously, I spend time finding and making good photos of myself with smile from different travel adventures, I wrote a positive bio which showed my interests. I got a few matches and tried to make something of it. I always told my intention to find serious relationship, tried to ask questions about girl's bio and photos and obviously tried to set a date. Finally I got a date with a girl which I thought went really well, we walked for 4 hours talking and laughing. This was my first experience of going on a date. At the end I made sure to say that I really enjoyed it (I was) and proposed another date. She said yes, and I was really excited. Second date went well as well in my opinion. She said on the first date that she wants to take it slow, so I didn't push anything and just tried to get to know her. Again, 4 hour talk with laughs and what I thought was interesting conversations. Each date I would make sure to say my intentions and say that I really liked here but without pushing. After second date she went to visit her family in another city. We texted and everything was looking great, the idea of a third date was in the air, and then suddenly she stopped replying or even reading my messages. The last messages was us talking about the city she went and I have no idea if I said something wrong or who knows. I decided to be understandable and wait. But after 2 weeks I finally got that it is over. I respected her decision however hurtful it was and did not bother here. I knew that if she wanted to say something, she had my number. Obviously nothing since. Still don't know why, but hey, learn and  move on, right? Time went by and no luck on tinder, other sites and real life. That incident with online dating, my loneliness and one of close relatives dying pushed me to the point when one day I was near a phone store. I went in and bought a sim card knowing full well why I bought it. I found a prostitute's phone number later that day. It is funny to think that I have no courage to ask someone out in person but can call and arrange a prostitute. Full time my mind was clear, I knew that I will remember it as a first time, I knew that it was a pathetic thing to do, I knew that it would not make me happy. I did it because I wanted to move one with my life and finally be done with at least something. We did it 2 times with talks in-between. Honestly I thought I wouldn't finish the second time, this was the moment when I understood how valuable is emotional connection. Some time went by after that night and honestly I still thing I did the right thing. Pathetic? Yes. But I knew nothing would happen if I didn't do anything and I'm tired of being late my whole life. The thing that still remains is that I have no idea how I can find a relationship or even deserve one. I am working on my self everyday but I feel like I do not have the mindset for this and it doesn't matter how much abs I have, how funny I am or how much books I read. Kind of hard to do something at this point, so I thought sharing this would make it a bit easier. Again I'm sorry for this post.

291,RevolutionaryCar789,1638148729,1,"A few months ago I was feeling pretty damn good about myself. I was coming to terms with the fact that I am a stocky 5 ft 6 in bald headed 30-year-old who likes to stay low-key and isn't lucky in romance. There's something comforting when you accept the limitations of yourself because then I can look at others and say that people aren't as attractive as we make them out to be. Even the finest, thickest woman more than likely has shit caked between her cheeks. I actually practiced semen retention and was trying to focus on my podcasting goals and I noticed that I was getting more attention from the opposite sex. This lasted a good little while up until a few weeks ago. 

The way that my depression normally manifests itself is in stage 1 where I start to become really angry and really pessimistic. I look at everything around me and the people and I decide that everyone is terrible and nothing ultimately matters. When I get like this I don't care about the struggles that other people go through and I definitely don't care about people who I feel are better off than me complaining about their lives. The second stage is the sadness that washes over. This is when I don't care about myself and I almost don't mind walking out into traffic because ultimately a lot of things are paying and this loneliness will never go away. I try to justify it by saying that everything ends and all these achievements and accolades are people work so hard to achieve will not mean anything once they're dead and it definitely won't mean anything in a thousand or so years. The Earth will eventually stop spinning and it will evaporate back into nothingness, so why do anything at all? This doesn't even cover the struggles I have in dating because I feel like so many people have unrealistic expectations of total strangers and they never want to see somebody for who they truly are. It makes me frustrated and just drives me further into anger and bitterness.

Maybe it's the change of the weather, maybe it's the sign of a decaying mind, but I have enough stuff awareness to know that this is not my natural state and that who I am is more than just these moments. But it is tough when you backslide into previous destructive habits. Right now I just wish that someone who truly loved me would let me be vulnerable in their arms and reassure me that my darkest thoughts aren't really me.

I think that's why being lonely is such a highly spread issue, because finding someone who treats you as an equal and just enjoys your presence without second motives is the hardest thing to find, both platonically and romantically. after seeing how shitty humans are to each other and how they only use you for their needs but never give something back, being alone doesn't seem that bad.

Other people make me DEEPLY uncomfortable and I'm aware that that's on ME, not anybody else. 
But I know I can't be the only one going through this, so I was wondering how other people deal with that friction??

Hi. This is my first post on this subreddit, having only just joined after having one of the worst mental health days I've had in a long time, but I just need to vent. I'm perpetually lonely and feel like my love life is on this ticking clock that's going to run out (or already has), and I don't know how to fix it.

I'm currently 20 (almost 21), and am bi, non-binary (they/she pronouns please!) and have two neurodivergencies, whilst struggling with mental illness. To add, I'm also plus size, with hormone issues meaning that I am quite a masculine-bodied person with facial hair etc. In terms of my past dating history, I haven't had a relationship in almost four and a half years, and all of the information that I mentioned above I think contributes to that and makes me feel not only isolated romantically but isolated in my experiences.

It's not my fault, because I am the way that I am, but I personally feel that society only accepts certain types of people/bodies as attractive, and with so many hurdles to overcome, dating is not only unsuccessful (I've been on multiple dates since that relationship) but daunting. I've used dating apps and also met people through mutual friends etc, but if I do get talking to someone they just leave after one or two dates (or after weeks of talking and no meet up) and then nothing comes of it, making me feel more lonely. It's hard to 'get back on the horse' again every time something doesn't work out when it takes so much for me to build myself up to get out there in the first place. With all of my quirks, (and having received comments about, for example my body hair, from past dates) it makes me feel like I am an undesirable mix of qualities of a person and not good enough.

I also understand that I'm quite young still and that I shouldn't need to worry about being in relationships, and instead focus on having fun. I agree with that, and I have a pretty fulfilling life outside of romance, but when things fall apart I wish I had a partner there to prop me up. *(Just to clarify, this is not the reason I want a relationship. I want companionship and to share my life with someone, I believe I have a hell of a lot of love to give. I've been trying to work on myself mentally and emotionally for a while, and I would give them the same support when they're having a rough time. I don't think I'd be the first to say that there's merit in having a partner there to help you when you're down, and that there's certain roles that family/friends/partners each can fill separately).* I live between university and home (mainly university currently) and I'm supported well in both households, but there's only so much friends and family members can do. Two of my housemates are in relationships and their partners live with us, and I love that they have their partners here to support them when they have their down days, but I can't help feeling sad when I can't get the same.

On top of all this, I'm only just starting my journey as a non-binary person, and I don't know if I'd feel comfortable enough to date without transitioning more as I can get quite dysphoric - which I'm afraid would make me uncomfortable with physical affection etc. Not presenting the way that I want to also means I don't feel comfortable in my body, which also affects my confidence and probably my dating success. I'm also struggling a bit with anxiety and depression recently, and I wouldn't want to get in a relationship and then not be able to give my all because of it, when I can just about keep up with my life as it is. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't know where to go from here. I have my down days and my good days, but recently it seems that my days are more down than good. Any changes I feel I need to make for myself would be long term, and I am just generally uncomfortable and lonely. I feel as though the older I get the more I may get used to feeling this way and may never find anyone (even though I really want to) and may end up just believing that that's the way it has to be. If anyone relates, has any words of encouragement or constructive advice, that would be amazing.

It’s funny. I can be emotionally open and honest. People can be emotionally open with me. I do have people I care about. I can ‘tune into their wavelength’ if they are neurodivergent like I am and relate to people. So why have I never felt like I have connected with anybody? 

&amp;nbsp;

Why is it that no matter who I’m with, even if I care about them, there is a glass wall? That every group of people I’ve been in, even with friends or family, I always feel like I’m on the outside looking in?

&amp;nbsp;

Do I simply have unrealistic expectations for friendships? Is it because I’m very introverted and people make me tired? I *can* make friends but I can’t ‘connect’ with them. I don’t know how else to explain it.

I literally feel like I can't talk about it to anyone. If I try and talk to friends, I feel like they've just desensitised themselves to me and parrot back clichés.

I can't talk to my family because they just... don't. understand. The last time I said anything, I was basically accused of being selfish and that I was bringing everyone down.

I don't have specific things that trigger me to feel the way I feel. Sometimes I'm having a relatively good day and then -bang- I have a tension headache, I'm overwhelmingly tired, I'm overthinking every interaction I've had in the day, and if it's a REALLY bad day, then my thoughts often turn... well let's say darker.

All I know right now - is that I'm stuck at work for the next 8 hours, my brain feels like it's in a vice and filled with fog that I can't see past. I don't want to talk to my work colleagues in the next room because they're laughing and joking and having fun and I don't want them to get like second hand sadness from me or some shit.

361,Teri_18,1638118764,1,"A friend of mine came in from another city. We had a mutual friend with a birthday and all she wanted was to do bowling and movies. This was in the calendar for weeks and I was really excited about it because I’d finally get to interact with someone in person. Then the day of, they cancelled the bowling. I was disappointed but I figured maybe we could do dinner or something that involved talking and actually spending time with each other but no one else was feeling the idea so we just went to the movies. I got all dressed up because I haven’t been out in such a long time. I still had hope that maybe afterwards we could head back to my place since it was near, maybe even have a sleepover. So I got there and everyone was already inside as I was late because I had to catch the bus while the rest of them drove. About an hour in I realized that this was exactly what I’d thought it’d be. It was 2 and a half hours of near silence. After the movies we all headed towards the door. That’s when she told me she was leaving the next morning because she had work in the evening. I thought we had more time. I considered asking to join them at where they were staying tonight but I stopped to talk to a mutual acquaintance and by the time I looked up they had all piled in the car and left without even saying goodbye, including the mutual “friends”. My friend from out of town called me from the car saying she just realized she forgot to say bye to me, she’s sorry, and asked how I was getting home. I forgave her because at least I was a thought, even if it was an afterthought. I didn’t feel like waiting for the next bus by myself so I called an Uber. And as I stood there waiting for it I was struggling not to cry. I got in the Uber and for some reason I couldn’t stop the tears from running down my face. I hate to cry and worse in public so part of me is really concerned. When I got home I broke down crying as soon as I got through the door. Here I was all alone again.

377,jesskitten07,1638110176,1,"I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this, maybe someone out there has felt the same or something. Im also sorry if this is long, as I can sometimes be long winded. Ive realised today that socially Ive kinda lost all the progress I had thought I had made. I have never found socialising easy. I am neurodivergent (Dx ADHD and suspected autism) and also have a host of other mental health issues, including a relatively rarer and much less known disorder. On top of all of this I am trans and have a gender non conforming appearance. All of this has gone together I think to often present a person who people i think either dont know how to deal with or dont want to be around.

Over the years I have never exactly been people's choice of friend. Sure I mean I have had friends, often made through circumstance when I was a kid. But as time went on it became more and more obvious who was actually the one engaging the friendships. This only got worse when I transitioned and I lost pretty much every friend I had.

After a car accident that exacerbated everything, and ended up creating a very turbulent period, I no longer could work and found it very difficult to study. On top of this I spent pretty much all of my time staring at the same 4 walls, with not much to do. Eventually, after &gt;!a suicide attempt,!&lt; I got some agency support and some friends who while not there most of the time, if its crisis time they are usually there. With this I was able to start going to a few group things.

What started as 1 then 2 group things, quickly ended up with me playing 11 tabletop roleplaying sessions a week, going to a music group, occasionally going to a pop punk club night, and possibly more I dont remember. Basically anything that aligned with my interests to stave off the loneliness I had felt.

Eventually I would end up meeting the girl who would become my partner. When we started dating I was still doing most of the groups and everything. A few times I did have to stop something because it clashed with something I wanted to do with my partner. She also helped me see that some of the groups I was in were not actually healthy for me, the people in the group being toxic, and that the only reason I stuck with them was because of that loneliness. Never once did she say I needed to stop anything, so yeah I know some people might interpret it as a manipulation but no.

As time went on, I was still with my partner and we were now living together, was still in a couple of the groups, and honestly I thought I had honestly turned everything around. Then the shop run by some friends where one of the groups I played at ran into a lot of issues with my friends leaving their business partner to clean up his messes. Now I had been friends with these people since before they ran the shop. I had join an RPG group that in a way spawned the shop. However once they left the shop I have not once seen them or talked to them without being the one to initiate contact. This is actually a theme. That I am usually the one who has to contact my friends, because if I dont I would literally never hear from them. This can actually be very hard for me because unless I am reminded of them in some way I can loose track of their existence (thanks ADHD), so if someone hasn't sent me a message in a few months there is a very good likelihood that I will never text them again.

However while all this has been going down, including having a friend end up ditching me and my partner causing my partner a good deal of mental stress, I hadn't been feeling the effects of the loneliness so much because my partner was always close by. However recently both mine and my partner's mental health were in a precarious position with both of us having hospital visits (she was in an very low maintenance ward off hospital campus, while I only was in short stay for 2 nights). Part of the reason for my hospital visit was that something my partner had said because of her stuff, ended up triggering me and yeah, Through this we realised just how fragile both of our situations currently were, and so for the moment she has been staying with her mother (as she has a greater SH risk, and it can be a trigger to me) while I stay in our house by myself. It isn't us taking a break from the relationship as we still talk and we do see each other sometimes.

Things have been kinda up and down over the past few weeks since we started this situation. All of them culminating in today. A friend sent me a message asking if I had gone to an annual LGBT festival event, as they had and were wondering if I was there. I told them I wasn't there as I hadn't been aware  it was today (because I have barely left the house the last few weeks I barely know what is going on around me) and even if I had known I didn't have anyone to go with.

It was that last statement that really stuck with me. That I really dont have anyone. Ive tried organising things with people, tried reaching out to people. Over the last few weeks I have tried so much to put in place a social circle but at the end of the day I have nothing to show for it. And so Im back to square 1, staring at the same 4 walls day in day out.

383,barbiedaisy12,1638107889,1,"I’ve never posted on here before… but I need to get this out, even if nobody ever reads it. 

I’m 29. I have two absent parents, a father who is a narcissist and has at least 15 kids with 5 different women and a mother who is a nice woman, but I can only describe as completely emotionally inept and who I genuinely believe doesn’t love me and didn’t connect with me as a baby. I’ve triEd so hard to tell both parents how I feel, but neither change. In general, I don’t get on well with my siblings at all as we all have so much trauma from our childhoods and were pretty much raised hating each other. 

I don’t have this core unconditional love or support system that a family is supposed to provide. I am also single and have been for 4 years now. All of my relationships have been with men who have walked all over me - cheated, stolen, and been emotionally or physically abusive. And I have noticed a terrible pattern with myself in relationships, that I can NEVER break up with them or walk away, no matter how unhappy I am or how toxic it is. Of course, this makes them respect me even less, and eventually they break up with me, leaving me feeling even more abandoned and worthless. 

I have a few separate friends, but no close best friends. I feel like I’m always the side character/ supporting role rather than a main character. I feel like I’m here for everyone but no one is here for me. 

The reason I am writing today is because I feel painfully lonely. I have always felt alone, even as a teenager, and I am sick to death of watching everyone else living happy lives with lovely family’s and healthy relationships and not having that for myself. 

I haven’t been on a date for 4 years because I am petrified of being hurt again, but as time goes on I am so scared of spending the rest of my life alone. I know it may seem unlikely, but my mum and dad spilt when she was in her early 30s and she never dated another man again and will now die alone. I don’t want that to be me. I haven’t even had children yet. 

I can’t convince myself to go on dates because I just can’t imagine why anyone would want to be with me. Deep down, I’m scared that I might be a horrible person. I always attracted men before based on my looks, and I kept them because I’m a door mat who mothers them, cooks, and cleans. I feel like none of my boyfriends loved me for me, they loved how easy I made life for them and what I provided.  I’m not a sexual person and it’s only got worse as I get older, and it feels like this big dark secret that they all eventually find out and then they cheat on me and eventually leave. And the older I get the less attractive I am, so I have even less to offer.

The loneliness is actually physically painful. I can go a full week without talking to any other human other than by text. I try to reach out to friends and tell people who I feel but I suspect they think I’m dramatic, and they can’t understand how hard it really is to be fully alone.

I don’t see a point in life without family and love, but I am scared I will never get these things, and deep down, I’m angry that I don’t have them. I’m bitter. I’m jealous of all of my friends and their parents who love them and their partners who support them. I’m too much of a coward to kill myself, but if I could go to sleep and not wake up I would. If I died, it would take months before anyone noticed because I live alone and I’m self employed. 

I’m very self aware and analytical so I don’t think therapy can give me any answers. And also, therapy won’t make my life any less shit or lonely.",lonely,I feel like I’m drowning in loneliness,2021-11-29 00:58:09

I felt guilty, because I wasn't the best boyfriend at the time, well, to be more specific, the last 6 months of our relationship (the length of our relationship was about 3 years). I got really depressed back then, everything was wrong with me. But I felt like I changed a lot. Like I became a much better person. So I thought, why I'm keeping her blocked? There's no reason. I should start my new love journey by forgiving myself for my past mistakes. I can't have this shit in my head when trying to date someone else, right? And so I unblocked her only on reddit, because I noticed she wasn't very active here. I typed out my feelings and how sorry I was to fuck up what beautiful thing we had together. I was simply hoping that she wouldn't reply, because I was doing this for myself, as a way to move on.

But that was HUGE mistake. Not only she did reply, but she offered to meet up and talk about stuff. At first, I was extremely shocked and scared. What if I still love her? Hm, can't be. Sure, let's meet up, I have nothing to lose, right? Turns out I had SOMETHING to lose.

When we met up, we talked about our lives, how things went after the break up. I was kinda happy to see that she didn't change much. Sure, she started smoking and drinking, but I guess that's what she wants right now. Can't judge. As we talked and joked like good ol' days, I started to realize. Damn. I still have some feelings left for her. Hmmmmmmm, maybe I should ask how she feels about me? UUUUU, turns out she kinda likes me, but she probably won't be able to date me again. At first, I was okay with that. I really need friends, why not have one extra?

We spent whole ass day walking, driving and just talking in my car (weather was pretty shitty). I was kinda unhappy to realize that I still kinda love her, but at this time I thought, that this is nothing. I can still be friends with her and date someone, I will manage, right right. Then I told her that I will be going drinking with my friends. She wanted to join. Sure, why not?

So, we went there, to drink and have some fun time. Everything was going nicely, everyone was having lots of fun playing board and Xbox games. But when my ex gf got drunker and drunker, she became hornier and hornier. My god, she was so fucking sexy. I can't erase that lust in her eyes from my memory. It's something you see extremely rarely. We were getting all lovey dovey, huggy wuggy, we even kissed when we went outside for a smoke. At the time I was drunk, she was too, so I thought nothing about it. I still knew I won't get a second chance, which made me pretty sad, but I thought whatever, I will get over it.

Then it was time to go home. We had enough of fun, it was getting pretty late and we were running low on alcohol. So, she called herself an taxi and it was here in 2 minutes. Sweet, that's fucking quick. Before she got in, she whispered to my ears ""please text me"". Okay, sure. I came back home, texted her goodnight and tried falling asleep.

Wow, would you believe that, IT'S TODAY! And I woke up fucking excited. In my simple mind, I thought that I have A FUCKING CHANCE, HELL YEAH BABY. I mean, why would she be so horny around me? And I couldn't be more fucking wrong. She still only wants me as a friend, bcs I know a ton about her, and so she does about me. This time this convo was happening via text and since I know her pretty well, at some point I remembered that she's most likely to say the truth when texting. I get it, it's much easier that way, you don't need to see someone getting hurt, so you can spill it out. She told that she will, MOST LIKELY, never date me again. And she was only horny because I'm the only one she feels attracted to physically. She couldn't enjoy sex with any of her ex'es after our break up. Yet there's still no chance I could have sex with her, anyways, so I didn't really care about that. I kinda just took it as compliment. And then it hit me.

It hit me SOOOOOO BAD. Only now I realized the magnitude of feelings I had left or gained during that night, while drunk. I realized I can't take it. I can't take seeing her with another man. I still really want her as a friend, but my feelings are too strong. So that won't be happening. I'm not going thru ordeal of emotions just for her. I have to try loving myself, right? So I made a decision. I decided not to text or meet up with her. I simply can't take it, I'd rather have nothing at this point.

But I didn't realize how badly this would hurt. I feel much emptier than I felt when we broke up. Like someone drained my heart, it grew back up and now it was thorn away with force. I want to fucking end my life once again. I actually lack words to express my pain, but maybe someone will get it.

So that's my long-ass story. I hope someone will see this. If you read thru this shit, I hope that it was at least interesting to read. If you are going/went through similar crap, text me. Let's suffer together, lol.

I  feel like shit. I feel like no matter what I do it's wrong. I have so  many wishes and dreams but no motivation to go thru with any of them. I  have no real goal at the end of the day.

All  my friends hate me and talk shit behind my back and I can't figure out  what I've done that's so repulsing. I don't even know if I can call them  friends per se, cuz even tho I've known them for 6+ years, I never get  invited to hang out with them or get invited to their parties. I stopped  being the one texting first a while back and my phone has never been  drier.

The thing is, I feel  trapped. I live a good 20 minutes from the city where I study and where  my friends live. My parents are fucking paranoid and h*ypochondriacs*  now because of covid so I only leave my house to go to school. I  haven't been grocery shopping in forever. I feel closeted. I don't want  this. I'm 16, and most 16-year-olds could very easily live by  themselves. Hell, I know 16-year-old girls who live alone with their  bfs. This ""protection"" my parents insist on is fucking my head right up.  On the rare occasions I actually get invited to a party I have to beg  my parents to let me go. I fucking hate this shit.

I'm  poor as shit. All my life I've had to see other kids dressed in brand  names and cool clothes, while I get hand-me-downs, 5$ tees, and 20$  shoes. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that my parents go out  of their way so I have a roof over my head, clothes on my back, food on  the table. And it's not even their fault that we are poor as dirt, as my  dad got financially fucked by his sister and the situation is really  complicated, but basically, we have to live like peasants because of  her. I hate this. I just want to fit in. I want cool clothes, I want to  be able to brag about family trips and vacations overseas. One of my  classmates is in Dubai right now, while I'm sitting in my boring ass  room scrolling mindlessly.

I'm so  fucking lonely and I just feel like I can't express my emotions  properly. As I read back on this post it looks like I'm some bratty  selfish kid who has 1st world problems. idk.

I  just want a normal life. I want a friend group that isn't inherently  toxic. I want a stable financial situation. I want the emptiness in my  chest to go away. I want my eyes to stop burning.

Not because I was literally alone, no, but having parents who play favorites and add to that being born as a middle child - being ignored and forgotten was the norm and nothing changed much, even now that I'm an adult. 

The years were just slow, further decent to loneliness. Losing a friend one year, two more the next, having one remain but then losing contact again. Each time like a death sentence. I have never made new ones since then. 

Being naturally quiet and an introvert, meeting people was a taxing activity. Pair it with trauma and depression and you have the perfect recipe for being alone, unable to reach out. 

And so I learned to cope alone, to be miserable alone, to laugh alone. To just accept being alone. But there be those days when that deep pit of emptiness inside, like a swirling vacuum, just pulls me in and it gets overwhelmingly painful to even breathe. But then again, I am alone and no one is out to comfort me, nothing helps but to cry and pull myself back together and bury myself in work. Just another day of trying to purge the lonely feeling with exhaustion and ""busyness"". 

And as if being lonely isn't enough, sometimes you get snide comments like ""never trust someone who doesn't have friends"" when it's me who painfully knows firsthand that genuine, true friends for life is an actual rarity to even have, let alone keep.

You see, ever since I was put onto this Earth, I've faced hardship and misery- not to sound too dramatic. My parents split shortly before I was born and in my father's physical place took an abusive asshole who stayed in my life from when I was two years old until I was fourteen. I won't go too deep in his way of abusing me and my family, but if you can maybe guess what happened, it's probably unfortunately correct. In school, I was always picked on and bullied and was the outcast of my class. From elementary school until high school, I've never had more than one or two friends.  And to top it all off, my high school ""sweetheart"" was an abusive asshole the entire time we were together and reopened wounds of past traumas with some of the bad things he did to me..  I've always felt lonely and rejected, ya know? I guess you could say, I'm a pro at it.

Rolling back to this last summer... Like I said I think something in my kinda just gave out and snapped. I broke up with my ex and was hoping that things would be better after that and I would maybe start to feel better too. But as the days went on and they turned into weeks, and months- I have only felt worse. Now it's almost the end of the year and I haven't felt this dark inside and struggled this hard in a long time. 

I wish I had someone to talk to. Someone who would actually respect me and be kind to me. I want friends and I want a relationship that isn't scary and abusive. I wish there was someone who appreciated me and told me nice things, ya know? Because my mind is such a dark place and I always have these thoughts that make me think I'm something awful and ugly and horrible. It would just be nice to have someone there to tell me nice things to contradict the bad things in my head. I want to be validated and accepted. I'm tired of being taken advantage of in some way or a joke to someone else. I'm especially tired of getting my hopes up that maybe things will be different when a new person comes along. But it's always the same. It's hard to trust people. It's hard to even wake up everyday.

419,Ancient-Option3436,1638088341,1,"So I’m a 21 F college student. After being cheated on by my long term boyfriend, I went through a hoe phase for a few months. I talked to/slept with a few guys. I quickly got tired of it, and now I’m at the point where I want to feel lovable. Being desirable is nice, but knowing that someone is capable of loving me is different. 

Some background on my previous serious relationship: he and I dated for two years. We started dating before he went to join the marines. He had poor communication skills and would be highly affectionate whenever we did talk. This made me think he was crazy about me and that he was just busy. No, the entire time he was stringing me and a few other girls along with him. 

After figuring out his lies, my brain started asking questions. Did he mean what he said to me? Did he even like me? Was he just using me? Was I actually deserving of his “love” or was I there for satisfaction?

It’s been almost 2 years since that relationship and I still have the issue of whether or not I am deserving of love. One of the few people I was able to be in a “relationship” with was entirely fake. So it’s made me wonder if I really deserve love or not. 

Within those two years, it’s not that I haven’t tired talking to other guys, but I get rejected. It’s not that I expect that any guy I talk to drop everything for me, but at least seem interested. I keep getting the same “I love your personality, but I don’t see this going anywhere” or “I like what we have, but we need to stop”. It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to think that my only worth is sexual. Like I’m cute enough to sleep with, but not cute enough to date. 

Sex is nice and all, but I’m craving to be with someone. I want to know that I’m capable of being loved. I want to be someone’s someone.

But literally my family is all gone and I just wish I had someone nearby to talk to. I honestly hate my life and I really don't say that lightly. With my struggles with depression and not working and just overall feeling like a failure, I am seriously tempted to just say to hell with this life.

i ask them how they do it and they say to just not worry about it and wait...but they dont get it, they'll never will, they'll never understand how does it feel to be alone while everyone else around you has someone...how does it feel to be in a room full of couples while you're just trying to distract yourself and try to keep youself composed and not seem like you're in the verge of having and emotional breakdown

they wont understand how does it feel to try to be good enough to be loved and cared for...to make someone as happy as they can...to finally get someone that understands you deeply, someone whom you can make plans for the future with and be happy together...they'll never get it

Very social people tend to be mean to others. People get married and take each other for granted. The internet and social media replaced actual socializing. Smart phones get all the attention. Everyone is ignored. People base friendships on how they can benefit from knowing this person or that person. I could go on you see. You just have to throw out any expectations of outcomes and don't mention things like being lonely or alone because everyone is in their own way or at least they feel like something is missing in their life. Without that emphasis and being willing to talk to any stranger you'd be in a different mindset. Be awkward and don't worry about it because the other person prolly wont notice it. Even when someones not actively being your friend, tell yourself that they are your friend. People are complicated so give everyone the same chance and benefit of the doubt.

One of the stupidest decisions ive made is probably asking for help in reddit, asking for help is a good thing but not when most of the people in reddit are failures and normies who are nothing themselves but still try to ""help"" others.


You cannot help others if you cannot help yourself I REPEAT you cannot help others if you cannot help others.
I once found this 44 year old loser in reddit saying ""Sucess only comes to those who are lucky"". Like what the hell am i supposed to do with this information??? Even if it was somehow true i cannot do anything about it,luck comes whenever it wants to. Your saying this to a depressed person,sick of life and your making him feel even worse saying that. That guy probably follows this advice and is now a depressed 44 year old divorced smoker who lies in his bed all day. 


And i hate people who say stuff like "" It will be fine"" Or ""im sure you did great things in life!"" Bitch you know nothing about me,how the hell would you know that it ""all will be fine"" Or ""i did great things"" when the reality could be opposite, being only ""kind"" does not help others, you kindness can only help people for a short run, after that they feel the same way in the long run. I want to rather know the truth which will actually help me as a person in the long run, no matter how bitter it is.


Most of the people on these sub reddits are depressed,anxious,suicidal people trying to help others when they cannot even help themselves! 


My advice is whenever you feel suicidal,depressed,anxious go to a good professional psychiatrist psychologist whatever!


You wanna get motivated? Follow advice of an actual sucessful person in life, the ones who are at the top of their fields.

BUT DO NOT follow advice of the people in these types of sub reddits , your literally playing a gambling game doing this, a person could message you, making you feel better or even worse you dont know, and majority of people who make you feel better are these ""kind"" people which will only help you in the short run but not in the long run. At least with these professionals you have a higher probability of making your life better!
Also, if you want to help others... Learn to help yourself first.


Thats all i wanted to say, i will probably not be replying to comments or dms after making this post,you CAN dm or comment.. your choice.I will most probably leave reddit for good this time.",lonely,"CONTROVERSIAL POST, might get downvoted by egoistic reddittards but i dont care",2021-11-28 14:03:31

You think its the weekend, and its your rare chance to relax and unwind. Friday, Saturday, Sunday- nobody is ever available. So im left to waste the weekend alone just bored out of my mind. And here i am, just sitting in a parking lot for the past few hours just feeling pitiful regarding my situation. This has been the case for almost every weekend without fail. Everyone else can go out and enjoy a friday/Saturday night- however I can’t, and by that i mean I physically CANNOT.

That’s when I am true to my deepest identity, and when I like who I am. But it never seems to last. At times, it has been ruined by the insecurities I’ve now outgrown. Other times, their own situations have changed and I’ve been shuffled to the background of their lives.

476,FabulousTrade,1638063964,1,"It's always said that you should be yourself in order to be accepted but I was never excepted when I WAS myself. For a long time I've been interested in the following things among others:

* Art Nouveau and Art Deco
* Hal Roach comedies
* Vintage comic strips (think 1930s and earlier)

I'm reading ""Tale of Genji"" right now and am always telling people ""it's a classic Japanese story"". I am just as picky when I watch TV. I have no problem with others watching ""The Office"" or ""Game of Thrones"", but I don't, and a lot of shows I liked ended too soon (Like ""Dead Like Me"" or Carnivale""). I have always been an artist, but I hate engaging in ""gallery snob"" nonsense and am willing to say when I don't get the purpose of an art piece. I just know what I like: art nouveau and art deco.  I also don't quite fit in with the comics scene, where it's either alt-comics or superhero comics (I am pretty much a ""Far-side"" girl). I don't even watch the same anime as people around me (They watched DBZ, I watch Revolutionary Girl Utena). I didn't even fit in the self-proclaimed anti-mainstreamers, the hipsters.

I had to pretend to like things I didn't just to be able to socialize. This was a habit that continued on into my adulthood, which has caused me to be seen as ingenuine, but since I've been working on shedding those habits, I'm back to where I was as a kid.

It was lonely growing up and sadly still does. The only people who share my interests are online (not social media). I hate that I can't win. No one likes me when I'm fake but they don't really like me when I'm not.

TLDR: The phrase ""Be yourself"" doesn't work for me, since my interests are so uncommon or niche that even with small talk, it turns people away. I'd *have* to be fake just to make friends.",lonely,I'm not excepted whether I am being myself or not.,2021-11-28 12:46:04
477,Outofthrowawayideas1,1638063322,1,"I think I wasted my time in college. I'm only 22 but I had a really bad experience with an ex-girlfriend that pushed me out of the dating scene from 16-20. So I put all my time into making a future for myself and getting a career. I went to school to be a pilot, got all my certifications, and will be working at an airline within 4 months. I should be ecstatic about that but I'm not. I've tried getting back into the dating scene for about a year now. Dating apps killed my confidence in myself because I don't get any likes let alone matches. I had a few dates with people who were honestly a waste of my time. Then I found one girl who I fell head over heels for. I usually don't let my guard down and immediately accept someone but for her I did. Then she ripped the rug out from under me and said ""she didn't want a relationship anymore."" Then proceeds to be dating another guy a week later. That destroyed my confidence and rightfully so. I recently downloaded dating apps again and now are lucky to get even one or two likes let alone a conversation. I go out to bars to meet people but that never works out either. The part that pisses me off is my friend who is the most awkward person I have ever met has girls messaging him all the time. I'm happy for him but it just baffles me. I thought that people wanted job security, a future, all these things that I was preached growing up. Guess that wasn't the case. I just don't know where to go from here. Since I am gonna be working at an airline I am going to be gone for most of the week and feel like my love life is going to suffer for it.

Every time my mother saw me crying she told me to shut up and not cry. She would storm into my room (almost break my door if locked) and either yell at me or bully me and talk bad about me. So I started to be scared to cry, scared that she could realize I was crying. On the other side she used me since I was a child as emotional support and had too many expectations that I will never achieve.
I don’t trust anyone in my life to tell them about my emotions or thoughts. I don’t think anyone really cares or want any kind of negativity around them. I get that.
I also think that no one wants to put any kind of effort into me and spend time with me. I wished my surrounding would at least care about me enough to ask me how I really am. Even the relationship with my „best“ friend of over 10 years feels superficial and fragile.

Back home, I had a wonderful group of friends who I would hang out with spontaneously and have little moments of fun. They all stayed in state and I moved to the big city (I wanted something new). When I got to college, I made some friends, but none that I would get to confide in or that I can just call to eat food with. I’m not sure whether it’s my anxiety to eat alone or something else, but I’ve been skipping meals if I couldn’t find someone to eat with. And I wake up pretty late, so I tend to only have a meal at 8pm. I live with a roommate and he has been annoying a lot of times, so I felt that I needed a break  for Thanksgiving. I didn’t want to go home, so I went to Boston where my old best friend from middle school is. He stayed in Boston for Thanksgiving instead of going home. I had an optimistic thought that I would rekindle our friendship that started fading apart in freshman year of high school. When I got here, I had several friends from college here too, but I travelled alone. I don’t know why I thought traveling to a new city by myself without solid plans was a good idea. I’ve rarely left this hotel room except to get McDonalds and shop.

It took a lot for me to be honest about my most vulnerable side to my therapist. It wasn’t easy to talk about fear of abandonment or attachment/obsession issues to my therapist. I also suffer from bpd. And recently my therapist did the worst possible thing to me, she asked me why am I here again, today isn’t my day! They said it’s not a good idea to have frequent session especially when I have a history of getting fixated or obsessed with people or things. They said it can get ugly so let’s avoid frequent sessions. And if I happen to miss my day, I shouldn’t come in that week on other days. 
They think it’s an “eye-opener” and they need to follow a very rigid plan. 
And the way they said that was so so so hurtful, if professionals start getting afraid around people with bpd what should we even expect from other people. It’s like showing your most vulnerable side to them and they hurting you exactly at that wonded part.  And I have never ever crossed any boundaries yet I ended up getting misunderstood. I take therapy because I need help not because it’s a hobby. I am willing to fight this but I can’t do this alone ...",lonely,Heart broken,2021-11-28 09:28:10

Ever since I was about 13, until now (almost 20) I've had this intense connection to a specific character. I honestly feel like I'm in love with them. I mean sure, maybe if they were real there's a chance their actual human flaws would irritate me and we'd be incompatible, but that aside, I adore this character. I love everything about them, and care deeply about them. Reading the Manga they're in over the years and seeing them grow and heal from their trauma made me feel genuinely proud of them like I would a real person. I care so much about this character and their happiness/well-being. I feel like if this was a real person, there would be no doubt in my mind that it's what you would call a soulmate. 
I'm in a relationship, I love my partner, and I've tried to move on and forget how I feel about this character but I never can. It's been almost 7 years, and I can't shake the feeling. Everytime I think about this character, no matter how much I try to ignore it, I feel so connected to them. 

I know they aren't real, and I could never be with them, but do any of you believe in the multiverse? Do you think they could potentially really exist out there and maybe we'd end up together in some other life?

A bit about me:

-Some things I'm up to lately: stargazing, raising caterpillars (Pyronia cecilia), getting rid of some of my ants both the pest and some of the ant farms, I'm giving them away. I think I stopped liking ants. First I found them interesting now they give me the creeps! I prefer butterflies.

-I like drawing, music, science, maths, art in general, I like playing videogames too as long as they're not sexist, which is pretty hard to find sadly. I like a lot old point and click adventures, and fantasy games in general.

-I like partying all night, but not the parties most people have, for me a party would be music, karaoke, some board games and maybe some games on retro Pie, nice food and some fruit juices, all night long, maybe go out to see the sunrise at a high places that feels special.

-I like board games, table top rpgs, poetry and much more!

-I speak English, Spanish and Italian.

-I don't like dark humor, or videos where people get hurt, or stuff like that, I don't like people suffering.

-I have depression and a couple more mental illnesses.

-I'm disabled rn

-I'm up to vc if we click.

-Or we could just play some games in bga maybe.

-Bonus track: if you're British and you're studying Spanish maybe we could even do some language exchange (?).",lonely,I wish I had someone to dwell in this shit with,2021-11-28 07:55:52

(Me F 21)(""best friend"" F 20)

 I think I'm done with this friendship, am I too intense? 
Please advice

We know each other since high school, she's in college and I'm still trying to figure out my life battling with depression, an eating disorder and severe anxiety (yet i barely talk about any of it with her because I know she's not my therapist so no I don't overwhelm her with my problems)

We are basically online friends at this point, we talk every day and I can't help feeling drained of my energy
 I feel like I'm being used, I'm basically her cheerleader! Whenever she's stressed about school or life I'm there to cheer, listen and give advice, I always give her cute and thoughtful presents, write looong paragraphs about how awesome and capable she is, send motivational videos, quotes, etc (am I being too much? She said she loves it and that I always make her feel better)

I even went to her house several times with care packages full of snacks and little gifts when she is feeling down (I do things I see on movies because I'm such a hopeless romantic with no social skills lol)

I'm not expecting big gifts or her to spend her money on me maybe she can't idk  (giving gifts is my love language)
One time on my birthday she gave me a bracelet still  on the store plastic bag with the receipt and everything!! With no card no nothing 
And other time she ghosted me on my birthday tf
I waited 1 hour on a restaurant and she never showed up because she was ""grounded"" so last minute

All I want is to feel appreciated

I even help her with her homework, and other stuff 
I'm like her personal assistant :(

We send each other pictures trying filters online and she has never complimented me! All she sais is , ""cool!"" Every fing time! I mean I know I'm not pretty but a compliment here and there would be appreciated that's what friends do right? Uplift each other...

She knows I have an eating disorder and still complains about how disgusting she looks when she is bloated bc she looks SOO FAT! and send me lots of posts on Instagram of pretty girls saying how thin, dainty and perfect they are

 (she's 00, xs and I'm clinically obese) is it normal? Am I being over dramatic because of my own insecurities about my body?  

I'm so confused, she told me she appreciates me and that i am her only friend and according to her parents that's true!! They even thanked me for being her friend when we first met (that was a little odd)
 
Every time I share some concern or a bad thing that happened to me her response is always the same ""oh really?, no way, *sad emoji* F, lol"" THATS IT!! 

I have other friends but they have their own best friends so I'm basically alone and sad

I think i am a good friend and still it's never reciprocate

Am I idealizing friendship relationships? 
I always do this, I don't want to be alone I'm an only child and i really want a close sister like Friend
Does it even exist? Am I just not lucky?
I see all this ppl throwing surprise parties for their friends, having matching jewelry, hanging out, taking cute pictures, being called aunt by their friends children and i really really want that

523,pockets2tight,1638045584,1,"I turned 33 this morning around 6am eat. For the past 12 or so years I’ve always dreaded my birthday and this is by far the one I’ve been anticipating the least. A third of the century spent here and I have very little to show - no wisdom, no love, no direction, no grounding. 

I’ve suffered from severe depression for the past 7 years, prior to that i was generally melancholic, but in 2014 something happened and I realized my anxiety’s and avoidant traits would always inhibit me, and because I probably have dependent traits, it’s not a good mix and I was aware that I’m not happy alone, but that I would always sabotage chances with a woman bc of my cowardice. Coming to that conclusion, I became intensely depressed - I delineate these phases of my life by the time I first started having suicidal thoughts.

And seven years later they’re maybe stronger than ever. No actionable plan in place, but just a sense of eventually it seems like that’s how it’ll go. I’ve grown hopeless and passionless.  My heart is so big, I have so much to give, but nobody wants it. 

I honestly didn’t think I’d make it this far but in the spring I met a girl that was infatuated with me. She has serious mental health issues and traumas that kept her from thinking she’d ever find a guy that she’d not only fee safe around, but also wouldn’t mind her condition. I have her everything I could- patience, safety, care. But still apparently that was not enough because two days after telling me she wants me to move across the state to be closer to her, that she’s sorry that relationships give her anxiety, that she was worried I didn’t want to be her boyfriend, she decided that “we don’t click” and we haven’t spoken since.

Nobody understands why I can’t get over her. And I get it - they didn’t feel those nearly 4000 days of continuous suicidal ideation that was finally broken. The return of hope, the promise of someone caring about me that I could let my guard down for. How it hurt me knowing how irrational it seems that she thinks there are other guys that will hear her problems, reservations, fundamentally religious ideas, and won’t do a 180. How so many will call her damaged and crazy. How they won’t see her pain as pain, but baggage, a deal breaker. I know I should be over her, but it finally felt real. I just can’t.

I don’t know the joys of a healthy sexual relationship, the fun of travel, or even the small pleasures like having inside jokes or traditions with a woman like a favorite restarting. No I just have my mind, broken by loneliness and starved for love and normalcy. So many unrealized passions and desires, so many of them selfless, like to bring joy to my children, to care for my family, to have the energy to do charity work again.

The warmest of hearts is still vulnerable to the brutalities of life. Year after year I could despair about my birthday, knowing another unfulfilling year past out of my limited ones here, and say okay well at least if I hang in there, a year from now it just has to get better.

I can work for the rest of my life but it's just not worth it to me. Life is not something I enjoy it's not something beautiful to me. The only reason why I'm not ending it right now is because I don't want to hurt anyone. I want my family to live happily so I can't hurt them like that. If I can make their life a little better by staying alive and pretending that I'm happy. I'll go to university and get a good job if it means my mom will be happy and proud. I'll hide the pain all my life if it means that they will be happy. 

But I won't enjoy any of it. It's all because I know I'll be alone. Completely alone all my life. And it's not something I can control. I'm unable to make friends or maintain healthy relationships. It has been over a year since I was able to talk to people online without feeling uncomfortable and feeling like I have to get away from them. I do have one online friend but sometimes I can't even talk to them. And someday they will be too busy with their life to remember me.

It has been almost three years since I had irl friends. Everyday I go to school where people don't even talk to me. Everywhere I go I have always been the one left out, the one who doesn't manage to make any kind of friends. And then I developed something which I think seems like avpd that makes it impossible for me to go and talk to people. And I know I will never be able to be in a relationship. I would never be able to open up to anyone face to face, support and be there for anyone, show my emotions to anyone and I hate myself way too much.

I have been lonely for so long that I don't know anything better. But it's different kind of pain to know that you will be alone for the rest of your life. Because my fear of talking to people is not something that will go away. Even if I don't kill myself now I know that someday I will. I used to try to find help online and someone who could understand. I wrote posts hoping someone would help but it has already been a few months since I gave up.

I feel small and alone and hidden away and I know there are people out there who can provide what I want and who I can give back to, I just have to somehow find them. 

What I want...

I want someone who loves me. i want someone who takes care of me and someone i can take care of too. i want someone who looks after me. i want someone who will cuddle me and read stories and watch films with me and go on walks outside with me, I want someone to spend time with doing nothing and everything. i want my daydreams to be real life and true. i want to live in a house with a stable job and big garden and live with people who love me unconditionally and who i love and trust back. i want a family to live with and i dont want to be alone. i want to feel cared for and looked after. i want to feel safe all the time. i want to be able to live with someone who i can tell all my secrets to without fear stopping me and i want someone who accepts me for who i am and who helps me to be a better person. i want someone who helps me to stay on track in life because i am sometimes no good at keeping myself on track with my goals and with the things i need to do to look after myself. i want someone who can guide me in life. i want someone who truly loves everything about me.",lonely,What I want - A vent from a lonely girl,2021-11-28 05:29:52
544,Dexiteer,1638037770,1,"Maybe I am being a little ridiculous even posting this here, part of me feels quite selfish for doing so, but I am trying to find avenues of understanding and acceptance... 

To preface this, it really would be wrong of me to say I have absolutely no-one out there to support me. Though it is arguably quite a small group, I do have people who I know care about me and would always help me out. There's just something lacking, something that I've not had for a long time...

That one friend who just gets me and will stick by me.

That one friend were you can just be yourself with, have a laugh with, argue with, be a nutjob with and just want to spend time in each other's company. I haven't had this for over ten years now, and the ones I did back then... Well, I just messed it all up and eventually lost them. I take all the blame for this, I was a reckless idiot, and I have had to learn a lot from these experiences. 

In recent times, more so at the start of this year, I made positive steps to confront certain aspects of my past (I am a survivor of childhood trauma) and I do believe I have grown as an individual person because of this. Part of this learning process, well it was to get out there and make some friends (both online and offline) and I found one or two people. I shared a lot with these people, they shared with me, but we also made sure we also took time to just have a bloody laugh... it doesn't always have to be doom and gloom!

Fast forward to now, they've pretty much just fucked me off and I really don't know why people won't stick by me? I know some of them had their own *stuff* to deal with, that's true, but they didn't have to just leave me hanging without a word... When you share so much with someone, bond with them over stuff, and they just disappear on you... That shit hurts.

I know I can be a daft little idiot sometimes, but I've always liked to believe I care enough to stick by people I thought were good friends. I would honestly do anything I could for someone I cared about, and I never want anything back. I know I should focus a lot more on my own happiness, but I genuinely feel good when I see other people be happy, it's an added bonus when I was part of making them happy... Even just a slight smile is enough!

I wouldn't say I'm boring either. I have enough interests (probably would bore you to death!) to keep me going, and I would like to believe I've had a bit of a life to share despite most of my decisions being a disaster so far. I even left home and moved to another country in Europe to try a new approach, I will literally give anything a go!

Just... I don't know why people keep leaving me behind. Maybe we really are a selfish and wrapped up humanity now, but is it really that effing hard to at least goodbye? I just want someone to care and stick by me, no matter what shite comes our way...

Honestly, I don't even know I am hoping to achieve my writing out this mess. I don't feel like it belongs here, but I just want to share something... somewhere.

Or maybe it's the three damn beers I had earlier before making me flipping emotional lol

I dunno... I just hope, one day, I find someone who really will understand and get me.",lonely,I just miss the closeness of a true friend...,2021-11-28 05:29:30

I went from being 14 and trying numerous times to kill myself and not leaving my room for 2 years to being 18 and having a pretty good life. I went to school with no problems I wasn’t happy happy but I was doing bad. Then everything got really good I met this girl we got along great became friends I became friends with her brother and sister. Let’s call this friend k and her sister L and her brother E. I asked k out after a while but she didn’t feel the same I thought it sucked but it surprisingly didn’t effect me that much. Me and k stayed best friends and after a while I asked her again because she seemed to change her feelings I was wrong but whatever I didn’t care. Then I fell hard for L and we started dating but we had to keep it a secret because the fact that I liked K their mum wouldn’t have been with us. But L lied badly to E and he told K and so K got super mad and told their mum now none of them talk to me and I think L has been banned from speaking to me by their mum. I can’t go back to being lonely I can’t go back to not having friends again. I can’t deal with not even being touched by another human for months on end I can’t do it again it’s like finally climbing out of hell only to see that you have to go through it again I know for a fact that this is temporary I know that I’ll find someone I know I’ll have friends In The future but all of that is on the other side of a massive valley and in the bottom of that valley is hell itself and I just can’t get through a another journey through it. I don’t want to die I just don’t want the pain again the heartache the pit in my stomach the loneliness I just can’t go through that again. Not again. It’s like when you’re vomiting and you’ve already thrown up once and so you know how much it hurts and you feel the next one coming but you just having to sit there helplessly begging for it not to come again.

The children found friendship and love they had for one another.

The giant did things unspeakable to the little child and the other was not there. 

Soon after the other heard what had happened and did his best to help her cope with what had happened. 

The children played again but nothing was the same, they tired the laugh and play, they tried to hug and kiss but it was never the same.

One day another child of the snow came they laughed and played but the other child looked on with jealous eyes but kept his tongue. 

One day the loves fought and the oath was broken and the loves left each other. 
An eternal vow broken and shattered.

The child with jealous eyes could not understand why, he tried and tried but nothing worked.

I cut off all my ""friends"" who were still actively using drugs. I tried to make the best of the situation and keep myself clean and last week marks a year and 6 months. I had a nice run with antidepressants, that numbed me emotionally and furthered my isolation, but that's a whole different story. 

I finally got off them, and I'm starting to feel like myself again but boy has it been lonely. I never had friends who shared interests with me that wasn't drug related and I don't even know where to begin.

Hi im 15 male and I have my best friend named Sacha also 15 male. I know him about 5-6 years and he’s always been there for me. He’s my only friend and shares the same passions as me. We like to hang out together and watch series together. He’s always been an adventurous guy and helped me overcome some fears. It was always difficult to make friends for me so he is the only one I got. I’m his first option not the last and with him I feel safe, I feel welcomed, I feel loved with him. But the problem is that he isn’t real. He never responds to me. He’s just someone I made up. You see, a few years ago(when I was 9) I decided to write a diary, I call them soul books I have like MANY of them. I write to him Always what I eat, how I feel, what I did today and what I wanted to do with him when I get the chance to meet him. And it affected my life really badly. With 12 on Halloween I told my mom that I’m going with Sacha, the plan was that I wore a Gon costume and he a Killua one(they are a famous anime duo,bestfriends) but I ended up going alone. Or whenever I went to the cinema alone I would buy two tickets for me and for him. Or when I go to a MacDonalds I would always buy two meals for him and me. I do it subconsciously. I forget that he’s just made up. But I cannot betray him, he never left me, he always listens to my deepest thoughts and the people around me are noticing it. Since I spent money for both of us my parents gave me more pocket money, they were happy too that I have friends. Whenever someone in school asked me what I’m doing today, I response that I’m going to Sacha. Only after a few hours I realize that he’s not real. I know I’m not normal, I’m just a freak but I don’t know how to deal with it. I can’t abondom him, he never did to me. But I want to move on.

I want to do something important, but it's hard to do when you live in a small town in Iraq/Kurdistan, even ISIS tried to take over. basically dreams are fucking dead here, people here immigrants in  Belarus rn. 

there is so much knowledge on the internet but idk what I want to do or learn or what is worth learning on the internet? I dont want to waste any more of my time

Im also tired of chasing people or girls, or making people ""my only goal"" I know there is more important things than chasing people.

I'm still 20, having no friends, my conversations are all one sided, no one puts any effort into me but I do put effort into others, maybe I'm not good enough?

my only goal is to finish school. because I have no other goals yet

I like soccer, science, astrology, movies, philosophy, psychology, history. 

or I spend time texting girls online who I dont know or watching porn. I hate doing those but I'm obsessed. I'm tired of wasting my time

I know people say that there’s nothing wrong with not being in a relationship at my age and stuff like that but you see people in happy relationships and can’t help but want what they have. I have a dog who sometimes I lay with if I feel that depressed. But he never seems to actually want to lay with me even though he is a cuddly kind of dog with literally everyone else in the house. Being with a girlfriend who really cares about me and loves me as much as i want to live them is all I want but I’ve never even been in a relationship, never kissed anyone and never had any real experience in that sort of area Before. Ive been told I’m not a bad looking guy and people have said I’m good looking but idk I just find it difficult to believe those kinds of compliments and idk why. I started bulking recently for the gym and I’ve started to clear my face up from acne. I do that stuff for me over anything else. But there is still a sort of void most of the time where I feel depressed in my room because I have no one to turn to and don’t want to tell my family about my anxiety and what I feel like for the past few months has been depression which really doesn’t help with this recent feeling of loneliness.

So I used to have a really good friend, we would talk a lot every day for a few months and everything was going well. I asked him often if there was anything I did that he wanted me to change or that annoyed him and he always said no and he said I never upset him and I make him happy, etc. Anyways 3 weeks ago we were having a normal conversation and everything was regular until out of the blue he says ""something happened and I need to go for a very long time. thanks for everything while it lasted but idk if ill be back bye"" and blocked me on everything. I tried to ask him what happened and if he was ok and I was worried he was gonna do something bad to himself because my mind always goes to the worst so I messaged him on my other account and said "" I promise I'm here for you if you need anything please be safe i don't know whats happening but its gonna be ok. Im so sorry if I did something but please tell me if I did because I have no idea whats going on"" or something along those lines. I don't know what happened but it made me hate myself so much more.

590,welovebobadrink,1638021382,1,"21M gay guy here. I just wanna vent here since no one really cares about me.

So today is just usual weekend for me, the day where i can finally have a time for my friends and family. I'm a busy person at weekday since i have to work and studying at the same time. But today i  felt so extremely  lonely.  I asked my friends about their weekend plan (i was about to ask them to hangout to coffee shop with me) but nobody replied to my chat, none of them. And suddenly i just realised that i never have someone that i can call 'Best Friend'. I'm just here, only by myself.

It's so unfair since anytime they need me i always be in their side. But when i need them, they just fucking ignored me. Also like i said i'm a gay guy but i don't have a courage to coming out to my closest friend because they ever told me a joke if someone they know is a guy they will unfriend them. Even if that someone is their close friend. 

Is it really what people called with 'best friends'? or is it me that wrongly think that they're my bestfriend since i have no one to called best friends?

I only have some friends in my entire life, and i'm so afraid that i will ended up alone until the day i die soon.

Sometimes i cry alone in my room but crying didn't really help me to getting out this feeling. I feel like a failure.

592,SoleWayfarer,1638020123,1,"Hi, I've been frequenting this subreddit for a few years actually, just seeing everyone's posts and relating to them. I created this account to finally vent a bit, leaving my other more recognizable one for things that are more positive and mundane. The reason for me to make this split is simply to mimic what I already do irl which is keeping a more positive appearance on the outside while things aren't really going well on the inside, keeping it all to myself. I guess that, like many can relate, there's a limit to how vulnerable you'd want yourself to appear to the people around you.


I too fall under the category of people that ""are comfortable with solitude"" (or at least I'd like to think of me that way) but lately I've been hit more frequently with these growing sensations of loneliness, sadness and worthlessness. It's a bit more overwhelming than it ever was before, over and over, I feel it break me down.


I'm an introvert and very reserved although rarely I can be extroverted. I no longer have a group of friends since we all grew apart around 3 years ago. I never had to second guess my place among the people I know since I always play the same role, I'm never really a friend to anyone but more like a friendly acquaintance that's always welcome with open arms because they're very ""happy"" and nice to be around. Getting to know someone new wasn't an issue then, there were always people to meet, the problem always was bonding with anyone to the point that I'd actually be considered a close friend and not some passing acquaintance. Things just led to me having a lot of ""friends"" but no one actually befriending me and getting to know me on a personal level. 
I'd be invited to some party or small gathering and find people in small groupings, none to which I belonged, I'd just spend my stay hopping from group to group till it was time to leave. I'd often express how lonely I had felt only to have my reality questioned with the argument that it wasn't possible since I have lots of friends and I'm talking with everyone.
I didn't want to be known by a lot of people I just wanted to have 3 or 2 friends that I could talk about anything, that I could rely on and be relied on, just people that'd be glad they know me and not just happy to see me, just one person that would return the amount of effort I put out or that at least is willing to make an effort to understand and see me for who I am and not for what they perceive me to be.


Alas then I flunked out of university and the pandemic hit, the people I knew were fast to disappear, it's not like I could've asked more of them.  
I kept telling myself that having a job, hobbies, distractions, doing important and unimportant stuff are enough to fill the void or at the very least distract me from it, but it's not enough to fill my heart. I tell myself that maybe I'll get used to it, maybe I'll find myself, maybe the future will be brighter and hopeful, but I know the holes will still remain.
I've moved back with my parents, recently quit my job so I can think things through more clearly, but solutions are hard to find, blinded by sorrow...


So here I am, a 23 years old guy with no career, no job, no accomplishments, no friends, never had significant other and still living with my parents. I've seen many describe themselves similarly here.
I find myself self-doubting, echoing the valid concerns people often post here. The people I knew have moved on and accomplished things. Sure, I can get another job soon or return to college one day but it's the social aspect that might be more difficult to salvage.


I see people my age, younger and older wishing they had friends, wanting closeness with others, tired of not having anyone to text about small victories, bad news or share hobbies with. How they've been told they just haven't met the right people yet, not even wanting a group, just one person, making conscious efforts yet still struggling.


I relate to all your struggles, finding friends is difficult and I can see it gets harder as time goes on. I'm not sure how to begin anymore, it's scary being disappointed but it's worse when you could disappoint someone. Opening up and letting people in can be hard. In the meantime I try and socialize with people I can play multiplayer games with.


I see others expressing their longing for a relationship, not having met someone that's understood them, facing rejection, getting ghosted, not being chosen because anyone else seems like an upgrade in every way. Some feeling ugly and having that weigh on them all the time, while it's not smooth sailing to others despite being attractive. Panicking because the longer they stay single the stranger and less desirable they'll seem to others.


I don't know how I'll date in the future either, a running theme I see is the concern that no one would want the inexperienced person that isn't young, that there must be a reason we're single, something must be clearly wrong with us given the length of time. And yeah that's scary to think.
I'm not going to naively guarantee you'll eventually find someone, but I hope you do. I understand that at this point we all need a miracle and not someone's charity. I don't mean to sound so negative, a good outcome isn't as rare as it may seem, something I can guarantee is that you don't deserve to be alone.


I'm very concerned for the future, I'm not desensitized yet, I still feel, I still hurt. I'm not bitter and angry, but I fear that one day I may get to that point, yet if I keep true to myself that probably won't happen. However I do struggle to carry on, my resistance is waning. I don't know how things will go. It's like I'm struggling between a state of control and breaking down.
I'm sorry I have nothing of value to say, just a long rant. If you've made to the end thank you for taking the time to read all of this. The reason for me making a post is that I think it'll be nice and liberating in a way to release these thoughts in some form.

*When I look in outer space for you and the sky turns purple and the moon is blue, then I know that I've been with you before. In some other time. Some other place. Some other time. Some other place...*

Whilst I would be quite impressed if I had the ability to find penpals in outer space, and I'm quite convinced some people here do come from far away galaxies, It looks like I'm just casting my tattered net through the realms of a few Reddit subs.... so here goes!

**Dreadful beginnings:**

A few decades ago (gah, at least three of them now!) I believe I came swimming down the birth canal in your typically standard fashion. Though I am still convinced I was adbucted as a baby, I came along as the 3rd youngest of four into the most backwards of families... The effects of this family are still evident to this day!

I was fortunate enough to be brought up in the North West of England (boo to the South!), and it is also important to note I was born in the *proper* North, not those fake places like Manchester. I will keep my actual county secret for now, aye, but even those from the pesky South usually believe I am Geordie or Scottish - I am not. I was also once asked If I was Welsh, that was a traumatic experience and really led me to question my own identity :)

*\*I'm now off to make a cuppa 'cause I can't be bothered\**

There's not really anything of real note during my formative years, ( just some crappy stuff we need not mention, and I just about managed to get through the school system with my glorious poshy school blazer. Not a posh school though, just your typical run-down comprehensive secondary!

Didn't really achieve much academically, far too busy whacking fellow pupils with those 1 metre metal sticks in technology. Left with a small cluster of barely-passed GCSES and the began the following career path:

&amp;#x200B;

* Cracker packer in a biscuit factory - I actually earned a whopping 5 quid an hour here!
* Once worked on a  farm dedicate to bull \*\*\*\*\* production - they were big boys, so to speak!
* Cleaner in a mental health hospital - I once witness a full toilet in a colour other than white.
* Travelled a little bit - went round Germany, Sweden and pretend to be a man of culture.
* Health and social care - did this for a few years, supporting people and all that stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from holding the above *satisfying* jobs, I pretty much wasted away my days in the local boozer and have probably lost about 20 years of my life span because of it. I didn't really achieve much, I must confess, but then I did always have this yearning to try something different. Around five years or so the opportunity to do so came along...

**Misguided Hope:**

Well, would you believe it? The boy had fallen in love with someone he met - *aww!*

*Little Cumbrian who's fallen in love... Without me!*

But this person wasn't some dishevelled northerner like me, she was from another place and this meant I had an opportunity to try and completely seek out pastures new...

I buggered off to Sweden, ([So fill to me the parting glass!](https://open.spotify.com/album/7D5xUGsOC4j2B4a58iQFJh?si=LBtijXqmR-iMQL2an0gvCA&amp;utm_source=copy-link)*)* and I am still here to this day. Just doing my thing, looking at some meanings and trying to work out what I want to do. Unfortunately the past few years really have been of the rocky road variety, and it didn't work out the way I would have hoped - I am leaving Sweden in a few weeks time.

But I have gained valuable experience from my time here, learned a lot about myself, so I have to be thankful to her and this country for that. I still can't get my head around herring though, that stuff is just disgusting, and I really do miss the joys of talking to some old bat at the bus stop back home!

[I did spend a lot of time with this... thing, though!](https://imgur.com/a/KdHdGm0)

But aye, the above is really just a small snippet of what I've been on with so far in my little journey. But what do I actually like...

**Interests? Who has time for that?!**

I'm actually quite bad at going over some of the things that interest me... I just kid of exist and do my own thing, though I would imagine a lot of us feel that way! I am notorious for gaining a new interest, being obsessed with it, dumping it after 5 minutes and trying something new.

But to rhyme off some stuff:

&amp;#x200B;

* Travelling - I am not going to pretend I am some renowed world traveller, I'm normally flat broke, but I do like to get away when I can. I was recently in Germany and will be heacing back there after the Christmas holidays... maybe to live there, who knows? :P Some of the past visited places have included Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece and Spain. I also once went to Hull, it was awful!
* Postcards - really big on this, and I do love sharing my thoughts with people from all over. I can send nice cute cards, or more crude ones for those who get to know me well :D
* Keyrings - I collect keyrings. Gift me with a keyring and I will love you for life!
* Music - I am quite often listening to my music, it's important, and I have no doubt my musical tastes will differ from many people here. Really big on the Pogues and the like, they sing a lot of meaning to me, and I can escape for hours into my musical realm.
* Rambling - isn't that the whole point of this? I love a good ramble with people, learning new ideas and sharing their own experiences. I mean proper rambles, not just asking questions on the boring stuff. I really like to share :P
* Gaming - this is actually a lie now. My PS4 died a few months ago and I've never bothered gaming since. I did like *Life is Strange,* that is the last game I remember playing!
* Genealogy - I've went off this a little lately but I do enjoy researching and history. I have plenty of family scandal to share with anyone willing to listen!
* Annoying - I like to annoy people 'cause it's how I show I care about you!

&amp;#x200B;

There you have it, some of my interests. There are more, of course, but this post is getting way too long as it is! I should really move towards the *meh* stuff...

**Personality... Do I have one?**

I am, like so many out there, not without my faults but I really do believe in a open approach to this. I have spent this year being a lot more open with others, and whilst it still can be tricky, I know I am slowly moving in the right direction :)

In many ways, the reason I put myself out there like this is because I feel a little lonely and detached from the world at times. I'm not going to lie and say I am all alone and misunderstood in this world, that's wrong, but I do feel I am lacking something. Maybe I am trying to find some people to fill that void, yet I don't want to throw those expectations on people.

Past experiences have not been the best, no, and I do have a lot of past trauma I am actively working on sorting out. It does not mean I am going to throw this on you, but I do sometimes have little hiccups from time to time. I have come a long way and want to do even better for me and the people I care about. I have chromosome disorders that make me look a little weird (I am defo weird, that's for sure!) so people who care compassionate and don't really care about that stuff are a must for me!

All in all, I just have some issues but it won't intefere with any potential friendship :)

But what you?

**About you, your good self:**

Honestly? I am pretty open about who you are and where you're from. I'm not really in this to throw unrealistic expectations on people, though it must be said... I do appreciate someone who wants to hold a conversation. I always like to match a person's effort, I'll give back what I receive and you'll also be party to my wisdom and guidance... good luck!!

I do appreciate people who take on an honest an open approach, and I am always open to the various methods of yapping we have in this modern age. My PM and DM boxes are now open, though I will say this now... any messages of a sentence or two will be ignored! Why don't you tell me about your favourite brand of tea? I'm not here to carry the conversation, just be yourself and allow a conversation to flow :) You don't need to be on-demand 24 hours a day either, that's just unrealistic!

Identity politics seems to be the way to go these days, although I can say I don't follow any of it and I just do my own thing. I'm not really bothered what you want to identify as, it's not something I pay much attention to... I just see the person for who they are with me :)

It doesn't matter if we don't *click* or whatever, we can just gently ghost each other and move with our lives. I would like to make some proper friends out of this, of course, and I will make you as much a part of my life as you want :) I have met some wonderful penpals and friends through these subs, even met some of them, and I want that to continue!

Just be yourself, kind and don't fob me off after months of getting to know each other without a word... That kinda move hurts, ya know!

**Conclusion:**

I am now absolutely bloody knackered from writing all that, and I still have a little hangover from Thursday... I think I'm off to take a nap! It would be really nice to hear from some people when I get back :)

I know this a huge amount of writing, I promise I am not going to always bombard you with this writing. I just like to put a bit out there, give you something to go on!

595,Sharmisthaaaa,1638018682,1,"I (20F) cheated on my boyfriend (24M) in the beginning of the relationship back in 2019 with my ex and i regret it till this day. Before coming in a relationship with my bf i came out of a toxic relationship with my ex. He was verbally abusive, cheated on me multiple times and was extremely possessive and due to that i slowly started to lose all my feelings for him and eventually broke up with him over text. We didn't get the closure and a few months after that i met my amazing boyfriend who treated me right. He was from a different city and he used to come meet me in the weekends and we would have great time together. We both were each other's first. We got intimate in a very less period of time and the relationship i had with him was something that can't be described. But then i started to show my toxic traits. On my 18th birthday i received a text from my abusive ex and he wished me a happy birthday. I responded to it and that's where the problem began. We started to talk again without letting my bf know. I always thought I'd confess this to him in person but whenever he came I'd just lose all my confidence by seeing his face. I eventually went to meet my ex and when my boyfriend got to know about it he was devastated. But i guess i was just a sick lady that kept on cheating him and went out with my ex again after that once. (We never did anything physical, we didn't even hold hands) then on July 2020 he met a girl on bumble and they both started talking with each other. The girl ended up falling for him and on my 19th birthday he confessed this to me &amp; told me he likes this other girl and told me to move on. I couldn't sleep that night. It was my worst birthday ever. I started scrolling my Facebook messages and started replying to people who wished me hbd. There i met this guy who was super sweet and consoled me a lot that night. My boyfriend got to know about this and told me to immediately stop talking to this guy and that the girl meant nothing for him it was just to make me jealous. I was still not over him and did accordingly he said. On Jan 2021 he physically hit me. Slapped, choked, kicked me on my breasts and what not just because he was drunk and i was kinda demanding. He later told me he's sorry for it and would never ever do something like that ever again. I accepted his apology and moved forward. Our relationship has been on and off ever since then and on July 2021 he told me come move to his city for my further education as he can't take this long distance thing anymore. I tried to make my parents understand a lot and at last they agreed to send me there even though the funds were a lot. But on 23 Nov 2021 he told me that he can't take the past ""cheating on him with my ex"" thing anymore and these thoughts run in his head 24/7 so he doesn't wanna continue anymore with me. I was devastated as i jeopardized my career too, for him. I am now really in a bad place. He thinks i am a hoe who needs a lot of guys in her life. I know now y'all will say this is toxic and it's better to move away and yes it is toxic indeed but i believe we can still work this out as we both are very attached to each other i can't think of leaving him. I was young and dumb back then but now i realize the importance and i would want us to give it a last try. Please suggest me something by which i can make him feel better a lil.

I met a guy a few months ago who was always there for me; we'd text each other every day, play video games every night, and watch Netflix together. 

I’ve been ghosted for 12 days now, he told me he self isolates sometimes when he gets into these depressive episodes. I tried checking in on him once in a while. He hardly responded, I keep telling myself that’s okay as he’s going through stuff. But when you have a pile of texts being left on delivered with no response, you can’t help but feel insecure and wonder if they just never liked you. 

I miss him everyday. I’m trying my best to move on, and only care about him as a friend would but it’s hard. It’s been really difficult for me to do my assignments as well because all I want to do is to nap the loneliness and pain away.",lonely,I feel lonely,2021-11-27 23:33:27

601,MeaninglessGaetano,1638015030,1,"3 years ago I reunited with an old friend from middle school and opened up to he about my situation, that became intolerable to me.

During my teenager years I never had social life, no group of friends or similar even if I was an ok guy in class, I was in good terms with everyone. So I was the classic guy that in class, with classmates, if funny and jokes with everyone, but then at home was all alone with nobody to checks on him. 
I still see some of them because we're going at the same university, but apart from that, the situation is the same. When I come back home nobody checks on me. 

So, I reunited with this friend and he introduce me to his group of friends but now, after 3 years, I still don't fit in. Moreover, it's been August that I don't hear them, I don't go out with them (probably left out as always) 


Now it's been a month that, occasionally, I go out with my cousin's group. They used to be school's classmates that still hang out together and I feel pretty bad about that. I think I'm jealous of it. She has what's I was looking for during all these years: a small circle of friends who knows each other for years and are still in touch. I feel awkward to go out with them because I feel the stranger in it, and it's true tbh

Sooo, nothing. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to feel. I recognize that I've a lot of acquitances, but I've no real close friends. I feel bad and jealous of my cousin because, in her group, I found what I was looking for, but it's not mine thing.

Someone told me it’s like a post-cuddle drop in your feel-good neurotransmitters that makes me feel like that. Like coming down from a drug high. Anyone know if that’s a real phenomenon? 

This is so annoying and frustrating. I feel like I keep using men to get over men but I have to keep finding a new guy to get over the previous guy. I hate it. I already am shy and have major social anxiety so it’s not easy for me to meet or hang out with new guys all the time. So it does take me a long time to get over a guy. 

I don’t know. I’m just venting I guess. I’m at the point where I’m starting to get old and I want to use my incredible sexual energy. I’m not really self conscious in the bedroom so I feel like I’m wasting my good years. I was a late bloomer in physical appearance but I remained socially awkward throughout the years. I never got the chance to “get it all out of my system.” I only got a taste and want it all but I don’t want to get hurt. 

I think I just want to be in a relationship. People would think it’s easy for me but it’s not. It’s not just about appearances. I’m just so socially awkward and emotionally stunted due to my inherent predispositions and my upbringing. One time I went to a family doctor to ask for antidepressants to be restarted for me and his attitude was almost like “WHAT? *YOU?* Why would you need them?” Anyways I haven’t gone to therapy in a long time but I’m thinking about going again.

I was streaming and made some parasocial friends (yes irony intended), and one of the female ones continued to slide into my dms just cause she was nice. I am not an incel or neckbeard but god did I fucking have that moment.

I called her beautiful and immediately felt the shame and disgust for myself. All it took was one picture for me to ruin a friendship cause I couldn't hold back my inner simp.

Now she accepted the compliment, but I have enough self awareness to know that the compliment was my insatiable urge for unhealthy codependency that said it. I have to actively block out daydreaming about the girl I'll never meet.

613,Beginning-Victory763,1638010161,1,"Hi this is my first reddit post ever and i never really engaged in community based social media so here we go i guess… I’m 19 and have been struggling with strong feelings of nostalgia and self pity , my life story is pretty simple, I’m an orphan born out of the far east of ukraine, adopted and brought to canada at the age of two, my parents lived in a fairly nice house and had steady incomes. A real suburban white family. Anyways as an only child of course I’m more prone to feelings of loneliness than others however this is why I’m writing this. Growing up i had lots of friends and hung out with them all the time, then one day when i was in the fourth grade i walked to my mom’s car so she could drive me home when she said that my father had made a bad mistake and was in big trouble with the police, turns out my dad had been fired from his cushy accounting job at the local hospital and out of desperation stole almost $90K  from our local sports association where he was the treasurer .Now not to complicate the story but lets aay my dad wasnt always the kindest man I’d met. Nothing like beatings or anything like that just emotional abuse and neglect. My mom grew up in a household where she described “my  evil stepmom used to beat me all the time and yell at me “. So you are starting to understand the kind of foundation i had as a kid. Fortunately i was really good at making friends so i would escape my reality by playing with the neighborhood kids all the time or reading books like harry potter or this awesome series i read called CHERUB (prolly the best series ive ever read btw) but back to the story… I’m athletically gifted and good looking (I say humbly) and i got a lot of attention from girls. Anyways in high school i got a lot of pussy and had a lot of friends, smoking weed drinking sweeping women off their feet you know the deal.  Somewhere deep in my heart though i knew i was empty. Somewhere in the summer in about grade ten i woke up with a strong feeling that i just couldnt do it anymore, smoking weed, partying , treating women poorly and like i didnt care. When the truth was i just wanted someoneI cared about to embrace me. All of the women i cared for (even though i could seduce them) eventually found i was too emotionally damaged for them and left . In grade eleven I went sort of crazy and basically went into EXTREME extroversion basically becoming a  schoolwide and town wide name. Then one day me and my friends weee at a lake and we decided to steal from a lake house. In the lakehouse all wewantex was cool stuff. We didnt care about jewlery or tvs or anything we just wanted to adventure andexplore. Well… we found a rugher flip (with no gjn nearby) full of hollow point bullets. I came back to school the next week and went to shpw my friends when a teacher snuck up and caught me. They immediately deemed me a school wide threat (I cant blame them) and expelled me . I was sent to an alternative school (a school for lesser students with bad records or ducked up home life’s) .in the school i felt alone again. Myrelationship with my parents hsd completely crumbled more than it already had considering i wass a horrible student and now i as just been EXPELLED. I hid in my room every day after school playing video games, developing an eating and smoking addiction. To drown out the pain I went back to my old ways. Except this time alone.. my family relationships ruined, my friends all thought i was a school shooter and no emotional support . Not only that but i had a girl… i really fucking liked her and i knew she liked me back . I knew for a faxt. . Until One day she blocked me. On everything. Everything gone, from the pinsccle to the gutter. Bad grades, no frends, nobody to talk to about anything. So once i graduate high school i got into a sales job. Sales… where making fast relationships and getting pen to paper is all that matters, sort of like how i used to handle women.  It’s been three years since i got expelled and two and a half since my girl blocked me.  I just feel horrible iknside. Like i lost everyone, like im just another taxi driver if you will. I often feel nostalgic about my friends and about how i used to be popular.  Now im cold. I can barely speak with out shaking i feel like a shell of who i was and i i just want to spend time with someone who cares. Its all so shallow … i feel like nothing really maters because im alone….,Now i know as im writing this there a lot more and tragic lifes than. And someone has it far worse than me but i still … just because someone elses suffering is worse does not invalidate mine and ii just want to express myself. I feel bottled up inside.

I’m new here and I just wanted to share a part of my life with somebody else than my family.
So.. I met my boyfriend on a dating app and everything was fast.. from stranger to his parents house every weekends… 
We had q lot of arguments on everything for almost 3 years and I was so broken bc nothing were going as good as we hoped. 
We tried almost everything we can to find a reason to stay or at least that was how I see.
And all of a sudden.. I met a guy on a game and we played almost every single days and nights. 
I was so happy to have something good for once in a while that I.. started to text this guy every time I wasn’t with him just to say « hey I’m here! I’ve been waiting for this moment the whole night.. don’t forget me » kinda attitude and emotions.
Obviously I started to get distant from my boyfriend.. and what he did .. is just accusing me of loving somebody else, of leaving him alone like he doesn’t exist anymore… but the truth is.. I didn’t realize how much power he had over myself until I push him away from my heart. 
And one day I started to be convinced that we still have a chance bc he was saying everything I always wanted him to say to me. 
We both gave each other things to do or say.
And… I realize that even if we give our best… I still feel lonely in this relationship.
I did something I didn’t want to.. that broke my heart but my bf assured me that if I block the other guy I would be happy with him and guess what…. One year later I’m still not happy with him. He is just not the one I would live forever with and he can’t even admit it.
I tried to make him understand that we don’t belong together, we don’t fit into each other lives.. 
Now I regret blocking the other guy cause I felt so happy and comfortable with him.. Even tho I try to reconnect with this guy… he never came back with the same connection.. and I think I’ve lost him forever and I’ve never felt more lonely now that he’s gone.

So since June this year I started watching Twitch, but more towards small streamers because I get to talk with them.

And it will develop to joining their Discord, and we get to talk more there like a real friends.

It seems like a replacement for my social interactions. I followed and watch more than 10-20 people regulary depending on their schedule.

The problem is that I've been ""friend"" with these people and spending too much time everyday just watching and interacting in their stream.

I understand that I will never meet any of them, let alone being a real friend, but there's something missing if I don't get to see or talk to them.

I realised this is the way I use to cope with my loneliness, and I really want to stop.

How do I stop from this parasocial relationship? Or it is completely normal to do this as a lonely person?

However, the server mods and creator are pretty close. They're all super nice but it's obvious that they like having a wall up from other people. They like their friend circle the way it is, all their inside jokes/spamming, and that means no one else is welcome to get close to them or anything. They're not interested in new friends, and only have energy to invest in each other, basically. Which, fine, okay- like I respect it and I'm not feeling any type of way about it although I'd love to be friends with them. (I'd also like to feel like I could come to them with server issues but I'd rather not be the subject of a conversation I'm not present for nor stir that friendship pot).

They posted a pic today about how they did this big thing where they traveled to see each other in person and they posted all these pics about it and like...I'm so, *so* happy for them but now I'm in this hell of realizing how alone I am. Not only that but also questioning myself of who I have to become to have something like that. I just...like, how do people do *that?* How does someone achieve such an exclusive level of friendship, not only with one person but with multiple? 

I'm so so alone. All the photo did was make me seethe with jealousy and realize how alone I am. I know it's wrong to but I kinda really hate them right now.

655,ChysCreativeThoughts,1637991444,1,"Ever since I was younger, I always found it harder to connect to people my age, and I still find that to be the case. I'm a  with only one person I can call a friend, and they live miles away from me. I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. In my years of junior high school, I had a friend group for a while that I knew ever since elementary. However, after a rumor was spread about me they all left. I ended up at my breaking point and everything kinda just went downhill. The bullying became to be too much, and when High School came around I took the first ticket out of my district.  I've always been a socially awkward person, but when my freshmen year came around I made some friends. Then covid hit and took all of that away from me in the lockdown. Spending my sophomore year in person, not allowed to really talk to anyone, or even sit near people was hard. Friends that I had made were all virtual, and we lost touch. A lot of the school friends I made that year were just trying to survive, and since my grades were good, I started doing people's work for them. I thought we were friends, but I was just a grade to them. Never talked to any of them, and I'm in my junior year. I'm alone and even when I try to talk I feel like I'm already out of the game. Everyone has their circles and I'm just there until someone needs a homework assignment. I'm more than my grades, and I know that. It's just all that people talk to me for now. I've tried inviting those same school ""friends"" to hang out, chat, and play video games. I'm always home alone, playing video games by myself, or drawing and writing. I just want people to talk to, to actually have friends. I feel like giving up, I hate feeling like I'm not worth anything to people. Maybe there's something wrong with me that I don't see. I don't even think people would care if I was gone.  I'm trying so hard to connect to people my age, to connect to people in general. I just want people to care for me as I care for people.

657,Im_So_Lost96,1637990633,1,"It is a hard pill to swallow, but I'm going to admit it.

I have absolutely 0 friends anymore. I haven't had sex since Valentine's Day. I have no social skills. I am severely depressed, I've been basically abusing light-substances to feel better and less anxious the last year. 

When it was 2019, I was forced to move with my family at age 23. I was in the middle of college, but we relocated to another US state. Much farther away from the last one. I had friends where I was from, lots of them. I thought for sure I'd be able to keep in contact with them despite moving. Oh, what an optimistic lie.

As time went on, 2020 hit, COVID took a toll on the world. I slowly started to lose touch with everyone I was formerly friends with. Phone calls, and text messages went from every few days, to every few weeks, to every few months.

Now it's 2021 and nobody cares about me anymore. I've hit rock bottom. I see my peers in relationships online, while I have not met a single fucking person from where I live now. I'm stuck at a community college with classmates who are 7-8 years younger than me. Dating apps have had very little luck with me.

Overtime I grew to developing a substance disorder, binge eating problems, lack of self-care. I'm 25 years old, severely depressed, mentally ill struggling from severe OCD, I still live with my aging parents. I have no idea how to meet friends, I have no idea what is wrong with me.

The last few weeks I've been slowly debating suicide. I'm too much of a wimp though and would never do it but the depressive thoughts hit me at night.

I didn't think my life would turn out like this. I thought I'd be able to be able to handle myself and being my own person. Able to tune out other people, but no. I need other people in my life.

This is why friends are so important and NOT overrated and I think many people lie when they say they don’t have friends because they’d have someone to take them in this position. 

Also this is why when people try to give me advice that I should just have sex with guys because that’s all guys ever ask from me (they never want a relationship or to date) people tell me to do it and this is why it is a bad idea, I have these 2 guys I’m only speaking to currently and they act like my friend but they probably/they act like want to just sleep with me and not date me and I told one of them what happened and he completely disappeared and he always messaged me back but suddenly he’s just gone.

i have a beautiful girlfriend. friends, sorta. my relationship w my family is decent for the first time in years. i have a lot going for me i guess, more than i’ve had in years. but i guess that’s not enough for me, i’m still sitting here starring at this ceiling again miserably.

i just don’t like me. i don’t like being with me, being myself.

i have friends but i’m no ones best friend. most of my friendships are just situational, once the new semester starts at school i’ll probably barely talk to these ‘friends’ ever again. maybe an occasional dm but no one really wants me around for that long. that sounds kinda sad but i get it, i wouldnt want me around for long either. i basically just microdose friendships so i don’t make people hate me. even the friends i have i can tell i’m not really myself with them.

i mold myself to fit others. i find myself at lunch surrounded by my friends just waiting to get home and be by myself again so i don’t have to hold up an act. but then when i’m alone again it’s utterly unsatisfying. i’m still me at the end of the day. at least the weight of holding a fake smile is gone but is it really any better laying here feeling like a fucked up puzzle piece that has no where to go.

 i just. i just really don’t like me. i wanna be easier i just want to think, easier? that makes no sense but i just wanna like what other people like i wanna be social and love being with people and make friends easily and that’s just not who i am and i hate that i’m not. the only place i feel i fit is in my girlfriends arms and half the time i feel i’m dragging her down with me. what’s wrong with me",lonely,it almost feels worse knowing everything should be okay right now,2021-11-27 14:34:36

At past jobs I was made to do other's work because I could not connect with my bosses and co-workers. I wasn't a 'favorite' and was treated as such. No one stood up for me when I was bullied, gossiped about or talked down to. Having friends or at least acquaintances at work in this society with workplace politics is a necessity. I could never move up from my position while people who worked there with less experience and time than I did would. I ended up having a nervous breakdown and lost my last job. I am now currently applying for jobs and trying to reenter the job market and they of course ask for references. I don't have any.

I've wanted to work in the creative field for as long as I can remember; specifically movies and behind the scenes of the entertainment field. I have made zero progress with that because I can not network. No matter what Meetups I attend, who I approach at a showing I can not make enough of an impression on them for them to want to connect. While I was unable to complete college due to a wide variety of reasons there are plenty of college dropouts that are successful because they are able to network and connect with people. While at school I could not connect with my professors outside of class no matter how hard I tried. And of course I could not make friends with my peers so I left school not only friendless but also without any type of supportive network. 

I have some health issues. I have no one to put as an emergency contact besides one of my parents. I have no one else but them and only in an emergency type of situation like surgery.

A few years ago my best friend in the world committed suicide. Ever since he passed, I've become more and more detached from having relationships with others. I don't know if it's where losing a person I felt closer to than I did with my own brother and not wanting to feel that pain again or if it's just fear of starting again.

My family is essentially splintered and no one is close anymore. Everyone is divided into camps and being around any of them is a pretty horrid affair due to all of the negativity.

I've always been okay on my own and operating at an arms length with most people. I don't know why but I find it becoming exceedingly depressing to know that all I have are the things I've worked for and no real deep relationships that would enrich ones life. Of the few friends I have, they're all tied up with raising a family or something along those lines to which I cannot truly relate.

705,jayr777,1637975586,1,"it’s so hard to live like this. like i know im ugly and super hideous compared to literally anyone, even like the most average normal looking person is so much better looking than me. i know im unattractive, but people shove it in my face. some people talk about me, backbiting, and I hear what they say, but I just try to play dumb and pretend like I can’t hear, so it’s less embarrassing. Other times, people straight up out loud in my face, say “your ugly as SH—“, and would just laugh and literally it felt like everybody agrees. also I’m south Asian, so for me it’s even worse because people are generally racist to me, there’s literally barely no one my race at school which just makes it worse (im a senior in high school). I’m pretty isolated. I cry to sleep a lot, and sometimes when I get pushed around or bullied, I come back home and cry and think over everything that happened. At one point in my life, I cried everyday for almost a couple weeks. i just wish I had someone who cared and loved me, because I seriously need it in my life. Because of my appearance, i feel so insecure and embarrassed of what people think of me. pretty much no one likes me at school. it kinda sucks, especially when people avoid you and treat you differently, and your literally the only one who is treated like that. i just play stupid for the most part, because it’s better laugh at yourself with them, then being the one being made fun of. In reality, I’m dead inside and heartbroken. idk why, but I remember every single person, everytime in my entire life someone gave me a dirty look, or called me ugly, or looked at me in disgust. It hurts especially, when people avoid sitting with you, or just ignore you, or just plain treat you badly. It’s not that I’m fat, or short, it’s actually the opposite, im really skinny (around 120lbs), and tall (5ft 11), I could honestly be a model, but it’s just that my face is ugly and super unattractive. I mean the only thing I can think of is plastic surgery now. But of course, it’s really difficult to completely change my face into something people would like. I know people will probably say, “why change your face for others”, but honestly at this point in my life I’m convinced im ugly, and will stay like that, until I change my face. I’ve thought about taking my life, but then reconsidered, because honestly I don’t wanna die, it’s more that I just wanna have a nice life like everyone else around me. it would be nice to live a happy and simple life. it’s not that im ungrateful, it’s more the fact that people are ungrateful/hateful that I exist, which hurts. So social interaction for me is a bit difficult, and I extremely nerve-racking. I mostly stay home, and try to avoid lookin at people when I’m outside. I try to make myself happy by making and listening to music, or maybe doing simple abstract paintings, or something like that. even doing something as simple as getting a job scares me, because of my appearance. at this point, attracting a partner is far from even close to my mind, im not even gonna begin to imagine something like that, because that’s probably not gonna happen, at least in the state I’m in now. the fact that even guys (my own gender) hates me and calls me ugly, and don’t wanna talk to me, pretty much guarantees girls probably don’t like me. sometimes i just wanna be invisible, or live in somebody else’s body for a day, just to see how it feels to be liked and accepted, and experience happiness. i hope this plastic surgery thing works. i plan on getting surgery on my nose, eyes, jaw/chin, fat grafting, skin treatments, along with anything else I might need to look good. i wanna look good looking like everyone else, im not trying to come out looking botched or weird looking, im trying to naturally enhance my face. It’s sad to see perfectly good looking people being called average and sometimes ugly. because if they are considered ugly, then what am i. then I think, looking at before and after of plastic surgery patients, and think, well these people were still beautiful and good looking before surgery, im doing plastic surgery to hopefully become good looking, but i, at this stage look so bad, idk if I will actually become good looking. im hopeful that as time goes on my life will get better and this difficult time will pass, and I pray often to god for things to get better. I have so much to give if I ever get the opportunity to.

706,nostradamus_0,1637975583,1,"I've been felling like reaching out to other lonely people for a while, and so here I am. Since the end of july I've been feeling this never ending feeling of loneliness despite the fact that I talk to my friends every day.  


It's not that I'm completely alone, I do have a few good friends and with one of them i usually talk with about my problems, and that's about it. I know it's enough and I should feel grateful for having at least a few friends, but seeing everyone evolve around me, like getting into relationships, integrating in friend groups and having an overall personal life full of the perks of being a teen makes me feel handicaped and stuck.  


Also I should mention that people usually ignore me but that's plausible since I'm having a very hard time being social. To give a bit of perspective, I was at a party a while ago and there was this girl i was really looking forward to meeting for the first time, but when she arrived I just expected her to also be interested in meeting me for the first time too and come say hi to me (after which we would chat  a bit maybe?), but of course this wasn't the case, she just said hi and sat next to the people she knew, and even though it's totally logical, it alienated me even more, so while everybody was just doing party stuff I went outside because i was feeling anxious and out of place, so waited for my mom to pick me up. Maybe parties just aren't my thing. I should also note the fact that I'm fat which in situations like these you can imagine what it makes me feel like.

&amp;#x200B;

After that incident I kinda stopped believing I'd ever integrate into the teenager life like that, and decided I'd do things with the purpose of improving my body and my life overall. I've started studying harder for school in order to move to a better one, but I haven't brought myself to start hitting the gym again, though I'm definetly planning to. I just try to stop wasting my time trying to appeal and connect with people that seem to simply don't want me, but of course this doesn't mean that it doesn't wear me out. I'm obsessed with being a normal teenager and I always feel like I'm far behind any of my friends when it comes to social life.   


Simply put, it hurts. A lot. Lots of my friends or buddies talk about having sex and hanging out with lots of girls, and i feel like it's a wall between me and them. It's like I'm so tiny. I'm angry at people for not liking me but I don't want to. I wanted to be part of a group and have a place somewhere for so long so little has changed that I see most people like evil beings, only evil towards me. I'm trying to fight this feeling but sometimes it prevails, so here ia am writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like people despise me, and so i unwillingly despise them back and try to separate myself from them. It's a thing  I live with, everyday, I don't want it and it's not easy, but I'll stop complaining now.

I would like to share my whole story one day, but for right now, I’ll say I was in an abusive relationship. People always talk about love Bombs and thinking they really found something magical and special. This was not true for me. I found someone I knew was abusive, and I let them abuse me. Why? (People walk away from this explanation with their jaws on the floor, but you probably know). 

I thought an abuser would stay. I thought if I let someone talk down to me and rape me, then at least they wouldn’t want to leave. Five years after they did, there’s a part of me that still misses sharing a bed. Not being raped obviously, just sleeping next to him. Some part of me feels like it was worth it (I know it wasn’t). 

My one other attempt at a sexual encounter in the last five years also resulted in being raped. So it’s hard to go out and ask people to touch me, even though I am starved for intimacy.

In a way, it kind of threw me off guard. She was someone that I would talk to from time to time. But, we really weren’t friends, per se. We never really had any in depth talks and we never did anything out side of work. So, it kind of threw me off guard.

I guess part of it is it actually felt like a genuine hug more so than one of the half assed hugs people give each other. I can probably count the number of genuine hugs I’ve gotten in my life that felt good (as in a “good for the soul” kind of way) on one hand and still have fingers to spare.

734,throwaway91818122,1637968836,1,"Hey, first off, thanks for taking the time to read.

For a long time, I've felt extremely lonely. I have a boyfriend, yet I still feel lonely. I crave friendship, but I fear I am never going to experience true friendship again because its harder to make friends as an adult. Is it selfish to want this? My boyfriend has so many friends, yet I have none. It feels so easy for him. I have tried to keep friends, but they have all disappeared for one reason  or another 

A lot of people on this sub seem like they have it much worse off, but I still feel so much pain. I don't want to rely on my boyfriend for all my social interaction. I appreciate him so much, but its not the same. I don't know if he can even truly understand and I feel bad always crying about the same things. I feel like I am selfish for wanting friendships when I 'already have a relationship'. 

I want to meet new people, yet I have no where where I can do so (just trust me on this). Also, where I work, 99 percent of the time I am alone. 

I feel like the best years are behind me, like it's not possible to make true friends anymore. When people are adults, they stop caring about stuff like that or something, I don't know. I feel like no one has time for anything anymore. I value true friendship so much and I just wish I could meet some new people, but it seems so impossible right now. And then, is anyone even looking for that? Do they even care? 

Some people just care about relationships, but I also want friendships to call my own. I never seem to be able to keep friends nowadays. Is this what being an adult is like? 

If it is, I think that really sucks and makes me super sad :( I dunno I can't stop crying just thinking about it. I always feel so alone (yes I am know I'm not alone alone, but it still feels like that). 

Am I ungrateful for feeling like that? I don't know what else to really say.",lonely,Craving friends,2021-11-27 10:20:36

Its not always that simple, though we can easily understand what we se (Happy or Sad), but only some can understand what the other person is feeling, meaning or thinking.

Idk what to do. Maybe I could use some support/distraction

Ilk leave the post I use to post to look for friends /talk to people right here so you get to know me a bit

Thanks for stopping by my post!

I really need people who'd understand me. I'm going through a lot, I'm very suicidal today and and so I've been the last week+ or so.

I feel very alone for not having anyone who'd understand me. Who'd get me. Who'd like to listen to me. I'm sick of being alone. I just want to hug someone meaningful to me. Someone who actually cares about me. I've been so sick mentally and physically for so many years but specially mentally (a lot more years) I'm so tired of life and how things are despite all my best efforts. I'm tired of living like this. I'm so sick of this world. And everyone in it.

So maybe if you think we'd click we can talk?

I'm looking for meaningful connections, not just chit chat, so:

For me, it's important that you don't drink, smoke or do drugs, that you're a feminist and that you're an empathetic person.

If you check all three, feel free to send me a message!

A bit about me:

-Some things I'm up to lately: stargazing, raising caterpillars (Pyronia cecilia), getting rid of some of my ants both the pest and some of the ant farms, I'm giving them away. I think I stopped liking ants. First I found them interesting now they give me the creeps! I prefer butterflies.

-I like drawing, music, science, maths, art in general, I like playing videogames too as long as they're not sexist, which is pretty hard to find sadly. I like a lot old point and click adventures, and fantasy games in general.

-I like partying all night, but not the parties most people have, for me a party would be music, karaoke, some board games and maybe some games on retro Pie, nice food and some fruit juices, all night long, maybe go out to see the sunrise at a high places that feels special.

-I like board games, table top rpgs, poetry and much more!

-I speak English, Spanish and Italian.

-I don't like dark humor, or videos where people get hurt, or stuff like that, I don't like people suffering.

-I have depression and a couple more mental illnesses.

-I'm disabled rn

-I'm up to vc if we click.

-Or we could just play some games in bga maybe.

-Bonus track: if you're British and you're studying Spanish maybe we could even do some language exchange (?).",lonely,I think I shouldn't be left alone right now,2021-11-27 06:15:37
768,justunwell,1637953463,1,"So my colleague is a really kind hearted and helpful person. We usually share memes, and have funny conversations if/when we meet. I'm relatively new to this job, like 6 months. 

I have no one to share about anything, not my emotions, not my depression or struggles. And I posted the sentence from the title of this post on my social and she replied ""try being a better friend"".

I couldn't get it, she doesn't know me at all to say this, I mean we haven't had much casual conversations, and I share very limited information. 
_______________________________

Kinda unrelated to the question but, I've been having feeling for her, it's not something I think, like when I see models, ""she's so beautiful"". The feelings come from inside like my body's telling me that, ""you like that girl"". 

I've been countering this thing by not talking to her or sharing memes, and trying to stay away from her. 

I'm starved of warmth and never hugged a girl in my life, or even held hands. I'm not talking about anything sexual. 

But this thing is for some other day. I'm weeping, I don't wanna cry and go lower. 

P.S. - To avoid any assumptions, I'm not an immature teenager, I've just never experienced love and affection. 

P.S. - I'm on meds and I'm actively consulting a psychiatrist and my therapy is gonna begin soon, but you know, in conditions like these, an hour feels like a day.

A lot of shit changes and I just keep missing the period before I started college because I was in this limbo of “im going to do something my life is going to start and things are going to change” because that’s really what I thought… but since college started I have:
-fallen in love and fallen out of it 
-lost my best friend in a way. she and I just do not talk anymore because she blocked me out of her life. she wasn’t someone who was a friend to begin with (used to really dislike me because of a mutual friend that would talk shit about me online and used to fuel this fire sometimes but we became close friends and we haven’t been since high school was coming to a close and college started)
-my close friend here in the city alienates me when I don’t wanna binge drink w him or go out w friends on some outing (he drinks a lot in general for the past year or so and it’s just getting toxic to hang out sometimes because he drinks every time we hang out now. i don’t want to be in the car w him when he’s drinking now which is always when we hang out) 
-found that I really do dislike college. I went from a CC to 2 different schools, one of them boasting how they’re the #1 this and that and is household name but i haven’t made friends at all. And it makes me feel more lonelier than I did in high school. I’m a few months from graduating but I have put so much of myself into this that I still haven’t overcame the fact that I need to get my license (I’m 21), somehow get a car, hope to find a job that’ll be better than the shit jobs I find now that won’t hire me post-college, and maybe move away for a little. But it’s going to take time and that’s not happening right now not till after graduation at least
-I smoke weed everyday all day just to get myself to do my schoolwork, eat, go on a walk, try to pressure myself on a run and once in a while I do and I hope that today is the day I go on a run but I say this to myself everyday. I also need weed just to sleep (I take lexapro and have been mediated since 15 and it’s the only thing that helps my insomnia w the addition of some sleepy time tea)

Ok. A writing that may sound very cheesy but is so entirely dear to my heart. A poem that’s so exciting. A poem that enchants a spark. 

These are my wishes that will one day come true. And if it can for me? Then it can for you.


My future love. My future heart. My future soulmate.  Wherever you are. I want you to know that I dream of these beautiful things. They mean so much to me. They hold no simple means. 


I can’t wait to meet you. To just know who you are. The man of God that will love me. The man that will treasure my heart. The one that will hold my hand while we walk together. My hand safely in his. Spending so much time together. For who can see a love like this.🌸🌺


I can’t wait until i get to surprise you. And love you so much with all my heart. Genuine love has to start somewhere. Knowing you is the best place to start.


I can’t wait until we’ve spent so many laughs together. So many loves too. And that day we both decide to practice our day of “I do’s”. No matter whom proposes first, we finally reach that day. The day we promise each other forever. Our most beautiful wedding day.


I can’t wait for endless days of surprises. Surprising you with all your beautiful dreams. I can’t wait to love you so much my future husband. I can’t wait for everything.

And finally the day where I surprise you with the biggest surprise of all. Telling you our baby made from our love is growing inside my tummy. My love, you will be the happiest of all.


All these precious moments will never hold any simple means. They are everything that so many of us want in life. These hold the deepest means. 


And mean everything to me.🌺🌸

Just find a way to naturally strike up a conversation with a classmate. Easier said than done, no pun intended, but it at least made sense.

I’ve just got out of jail about a year ago after spending a year in, and now that I’ve been out and sober for all of it, I find myself alone. Most of my family has past away, lives out of state or just won’t talk to me (and I’m fine with that!) but with it being the holidays I’ve found myself being extremely lonely and depressed lately. 

I have two awesome roommates, one who I just checked into a 90 day treatment for his Meth use, and the other who is a really awesome friend, but I feel like I lack that “deep connection” with another person.

I’m not sure what to do anymore, I’ve been fighting off suicidal thoughts and urges for so long now that it’s become second nature. I’ve tried seeing a therapist and yes, I’m taking my medications and even upped the dosage, but nothing seems to help. I’ve never been this low in my life. 

Seeing my friends in happy relationships, and the affection makes me wanna cry, or scream and I’ve had to stop hanging out with them because of that. (And yes, I’ve told them why) I’m not sure if there’s something wrong with me, or if I’m repulsive, or if I’m just destined to be single forever, but after my divorce, no relationship has ever worked out or ended well. 

Even my single friends have stopped hanging out with me because of me being “such a damn bummer all the time”

I don't want to be here in this house in this city. I have decades of memories here which I want to physically distance myself from.  I have no attachment to my things… If I had an extra one or two thousand bucks, I'd put my son &amp; my only important belongings in my car and go find a place far away from here.

It is currently 12:50Am, and just like most nights I can't sleep. Got a lot on mind, and I am just in my room gaming on PS4. I probably post more than I should, but people just seem to come chat and then POOF! ghost me every time. I don't know why. I am just here looking for friendship, and someone to talk nonsense with, laugh with, game with, send funny pictures to, and all the above and more. I am willing to chat with anyone: Male, Female, Alien from the planet Gloopenglop, Robot from the future, vampire.. ANYONE! 

I am from the US and would prefer someone from the US as well. I live on the East Coast. 

My interests are:

gaming: PS4 mostly (ask for PSN)

Photography: I have a lot of photos of nature and my cat Raven

Listening to music: My playlist is all over the place

Bowling and disc golf: For bowling I bowl on leagues and I am not too bad, and disc golf I just recently got into

Horror and Conspiracies: That's just a rabbit hole I love diving into and enjoy anything related. 

That's just a little bit about me and if any of these interests you feel free to message me, text, or we can switch to discord.

849,IllustriousPart5737,1637905756,1,"I went for an outing with 2 friends, one guy and one girl. We came separately and I was driving alone while the other came together. (I came abit later due to some house errands). For context, the other girl had a boyfriend and all 3 of us do not have any romantic inclinations to each other, we're just friends.
We hung out til midnight in a mall. Then when we were about to leave, I asked the guy if he is coming with me since our house is closer. He replied ""oh (Girl's name) can't go alone"".
And (Girl) replied back ""oh no how could I walk alone at this time???""

My car is parked in the rooftop parking lot. And her car is parked in the basement parking lot.

So we separated there. And only when I reached my car safely after clutching my keys with no one else around me, that it occurred to me...
"" how about me?""

I'm a girl too. I too had to walk alone in an empty parking lot to get to my car. They didn't know how far my car would be... And the thing that upset me most was, I didn't even think to ask them to accompany me first. I didn't feel like there was a choice to do that because being alone and looking out for myself as a girl is just something that is so normal to me. It was just a routine thing for me to have to do something by myself.

I cried for a few minutes in the car. And just felt so sad for myself. I felt at that moment, that maybe people just stopped worrying about me because I look fine being alone and seemed capable of looking after myself, unlike other girls.

I didn't become this way because I'm this way, guys. I became this way because I had no choice. I had no one to depend on, I had to learn to walk by myself and take care of myself. I was surprised that this little incident made me cry so hard in the car by myself in an empty lot, but... I was just so sad for myself.

Please don't tell me I should've ""asked"", I should've been needy or etc. The thought of doing this didn't even occur to me at the time because - I never had the opportunity to demand something like this, or gotten used to the expectation of people helping me this way and so I got used to not having that.",lonely,Just a rant,2021-11-26 16:49:16

855,Healthy_Stick4496,1637905044,1,"Hey ya’ll, first time posting here.

I’m not too sure where to start, but I believe I have some form of high-functioning autism of some shape or form but have never been diagnosed. I’m 24 and graduated high-school back in 2016, and after flunking out of my first run of college back in 2017 and working a full time job for the past few years I’ve gotten back into a university and am making decent grades while majoring in computer science.

I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety majorly and was ostracized somewhat in high-school. I have maybe 4 friends that are all busy either with work/school/children etc. and I have not had any form of relationship since my senior year of high-school (SO cheated on me and dumped me a week before prom).

My younger brother (22) on the other hand seems to be the exact opposite. He’s found himself a girlfriend that he is absolutely crazy over and has been successful in school and his social life. I’m honestly jealous over it (isn’t the older brother supposed to be the one that he looks up to and not the other way around?).

Every attempt I’ve had since HS to foster any form of romantic relationship has met with failure (most recent crush had a thing for my roommate) and I can’t help but feel as if I’m just not meant to be happy or have an SO. At 24 years old my romantic experience is extremely limited and I feel as if I am unable to foster connections like other people do and it honestly gives me a feeling of hopelessness for my future.

Anyway, idk I felt like maybe this would help me feel at least somewhat better. I’m open for questions, thanks.",lonely,Just want to vent.,2021-11-26 16:37:24

872,Ok-Painter-4192,1637897894,1,"All my life I’ve always put myself at the center of attention. Always was the first kid to get drunk. The kid who’ll try anything. The kid who’ll fight or fuck anyone. 

Then in my twenties after high school the party kinda stopped for everyone except me. I started falling in love with a new thing, euphoria, and it was my everything, and my downfall. I don’t really blame anyone, for me loving drugs, nor do I know why I fell for them so deeply but I did.

21 I first tried heroin and I have completely thrown away everything I love and cared about for her at this point. She had her icy cold fingers wrapped so tightly around my heart that by the time I realized how far I fell it was too late.

Ever since then I’ve had short bouts of sobriety maybe a month or two but usually less then a week in length. And every time I get sober I really REALLY realize how deep in this hole of loneliness I truly am. After every run I’ve lost complete trust of my parents and they are so disappointed they don’t talk to me for the first couple of weeks. My friends are all gone, years of watching me destroy myself and they could only take so much. But I’ll quickly find a girl who seemingly loves me with all her heart. And we fuck and have amazing sex every time. We’re sober we’re gunna move in with each other sometimes. Life is just gunna be alright. I blow everything else off, who cares that my parents don’t love me, that my friends are gone, she loves me!

By the time my parents come around to talking to me again they tell me what a terrible idea it is. “Oh you’ll only bring her down, you’ll turn her into a junkie, or I don’t care about her”. Or sometimes they’re just brutally honest and say “yo you codependent dumb fuck, your gunna throw away your life and sobriety over some hot blonde”(paraphrasing ). And to give credit where credit is due out always the hot blondes who are my downfall. 

Regardless the point is my parents are completely right. I’m a codependent hardcore heroin and fentanyl addict. And what always happens? The girl ends up finding someone more stable, who drives a nice car, who has a great job, for someone older, better looking, or sometimes for no seemingly good reason whatsoever. And in hindsight I should have seen it coming. This is what always happens, I always say I’m not gunna fall in love, that it’s just “meaningless sex” then she tells me she loves me, then I fall for her, then it’s over and I never see or hear from her again, other than the occasional Snapchat.

Then comes my fall, and I don’t blame her it’s my fault for being so weak. Just heroin is the greatest lover I have ever come to know. When she’s in my veins I feel warm and loved and safe. Seeing the blood draw up in the syringe is like that moment right before a powerful orgasm, then you push that plunger in and blast off!! The whole world seems to melt away and it’s just me and porter Nirvana. I’m desperately spending my last penny to feel her embrace one more time because it’s sooooo much better than any lonely shitty reality that I wake up in. I need more and more and MORE. Very soon I’m banging half grams, then whole grams.

Well last Saturday I overdosed, after 100 something days of sobriety (the longest I’ve ever had). I thought what I had was the same stuff I bought the day before turns out it was mostly fentanyl. Now I don’t mind fetty but I was being sold almost pure heroin, as in more heroin then fentanyl mixture. So while I was dope sick desperately tearing my bags open I didn’t notice the different stamp on the bags. I poured a .9 in my spin filled with water, and sucked up into my syringe. I was found dead on the floor of a gas station bathroom, truly alone, cold, and lifeless, needle still in my hand. Well after a hospital visit 4 shots of narcan, and restarting my heart I’m still here. Nobody knows I overdosed except a couple of friends, and know y’all. So yea, if you feel used, vastly empty, and chronically alone, your not, I’m here alone with you. 

Since getting sober before my relapse I have not used anyone. I had been honest and kind to people, I had a good amount of friends. But since I left the program I’ve lost like 99% of those friends, and my lover, and my one thing I can’t escape has turned her back on me once again. So yea I feel used, vastly empty, and chronically alone. I can’t believe that I was dead. When I woke up in the ambulance I was so confused. I’m still shaken up pretty badly but I haven’t used since Sunday.",lonely,I’m a codependent heroin addict.,2021-11-26 14:38:14

Although I am young I have already fallen victim to many vices that are of detriment to my well being. I’ve struggled with substance abuse issues for a long time, well to be honest I don’t entirely remember too much what it’s like being sober. I won’t spare you the details but I just felt the urge to get black out drunk and cry myself into a pit of despair, as previously stated i don’t have family my relationship is shit with them to say the least (I’m only their piggy bank )and the only “friend/ love interest” in my life stood me up today. I tried to get alcohol thru Uber eats and dooor dash but can’t since I lost my ID and now I’m mad dwelling in sorrow.

I really get the feeling that she is so into me. We have dated for about two months now and yesturday we had the talks if all talks. It was about making things exclusive between us. We decided to think of things we need and expect from our partner in a relationship and what goals we would like to set for a relationship and bring these things up the next time we meet and then wait a week to decide on our own if we want to have that kind of relationship, knowing what the other wants and needs and if our future plans are compatible. I couldnt sleep tonight because all these thoughts race in my head about what I do really want from a relationship. I wandered to explore my deepest feelings and wants and came to some kind of mental break down. I also have tears in my eyes writing this. For all the time I have known this girl, I felt loved, cared for, like I wasnt alone in this world and understood. And this is kind of all I want from a relationship tbh. Is it wrong to just wanting to have someone who makes me feel the way I described? Because I hear all those stories about ""you should love yourself first"" ond ""your feelings (negative or positive) should not depend on someone else"" and that makes me think that I am an asshole or mentaly unstable for wanting these things in a relationship.

It’s thanksgiving and I usually don’t expect much out of it but today made me feel terrible than I usually do when things don’t work out. I usually can just move on but something fell to the bottom of stomach and won’t leave. My boyfriend got sick two days ago and I’ve been doing my best to make sure he is comfy and happy while I do chores and go to work (we live together). We were originally going to go to a family gathering on his side of the family but since he was sick he cancelled. I decided to stay home so he wouldn’t be lonely and I wouldn’t mind cooking us up something just so we could have our own holiday feast. He didn’t touch any of my food and barely spoke to me today. He said that he felt perfectly fine and binged watched a show all day. I tried voicing my concern and discomfort but he ignored me and just continues watching his show. As I speak he is still watching Suits on Amazon Prime. This isn’t the first time on a holiday he has straight up ignored me or not cared to spend time with me. It’s not like he isn’t used to spending holidays with people. He spent the 4th of July with friends getting drunk and then passing out on the couch. He went to spend time with some friends and family over in Texas on his birthday at the last minute and didn’t want me to come. He still accepted my present and I wished him the best. To go back even a bit further on our anniversary he didn’t plan anything and just gave me some flowers. It was nice and I still can envision those flowers but it still makes me feel upset. So, all this is has kind of accumulated and made me sick. I’ve been staying in room for the last 3hrs crying after I cleaned up the house.

A) build my self-worth and self esteem, which I've been succeeding in, been feeling happier and more comfortable in my own skin recently. Confidence has grown thanks to this, and

B) cut out all the negative media that get thrown about nowadays. (Social Media, ""red pill"" YouTube, general modern News, etc...) It's been doing good for me, putting effort into not seeing all the political and negative bullshit.   


But still, I feel left out, the last time I've had anything close to an in person romantic relationship was when I was 12. I went to an online high school for ALL of High School, no in person connection there, and my ""high school date"" lasted a month where she dumped me extremely toxically for a guy over his voice and nothing else. When I was in junior high, I was a ghost, I never had a true group, I was an observer. There wasn't any chance for me to have a true in person relationship during my formative years, and now I'm 19 and feel lost, empty almost. I don't have my license so I can't go anywhere, can't meet anybody. 

I crave the romantic connection, an in person connection, but it seems like an impossibility in my current situation. I know I'm only 19 and I still have life to live but it's so fucking lonely not having that connection at all during my teenage years. I also know it's possible to live single, but then that's not being lonely, I'm NOT a person who WANTS to be single his entire life. I just can't do it. Don't get me wrong, I know the value of loving yourself when nobody else will, I *know* that, I'm doing good work on it.

I said wait I have some over here and when we got the house fumigated last month he told me the pest control people said that if it was factory sealed and not cardboard it would be fine.





Well apparently he was mistaken and it's not fine but he didn't tell me that so I told him its doubled factory sealed, it's in a sealed bag, a sealed plastic box, and vacuum sealed spices and broth.





He screamed at me it wasn't fine but wouldn't elaborate why.



Then when I explain again that you can tell its vacuum sealed (not condensing because when I helped pack he didnt know what that was) because theres no air he freaks out again, screams he said no it means no, and I asked why if it wasnt unsafe and he explains that it is unsafe and that after the fumigation he was told even factory sealed was not good unless in a metal can.




I cried and said he didnt need to yell and that I was only going off what he originally told me, how was I supposed to know and I said it's fine I can replace my stuff but it's not fair to call me stubborn or stupid when you with hold facts from me and didnt tell me anything....




so I havent eaten today bc he said we were going to do it 4 hours ago and I wasnt really hungry and now its 5.30pm PST and I havent eaten all day and yesterday I had only 500 calories from a frozen meal.




I'm literally dying from my depression. I'm trying to eat it's just so hard.




the motivation is just so hard




I'm disappointing everyone by not even doing the bare minimum to even survive





I didnt even add the stuff to the pot I just brought it out and said hey we have this and its sealed....




I'm seriously going to accidentally kms.




not like I'm not suicidal, but I promised myself that before making a permanent decision I'm going to try and get back on medicine (being ""happy"" doesnt matter, I've had several serious attempts and one of them was when I was ""happy"" so that if I died it wouldnt be ""impulsive"" and when I was sad out of my mind)





there is just no motivation to live.






I have things I love, hobbys I enjoy, and people I adore, but the motivation... I just cant eat. even more so when I get yelled at then yelled at again bc I was in the ER because my body was shutting down. like I'm sorry I'm trying and I know it's not enough but I'm not ""going on hunger strike just because I'm upset""

As title says, I have absolutely no friends as I recently cut off my friend of around 7yrs from high school(it's a long story..), never really been in a relationship and while my family is extremely concerned, I feel comfortable like this. To a point I get concerned myself that it's indeed not normal. From time to time I do feel lonely, but those moments are short-lived and I end up forgetting all about it for next several weeks or even months. I do have hard time letting people in and if there is even the smallest possibility of someone wanting to hang out with me, I subconsciously push them away. Something just clicks in my brain which I honestly can't explain and I suddenly feel like cutting off that person despite them being really nice and having common interests. Again, this is something I'm extremely frustrated with, I can't figure out why it happens, but I just become extremely uncomfortable with an idea of befriending someone further. At work and uni, I almost always try focusing on studying/working so people won't approach me.

They are somewhat understanding; they know that if I was suffering from leukemia or something I might also not be up to it.  However it still felt pathetic to not spend the day with anyone, and even more so regarding what I actually did.

I drove 4 hours away to the spot where me and my ex had our first meaningful date where we were decidedly dating at this point (it was a semi long distance situation).  It's close to where she lives, but I knew she would be back near my home to visit her family.  I parked, got out, sat down, said 'huh' and then got back in and drove back home.  I am not sure why I decided to do this - I think I wanted to go back to that spot, but knew it would be weird if we ran into each other there, even though I knew there was basically no chance of this happening.  Ironically, it's even weirder that I went there on Thanksgiving in lieu of spending it with my family because I knew she *wouldn't* be there.  Idk I'm really fucked up and had plenty of hours to kill today so I said whatever.

But it's still unnerving having the self-awareness of how bizarre the whole day went.  Shh only you guys know so don't tell anyone.  I just wish I had a normal, healthy brain, and a sense of a normal life.  I thought this would finally be the year I had someone to bring to my family for the holidays, that I could finally meet hers.  But no, instead it's been another year of further brain rot and increased hopelessness. 

I so desperately wish this could be a great part of the year, but for the past decade it's routinely been the worst - Thanksgiving and my birthday in the same week, and Christmas only a few more down the line.  Every year it gets lonelier, the years pass by, the only changes are for the worse, and I can only try to grasp to hopes and possibilities, knowing they will pass through my fingers like the others have.

I do surveys for a few bucks extra and sometimes they get very invasive (they dont warn you) asking about mental health and social life and how I feel about my life.  You can imagine the social questions are day ruiners but one really went there and asked ""if you had an emergency at 3 am would you have someone to help you?""  A lot of times I don't even know what the surveys were for.  But thanks for the 30 cents!  How could they not think that type of question might put someone in an unalive state?  The only thing worse is when the situation actually occurs.  Like when my car battery died late night last week and I had to pay $60 for a jump. (Well there went survey earnings)

I'm pretty fine on my own but confronting emergencies really drives it home.  If you get depressed over constantly being asked where you are on the food chain of life don't bother with surveys.  Yeah one minute your being asked about Pepsi and the next if anyone cares you exist.  For 25 cents lol.

921,cityhomesteader,1637880527,1,"Wasn’t sure which sub to put this in, so please let me know if there’s a better one. 

Some context: 
Parents and I aren’t close. My mother is highly anxious (and definitely the source of my anxiety). Dad is pretty quiet, which I prefer. I think he knows I don’t want to share or I inherited the same familial silence. Either way, he’s often telling me he’ll “talk to her” about the things she says and does. To keep it short, she’s really overbearing. I’m almost 30 and when I come home (I live 1000 miles away permanently, been doing so for 10 years) she doesn’t allow me to do anything on my own. 

At first it sounds nice, someone to cook and clean for you. She takes it too far, whenever I’m making myself food she’s hovering making sure I’m doing everything “right”. She doesn’t allow me to use the stove (any time I try she rushes over and turns it off). I’m an only child and there’s a reason I live 1000 mile away, and I limit my visits home to twice a year. Since I’m the only child, I have to take care of them. 

The meat of it: 

I was supposed to spend thanksgiving with my bf and his family. I did last year when I couldn’t travel, and I get along with them so much better. My parents last minute asked me to come for two weeks. When I say I can’t my mom cries and then I’m the villain. 

I’m really sad I can’t be with my bf and his family today, and I feel like I’m annoying all my friends I’m texting today. I just feel lonely and sad and I don’t know what to do with myself for the rest of the day. 

I guess - how are you all? Tell me about your day or something you’re excited to do?

Thanks anyone who read through that, lol.",lonely,Spending thanksgiving with parents,2021-11-26 09:48:47

The repetition of my emotions are unbearable! It is likend to the classic tragedies of old, like the old plays written in ink before the era of film, I fear that every minute of my life will remain as dreadful as my present and my past, and all my dread is set in stone, like a character fated to walk an endless path of torment, like Sisyphus pushing his torment across endless mountains in the form of a boulder. And each time I reach a peak, the cycles repeat. To remember myself a couple of years ago is to realize what manner of beast I have become. I have been reduced to such torment, and that torment defines my days... It defines me. The envy I once felt to community, friendship, and family, has transformed into pure and bitter hatred. I desired a world, where all men are imprisoned in anguish! A world where I can be at peace through the graceful embrace of death, my mother. And my brothers and sisters in humanity can finally be magnified with in her bosom. A world of no more pain or laughter. A world of true peace.. But now that is a far-away dream.

The reason I am here is to ventilate my thoughts and hopefully shed some light on my situation, so my ex-partner moved out July 2020 (This is not a sob story) things just didn't work out, she wasn't ""my person"". But it was my longest relationship, the first I lived with.

I've tried dating sites, we know they suck but it's worth a shot sometimes.. I'm struggling maybe I am trying too hard?. I don't have a clue what I am doing anymore people just don't seem interested, its like I'm boring them

I don't know if I'm fully healed or not or i'm desperate to be happy again.. those are only questions I can answer. I could talk to family but as a man vulnerability takes a hold of me and then it starts to feel like embarrassment.

OK, to start off, I have a geography trip on Monday (I'll basically just be doing some research and stuff), so today we were preparing for it. My teacher walks to me and says something like this, ""\[name\], can you make sure you can be with a group (of students) on the trip, we have to be able to manage all of you"" and various stuff like this (very privately). At the end she says, ""You know why I am talking to you dont you"". This hurt me (unintentionally; im sure my teacher is sympathetic). I do have friends. Close friends who would consider me their best friend. Just not in that class. It got me thinking, have i got serious problems? does it appear that way to others?

for context, my class is literally made up of those ""popular"" people, the ones who might vape, who are at the bottom of the class (basically the dodgy ones, I don't know how to describe it). Am i expected to make friends with them?? 

Everything would be going fine if my teacher hadn't said this. I'm also getting increasingly existential about my future; I know i have a future (I'm doing well at school), I just cant see myself going to a boring job everyday, having nothing to life for. In fact, what do i have to live for even now?

one more thing (sorry for making this post so long); i know people say friends dont matter too much at my age (14 btw). and that i wont know them in the future, but it matters that i am still... going through all this for that reason (?)

983,BJP-GOP,1637855017,1," 

I can’t believe I’ll be a “man” soon, I still feel like a kid. In January I’ll turn 18, it feels a bit scary because my whole life I’ve had to lie about my age when making certain accounts, I don’t know I feel old. I know you read that last sentence and thought “Oh god, this kid.” But really I do feel old and I think it’s because my life is so eventless. Nothing happens during my summers, I wish something fun happened. Every break, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Spring Break, during the summer I would get so depressed because I had nothing to do, I was literally kind of yearning for school just so I could get 45 minutes of socialization at lunch. When the pandemic started and everyone talked about their social lives being ruined I would feel bad about myself because I had no to ever socialize with outside of school, and now others were feeling what I’ve felt for my whole life. I really got to see what I was missing out on. I don’t have anyone to be with. I can’t help but feel that I’ve been robbed of my childhood and high school experience, I’ll expand on the latter later.

I wish I got that high school experience, you know what I mean? Like late-night drives with friends, or going out to eat after school. I wish I came home at 4 or 5 in the morning after sneaking out of the house. I live in New York City, yet I never really explored my city. I wonder how it feels to be loved, I wish I knew it, that feeling. I wonder how it feels when someone really wants you to come to their party or hangout “event” for lack of a better word. I wish I was wanted more. 

Sometimes when people talk about certain things and they can all relate to each other I feel left out because I can’t relate. I can’t relate to hanging out with your friends after school. I can’t relate to being invited to a birthday party. I wish I had friends to hang out with. I wish I actually felt like I belonged, not the guy who walks in the back of the group because there’s no more space on the sidewalk. I can’t relate to trusting someone. I wish I could trust someone, I wish somebody loved me.

Have you ever been so lonely you refresh your email, hoping something new comes up? Yeah, that was me during the pandemic. I feel so pathetic writing out. 

Around December of 2020, I had my first real OCD episode, Pure-O. It’s been a lot better now, but for more than six months I was suffering. I started going to the gym though, around late May of 2021, and the gym become the highlight of my day because it was when I could get out of the house. I would be gone for like two to three hours a day. Often, I wouldn’t even go to the gym and would just walk around the city for two to three hours going places I’d never been before. It was fun, exploring the city with headphones on, it helped me forget what my life is like. I would walk through neighborhoods I’d never been to but I would never feel lost, there was this kind of wanderlust without the fear of being lost. I don’t know if that sounds corny. Going to the gym kind of gave me purpose, if I didn’t go to the gym or have a good walk, I would feel like the whole day was wasted. I had to stop going to the gym this September because I started college essays, but I’ll go back in December or January.

Not to sound pretentious but I know a lot about politics, geopolitics, and history, compared to the average person, but compared to any expert, I would be a novice, and that sucks. I don’t skate and I’m not one of those car guys. I’m not athletic, I was never allowed to be because I was never allowed to go out. Now it’s time to apply to universities, where my life might get better and my friends might come into existence.

I will be majoring in finance but I don’t know if I want to work 80 to 100 hour work weeks in investment banking, which is where everyone that majors in Finance go after the first two years of university. I don’t wanna be stuck at a job I don’t like, I wish there was a way out. Psychology, philosophy, and political science all appeal to me but don’t wanna be broke, I want money and a lot of it. I just feel like I’m lost because I don’t know where my life is headed and my life so far has just been so shitty.

On top of that, I don’t know if I have what it takes to be a man. I can’t stop feeling bad for myself. I don’t think I have what it takes to be a man. I’m not brave or strong. I’m a coward, I never stand up for myself at home or in school. I just take things and keep quiet. I wish I could punch people sometimes, but I’m smarter than my emotions and know I would get my ass beat if I ever tried anything.

1010,No_Amphibian_3838,1637836832,1,"I have never really tried to make friends before because I tend to like being alone most of the time but I've always wanted that connection with someone. I wanted someone where I only had them as a friend and they only had me as a friend sort of thing. I don't know why, maybe its because of what I seen on TV shows/Movies growing up, where the main character or one of the main characters had that one friend and they only had each other. 

I don't know how to have a conversation or maybe I just haven't found my people yet. It's hard for me to relate to anyone, I never think of the right thing to say. I always say the wrong thing to make them not want to talk to me or I make it awkward.

I know it is just difficult because I don't do it enough so I never learn how but it's hard not to get discouraged. I run away from my problems, so they never get resolved, I've been running for so long that I've run out of space. I don't know if I'll ever be better, I'm still running, I'm still trying to distract myself, still trying to forget even though I can't because they're all intrusive thoughts.

I have been in gotten attached to two romantic relationships so far and I destroyed myself being in them. The break ups were a nightmare, I think I have a Fear of Abandonment. I can't let go easy even if I know it's bad for me, I always want to make it work no matter what, I always think there is a way. I think my mind pushes them away just so I can move on, I notice they're bad for me but I still latch on so my mind makes me very clingy to push them away. When they have moved on completely then I can finally start to move on. I'm crazy I know..

I don't know if it's a good thing for me to post here but I think I'll do it anyway, I'm a little drunk right now so I'm not thinking straight I guess. I don't know why I always feel the need to overshare when I'm drunk but I guess it could be good to get it off my chest

1011,imlosingitxx,1637836814,1,"friendships, platonic relationships, non-platonic relationships, whatever. It doesn’t matter. nobody ever wants me as much as I want them. nobody ever thinks about me as much as I think of them, i’m sure of it. nobody ever values my presence in their life as much as I value theirs in mine. 

nobody ever needs me as much as I need them. and it hurts so fucking bad. I can feel my heart breaking, like literally feel it, over and over again every day. it’s heartbreaking to even wake up every morning when the only prayer you make at night is to just not wake up again. because you know it will always be this way for you and it always has and you just don’t want to have to face the pain day after day. 

my heart feels so heavy, not figuratively, but quite literally. my body feels so weak. the emotional/psychological pain that comes with loneliness is bad enough, but then when it becomes physical? I wouldn’t wish this kind of pain on anyone. 

I just spent the last 4 hours weeping on my bathroom floor, it’s become something of a ritual. it never helps, of course. sometimes I wish I would stay numb and apathetic, other times I just wish I could scream and cry my heart out. It doesn’t solve anything tho. I can cry all night if I want, nobody’s hears me. nobody’s coming to save me. 

Tonight I cried because I went out with an old coworker of mine a few nights ago and before we went out he was so interested and confessed he wanted me and he was texting me nonstop and then we went out and the texts got slower and shorter and shorter and he’d gone from texting me paragraphs to responding with a “yeah” or “no.” And maybe it’s the fact that I was awkward the whole date because I haven’t gone out in so long and I felt really insecure and not pretty enough and I told him not to stare at me bc eye contact made me nervous which threw him off because I wasn’t this shy insecure person when he first met me. 

I’m sure he’d respond if I told him to come over to my place tho. figures. 

And i’m so angry at myself because I get attached so fucking easily and I catch feelings too fast and then i’m left thinking about someone who isn’t thinking about me. missing someone who doesn’t miss me. not being able to sleep at night wondering what went wrong and why nobody can ever be as crazy about me as I am about them.

About the stars that fill polluted skies

I’m currently married but my wife and I are separating as we realized we aren’t really meant for each other. Not to mention she has a little resentment towards me for being trans and not like in a mean way she’s not transphobic or anything it’s just she married someone and now I’m changing she was even ok with and supportive of it at first but since I started hormones it became real so I can’t blame her. Then I’ve never been that close to my parents and coming out didn’t help so I’m not getting any support or affection from them. And I have zero friends (physically). Again none of this is news to me but saying it out loud just crushed me and I feel more alone then ever and that’s saying something because I literally felt invisible growing up.

You try to shake the feeling that you caused it because maybe he just got stuck or is having a hard time focusing.

I'm 17 and in highschool and everytime I see a group of people with their friends or loved ones I get jealous, I wish I had that. But I'm very lonely, I tried to change who I was, I went out to hang with people, and I participated in clubs. In the end it always ended up me being forgotten. People forget I exist the only time I exist is for answers or I'm just the only one left to talk to. I see kids phones blow up with snaps or other apps, texting many people while for me I have nothing.  I wish I had people from school snap me but people don't care about me. I sit by myself where ever I go, no one wants to make plans with me, and I'm always forgotten. Sadly it has been like this for as long as I can remember, I'm used to it at this point but sometimes I breakdown wishing for friends or get jealous of others .

I have pretty bad anxiety and other mental issues but I can manage those fairly well. So I thought it won't be too tricky to meet new people. Been here almost 6 months and it just hurts. Don't get me wrong, I've met people, I've made some friends but nothing like the ones I used to have in my home town. 

My life has been rough, I won't go into detail but just.. rough. I only say that because it means I can't just open up to people I barely know. I've silenced rooms of people that I've known for years with a simple story, that I thought was no big deal. People don't know how to react to my life and it makes it very hard to make any connections because I have to wait and wait and potentially be boring until I can finally tell them interesting things about me. Because unless they already like me, hearing my stories can be jarring and its an easy way for people to distance themselves. I know I'm more than my past but it's a different friendship when they know where I've come from, a more fulfilling and fun one.   


 I just want to be able to text someone ""heya whatcha doin today? Wanna go shopping, I need a new pair of pants""  and have it not be a big deal. I just want a hug, I want someone to talk to, to actually invite me out because they want to see me. Someone who I can connect with.

So, I know people on discord are not that important in our lives as they cant much change our life... But more than a year ago, someone saw my messages in the reply of one post. They texted me and they accepted me for who i am and were always there even tho i was so bad and rude... They even introduced me to 2 of their friends... Everything was great. There were few fights that ended up solved... But for last month, it seems that they just started to not care, and that they need a brake... But, it all escalated to them leaving me and not accepting  me back... I cant even describe how sad and hard it feels for them to say that. They were the most important person I knew, since nobody accepted me like they did. And now, I asked here on Reddit if we can be friends. Lets just say the response was more than just negative...
And now, Im only left with 2 friends... Both say they like talking to me, but i think they had enough as well... They always ignore me suddenly and sometimes just seem like they dont care and want to end the short conversation. So, the problem of me being absolutely not social, I decided to join a server from a youtuber Dani. I said hi few times, and someone dm me. Now, the ""about me"" was *blushes* and they probably saw it and went along... But i forgot i even had that ""about me"" and I emediatly knew that this person is not gonna like me. So i asked my 2 friends to help me and tell me what should i say. Now, I knew that if the person knew how much of a pu##y I am, that they would be disappointed... So I blocked them and now i feel bad.. I wanna tell them who I am and how I talk, but Im afraid they will leave me... 

So my anxiety, sadness, low social skills, misunderstanding and saying ""sorry"" is not cured... I just wish someone would love me and just show that they care like the person i told you about did, even tho it was all probably just fake... But that will probably not happen again... Like what are even the chances that someone randomly texts you and treats you like nobody else yet did? Extremely low or none.

1084,linosan,1637800872,1,"When someone asks me if I would like to be in a relationship, I often have doubtful feelings. 

On one hand, holding a relationship for long would be really hard for me, especially with people who are way different from me—which’s the case of most of the people in the world. This often makes me not want to be in a relationship at all, knowing that in order to keep it alive I would have to sacrifice a lot of myself for it, and I don’t see any reason why this could be worth it.

On the other hand, the fact that being in a relationship is so far from my reality is exactly what it makes this idea interesting. Just like a Greek hero who’s about to start a new adventure, or a Viking who’s surprised to see a desert for the first time, being in a relationship would be something so new to me that it makes me want to experience it ar least for once. 

Right now, I’m a bit inclined to say I would like to have this experience and see how it feels. Yet, it’s still really difficult. I mean, if making friends in school is hard to me, having a girlfriend is impossible.

At least this year we did. I did make plans twice and only once did that work out but they ended up leaving a couple of hours later, which really bummed me out considering we were meeting after a while.

1125,fittykrab,1637785363,1,"So, I am a 22 year old male, who is trying by himself to cure from stress disorder and religious OCD, stay in shape and eat healthy.  I am lonely right now, for a year, all my relationships with previous friends are broken, and i was feeling lonely from 15-16 years even at the time i hade up to 10 friends. I felt lonely even then, because after the bullying i got at 15 years old at school, all my communications with friends were different, i felt like everyone is together and I am the first, but when something happens, some event I am not invited. I had more brain capacity to take life, instead only drinking and partying, so i left my friends at age 19 and went to work with a good salary, girlfriend left me long ago too, even if i have few people which i would text some thing, it is rare.  So year ago, when i was drunk i broke my collarbone and went for 2 months without normal sleep, cause i couldnt sleep on any side, only on my back ( i m not that person) + my shoulders were immobilized,  2 weeks after bone break, my girlfriend left me, and i had big struggle trying to get her back. One day i woke up with some broken TV visual effect, which later occured to be HPPD ( i tried once at summer w friends some shit) so it got effect on me.  I got scared, i went for doctors, they gave me XANAX and some other shit, i didnt knew what i was drinking, but my nervous system and mental being went to cosmos, i couldn't sleep without those, when i close my eyes, till now - i see broken TV (hppd) and it bothering me for a year. After all this prolonged stress, i got stuck whit religious fear. Was learning about 6 months. Now trying to cure from OCD.  I don't know what to do. I feel broken, won't say more. Cause this is enough, one word, broken. I don't have such more energy to move forward like before. I  need an advice. I can't even work (glad i m working by myself and can go work whenever i wan't, but my job is annoying me- food courier) i make good money here in my country by that, but you expect whats this job is.  
I see, how everyone are moved forward, having cars, social contacts, girls. Everyone is moving. And I am only moving in my anxiety. Alone. I even know, that trying to tell anyone about that is stupid, cause all my people i would know, they probably would not care and would not even try to help, instead would offer me to get drunk. I quit any type of drinking btw.   
So, my main struggle is that don't know what to do best now for my life, i m feeling old, even knowing I am young, but when i see how others live, i know i m not using my age right. Which gives me more depressive toughts. I live in a country, where everyone are for himself, and bullies, alcoholics and etc. Our country is top 3 in alcoholism. I can't find any friends or girls who won't party, won't drink. I live sporty healthy lifestyle from now, that's messing with me too. Help.",lonely,"I would like to tell a story, if you listen.

1137,Sensitive_Ad_8472,1637781080,1,"I want to be super clear that these are not hate-on-introverts threads. I don’t hate my family for how they are, it’s just hard to be different and it’s always hard to face an expectation to be something you just aren’t. Introverts do face that on a larger scale, but that does not invalidate the challenges I am facing. I feel there is no way I’m the only one facing these challenges and I want to connect with others and talk about how being extroverted feels and works in isolation. 

I do believe it is also a spectrum but I am pretty darn extroverted. I recently moved to the country with my chosen siblings who are also introverts. I don’t think that introverts are less good, and I don’t wish my siblings were extroverted. I just feel really sorry for draining them all the time and I wish we could add some more extroverts to our family.

I also understand that people who lie about being extroverted aren’t lying to me on purpose, they are probably just confused about who they are as I was for a long time. I brought it up because I want people to know it does not help me when you pretend to be an extrovert. I end up draining you and feeling like a horrible monster, and it ruins friendships. There have been a few friends I have lost where I really wish they’d had the courage to tell me how they are up front. 

I know I can’t be an introvert so I am trying to do everything I can to make more friends. I hate feeling like a vampire, and I end up “frozen” 🥶 or stuck on the couch a lot because I’m not charging. It is hard to even get up and drive to town or something when I’m feeling so drained. I am still working at it and trying so hard.

Of course I can get hugs from relatives and all, but I don’t have anyone that I can walk up to and ask for a hug that will really feel super affectionate. I was told by someone who I also ranted to that my love language is physical touch and affection, and I get none of that. My friends and other things i do every day help me cope and get away. I go out with friends multiple times a week and I do a lot, but I get so sad and heartbroken and depressed every night by myself when I’m in bed because I just don’t have that affectionate love that I need.

I want a female figure in my life, mainly a passionate parter my age that will just give me what I need, which obviously states many times, just some physical affection that’s meaningful. I almost had it this year, and even had a GF. In fact, I actually got held and comforted. But she practically threw me away soon / days after, so it made things worse and it doesn’t feel real anymore. That was a bad feeling. To put the cherry on top, the GF I had practically cheated. Destroyed my mentality… am I even worth it? Girls and even guys too in public just sometimes… look at me funny or dont treat me as serious as I’d wish. All of this makes me feel not wanted or loved… even with the friends I have.

It really has destroyed my confidence that I attract no females. Screws with my head. I have all the intentions in the world to treat a girl with respect, kindness and true love. I am a willing person for a serious relationship, why can’t a girl fall in love with me? Why can’t I attract anyone…

Like most people on this sub, I'm an introvert, and I find small talks and courtesy conversations utterly pointless. When people say ""how's your day?"", do they really care about how my day is going? Of course not. Most people are so self-absorbed that they are literally incapable of viewing the world objectively. They are just asking because that's what society expects them to do, and that makes it even worse, that people are just mindlessly spewing out words they don't mean like a bunch of text-to-speeches following a script.

On the other hand, I am probably the least interesting person on the planet. Lately, I've realized that I am incapable of forming emotional opinions. Every thought I have is a fucking analysis, weighing pros and cons, trying to create a metric to find an objective answer. The other day I saw two of my classmates, upon seeing their friend in a car, hoped in front of it like a pair of fucking circus monkeys.

I’m visiting my family for the holiday, but the person I’m most there to see right now is my mom. We’re both in recovery, both have over a year sober, and this is one of my first times seeing her with a clear head in years. She originally abandoned me as a kid and did her thing. Since then, we’ve both gotten better and have a relationship now (thank god). We got to talking about the past, with less discretion since we’re both addicts I guess. She brought up some graphic shit from our past, and filled me in on a lot of details that I didn’t know and not sure I needed to know as her son. I told her I forgive her (because I have) and I know she was doing her best. But whenever I went to bed, I pretty much broke down. I’ve done work over that stuff but there’s so much shit that hasn’t been touched on I’ve come to realize and realized how hurt I still am. I really need a friend right now, or something.

But now I'm like completely isolated, live alone, no job due to anxiety, and am so anhedonic that i have no interests or hobbies. I live in a constant state of boredom. I also just like get shit, idk how to explain it, so a lot of things to me are just 'it is what it is, i understand it' which doesn't lean well to good conversation. I like thinking about deep stuff, like human nature and the human condition, but unfortunately the answers I've sound so far seem quite cynical -- again, not good for convo.

My days are all boring, so there's nothing to talk about there. I haven't had friends in a year and a half, and for the 4 years before that was just going through hell with an abusive relationship and a bunch of other shit -- even for a about 3 years before that things were in the 'starting to fall to shit' phase which isn't good convo. On top of that, my memories terrible and I don't really remember good stories from my life or anything to tell. I only remember depressing shit, and I even have to push myself to remember that shit, and still can't in any exact detail. Idk why my memory is so bad, but it is.

I have terrible social skills as well, because I've always been shy and have been really isolated for a long time. People say I'm funny at least, but I used to be really funny and now I'm nowhere near as much, so I never feel funny. I feel like I have nothing to give people. I feel like I neither know how to have a conversation nor have anything to have one about. I feel like I don't even know who I am, let alone how to be me anymore. I always feel like I'm slightly acting. I think that's because of what I've just said, and a life of shit situations that fucked me up in that way.

It sucks. I just get ghosted all the time. And what's worse is I live in a tiny country called Northern Ireland, and it's impossible to find anyone online who's from there, but I just want real life friends again. Then again I'd just be boring irl too, bc idk what even to do to have fun rly. I do, but idk if it's other people's idea of fun.

Sorry for the long, ranty, depressing post. I made this way too specific for anyone to fully relate to - and it's too much at once for anyone to relate to anyway - but I kinda just hope some people relate to at least some of it so I don't needa feel as alone in this, or as weird.

1227,Sufficient_Thought56,1637726938,1,"This is my first post anywhere in Reddit. I’m sorry I just need to vent.

I graduated college in the beginning of the pandemic and I soon started an online business which did pretty good for the first year, and it requires me to work from home. A dream right? Fuck. No.

See I had a massive falling out with my 2 college friends after graduation. It was a pretty traumatic situation. The kind where a friend group decides one person is no longer ‘in’ and they’re kicked out. I don’t blame them, but it hurt so bad and has made me so untrusting. I’ve never been good at keeping friends around so they were some of my last ones, I don’t have any from high school or anything. And I’m terrible at forming new friendships. I can talk to someone at the bar, but when it comes to following up, I’m so so bad. 

I’ve slipped further into isolation than I have in my entire life. I have stopped interacting with the one friend I have left, they’re very understanding, but we talk maybe once a month now because of me.

I live with my boyfriend, who I am so grateful for, but I would be lying if I said my isolation and anxiety hasn’t taken a major toll on our relationship.

I’m afraid to leave my house now. It takes 3 hours on average to get out and go to the store or post office, that is, if I can manage to leave my house at all in a day. I frequently go days and days without leaving the house. And possibly weeks without speaking to another person other than my boyfriend. I feel like I’m going insane. I want to get a little job at a grocery store or something just to see some people on a regular basis, but I am so socially anxious about being in the world. 

It’s getting to the point where I am suicidal again. I’ve attempted once in the past, and obviously failed. I’ve relapsed in my eating disorder. I haven’t relapsed in s/h but I think about it constantly. I’m to the point where I just want to go to bed and not wake up. I can’t stop thinking of methods. The thing stopping me is that my little brother just got hospitalized for suicidal ideation. So there’s no way I can cause more worry when my parents are already so stressed about him. 

If anyone has any advice or evidence it can get better please let me know. I’m getting so so tired",lonely,Work from home - so alone.,2021-11-24 15:08:58

I still miss him despite his flaws and I loved him just the way he was but I still feel guilty even though he has already gotten over me.

I just ruin my friendships, I try to be in a good mood to talk to them but I can't. I try to socialize with my classmates but I feel like a stranger when I start talking about my hobbies. The psychiatrist told me that I have to socialize more, but I've already did! Everything and I can't relate qith the people anymore. I'm just just a hollow body which his friends left him a long time ago.

I hate being treated like a sex toy and someone just to blow off steam. I did it too but I've tried not express myself, it feels horrible when you don't have someone to write to you to see how you are and to be nice to you just once. It's disastrous the fact that even the past consume myself more and more.

I no longer enjoy things like I used to, I just start crying at night and in the morning because my thoughts don't let me be a normal person. The only choice for me is to the death, but I can't even do that as I'm afraid of committing suicide and I can't stop cutting my chest anymore. All I have is a damn plushie, sometimes I don't know if it's okay to talk to an object that can't even answer you.

Afraid of being discriminated just because I have other preferences.

We knew eachother for over a year through a game. Somehow we always clicked and it was always so easy to talk to him, even before we started dating. We were two broken pieces that complemented eachother. He made me feel so good. The time i spoke with him took all my worries and problems away. I was in a very dark place when we first started talking. We both were. And we took eachother out of it. But after the breakup i fell again in that place. And it's even worse then before.amd i don't feel comfortable talking about it with no one but him. But he kind of disappeared. I tried to talk to my friends, people i know for like 20 years. It seems so odd to them, they make me feel so odd and i shut down again. We grew up togather but i don't really know why I am still friends with them. I felt more connected to this guy that i had never even met in person then another persons i met in my real-life. So with the breakup i lost my boyfriend, my best friend and my shoulder to cry. I am not saying that it is his fault I'm feeling like this. Part of it surely is. But it mainly just evoked things that were already there but were just hiding for a while. Im trying to get better. I cannot really afford a therapist right now. So I'm just trying to with things therapist used to tell me in the past.  Last few days have been horrible. Especially last night. I texted my ex telling him how bad i was. He responded very kindly. I'm surprised he responded in the first place. But other then just a few kind words that was it. He was not really there. It felt like he was doing it out of courtesy. It crushed me even more. I was there on his darkest days and we were not even dating at that time. Not out of pity, or courtesy. Because i cared. Because i would have wanted someone to do the same for me. Now he could do the same for me but he didn't. He didn't even asked how i was doing today. Like he didn't care. Makes me think if anything we had was ever real. Breakups happen and people leave all the time. But how can you erase love in just a few days? How can you stop caring so fast? I want to know and to learn to do the same. I really do. Was it just all a lie? A lie that went to far? On my part my feelings are all real. It's strange but all real.

Never in my life have I been this relaxed. It’s feels surreal to know that I don’t always have to be hyper vigilant now. That I don’t have to watch my every move and judge what kind of reaction it would get. It’s not like walking on land mine anymore now fearing which step would blow off. 

Though I am way back in academics now and struggling with health issues now I see hope of light in future. Heck I even used all the money i had to buy myself a nice pair of shoes. And booked a trip around Christmas holidays. Hoping to start the new year on a good note. I even booked myself for a marathon.

1252,Shkotz,1637713307,1,"Over the past few years, I have developed facial pain on one side of my face. For a while I had no idea what it was, a dental, TMJ or a neural issue. After seeing countless specialists, we ruled out any dental issue or nerve issues. So I've been diagnosed with a-typical facial pain.

My doctors don't see anything wrong with me on paper, I've tried all sorts of medications and even after getting botox, I still feel pain. I'm at the point where I just give up and try to live with it. 

When I'm alone for a long period of time (which is almost always, I work from home and live alone) the one side of my face gradually begins to tense up and a dual achy pain persists. I learnt that when I'm around good company, the pain isn't there, but if I'm in a very anxious situation, I will feel it as well. It drives me crazy that something that is out of my control can cause me chronic pain.

I used to not dread being alone, I liked being cooped up in my own apartment, and not have to deal with the outside world, but now, that is taken away from me. 

Some evenings, it gets so bad, that I have to go out and walk around outside, just to distract myself from the pain. Alcohol also helps with the pain, but after almost drinking myself to death, I realized that it isn't going to make things any better in the long run. At one point I would polish a full bottle of bourbon (750ml) every night, just to make the pain go away. 

I can't take up things like reading or adopting a new hobby, because I can't focus anymore. At work it's a little better, since I am interacting with my coworkers, which seems to be helpful.

I miss the days where I was able to just curl up and read a good book, and disconnect myself from the world around me. But now, all I feel is pain and loneliness that keeps me tethered to my existential dread.",lonely,Facial pain when I feel lonely or very anxious,2021-11-24 11:21:47
1253,ldasjflkdjfslajdls,1637712865,1,"23F  
This might sound like a big jumpled mess but lately more and more I'm realizing that nobody in my life really takes me seriously or even truly cares about how I feel. For the past decade I've just been the funny friend who's always there to put up with other people's venting or abuse and then I had a few years where I was really awful to people because of my mental illness and they seemed to take me more seriously during that time but now that I'm better (in that sense) nobody takes me seriously at all despite everyone forgiving me and acknowledging that I've gotten better socially.  


People in my life don't even take the comments I say about things just trying to make conversation in a positive way or seriosuly, they just think I'm being stupid and have to prove me wrong until I google what I was talking about and show them and they get mad and say ""You really had to prove yourself right about this? None of this matters!"" Well it apparently mattered enough to you that you had to tell me that what I'm saying can't be true. I've had the people that I live with literally google things on their phone while I was still speaking just to see if I was lying or wrong so they could prove me wrong.  


Every day I get judgement on the state of my bedroom or my appearance, ie being called lazy or gross or that I smell and that I'm fat and I'm supposed to just continue the rest of my day pretending that it doesn't hurt me because if I act like it did then a fight starts. My bedroom is a fucking mess because of my severe depression that is only furthered by dealing with everyone in my life thinking I'm some kind of joke or punching bag. When I talk about things sometimes the people around me disagree with it on purpose (yes, on purpose, I've asked them why they do this and they said because it's fun for them to) just to start arguments with me. The same people asking me why I stay in my room all day. Surprise, it's to avoid dealing with you.  


I think I am treated like this by everyone in my life becasue I'm unemployed. I'm unemployed because my mental illness has crossed the line of being a disability, I'm not able to do things at work without having panic attacks or crying, I'm really slow at everything I do and I need to be redirected because I lose focus so often. I have ADHD and I think autism as well. I don't know if I can even survive the rest of my life with these issues considering society favors people who are actually capable of keeping a job.  


I try to ask for help for these things but it's met with passive aggression or anger. I'm told that ""I'm not helping you, you should know how to do this yourself."" I'm so tired. I feel so alone because I don't feel a single connection to anybody in my life because they all think I'm stupid and only care about their own interests or lives and I don't want to annoy anybody more than I already do so I just fill my life with fiction or video games to avoid reality because it hurts so much.

Sometimes, I feel like my old self, driving my car, playing video games, going for a walk, or reading a book, most times I feel like someone new. Me, but a newer, more experienced me, and older me, a me without her.

Sometimes, I feel like she is just in the other room, or that she'll call me up, and we'll talk like we always used to do.

On my last non-virtual year of college (I graduated 2020) I met the most amazing woman. We met at a bar where we danced and kissed. I forgot to ask for her social media (this was my first kiss so I was nervous). Turns out , we are in the same major. I run into her at college months later, but she had gotten back with her ex. We were still friendly with each other. Eventually they break up and I try to ask her out and she agrees. We go out a couple of times but it is clear she isn't over him, so I gave her space.

Next year, at the beginning of 2020, we are classmates. Start talking again a little in class but less than a month after the semester starts, it goes fully virtual due to covid. I went back to my parents house (not a good environment to say the least) and with all that's going on I start loosing it. I wanted to ask her out again, this time make it clear I want it to be a date, confess my feelings, just keep talking but I can't. I'm agonizing over what to text her, would it seem irresponsible if I suggested meeting up in person? What about a zoom date? That's pathetic, I'm pathetic. Anyway... I was not at a good place. I start going to therapy and it helps. Download Tinder, and holy shit, I matched with her. I finally decide to be brave and ask her on a date, and call it a date. She nicely rejects me, soon after starts dating a guy she met on Tinder. She is still with him today and they seem very happy.

I was sad about it for a while, but I convinced myself she never liked me back anyway. Until I got the message that is in the title. I posted one of those links where people leave you anonymous confessions on my private story, one of the messages was ""if things had been different, we would have probably gone out and been more than friends"". As soon as I got it I checked who had seen the story and there was no way it wasn't her.

1284,Sensitive_Ad_8472,1637695079,1,"This is not a joke.

I’m a lonely extrovert. I come from an introverted family, and my whole life (until I was nearly 30, 34 now) I believed I was an introvert with something wrong with me. I guess that could be another way to describe being an extrovert with limited social skills (they have gotten a lot better!) and social anxiety (I’ve also been able to work on and had a lot of progress).

I feel the need to use some definitions at this point, because I see “introvert” and “extrovert” get tossed around to mean different things. I’m using extrovert to mean I get energy from being around people. I spend energy being alone, which is how an introvert would get energy. To me being an introvert sounds like it would be -way- better, because I could have energy all the time without needing to do all kinds of hard work on myself. Maybe the grass is always greener on the other side.

There are hardly any resources for lonely extroverts. I found one article about it, literally only one. It said I should do puzzles and play guitar. I do try to play guitar now, but I am not very good and it is hard to find motivation. I see why the article said to try guitar, but this article was (transparently) written by an introvert. I feel like playing guitar can charge my battery like the engine charges the battery of my car, but it won’t be able to if it wasn’t for the ignition and the starter. I need a fair amount of social just to get started.

Some other observations:

I can’t charge at work. I work in food service and basically interactions where I’m getting treated like shit are at best break even. I come home physically exhausted, and with about the same charge I left with. Unless I have a really good day. In that case I often wake up drained because I work nights and won’t even see my family until morning. I’m too physically tired to get much done at that point anyway. 

Meditation, journaling, reading and texting (and online groups like this one) give me what I think of as a “micro charge”. It’s enough to stay up on my phone all day, but won’t start the engine.

Having a small group of friends around all the time is ideal. I think 15 is a small group. Other extroverts are amazing to have around because we can charge off eachother forever without hurting eachother. Feeling like an emotional vampire makes me cry, but most of my friends are introverts because that’s most the people I connect with on the level of being socially awkward.

I can overcharge! When I am in too big of a group for too long I get zonked! Once we had unexpected visitors three days in a row and on the third day I saw them coming and hid in my sister’s car 😂! 

Animals and pets are wonderful but do nothing as far as charge goes.

People lie about being extroverts all the time because they think they are “supposed to be extroverts” when I treat these liars as extroverts it ends very bad for both of us.

Everyone always says not to settle for someone, that you should find someone who meets your standards and makes you happy. But I'm scared of finding that person again. I'm scared of letting someone have so much power to break me because what if they end up leaving again? I can't afford to go through the pain another time. 

There's a guy in school who really likes me. He's a great person and dependable. I like him a little but we don't reallyyy click. He doesn't make me as happy as I make him. But maybe being in a relationship with someone like that is safe and healthy? Coupled with the fact that he will never have the power to break me.

Western European, turned an adult (18) not long ago, found my self truly alone (literally alone, not just lonely) as a foreigner in my own home city and country.

Turned an adult not long ago, since I was 10 I moved school/city/country every year so I never built any meaningful relationships, at least nothing further from pleasant acquaintances (never been to a party or had a friend, spent all of my time alone in my room or in the gym).

When I finally finished school I moved back I had neither the social skills nor the means to meet people of my age. I mean, how do you make meaningful friendships at my age from ground 0 with the social development of a 10 year old? where do I meet people? how do people my age interact with each other? I've never dinked any alcohol due to a lack of reason to do so nor smoked.

Tbh I've been reflecting lately and I have realized that I spent most of my time either thinking about ""Oofing"" my self or doing literally NOTHING during hours, just lying down in my bed, sometimes I am sleep deprived for 4 days and others I sleep though A FULL DAY (24+h). I no longer do things I enjoyed like playing videogames, going to the gym or studying physics and math. I kind of feel like the me I can and should be is so far away that it is completely a lost cause, I feel like I am truly not worth fighting for.

I know that I am going to sound mean and that I am invalidating the problems of others, but is anyone in this sub really going through something similar? It is just that I can't imagine many people have experienced true isolation, I do get that everyone can experience loneliness but I can't help but feel jealous of people here that say that they have irl friends but are trying to meet people, or that the have friends but no close friends, or that they have had previous relationships.

If there really are people like me or people that want to help me for any reason, do you know any discord servers I might be allowed to join? can we talk? and, would you be willing to meet irl at some point?",lonely,"(not really much suicide talk other than mention) Western European, turned an adult (18) not long ago, found my self truly alone (literally alone, not just lonely) as a foreigner in my own home city and country.",2021-11-23 21:35:53

1336,ProstJane,1637655195,1,"I was just up and left by my partner of 4 year. 

I finally found an apartment to move to after having to move all our things and our cat back home, only to find out the owner was not just selfish, but literally soulless; after less than 3 weeks of my moving in (I vividly remember telling my mum where the Christmas tree would fit perfectly), she emails me and tells me she has to remain in New York while her divorce finalized, and she was going to move back in (so I was going to be moving out… 

A month after my ex leaves, I finally get the chance to get all the stuff he left behind back to him… we meet the same night I find out my co-workers have essentially done ~50% of the work in a project that needed to be completed by the following day, and - as I’m new to the team - was kept entirely out of the loop and left to finish the project overnight; he asks if I want help carrying my things to my office, where I was headed to work at 10PM, I was exhausted and let him, I realize I’ve forgotten the keys to the main door at my apartment (that I’d just been informed I would be being kicked out of that day), and out of complete and total loss, I go with my ex to his apartment nearby to rest. 

I woke up 20+ hours later and found he’d  raped me in my sleep (I take medication at night with a heavily sedating side effect).

I call 911 out of… shock I guess, he’s arrested, I’m stuck in a hospital in Brooklyn for 12 hours waiting to get a rape kit, and it felt like the very last thing every officer on the scene wanted to be doing that night was… their job? I felt like the greatest inconvenience to them all on a personal level.

I return to my apartment where the owner has now set up a bed in my living room. She makes it feel like there’s literally no oxygen in the air.

2 days later, I’m finally contacted by a detective from the responding precinct, who informs me that my ex was released as they found no evidence present to prosecute him.

The next day I gave up and booked an Airbnb until I could find another apartment, because living with the owner had become completely intolerable… I felt like every breath I took was an annoyance to her.

1345,Affectionate-Mix5043,1637651189,1,"i was in a relationship for almost three years with a guy who meant the absolute world. literally the best guy i had ever met. in the beginning of our relationship, he nurtured me so well and did so much for me. i got too comfortable. it made me the bad guy since i got too dependent on him. we took a break and then got back together, and i made a stronger effort to be more independent and honor what he wanted in our relationship. but the love he had for me was already gone. 
we broke up a month ago officially, but were still having sex. he asked to stop and moving forward we would only be friends. that’s fine. i felt like the love during sex was gone too. but i am alone right now and i’m going to be alone for thanksgiving too. i am in my collegetown and my roommates have gone to visit family. they know about my breakup, but all they said was sorry once, even after one of them saw me
crying because of it. i know it’s not their obligation to check up on me, but i just really wish someone was here who could make me feel better.
one thing that stayed constant in my life was my inability to make friends. as a kid i was left out a lot. in middle school and high school, i watched my friends make plans in front of me excluding me, watched them hang out together on social media. i grew up in an emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive household too and my friends knew that, yet i was always at home since no one wanted to hang out with me. and even now in college, as i try to make an effort to meet up with people, it’s always me asking them and no one ever asks me. my roommate that i mentioned earlier goes out every day and i have met all of her friends in her friend group, some of which i introduced her to. she comes home after hanging out with them and tells me all about her day with them, even after in the past i told her how lonely i am and how id love to be part of a big group like she is. she always relies on me when i feel like i can never rely on her. she never thinks to invite me when it’s all i want. 
today, all i can think about is how no one wants me around. how i can’t even keep my boyfriend, and after 18 years if i were to look at my inner child i wouldn’t be able to tell them i made them proud and made lifelong friends like we expected to. in middle school and high school, i was greatly screwed over by 2 people i considered my best friends, and everyone ended up hating me for it. i ended up losing twice in that situation. everywhere i go, i feel like a burden. i just don’t see it getting better for me especially when i have been trying to put in effort for so long. i genuinely feel like the world would be a better place without me. i cant stop thinking about my past trauma. i cant stop thinking i’m just someone who will remain lonely forever, and to me, i’d rather die than feel as lonely as i am today. thank you if you read this. i just need someone to listen.",lonely,"going through a break up, no one is checking up on me. can’t help but feel like i don’t belong in this world.",2021-11-23 18:06:29

1347,No-Leadership-5118,1637650819,1,"32/M. Became partially disabled last year. Had to get on disability as I grit through what will be 5 surgeries in one year. I have one more to go, then several months of rehab and I hope to be back to work by next summer. Trust me, quitting work at a young age is not all its cracked up to be if you don't have a spouse and children. It gets quiet and boring real fast.

I've really come to hate being single. And the only conversation I seek out these days is from single, eligible women. But even that's been hard to come by. I just got rejected by a lady friend of 6 months I was into. That still stings a week later. I'm not having any luck with online dating.

One thing I've noticed is I hate the mundane chat with anyone else. I have two guys in my phone older than me, both in their 50's, both single with no kids. They're in the predicament I'm in right now, but permanently, not as a result of temporary illness. And they're 25 years older. Its a wrap for them. These two guys text me day after day and want to shoot the breeze about miscellaneous nonsense. 

It's not just the guys though too. My mother is obsessed with politics and as a result of my poor health I couldn't care less. It's all very shallow to me unless perhaps we're talking about free healthcare. My neighbor is a 31 year old woman whose an RN. She is a hot mess and any time I run into her and get stuck sitting on the porch, she's droning on about her relationship issues. Interrupting me, talking about only herself - you realize this person does not even recognize whose standing in front of them. It's just free therapy hour.

It feels like an emergency to find someone even though 32 is relatively young. I could not have children for another decade and no one would bat an eye. But I've been single for a while and it's a priority. I do like talking to you Reddit people though because you're new and mysterious, and if you're reading this forum you understand.

I'm 1 month sober, before this I smoked weed daily (for the past decade). I'm also getting sober from alcohol, although I didn't really drink that often in the first place. I currently live with my brother and mom. I escaped an abusive relationship and became homeless this past summer. I'm 26. I was in my last year of school when I became homeless. At the same time my health rapidly declined. I went to the doc, he told me my thyroid was 2-3 times the size it should be. That was months ago &amp; because of insurance/moving to a new state I'm only now going to a doctor next week. Anyways, I'm in a new state &amp; don't have any friends. Its also a small town, coming from a big city. I've sworn off dating for now.  I'm really tryin to raw dog life and process my emotions properly...... I also have been off antidepressants and adhd meds for a couple months now. But, I'm really struggling. I want to be able to work out, and work. Not being able to and watching myself gain weight/get behind is killing me. I don't know how i'll ever be able to get a good job or afford anything. Even when I do begin dating, I just have too much trauma and too much to learn... It feels hopeless. I emailed some therapists today, so hopefully I can find a good therapist....although spending money is not something I can afford right now. Luckily, I have some money from family (which just fills me w shame honestly). Because of my health symptoms I can't work right now. I can hardly do anything, I wake up most days nauseous, or with a headache of varying severity along with a fuckload of other symptoms.

I feel like I am stuck. I keep telling myself to meet people and try to make friends. Which is very difficult in a town where you don't know anyone. I got invited to a Friendsgiving at my neighbors house, I think because my neighbor felt bad asking for spare chairs and she invited me to be nice and it was nice to talk to people but the only thing I could really think about was that after I went home I would just return to my life of being alone. I did talk to one girl there who seemed nice and I actually bumped into her on Sunday while getting lunch and I gave her my number. I never got a text though.

I'm on Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge attempting to meet girls my age in this area and to date I have had a few Tinder and Bumble matches, no Hinge matches, and 0 dates. I wouldn't say I'm unattractive but I'm not a stunner either. Somehow I've got myself stuck in this mind set that I cannot uninstall those apps or I'll miss my chance to meet someone really great, but at the same time keeping them installed and opening them to absolutely nothing every time is driving me insane.

I was going down the street to this bar on the weekends for happy hour but I decided to stop that because it was starting to feel unhealthy. I would go, get completely drunk, and then go home and cry. The bartenders all know my name, but from my own experience of working at a bar, knowing your customers doesn't mean you want to be friends with them. 

I turn on my Xbox sometimes to see if anyone is online, they're not. So I play some games and get absolutely destroyed and that makes me feel even worse because I'm sitting in silence in my apartment feeling like garbage at something I used to enjoy and have no one to vent that to.

Back to my puppy, I go on walks with him everyday firstly because it's good for both of us, but also there is this 1% of hope that I'm somehow going to meet someone and talk to them while I'm out. 

So I'm not sure if this was even helpful for me to type all this out. I just feel like somehow I just got stuck in this cycle of being invisible. It feels like no matter what I do, no matter how many times I smile back at someone, or try to start a conversation, or even give someone my number I always end up back in this completely alone state. It's starting to really hurt my mental health, I have full conversations with my dog, I haven't had someone text me for weeks, I barely want to eat or sleep.

1399,LostLeo88,1637631189,1,"       My father isn't actually dead. In fact he is very much alive and unwell living in a van a days drive away from me. However, as he becomes older and weaker from years of drugs, sex and rock n roll I find myself making adjustments to his eulogy. 
      Yes, you read that correctly. A eulogy for a man that is still alive. I'd give anything to meet just one child of an addict that hasn't already thought about what they will......and won't say when that fateful day arrives. The day I have to stand up in front of a room full of people that he endlessly disappointed and find the strength to do right by him. Because the funny thing is I fucking love my addict father. We have almost identical minds I just never behaved......well to the degree of recklessness that he did. 
     Since I've been using Reddit as my journal lately it only seemed fitting to put everything here. I won't get to say all of this to them. I want to get up there and steadily hold up both of my middle fingers and scream ""FUCK YOU for giving up. FUCK YOU for leaving. And finally FUCK YOU for showing up today with your small minds and judgmental stares"". But I wont. I won't because my father's reckless behavior gave me a sister. A tiny impressionable human I am now mentally responsible for. I'll do everything in my power to preserve her mind for as long as I can. No one gave me that courtesy. So here it is in all of its current unfiltered unapologetic glory. 

My Father's Eulogy:

     For 28 years I had my father all to myself and I loved being his only child. He was so in love with me and I don't think there has ever been anyone that has loved me that much. But then came my baby sister. I struggled her first few years with accepting that I no longer had him to myself. But one day he called me and there she was on a video chat. I realized almost instantly that this tiny 5 year old girl had my nose. That's all it took. I was attached. 
      My baby sister is the greatest gift my father has ever given me. I knew that he would pass so much earlier in her life than mine and I promised him I would watch over her for the rest of my life. She will never walk alone. 
      It's no secret to anyone here that my father was a life long drug addict. Over time the people in his life gave up on him one by one. But I was one of the chosen few who got to see his soul. Who he really was beneath the stories that others told of him. I promised myself that I would get up here and do right by him. Tell you all who my father really was and why I am so proud to be his daughter. 
     He taught me to respect animals just as much as humans and got me a lot of fuzzy ones over the years. He gave me 2 kittens, a dog, a bunny and he even drove 8 hours from Maryland to Massachusetts to deliver my hamster ""Flopsy"" as a communion gift. He taught me how to sneak into movies and we once saw 6 in one day. He taught me how to drive and how to make it up a snowy hill with a stick shift. He was great at driving in the snow. Always calm and never panicked. 
    We made each other laugh until our stomachs hurt and tears rolled from our eyes. He was so funny. He was a talented musician playing guitar and singing in my youth and later turned to drums when his hands couldn't handle the guitar anymore. He taught me how to play guitar when I was 6 and bought me my first and only pair of diamond earrings when I was 16. And no I dont care how he got the money. People have attempted to sway my opinion of my father over the years. But I've never faltered in what I know to be his truth. 
    The truth is he was the only person who ever really knew me. Because our minds worked the same way. He gave me the gift of empathy and compassion. He knew how to comfort me, what to say to me, what not to say to me and how to be everything I needed in whatever situation I was in. 
   Every night I stayed with him (which was weekends and summers) he would sing me to sleep with his mashed up version of Bob Dylan's knocking on heavens door that included parts of the Guns and Roses cover. I remember what it felt like being rocked to sleep by him. His deep singing voice coming through his chest onto my cheek as I laid against him.
   A part of me is now gone and the hole that is now in my heart will never be filled. But in many ways I don't think I would want it to be mended. Because that reminds me of just how much he meant to me. Just how much his mere existence mattered. I will miss his sunny side up breakfasts and how he'd get so upset if he broke a yolk. I will miss our long talks where he would make me feel heard and never attempted to stifle my voice. As most of you know I talk loudly, fastly and way too much. But I was never told to be more quiet, to slow my speech down or to stop talking all together. I'm not sure he knew how much that meant to me. 
    He saw my flaws as gifts. As things to be proud of. He saw the good in everyone. And I mean everyone. He taught me how to fold a wad of cash properly with the one dollar bills on the outside and the 20's on the inside so potential robbers would assume I was broke. He taught me to buy the biggest pack of sharpies to make sure I had every color in case I dinged someone's car door I could just color it in.
    These may sound like terrible things to teach a child. But I assure you it was never done with malice or poor intent. He was doing everything in his power to prepare me for the world to chew me up and spit me out like it did to him. I will forever be grateful to know the absurd yet useful things he taught me. 
    I'm scared of what life is now without him in it. But I wouldn't change a single late night drive, 3 hour phone conversation or the fact that he wore cut off jean shorts to bed every night like a hillbilly. I feel as though it would have been an easier choice to let the sharp broken pieces he'd crumbled into lay. However, as his daughter I made the decision to walk through the fire with him and I would do it over and over again. My only regret is that he won't be here to watch me say FUCK ALL OF YOU. Daddy, I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again. I love you.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday: The most energized day for me because I have to go outside most of the day. At the end of that day, I feel my self productive.

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: First day in week that I have to go to work. I get good money, but it's just boring af. After the work, I remind myself that I earn good money , so I should give myself a treat. I buy a huge bag of snacks and a large box of cookies 2 hours before the sleep time that I planned (10pm). I don't want to keep the snack for tomorrow because I had food that I cooked before, so I tell myself: Hey let's watch Youtube and finish this big snack. I ended sleep at 3am of Thursday with half of the snack uneaten.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: I wake up at 9am. I don't feel sleepy but tired. So I grab my phone to watch Youtube videos, some news, and some porn stuff. When my phone shows me that the battery is low, the time is already 2pm. I charge my phone, eat the leftover snack from yesterday, wake up, sit on the chair and continue watching stuff on my laptop. When I feel tired again, I know that my phone is fully charged, and the time is already 8pm. I lay on bed and continue to use the phone to 3am then sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday: I wake up at 9am. I remind myself to go to work today, and I shouldn't buy snack again. But because I'm so tired, so I stay on bed and do same things as Thursday. I ended up going outside to buy snack again. At the end of the day, I realize that I skipped my work today. I tell myself to go to work tomorrow to compensate Friday, but it's 3am so I go to sleep

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday: Same as Thursday

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday: Same as Friday

&amp;#x200B;

Monday: Morning is the same as Thursday. At the afternoon, I successfully convince myself to stop this. So I take a shower, clean my room, dispose the food that I cooked last week but ended up replaced by snacks, and cook a healthy meal prep for the next week. I sleep at 10pm that night which is the time I planned.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday: A new cycle begins

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student living in a foreign country with no one  beside me when I have problems. My friends in my home town don't understand and just tell me to stay strong. I also don't want to tell them my problem anymore because I feel like I bother them too much everytime I call them.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped in this cycle and I don't know how long can I keep myself living with this.

I stopped showing love the way I used to and just became ignorant to her needs. A year later we kind of both saw the issues and it was a wake up call for me. I tried to turn it all around but at that point it was too late. So now I feel that COVID has taken away the one person I used to always talk to/do activities with. No one died so I’m fortunate that way but so much has changed for me that I am now feeling extremely lonely. I glorify the pre-COVID days even more because it was a time when I was happy. I think this will always make me hate this period of time. And all I ever hear is that COVID isn’t going anywhere and “this is the new norm”.

 I'm sad, or feel completely numb, but in front of my friends and family I put like fake clown disguise and try to be funny. I'm in highschool, in Poland I might add and started cutting about year ago. Of course all shallow as I don't want to end up on ICU, I always did it like after all my PE lessons in the week so people wouldn't notice (I mean like if have PE in Mon and Tue I will cut Tue evening). I always stand in the corner so nobody can see my cuts. But recently I had lots of exams and feel constant urge to cut. And at one hand I don't wanna anybody to notice so I won't be cheap attention grabber but at the other I would love to vent irl even though I'm scared they won't be my friends at the end of that scenario.

I was tryna find some solutions in the internet so I found out that you should do some exercising to boost your overall mood etc. So I bought dumbells and started working out at home first like for month it really did help. I used to working out so hard to the point of vomiting. I couldn't move a muscle next day. But for some odd reason after that first moth or so I became as sad as before and sometimes even more depressed when I was overburdened with homework and studying so I couldn't have a training session that day. I felt super guilty about it. Now I'm not as fat as I used to but still miserable xD.

 I'm even more blue cuz my friend whom I consider to be very good man told me recently something like ,,I feel like a god, you see those grades those all are better than yours'' I don't think he was trying to hurt me, I think he was teasing but it hit home and it really hurt. I am really trying to be like A student, but for him it's cup of tea. I feel like I'm a bargain to the earth and my parents. I feel their disappointment in me. I see disappointment in their eyes. I hear  disappointment in their voice when they are talking that I can always reform my grades like nothing happened. 

I am worthless, dumb and ugly. I don't feel necessary nor loved in this world.
Everyday I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Waking up with idea that for next six or so hours I will be sitting in class with fake smile is horrible. It makes you don't wanna wake up next day y'know. Just go to sleep and sleep forever. I don't deserve to be alive. I'm in constant cycle of hating myself for feeling sorry for myself and feeling sorry for hating. I fantasize about my suicide.

I never had a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin, I'm morbidly obese, Extremely short, unattractive looking, I only have an associates from a community College. I hate my life because I can't get a girlfriend because I'm too unattractive for them to like, I'm 5'5 and about 300 lbs so I look disgusting without you seeing me..

I work for my father as a salesman but I'm bad at the job,, he makes me live in a one bedroom apartment with 2 of his friends who I don't relate to because of the age gap. One is 70 and dying of cancer and extremely republican so I don't have alot in common with him, he's living with us because he's my father's closest friend and wants him comfortable in the end if his life. The other is 50 and a drug addict gambler who stutters and gets on my nerves and never leaves me alone with small mundane things like how to work his phone or our TV cause he won't bother to try to learn it himself. he also works for my father and my dad pities him so that's why he lives with us so my home life sucks because no woman would want to date a guy with forced roomates like that let alone a guy living with his father. 

I'm severely depressed over how no woman loves me or cares about me or even thinks of me. I suffer from dysthymia. For years I've been on here, spamming my problems on all dating and relationship subreddits to the point where a subreddit about me was made to report me but instead I just kept speaking directly to the subreddit it became a support place for me about my problems for over a year. Almost all have given up on me, have labeled me a lost cause and don't want to speak to me, those who stayed don't have anything new to say annd it's a matter of time until those who tried and stayed this long give up on me too. 

I grew up in Colorado and  Massachusetts my whole life and I never fit in either place, in Colorado where I grew up since 6th grade till high school I was bullied and picked on and girls thought of me as a loser, I had a lot of bad experiences with rejections from then that I still go to therapy for today. My friends in Colorado all have lives I wish I had. They have great careers, and they have attractive girlfriends and wives and I wish my life was like theirs but its the furthest thing from. Now for the last 8 years I lived in Massachusetts and I've gone nowhere in my life, I have no friends, no women interested in mem the closest thing to a social life is spending time with cousins and most often they only hang out with me as a favor because they think I'm a loser. 

I ruminate over all the rejections in my life I hate myself because I was uglier than the men who the women who rejected me chose, I have an unhealthy celebrity crush where I hate myself over her because she's married, Every day all day long I wish I wasn't me. 

I know I could lose weight by exercising and eating healthier but I just never get on it because my work ethic sucks and I'm frustrated by the work needed to be put in and I frustrate myself because I know I am still going to be not handsome so I always feel like ""what's the point if I'm not ever gonna be good looking after?

Don't even get me started on the common idea that romantic relationships are at the top of relationship hierarchy. I don't feel sexual attraction, I don't feel romantic attraction, and no matter how many times I say that, any physical contact and so many other things are still almost always assumed to have some hidden meaning behind it.

Ok so about me for a little context, I'm 31yo, male from UK &amp; I was born with a disability, I've suffered anxiety, depression &amp; very low self-esteem all my life, I had been heavily overweight from age of 17 until 29, used to smoke, never had a real relationship, was addicted to pain pills and drank alot. When I was 14 I had a operation on my disability, during which I was abandoned by all my friends. 

So for years I sat and suffered alone, but then slowly I started getting my shit together giving up addictions, losing alot of weight and working on my mental health but still never had any friends until about 4 months ago, I finally got a group of mates I thought but after a incident at weekend I felt abandoned by them again &amp; I feel like I no longer trust or belong with them. They are offering for me to go back in to their group but I feel like I'm being blamed for what happend so they don't feel bad.

No beast in the wood, nor bird in the tree,

But shuns his path; in the windy gloom

They give him plenty, and plenty of room.

Watching the ragged clouds go by.

My father will never understand, although he knows of my suicide attempt. He always acts like nothing is going on, and life just goes on. I haven't had an honest talk with him in 4 years. He has had multiple girfriends since and even before she died, because he cheated on my mom when I was young. He did this while he knew that she had a terminal disease, I resent him for choosing to do this every single day.

My friends are assholes, the only reason I hang out with them is to drink myself to shits without it being weird. I know them from high school, before I used to be a lonely nerd, but I acted popular so I could hopefully have some interaction with people, which I never had before. My grades dropped and I can't do the dream job I always hoped to have.

The reason I'm still here is to hopefully make my mom proud one day, although I have no goals in life and I barely get out of bed every day.

I think about the suicide ""attempt"" everyday, I think I would have been in a much better place had I actually gone on with it. My attempt was pretty much just trying to jump in front of a train, and then holding back the last second, so I don't even know if that counts, but hey.

In last few years most of my friends moved to different parts of the world to chase their own adventure. I have few friends now but interactions with them are not fulfilling, most of them want to hangout on weekend nights to drink but I'm not enjoying the mindless drinking anymore.

My girlfriend has a very busy schedule and we are not able to spend a lot of time together. When she is available we hangout on weekends and do fun activities. I'm relying on her for my emotional needs more than I like and don't want to put that pressure on her.

I have a good relationship with my parents but them being in India doesn't help and they don't really understand the need for emotional support, when I bring this up to them, the conversation will almost always end up with them saying I need to get married.

Idk, its just bizarre to me. Affection exists, friendships exists, and so do relationships. But they seem so... out of touch for me. Like it's an unattainable thing. But obviously it's not 4 other people. It's like I'm viewing all these things through a lense, rather than actually being in it.

I look at just notice weird things,  like how often others smile or laugh while in a moment or simply how someone may interact with another person. But I'm just observing it while they are living it. I'm just there.  Its quiet odd. 

I dunno. Its just unsettling tbh. 

Having no friends isn't ideal but like I said before, its impossible for me to genuinely believe that someone would actually want to be my friend. So its just never really been something I've pursued or put effort towards. It just doesnt seem realistic. It seems out of reach and just beyond me, to be completely honest. 

People genuinely have people who gaf about them, like them, and care about what you they to say. That's crazy. The more I think about it the more insane I get.

If you can keep your head when all about you     
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,     
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
    But make allowance for their doubting too;     
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,  
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: 
 
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;     
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;     
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  
    And treat those two impostors just the same;     
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
  
If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
    And never breathe a word about your loss;  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,     
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’  

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,     
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
    If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,     
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,

I live by myself, and while I have a good amount of hobbies, and I have SOME friends, I feel that I am alone most of the time.  I go to work, and most nights I go home and spend the night alone.  I exercise daily, as it helps me feel better about myself, and I eat probably way too many desserts.

My main hobbies are reading, video games and board games.  The first two I can do completely by myself, but the board games, which are the things that I enjoy the most are ones that require at least one other person (There are solo games but I don't love them!)

Most of the people I associate are people who I work with or worked with.  I have people who come over about once every other week or so to game with and a few friends who I go to dinner with but I really wish I had more.   I'm not big into bars or clubs and I am on a ton of dating apps (Tindr, Grindr, Scruff, Hinge, Coffee Meets Bagel) and the people I encounter often don't want more than a one night stand, which is frustrating as heck.

I was amazed when I finished watching the movie because I've never seen such an accurate portrayal of a lonely person, and the movie manages to be both hilarious and tragic without being disrespectful.

anyway, what impressed me the most about the film was its message: how we might not  be able to fix someone, but how we can be broken together. no matter how lonely we are, we can be lonely together.

I found the story very powerful and thought that in this community we may have troubled lives and lonely mornings to face daily, but we have each other, and we can understand each other's wounds of loneliness better than anyone else, and thats quite lovely.

It has been 4 years since I left middle school and we moved to another place and it became so hard for me to make friends.

My first year in high school it was a new experience since I didn't know anyone so I tried to get to know some of my classmates and I didn't find someone that we share same interests. The first year has passed and I couldn't find someone to take to.

The second year was waaaay worse, we were just 7 in the class and some problems happened and I don't tolerate childish behavior so the class fought me so I it all the ties with them, and I said to myself I'll focus on my studies on the third year to graduate to the university without the help of anyone nor my classmates nor any friends, my parents were the only friends that helped me out.

And now I'm 18 in the university and still hard for me to get to know someone, it sucks.

I'm doing my best to fill the gap and not feeling lonely by peaking up new hobbies and sports, but still doesn't work out for me, since you don't have close friends to talk about your problems or having some fun in this life, who's gonna be on your side when you need to spend some time, it sucks.",lonely,I can't find new friend.,2021-11-23 03:44:37

Covid came to Ohio same time I did, I've literally not made one friend. I used to be a salesman and now I'm deathly afraid of people and can't find any sort of support groups or kindness.

Never been someone who felt like giving up on life but between being alone and not seeing the little girl I raised in now 770 days, I've decided life isn't worth living most days...and it's getting really, really bad.

I (24/m) am lonely by choice. I have no problems with social interactions nor do I lack friends as such, but I’m lonely because I choose to be. It’s in solitude where I find my drive to shape my life. To discover who I am, to understand what purpose I serve in this world.

I haven’t been with a woman in 8 months now, and I don’t think I will for a long time. Why? I have understood that if you want something, you really need to want it. Or else, you’ll never truly achieve it.
For me, I want to build a life for myself. To define who I am in the comfort of my own thoughts and my own skin. 

I hope there comes a day when I have things in order, so I can have the space to “want” an intimate relationship, or simply - to not want to be lonely anymore.

I like paranormal especially the scary movies like conjuring and insidious.  
Manga and anime (hunter x hunter love that one) 
I enjoy working out even tho I'm chubby. 
I like animals (use to work with dogs all day at a resort ) 
Love being open with others and expressive opinions and thoughts on things but don't like drama . If we disagree on something then we can agree to disagree.  
Idk.. I enjoy alot. Just ask me. 
I'm a shy person so it's easier for me to text that speak as I get stumped really easy and nervous

1510,Sleepycat606,1637585874,1,"I’m in my last year of high school, and I’ve never felt so lonely. Last year I used to have a great friend group, I was really happy with it. At the beginning of the school year a new student became part of the group as well and everything was great, but months later she started showing very toxic behaviours, and she started dating a guy in the group, which made me the only one who was single, which was very awkward, but it was fine still. They didn’t leave me behind and we still were all friends with each other. 

At the end of the year, we all (except from her boyfriend, who I’ll call R) started growing more and more apart from that new girl (I’ll call her J) because of her toxic behaviour. Just before the beginning of this school year, me and my best friend (who used to be the closest friends to her) decided to talk about why we drifted apart from her, she said sorry and she told us to tell her when she did something that bothered us, and we agreed on starting over and trying to get along, even if we didn’t act as friends. 

I was happy that the conflict was over, but when we got back to class she completely ignored my best friend and I, while she was super nice to the others, leaving us behind. Al, the other friends started to drift apart from everyone and being only the two of them together, so now si only have my best friend and her boyfriend, because R, who I used to get along really well, now ignores me because J probably told him to do that. 

I really want to make friends, and there’s one girl in my class who I got along well at the start of the year, but now she hangs out with J and R and also ignores me. When I go back to my house, I see all of them ha going out and walking together in the same direction as me, and I really wish I could be a part of that, but I can’t. I’m really tired of it, I just want friends. I know I have my best friend and her boyfriend, and I’m really happy to have them, but there are moments when I’m all alone because, well, they are a couple. 

I know this isn’t a big problem but I feel as if I’m watching everyone from the outside, I can only wish to talk to them and be a part of their group, or just be able to hang out with them when we’re in class, or walking home. I hope I make friends when I go to college but it will probably be the same as this year, I don’t know why but nobody likes me, no matter how hard I try to get along with them.",lonely,Lonely at school,2021-11-22 23:57:54

1526,Ripmacmiller412,1637575334,1,"The “love yourself first” message is a setup, even though it’s been perpetuated in new age psychology circles for years. It (falsely) suggests that there’s a finish line or some attainable goal you have to meet before you’re worthy to receive love – or be in a relationship – and that once you reach that goal, or get in that relationship, you’re done. Nothing could be farther from the truth. You do not need to reach a certain point before deserving to be loved or cared for. Every version and part of you deserves to be loved.

If we all waited until we felt proficient at self-love or being “happy” before entering into a romantic relationship, we’d be alone forever. Because everyone has wounds and disowned parts that they’re never going to be totally okay with, and it’s actually through relationship where another person loving you can be a huge boon to revealing and healing those parts.

This is not to say that you don’t want to address your issues or the stuff that comes up around self-worth BEFORE you get into a new relationship. By all means, attend to those places in yourself. As long as you remember that self-love is a continuum not a fixed state.

I don’t know how it keeps happening. Ever since I got into my first relationship at 15 it’s like I’ve been the crazy one forcing people(who initiated/showed interest first) to hang out with me. 

I’m 19 now and a lot has happened in between. I let my guard down for just a bit. And it’s happened again. We made plans for her to come over on Saturday. She asked three times. I gave her my address and said come over whenever on Saturday. “Sounds good!” She said. 

As much as I tried to deny it. I couldn’t suppress my excitement because I finally have someone coming to visit! From Wednesday to Saturday I was just kept thinking about it. Of course with my history or being stood up/ ignored/ even denied(like on some no I would never do that with someone like him…just after the fact) I had it in the back of my mind that she probably won’t show up. But I still had my hopes up.

She didn’t show. After staying in bed most of the day I went for a walk at like 1 am and cried wondering how it keeps happening. I’m the only constant in all of it. These girls don’t know each other. How can I do everything right(IMO) and still get stepped on?

So come senior year of high school I dropped them for her. It’s always been my dream to be a Marine and she didn’t want me to go so I joined the reserves for her. She’s also cheated on me twice and I’ve forgiven her. I use to be really fat and thought she was the only one who could ever accept me. Well I come back home and I’m just constantly talking to her and her only. She was the only person in my life, but that wasn’t even enough for her. She said I gave her to little attention and I needed to give her more so we argued and I agreed. She started acting different like how she use to act when she was cheating but she hadn’t cheated in years so I thought nothing of it. All of a sudden her passwords change and again I thought nothing of it. I had 1 other friend and we would talk well one night I cheated on my gf (we’ll call my gf gen in this story). I felt fucking horrible. I couldn’t sleep at night so the next week I admitted to gen that I cheated on her. And of course she went off on me and say “how could you do this?” “We had it so good” “we finally had it perfect”. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to bring the past up and also cause I had nothing to say. Well 2 days go by and she has a new boyfriend. Some dude that I had no idea she was talking to. But whatever I didn’t blame her. A week passes bye and gen calls me. And she tells me she’s pregnant with my kid. I was in shock. I told her that we should fix this and we can start our family and all this shit and she told me “I’m going to see Daniel tomorrow” and I stood quiet. Well I told her “I cheated so whatever you do tomorrow I’ll look past it but let’s just do this” and she said maybe. Well she straight up tells me they fucked... the next thing she tells me and she’s aborting our child... I begged her not to. She did it 3 days later. I was so utterly destroyed. I didn’t eat for a week, lost 10 pounds, drinking every night. I didn’t eat until someone in my unit told me to eat but they didn’t know what was going on. He just told me to eat the rest of his food. Genuinely was going to end it all. But gen then messaged me saying she wanted to get back with me and I said yes. But changed her mind. This happened about 4 times while she was still with Daniel. I had enough and I told her off and stopped talking to her . Couple months later I got a new gf but she had a sugar daddy she was fucking the whole time. I was aware of it at the last month of that relationship I just thought to myself “I don’t deserve any better” well I ended that and I was alone. I then picked up boxing again cause I’ve been doing it since I was 6 and I let out all my anger and it was working! Then my unit told me I was getting mobilized. So we tried getting a fight before I let but that didn’t workout. Now I’m at Virginia and I’ve been alone with my thoughts dont really wanna talk about this wit anyone in my unit. But I feel alone. I miss a that affection I use to get. And then I start thinking that after this I’m coming home to nothing because I’m not close to my family cause we’ve always had problems. I dont know it just sucks. I’m sad and i thought I was over the whole relationship with gen but I just started thinking about it so much out of no where. It’s not like I suppressed it or anything I cried and I coped and I thought I moved on but now I don’t know. Maybe I just miss that feeling of having someone?

for the past two and a half months he's been really distant and just.. not there. he wasn't busy he just didn't want to speak. i had a gut feeling something was going on but gave him the benefit of the doubt. anyway, we went on a break with ONE boundary, which was that we wouldn't do shit with anyone else because we still love each other and want to be together. anyway, he broke that rule entirely and did it with a girl he introduced me to earlier. he told me tonight that he would still have feelings for her if she didn't tell him she doesn't want him anymore. basically, im a second choice, and the only reason he didn't LEAVE leave is because he didn't want to be the dick to formally break the promise. he confessed he's been doing shit with this girl since a week before my birthday, which is why he constantly cancelled all plans, went out randomly, ignored me, etc. so i broke up with him.

I finally followed their advice and made an account on Tinder. I spent hours and hours to polish my profile, I also asked others to give me advices, I spent hours to choose the best photos of me, I spent $80 to upgrade my membership,

It has been quite a few months since, I did not even receive one like. 

I accepted there is no ROI for my time and energy I gave up.

I also sent a rather angry letter to Tinder. I said I made an investment but I did not even receive one like, no matter what I tried.

I kept browsing other women on Tinder, and one profile, she was not even necessarily very attractive, and she said ""If I am slow to respond I am sorry, I have 2000\~3000 likes""

And another girl said to me, outside Tinder, ""I tried Tinder, and even before I completed my profile, I received 20\~30 likes""

I tried everything I possibly could.  I lowered my standards a lot.  I have sent like to some of the least attractive women I have ever seen in my life.

I lost a relationship in part due to my fears and insecurities and I am trying to change. But it’s hard when it just seems like it’s everywhere. That there’s no doubt it will happen to me or that, conversely, I will continue to fuck up my relationships because of this (not always situationally valid) fear I have and continue to push away the people I care about the most. Why can’t I just believe them when they say they love me at face value? And why can’t I trust? Will I ever be able to? 
Right when I made so much progress and truly began to let go and trust, it was already too late and I pushed them away. They want to leave. 
Now I sincerely doubt I’ll ever come close to that again. I can’t picture it.

1582,OmgJustLetMeExist,1637553839,1,"I know how shitty, selfish, and assholish it is to say that, but it’s true. I’m aware that she’s with someone, I’m aware that they’re both very happy together, I’m aware that it’s not like I could give her anything that he doesn’t already give her (and more), and I’m trying to get over my feelings, but it’s still just such a knife to the heart.

She had a crush on me back in elementary. I was never aware of it, and she never even told me until this very year, after she moved for over 3-5 years and came back. I’m fully aware that things like that have never, will never, could never work out long-term, but it’s the closest I think I’ve ever come to having somebody *care* for me in that way. We’re good friends now, but ironically, now that she’s back, it’s the other way around. 

But, she’s already long gone. Another friend I opened up to about this hit the nail pretty well on its head: My insecurities make me think that, because she’s the only one I know of that ever *has* cared for me that way, that she’s the only one that ever *could*. But she doesn’t. She won’t ever. And hearing her talk so fondly about him every time we talk, how much she loves him and he loves her, how she’s already got a future planned for the two of them… I’m happy for her, but… it just hurts. So much. And like I said, I know that’s a dick move, and I’m actively trying to get over it, trying to stop feeling so sad just because of her happiness, but… it’s been hard so far. And I feel like an ass for it.

So yeah, ig that’s my first little mini-rant here. Probably not a good idea to do this on my main account, but i don’t care. I just wish that it wasn’t such a stab in the heart to see her in a happy, loving relationship. Something I doubt I’ll ever have. Something I was, unknowingly, so close to having, even if only for a little bit.

I got seriously mentally unwell and was in a really toxic circle. The circle was 100% making me worse. I tried to end my own life as I just couldn’t bear to go on. My “bestfriends” gossiped about me whilst they thought I was “dead”. They also sent me abuse once I came “round”. Usually I would just block but I was still full of a lot of drugs and sent them abuse, I don’t feel bad about that part because WTF. I never expected anything like this from any of my friends.

I slowly but surely have became more introverted since my breakdown, I don’t trust anyone. I don’t want to go out, everything seems so false to me. I’m very surface with everyone I have now. I don’t tell anyone a damn thing about me because trust no-one. I feel absolutely lonely though. 

I still live with shame and guilt over my breakdown. I want to be free of it and to be happy. I would also like someone I could actually trust. I’ve always had trust issues in relationships so I’ve been single for years but now I have it with friends too. It sucks.

I just want to build myself back up but I feel like a shell of myself. I have no family either. I just I don’t know what to do. I need to find out what life’s worth living for because I’m sick and tired of being trapped in this depressive, lonely cycle.

I used to be able to fairly regularly make friends on Facebook and twitch. I wasn’t the best at making super strong connects. But, I was able to make friends with people I’d talk to once in a while. There were a couple times I was able to make what might be a best friend; or as close to a best friend as far as online friends go. But, for one reason or another, I ended up losing the online friendships I had.

Over the last year or so, I ended up deleting my accounts for Facebook and twitch. I’ve tried using various other social media media sites/apps over that time. But, I haven’t really been able to find that grove I had making friends on twitch/Facebook. Reddit, Twitter, and Amino have come fairly to filling that void at time. But, something about them just hasn’t kept my interest for more than maybe a day or two at a time.

I want to try to keep using some sort of social media app because it’s hard for me to make connections with people in real life. And, I figure continual usage of subreddits/pages on social media would help me build connections with people if I interact with them regularly.

I'm extremely lonely in between. The man I wanted to marry is now married. The man I was once in love with now has a child (one that he was so afraid to have with me). I don't believe there's anything inherently bad about me, but it feels like I carry one pole, and the universe carries the other, and I can never experience what the average person experiences in terms of relationships (friendships, family included). This kind of loneliness is deep and never ending. I'm always longing for what the average person has. After years and many trial and error dates, I met someone recently that makes me feel warm, and it's been a while since I felt that. He's not willing to spend the time and effort maintaining a relationship and I am. I can't spend my entire life being knocked over by the world while everyone else gets two sturdy feet to stand on.

I am restrained by the figments of societies limitations that have structured my own opinions of success.

My current position on this earth  is in a fractal state with no certainty of the repetitiveness coming to a halt. 

The walls of my future are growing thinner because my foundational issues are beyond repair. 

Repression has caused cracks under the surface of my childhood  lucidness.

Reality is a spawn of fearing failure, and overtime and hardships I have been adopted by reality. 

Deep within I desire to follow the instinct of my driven purpose yet I get reminded of my worth with every paycheck. 

I have waved the flag years ago but the war between my higher self and my lowest form will not subside. 

The midst of the battle is taking place in my late 20’s but every week is a half decade worth of discouragement. 

I believe that beyond this body, pain perhaps will be collected through out our lifespan like currency. 

In hopes that all the sufferers will hold the highest of wealth hereafter. 

My imagination is being held in captivity, held in chains and kept underneath cement blocks. 

I lost the potential of my youth between the gentrification of my city and the pandemic.

My aspirations have wandered off into a city of infinite expanding trees. 

While I dwell in Forrest full of tall buildings and over labored minds.

My dreams have been sealed in an envelope I keep underneath my mattress next to the rent money. 

Sometimes I tear the edge of the corner just to get a glimpse of make believe like how Charlie opened up the candy bar. 

Except he got the gold ticket and we’re left with forgotten envelopes. 

The ward of my emotions are underneath dungeons of devastations with secret entrances and endless stairwells.

My environment is a product of my safest way of living I can possibly achieve. 

Not a life style I can look back and be proud of but at least say it was proficient enough to sustain.  

If I don’t make it for one reason or another I want everyone know no matter where this life may have led that I was always home sick.

I know the light will find me long before death can, i hope victory is within an arms reach for the forgotten.

struggle that feeling many months all by myself, 

and i found something that maybe help you get out of this feeling.

according to those tips, i live alone for about half-year and enjoy my life more.

&amp;#x200B;

1. change your mind, it's no matter you feel alone, sometimes trapped in a relationship is another big problem and then you feel annoying instead of lonely.

2. do something creature work you like, drench into heart flow, like writing、compose music, it can save you from a sense of meaninglessness of life.

3. filter your information, social media always spread anxiety. 

4. meditation and sport are good.

Over the last few days I found out my ex (broke up a month ago) has a new boyfriend, which hurts, but I accept that life goes on.

So... Did she figure it out in a month? Or did she lie?

A world of extremities, where the bittersweet paradox of escape is met with everlasting plains of ice and fire, lonely oblivions of infernos in seas of dunes or tundras cold with no in-betweens. A world of no will or choice. The burn of voids upon voids so vast and endless that it burns out my very soul, fading away the most personal side of myself.

Exactly year ago me, her and her friend became a company and after a while another one guy joined us. We played D&amp;D, videogames and watched films together. It might seem idyllic for a lot of people, and don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying this sort of life, but it ain't so good as it looks. This whole year i suffer. She is the first and may as well be the last person I'll love in my entire life. I think about her every day, I dream of her hugging me not because i told her to, but because she wanted it. Every fucking time we hang out together we everyone enjoys it, excluding me. They hug while i lay nearby, they rest under one blanket while I'm alone, they all three sleep while I, at the end of the bed, try not to wake them up while crying. I pay around half of money spent on our meetings, and I love them all at least like friends and her..... I just love her. But we can't both be in love. She is a lesbian and i have self-esteem problems after all this stress. In a summ of this year I grew very envious and everytime she hangs out or just texts with someone from outside I'm having an anxiety attacks thinking everyone will live me alone like in the past. And all of this time I have to hide all of this deeply within me because if they'll know about my love and all of my envy and just fucking touching hunger, of at least any love hunger, they'll absolutely leave me alone alone alone alone.

There’s this girl I met in high school. She was in the grade below me but we had some classes together. That’s how we met lol. Anyway she’s actually pretty attractive, one of the prettiest I’ve seen. She had a bf the whole time I knew her in high school and her bf was in my grade (he was an acquaintance of mine, not friend, and I haven’t talked to him in years), but a few times she complimented my looks, and years later I heard some other nice things she said/thought of me, some from her some from others. 

Since graduation, I’ve only seen her twice in person. Neither time went well. We were happy to see each other, but the first time was when she was still with the guy and the second time was during a time of depression for myself and the function we were at. Neither of those times we planned to see each other it was just by coincidence. However I could have talked to her more and better than what I did, but as usual, I messed up because I’m not great at talking to women especially those I’m interested in and the depression the second time didn’t help me. She actually broke up with her high school bf a couple years ago. I’m 23 and she’s 21/22.

So, by lucky circumstances, if her and I were to start dating:

the good: we’ve known each other for years and we find each other attractive. We get along well as we’re both friendly. We’re both modest at least I think she still is. We share some common interests. 

The bad or at least mixed: she’s much more of a people person/involved with the community. She’s extroverted while I’m introverted. She has a big (for average high school/college students) social media presence while I have none. Finally, I have the same first name as her dad.",lonely,AOE have a feeling of attraction to someone who on one side would be a good match but from another side wouldn’t be?,2021-11-22 08:37:36

1657,hikjhjkhkggjhgw,1637529076,1,"I'm mid-late 20s and I have two proper friends. One of them is my girlfriend (who currently lives on the opposite side of the world to me), and the other is a guy I met at work and have been friends with for a couple of years now. Other friends either moved to other countries or I was never close enough with them for either of us to make the effort to chat and hang out when it wasn't convenient (i.e. once we left university or the job we were at).

It's painful for me to not have a friend group anymore. A group formed at a previous job but I left the company and it was difficult to maintain it when most of their get togethers were after work drinks. Nobody wants to be the guy who is still showing up to after work drinks months after they left the company lol. So from there I just drifted away from them. I lost my friend group from high school because I had a bad breakup with my girlfriend who was also in the same friend group. She was very emotional and the group were frustrated about it so I just cut ties to make it easier for everyone. The friends I made after that barely hung out at the best of times, and now have kids etc.

I dream of having a group of friends that hang out regularly again. I wish I could have a group of friends that like to go out for dinner and drinks, go on weekend trips, and organise last minute activities. It's all great having a few one-on-one friends, but it doesn't hit the same need as having a close group.

I feel that a lot of people around my age already have closed friend groups that formed from school or university. Any groups from clubs and sports often already have years of inside jokes and friendship that mean that I end up joining the club but never really breaking into their inner circle. Seeing people I know who I consider as less sociable than me post pictures with their friend group hurts me because I question why I don't have that. Sure, I can be slightly socially awkward, but not really that much. The few people I am friends with and the people I meet through them seem to like me.

I've told myself for a long time that I only need a couple of friends to be happy. This post is to acknowledge to myself that that is a lie - I was just protecting myself from the pain of admitting it.",lonely,I don't know how to make friends anymore,2021-11-22 08:11:16

And then one day perhaps a large meteor will slam into the earth and we’re all just fragments in space. Everything the human race has got to is debris. Satellites remain orbiting our planets, sending images of our decimated world back to us, never to be seen by a life form that could possibly comprehend it. This post is never read by a human being again, eternally existing on an imaginary little world we created called the internet.

I’m a Christian but am currently going through a doubting phase for the first time in a while. Each prayer feels a little more hopeless than the last. Other than grace, my most frequent prayer is something to do with either me getting better sleep, which never happens, or me having less worries, which only happens when I smoke weed. I would love to pray for other things like world peace and nourishment but I am constantly worried or tired and its always on my mind so I never end up doing it.

So here I am alone in my room , listening to some really good sad music, acknowledging that my life will not amount to much, but even if it does, it will get lost in time anyway. 

What’s the fucking point of this all tbh. Whenever I get asked what the meaning of life is, I always say “to find the meaning of life”. If this is true, there is therefore no point. We will never find it, and therefore never understand or experience our meaning, then get hit by a world disaster and our time is up and nothing we did will have mattered to anyone but us humans, which don’t exist anymore.

On top of that, I’m supposed to be enjoying my life the most around now (I’m ). If I am having an existential crisis because my life is so boring, stressful and repetitive at this age, I just can’t bear what my life will be like when I am 24+. It just doesn’t feel like i can do much about my life at the moment. Feels like I know that my life is gonna suck. Fuck.

I am not suicidal. Looking at this post seems to disagree with that, but don’t worry - I would rather be a degenerate than be dead so if I was suicidal I would probably do some really fucking dumb shit before going. Maybe that is what it takes to know your meaning. I won’t know for now. 

I’d say I’m about 4.5/10 on the nihilism scale if 1 was caring what everyone thought about me and 10 was going on a final 3 day bender.

Life is like a heartbeat monitor. You will have ups and downs, but eventually die. And when that heartbeat stops one day; there is no more ups and downs; just a straight line carrying on forever.",lonely,I’m having an existential crisis,2021-11-22 07:37:48

Have spent several years like that and whenever I get some time with myself alone... I feel kid of stuck in a situation I can't escape from... Not now atleast as it's been so long.

I've never found love, never had any gf or date. The closest thing I had to a girlfriend was a girl on the internet whom I met once and she asked me not to disclose to her friends that we have anything close to a date or something...

I've been silent my whole life, I work hard, earn a decent amount but I think I find it very difficult to talk to new people and hence I only have a couple of friends who don't give a shit about me😂. And I understand their part they are perfectly fine, I'm the weirdo I believe.

I've always been shy and I don't handle crowd well, I feel threatened if the number of people around me goes above 2 including me 😂😂

I'm laughing because this is first time I'm sharing something that I haven't dared sharing anywhere or to anyone else. 

I don't know if this loneliness of mine is just something I have in mind or real... Right after marriage I thought now I've someone to be by my side always but it's a different scenario altogether and I don't blame my partner either she's just the way people are and expecting someone to understand my feelings without expressing them is next to impossible... I know.

But I still hope to meet someone I can open myself to and I do love fun... I wasn't like this at all... It's like I've stopped being myself for several years and it's about to explode someday and I'm afraid on that day also it'll explode inside of me and no one would know...

I am pretty broken to be honest and I'd just like to find someone to chat nonsense with. Someone to laugh with. Someone to watch videos with. Someone to play games with. I'll chat with anyone really about ANYTHING.  I am judgment free, and respect all. you could be a witch, a robot, an alien from the planet gloopenglop. I just want someone to chat with and create a friendship with

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me. I am 26 years old. I live in the US, and would prefer it if you did too just because of the whole time zone thing. I have some mental health issues I deal with on a day to day basis. So if that is a problem.. uh sorry not sorry.

I enjoy playing games, (I play on PS4, but don't really have many games. I play Fortnite, Rocket League, Apex, (I am trash at all) and a few others I can't really think of right now.) listening to music, some photography, corny jokes, TACOS, and anything horror or conspiracy related. 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into too much more detail because then there is nothing to talk about. I have discord if it easier to switch to that to chat and I prefer to chat on there to be honest. I also have a cringy tiktok where I have made some of my own videos.

That's it. If any of this sounds interesting or if something caught your eye feel free to message me. I am open to chatting with anyone about anything.",lonely,"[26/M] I'm socially awkward, so look here... maybe [friendship] [chat]",2021-11-22 05:23:37

1688,Dragonsontx,1637518890,1,"ive been planing this for a while ngl, i wanted to do it on my last birthday but a girl came and helped me, she became my girlfriend of 11 months, we grew really close together, but 3 weeks ago she decided to break up with me, as she didnt have time to talk to me all day, and wanted more time to be with her friends and go out, shit broke me ngl, the only person i truely loved left me and threw me away like yesterdays garbage.

what hurts most is that she did it the day after my bestfriend died and 2 days after my grandpa died, and with her leaving me depression came back, and ive become more and more down, to the point that people around me dont talk to me anymore, my phone is dry, my best friends havent talked to me in a while, no one texts me, no one calls me, no one chills with me, for the past 3 weeks its been only me.

ive been drinking and smoking heavily since then, funny tbh, she was the reason i left them, yet the reason i came back to them.

i still want to try to fix it between us tbh, i love her too much.

my birthday is next week, and ive made a decision, if my friends and family forget about my birthday like every year, im leaving everyone and starting a new life.

but im planning on ending myself tbh, if my life doesnt get better in a year or a year and half then im doing it, im so sick of the shit ive been going through, for the past 7 years ive been treated like absolute garbage, even now i still get abused by my parents, i get left behind by everyone, and no one talks to me unless they want something from me, im really sick of this.

nothing makes me happy anymore, even when i was with her, the only thing that gave me joy was her, i dont find gamaing fun, my work seems repetitive and annoying, i dont go and hag with friends, i tried to but i ended up getting overwhelmed and cut it short went to a bar and got shit faced.

today while i was going home i got hit by a car, the road was slippery and he was speeding now while he was coming towards me, everyone around me jumped out or ran away, while i just stood there and smiled, idk why i did that, i guess i wanted to die? but while i was there waiting for it to hit, i had flashbacks, to her, how she always smiled, how beautiful she was, how fun it was to be with her.

now that im home and nothing happened other some bruises, i really wish he would've just ran me over and ended it.

well while i was finishing this post, my mother came, turned my room upside down and beat the living shit out of me, and screamed at me, literally destroying my self worth, i hope this year ends fast so i could end my life",lonely,"im close to ending it all, and ngl im quite happy",2021-11-22 05:21:30

She was the last close relationship I had with someone and now it's all gone, I don't have any friends or people to hang out with and talk to besides some friends I have on Discord in a server, they're kind of more like acquaintances than friends to me because we're not all that close and talking to them feels less personal if that makes sense. I just really long for a close relationship with someone again but I can't get that anytime soon. 

I feel stuck because I live on a tiny, miserable island in the Caribbean that has a population of a bit under 100,000 people if I'm remembering correctly, I used to have friends when going to school but many of them stopped talking to me after we finished school and I cut off the rest because they just weren't my kind of people anymore. I don't like how the people who live here are mainly due to the culture they've been raised in. A culture of ignorance and stupidity to put it simply, literally everyone behaves in the same ignorant and stupid way and that prohibits me from going out and actually making friends.

For so many people they've been able to live lives and experience things like young love or random flings or even just shitty relationship stints that they've been able to grow and learn from, slowly figuring out what they really want/need in terms of love and romance. I've never gotten or experienced these things during my high school or college years. Now I'm at the point where I really do want to experience some type of relationship or intimacy but the entire prospect is so much scarier and so much more anxiety inducing because I have no experience.

It prompts us to do dangerously self-destructive things like dwelling on our insecurities to the point we feel like they're the only reality and there's absolutely no way of changing or growing past them. 

Human connection is what helps with that but you've been hurt by people so much or feel you've let them down so often you're afraid you're unable to move past it.

For the past 6 years of my life I've sat next to this girl in form class and gave no attention to her whatsoever. Just last year we started talking. Just simple conversations you know, ""Hey! how are you?"" and ""How was your weekend?"" type of conversations. I immediately knew she was just being friendly so I reciprocated her feelings. Sometimes I'd catch her looking at me but I thought nothing of it. This year, our final year, we started talking a bit more. Our conversations went from just standard greetings to a bit more personal, as we started discussing about our future plans and our hobbies and the things we liked. Still I could sense she was being friendly. Even in those moments where we sat in silence listening in assemblies and lessons in class, I still felt her warm presence. 

All this time I knew she was being friendly but her warm, welcoming presence started to grow on me. I developed a crush and I started to like her. Now that we've graduated and we're all done and dusted with highschool I can't stop thinking about her. I let my fantasies paint an image of what I wanted to see instead of facing reality. Her smile is what I'll miss the most. As I head into the future I hope I'll find someone like her. Someone who can brighten my day from a simple wave, a simple smile, a simple act of kindness. I know I'm to blame for getting to attached and I realise it now that she was out of my league. I just wish I had the chance to at least tell her my feelings.

I had a dream last night that was particularly cruel. I was hanging out at some sort of lounge at a club or bar, sitting on a couch with another couch facing it and a coffee table between them, and this really cute guy comes up to me and starts talking to me. After like 5 seconds he just suddenly walks away and goes up to another cute guy who's sitting at the couch across from me and chats him up, only he doesn't walk away from this guy like he did to me. They instead hit it off, and I'm just sitting there looking at my phone and glancing at them every few seconds. As their conversation goes, the move closer together, then they're holding each other, then one of the guys lies back and the other gets on top and they start making out.

Don’t get me wrong I have a great supportive family that does sort of understand me but beyond that there’s just a sea of doubt.

I’m for the most part an introverted, reserved person and I have a small circle of friends that I love and care about but I’m constantly second guessing my place in those friendships.

This year in order to quash those doubts I’ve been making a conscious effort to be more outgoing, to take more initiative and yet I’m back to square one. I thought that despite our slightly clashing interests (mine and theirs) it would still be smooth sailing but it isn’t, at least to me.

When you have a friend group, even with just 4 people in it, it feels so damn complex to navigate.  
   
I had a session about this with my therapist and she asked me if I had an anchor, or a fallback, a person whom I could just trust, who would be there and I realized that I  didn’t have an answer.

But I guess I’m there.I’m a person whom I could trust and would be there.But I’m starting think that it’s always going to be just me.

There's this woman I'm meeting up with regularly and I am becoming increasingly more scared that she'll just change her mind about me at some slight or mess up on my part. In this way she is rather like me. And she goes back and forth a bit in her head about how she feels about me but she tends to go back to a positive opinion. I just don't see why she'd stay with me for long though knowing that she's got her life mostly sorted out, and definitely way more than me by Western standards, and she doesn't have the same weight behind her feelings for me as I have behind mine for her at all. I've got no one to rely on and we aren't speaking constantly, of course. It feels very good to me when we talk because they are the only honest conversations I have with anyone while she has me and other people in her life, too. If the roles were reversed I'd 100% care for her but I haven't gotten around to sharing this information with her. I just don't think she'd deem it reasonable for me to have chosen this closeness and normality for myself. And I'm mostly fine, mind you. It's being with other people more often that scares me. But I feel if I aim for little contact with somebody else I'll have to take all of it again and the hectic lifestyle by which I'd have to lose myself in other people and abide by so many of their wishes in social situations again... it'd just break me. I don't really tolerate stress like that well at my age.
I don't think she'll keep loving me even with my insecurities or that I'll be her type of guy in the long term, really. She's into partying and hookups more than I was in my teens to be honest lol. And I don't even know why she'd care about it so much as to ever judge me for it but... yeah.

EDIT: by the way, I travel abroad a lot for business trips and whenever I'm away I do tend to be more open and fun but it just doesn't feel the same way since I don't really get to know the people I spend time with away from home.",lonely,What I am afraid of isn't being mistreated in any way but actually being loved back~little thought I just had,2021-11-21 23:41:56

But during those years and up till I was like 16 everything just revolved around drugs. I had friends to smoke with and drink and we did dumb shit. I never made any girlfriends. I got addicted to weed. Stole stuff, sold stuff etc. I only recently turned 18, and for the past year and a half now Ive just been trying to fully grasp how fucked I've been mentally, super neurotic, anxious, depressed, and got so very lonely. I got really lonely. It was hard to quit weed but eventually smoking it just made me overwhelmingly anxious and insecure and depressed, like instantaneously, whenever I'd get high. Some time ago I also got really obsessive over like the concept of a soulmate, like my idealization of the perfect partner. But anyways I wasn't in any place to maintain all the friendships I thought I had, and when I lost them there was no one else and I had no ability to make more. it's even more depressing that the last friendships I have to think about are from when I was like 15. I'm still kinda just depressed all the time and I never find any opportunity to make friends or feel comfortable doing so. I think daily about the people and experiences I could be missing out on. But idk if it gets to me as much as it used to. Its just hitting tonight for some reason I guess. I mean as I grow older it just hurts. Turning 18 blindsided me honestly. I'm not really on good terms with my family or my home either so I pretty much just sulked and did nothing on my birthday. I really just think about how I'd love to have like a friend. Or a girlfriend. Or 2 friends. Or 3. Or maybe just a bunch of admirable aqcuaintances. That'd be cool. Wish I could do the past like 7 years or so over again and just have grown up in a different state or something. I wish I was in some position where I could just maintain a friend or a few, have people to actually socialize with like at least weekly. Its so weird that I don't, like I feel like everybody my age, or actually not even my age, but people younger and older as well. They've all probably at least had friends within the past like year.

I don’t have any friends. I don’t have a good relationship with my family so when I force myself to be around them I painfully fake a smile for the sake of there happiness. Doesn’t help that I’m still going through a breakup of a two year relationship. It’s been almost a month since my birthday and I didn’t really do anything but work, I went to a Halloween party, I invited myself to, and called it my bday celebration. Anyway the point is I haven’t done anything since. I see my fake friends about once every two months when they finally get around to me after partying every single night and never inviting me even though they know I want to. And I know I shouldn’t be friends with people like that but if I didn’t see them I would literally never do anything although I’m almost there. 

I wouldn’t care about the fake friends if I had just one solid BFF. And it’s just getting so hard because it doesn’t make sense to me. I put myself out there, I go out, I invite and reach out to people, I’m so outgoing and everyone describes me as the “happy-go-lucky” or funny person, and treat me as I guess the “cool” one but im always getting left out and no friendship ever goes anywhere. I always have to text first or invite myself it’s kinda embarrassing cos im sure people have noticed.  I can easily talk to people I feel like I have clicks all the time but I just end up getting rejected. Quick examples the two most recent. Met this girl at the store I thought we really clicked. “You’re from ny? Im from ny! You’re Dominican? Omg im Dominican! You need friends? Omg I need friends” gave me her snap. I texted her a couple days later she was really dry I was like oh okay maybe she’s just dry otp. I tried a total of four times to hang out and declined every time so I just stopped trying cos I looked stupid. Even tho they were all pretty spread out still. Then at this Halloween party I talked to this girl alll night it was the first time in a long time I’ve felt like I had a bestie. Haven’t talked to her since. It’s nonstop false hope. 

I’ve been depressed for a very long time but this loneliness is really fucking me up now. I never noticed till recently but It’s always been like this, me not fitting in and getting left out, but I never noticed because of school. Not even my cousin wants to be my friend and we used to be so close but that’s a whole nother rant. I’ve always struggled making female friends and guys as you get older aren’t really looking for friendship from girls. I don’t really care about the gender but it’s just so hard both ways. It would be nice to have a girlfriend. I have no one to talk to about boys, work, what happened at the grocery store yesterday, anything. I just feel like peoples entertainment and once they’re done they go to their friends they already have. I know I can be very annoying at times with my extreme sarcasm and hyper personality but idk I feel like everyone has those things to make us different.

i feel like i exist solely to watch others have a life while wishing i had one of my own but ive come to realize i never will have one. at this point my mental health and social skills have declined so bad i cant hold conversations and the smallest interactions make me panic. ive been in therapy for some long with no results. i tried anti depressants but they didnt do anything for me so i stopped taking them ill try new medication soon for the first time in 3 years but i dont think anything can fix any of this. i have nothing to share with people that isnt me gushing about media or discussing random things, my past is all trauma, my present is just me having breakdowns and desperately trying to keep my brain occupied to avoid intrusive memories of my trauma and i have no future. i used to be such a hopeless romantic easily falling in love but now the mere thought of being touched or having a romantic relationship make me physically sick. i have become so repulsed and disgusted by the idea of me being seen as human and living a human life. the mental image is so alien and feels and looks so damn wrong and impossible and horrendous. i feel like im not human anymore. im definitely not part of society in any way shape or form but i dont even feel like im the same species anymore. i feel like with every passing day i loose my mind more and more. the past few months all of my copying strategies stopped mostly working (distraction trough media and daydreaming), intrusive thoughts are just too loud. i either remember trauma or think about how humiliating my life is and how disgusting i am and how i dont deserve to watch this series/play this game/daydream because its reserved for humans and i am not one.            
              
i do have 3 online friends but it's just not enough, i need someone here in person with me and help me back on my feet make me feel human. also i hate to say it but i am either envious of their lives (living alone, stable job/uni, irl partner with an active sex life, irl friendgroups etc) and become suicidal when they talk to me about it or i am so deeply ashamed and humiliated by my own life i dont wanna talk to them because i cant shake the feeling that they laugh at me or hate me or are as repulsed by me as i am.

1788,kasaidoragon,1637472285,1,"I’m a strange case I guess. I always remember everyone’s birthdays, always send them a small gift or visit them to celebrate in some way. But I never get a birthday surprise or a visit, or even plans.

Since I was in middle school, no one found the effort to just celebrate or show a small gesture towards my birthday. The only exceptions were 1.) Senior year of high school, I joined a queer clique who were really nice about my questioning and eventual discovery of being queer and 2.) When my ex-boyfriend, who at the time had a crush on me and I had no clue, took me out to eat.

That second one was almost 3 years ago, and I’m back to my regular broadcasting of lonely birthdays.

Every birthday usually brought some sort of traumatic or crappy experience as well, mainly because I end up staying at home. Last year my glasses broke and I couldn’t see at all 2 years ago, or being told I was in danger of homelessness a year ago, for example (I’ve had worse but I won’t say what those were).

So I’ve decided that maybe I should make the best out of my situation. 

Maybe I’ll be alone again, but I’m pretty much always alone anyways.

I’ve considered this:

Maybe I can dress really nice, give myself a fake identity for the day, and be some mysterious but an unusual person in public.

Maybe I’ll go shopping for myself and get a small gift to remember the day.

And then maybe I can do one thing someone who just turned 21 can do. I don’t know what specifically 21 year olds can do, but I’m looking into it.

Maybe I can just explore the area as well, eat at a restaurant people have always suggested others to go to, or a bookstore and get myself a book. 

People on their 21st usually go clubbing, or have a social gathering to drink, but since I’m on my own I think it’s too risky to try drinking or clubbing my first time alone. 

So that’s what I have so far as an idea. Unless you guys have better ideas on what someone who is on their own on their birthday, please do suggest something.",lonely,"Several years in a row that no one will join me on my birthday, but maybe I can make the situation better",2021-11-21 16:24:45

I think I've had great friends, but I feel like they just keep me tied to them so they can use me whenever they need to. I'm always the one listening, I'm never the one being listened. I feel like a stepping stone for everyone. Any time I try to express myself to someone they just make it about themselves somehow and I don't even try to keep the focus on my issues even though we were talking about them. And don't get me wrong, I love helping out and listening to those I care about, I genuinely do, but I too need sometimes to let some stuff out and I really feel like there is nobody willing to listen to me. I usually vent by crying myself to sleep. I've felt this all my life and it has just gotten worse and worse as years go by. Im in my second year of college now and I hoped that I would be able to meet people that would maybe listen to me, but those new friends I've made just do the same. Again, I really don't mind listening to someone's problems for hours, I'll do it gladly and with genuine interest and care, but it can really just make me tired. I've always felt like there was something wrong inside me and I've recently gotten to the conclusion that this is it. I'm just a stepping stone, another one of the bunch, that guy that's nice and you get along with but won't invite to your party.
I'm now used to being a stepping stone I think, and I really enjoy helping those I care about but this has led to feel worthless. I recently heard a song by twenty one pilots called ""Choker"" and it has this lyric that says ""Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand"". This is exactly what I feel and it hurts. Actually the entire song pretty much describes exactly the way I feel (and it's actually a great song you should give it a listen).
Anyways, I don't know if anybody is going to read this, but if you did, sorry for bothering you with my problems that are probably just what someone who's had an easy life would consider them problems. I just needed to vent a little, cause as I said, I never have.

I close my eyes.

I feel the wind gracefully on my face. 
I have seen the skies. 
They fade in and out, I’ve lost track of time. 
The hiker who pays me homage, I greet him with a smile, but he soon will leave. 
I have watched the seasons change, the birds migrate, the hibernation of the native. 
I have seen the skies. 
I have never seen myself for what I am, only the rumors. 
For I am only a sign of the times. 
I build myself up from the earth and cascade my soul down the rolling hills beneath me.

I have seen the skies. 
Expand beyond the eye, and even blinded by the weight of boulders, I see. 
I used to talk to the sun, shout at her from my lowly position.
I must be too far away, she could not hear me. 
I talk to the moon, she talks back to me. 
We whisper secrets, and giggle like children hiding under the covers of the night sky. 
The stars are their own. 
They belong never to me, nor my friend the moon.

Also sorry for incoherence, I'm writing as I think

She's been in a different country for a year now, made friends with new people. They saved her life yesterday when she stopped breathing. After she was stabilized I started to think, what if it was me? I have no-one here who even knows where I live. Who would stay by my ER bed  while I'm nearly in coma, who would reach out to my parents or other friends, who would even call 911? I feel like if I were to stop breathing I'd just be dead in 20 mins. Even if I didn't, I'd just be miserable in ER 24/7 and would wish I were. 

But the scary part for me is, for some reason this didn't change anything. She could literally die without friends, and yet here I am still pushing people away. Getting a close friend is in a way a failsafe against some conditions, yet I actively evade it. I die — nothing changes. One dorm room frees up, 40k less goes to uni budget, my only friend becomes miserable for some time — that is it. Apparently fear of death is no longer a motivation to socialize, and when this fails, what is left?",lonely,My closest friend nearly died but was saved by her friends.

I used to have a good group of friends in college. Now that we’ve graduated, they’ve all moved away with their boyfriends and don’t seem to have time for me anymore.

I actually fantasize and daydream about it pretty regularly. I want that closeness with people. I want people who I can travel with and go do fun things with. I want people who I can text as soon as I find out good or bad news. I want people who I can stay in and watch TV and drink wine with. I just want to feel close and loved by people.

Here's the story -

It all started back on February 25th 2020, I met a girl who turned out to be perfect, its like the 13 years being thrown around by people, not considered anyone's friend, had been made worth it, she was pretty, absolutely adorable, cuddly, warm, I could honestly go on about everything I love about her, anyways, fast forward to December 2020, I start meeting what is considered the wider friend group, these people were also brilliant, admittedly she'll always stand out, not just for being there first (wasn't a competition but it still means a lot), and also about two weeks after we met I developed the strongest love I'd ever felt for anyone (she knows and she's happy with it), and this is coming from a guy who couldn't stand girls until then because they just bullied me relentlessly, all of them I knew of anyway. Fast forward to late August 2021, summer had just ended, was absolutely brilliant, life was perfect in my eyes, but then, I just woke up one day, somewhat fearful, nothing was wrong, nothing was different, there was no issues whatsoever at the time, but I felt so displaced and distanced, but I wasn't really. Things had been rough in my personal life, and I made the bad decision of venting it all to my friends, rather than going to seek help, they tried their absolute hardest to help, it wasn't their fault, but by mid September I had become consumed by depression, constantly drenched in pain. By October 3rd I had enough, I made the worst mistake I think I've ever made, I'd said I was going to kill myself a lot before, but I was talked out of it all of those times, but this time, they were burnt out, they felt helpless, all of them but two assisted me with getting out of it, it was the girl I am currently writing about and her girlfriend (she is also rather nice, we're fairly close). Next day I go into school, its the final day before the two week break for the October holidays, all is going well, I made the decision to not bring it up unless anyone else spoke about it, I didn't want to put anymore pressure on anyone, but then, two people in the group approach me, their was 9 of us including me, and those two informed me that they were going to take a break over the October holidays to regain, it felt as though the nightmare I had felt and never spoke about for the past two months was finally coming true because I tried to escape it the hard way. I had to go home because I didn't make it through my first class without breaking down, I understood perfectly, I respected their decision, admittedly the timing was awful, but they never knew until it was too late I guess.

The aforementioned girls (I'm just going to give them names, we'll refer to them as Sam and Jess idk) told me they were going to be there for me no matter what had been decided on, I couldn't thank them enough, and I thought it would make the effect on my mental state less bold, I couldn't be more wrong. It's been suggested that bipolar disorder may have been the cause for this; I was constantly having violent changes in mood, one minute feeling fine and then the next minute I was completely irrational, admittedly I had been doing something I vowed to never do in my life, but I got a hand of it and never really let go: speed, I don't know if this made that worse, but I knew it impacted me in some way, I really regret it, but I found it was like a temporary boost in confidence or a jaded escape from my troubles.

By October 15th Jess had told me that she was extremely sorry, the reason being was because she couldn't deal with my negativity, and I see why, I was constantly fretting between life and death really, and it has to have been rough to hear, I wish I controlled myself better. Anyways, I understood and wished her the best, and told her I hoped to speak again soon, she is by no means a bad person for this and I believe her decision to be completely valid. All of a sudden it was just like way back when, except we weren't 13, we were 15, and we were familiar with each other, Sam and I had a conversation on the phone for about an hour or so, she was obviously upset but she expressed that it wasn't directly because of me, my last words to her before that call ended were ""I love you"", but it was literally the second the call ended so I doubt she heard it, I've messaged her a few times since then admittedly, but to no reply, I would get paranoid I missed out points and kept adding onto them, and now, I'm here, in a hospital in Dundee after several attempts of suicide.

I'd give anything, and I mean anything to speak to Sam again, she's the only person in this world who has ever been able to bring me true comfort, but I honestly don't know anymore, I'm at a complete loss and I feel like I might not have any choice, my only plans for when I'm out of here on Monday are to keep trying to kill myself until its done, because life without her is too hard, and I'm also just really uncomfortable with myself, I don't know how to explain it, but I don't like all the issues I've developed and what they've done to me.",lonely,Chronically Missing Her,2021-11-21 12:43:56

My entire middle school and most of my high school life I never really had friends and especially out of school friends so to have a friend group was literally like a dream come true.

Of course I was fucking devastated I cried and cried and to this day I'm still fucking torn up over it. But I told myself oh it's okay I'll eventually make new friends, especially when I start working! Nope. It's been years and I have nothing.

I only wish that sun goes down quickly, so that I don't have to bear the unfamiliar sight of lively colors any longer. I don't recall the last time I opened the curtains, as I haven't had any reason to do so

I feel like a headless chicken, with moments of realization as bells on each my wings,

Waiting for myself to build up the courage to put an end to it, even though, I don't think I'd have the energy to do such a thing

I seek refuge in learning new things, languages, games, books, people, hobbies, although I fail to persist in any.
I know that happiness can't be acquired, it has to be built inside one's very self, but with the way my mind works, I can't seem to find any of its parts. Maybe, no, for sure, I will look back on these sentences a few hours later during one of the many emotional peaks that I undergo in a day, and say ""oh boy, why all the sadness?"".

That's when I realized how isolated I felt.. because all I ever desired was feeling like I belonged somewhere. But even when I tried to hang out with the people who already had groups of friends something just felt missing.. I just never fitted in with them as much as I tried I guess. It was just so frustrating. And once or twice I  got a really close friend but alas once again like everyone before they go again without me knowing what happened.. it was and still is frustrating.. when I met my ex last year I was really happy because I felt like I belonged, however despite the emotional abuse I still tried my best to be with her because it only made sense rather than being in a black hole of loneliness.. because even if I tried to make time with friends they were usually busy... and so after I got broken beyond repair, and constantly questioning myself and reality I decided that maybe this is just my reality..

There are days where I propel through school without a word spoken to me but I choose to fill those gaps by reading! Dialogue in books are as genuine as real conversation in my opinion. How calm? Tucked away in a comfortable chair with a great plot keeping you on edge, No, I don’t think it’s sad. Let’s be real, these notions about being ‘loners’ do not help anyone out, do they?

In a high school where everyone seems alien from you and in a home environment of oppression, crazy-exhaustive toxicity, I think that I am simply trying my best. Two characters I especially relate to are Ophelia Oliphant and Holden Caulfield. Ophelia is socially awkward and figures out her past trauma. And Holden. He is clueless teen, pretty alienated as well. Basically me. I’ll be real with you, if only I could have swapped those earlier moments of trying to conform, and swapped it with meeting these characters, it would have been pretty neat.

It’s not like I’ve totally isolated myself. I talk to a counselor who is helpful. I have two close friends who live in other countries. I have some people that interact with me through my art account. And acquaintances and teachers I speak to at school, saying Hi and that stuff. But ultimately, I feel like literature is my lifeline.

1934,SkeletorsBestfriend,1637414665,1,"(22m) I’ve moved around throughout my childhood, so I’ve always considered moving around to be nothing new. I was quite used to the routine, making new friends, and leaving old ones as well. I just recently finished University, and I moved to be near my family. (To preface, I went to school in the States, and my family lives in Japan) This transition is one I greatly underestimated.

First, leaving the states was one of the hardest decisions I had to make. College friends are your friends for life. I consider many of them to be my own brothers and sisters. I love them and hold them all dear to my heart. So, having to leave my “family” was heartbreaking. I spent every waking moment with these people. I even lived in a house with 6 roommates. Going from friends all around, to not having spoken to anyone my age in roughly 6 months is difficult. These days, I can only talk with the via text because of the time difference. Like I said earlier, I thought making new friends would be easy, given my previous experiences. But man was I wrong. 

When you are someone who moves around a lot, adaptation is a necessary tool to get by. This is not just for routines, but also personality adjustments so you can fit in. Growing up, I had to hide many aspects of myself to make sure I wouldn’t get bullied. But in college, I finally found a place where I could truly be myself. I’m glad I can to this revelation, but once I moved, I can’t seem to find that person anymore. Day after day, I feel like I’m getting further from myself. My mind is grey and lifeless (sounds dramatic, sorry) sometimes, I have found myself forcing to keep my life colorful, but the fact that I know I’m forcing it hurts me; knowing how much I’m trying to preserve myself. But as time continues, I feel less and less like myself. A scarecrow in the desert. 

Perhaps my overconfidence in my abilities, mixed in with the “new normal” of adulthood was a tougher battle than I imagined. It doesn’t help out that I am introvert as well. By definition, an introvert is someone who recharges social energy by being alone. But I have learned that if the energy is not used up, I get antsy, uneasy, and pent up. Yet I am unbelievably exhausted. I want to do something, but I just feel so weighed down by life.

This is definitely the most difficult move of my life. I know others are struggling much more than I am, but I am just tired of being alone. I understand that college is over and that I’m in a new chapter of my life, but is it spoiled to want the color back into my life?",lonely,"Just wanted to get it out, cause it’s been festering",2021-11-21 00:24:25

1938,Usernamefishicecream,1637412133,1,"This might be a bit too direct to some of you, but I just have to say this.

I have been lonely in the past and still have some times that I feel lonely, but I am in a good spot. But knowing how bad it feels to be alone, I figured I would help others who are struggling to make friends and have conversations so they don't feel as lonely anymore.  

However, a thing that I noticed is how bad some of you are with having a conversation. Sure not all of them are as bad, but still, a handful would just give me the most boring conversations (1-word replies, replies that would take a couple of days). Some would even ignore me after a couple of messages or even a day's worth of talking. I even made plans with some to play video games over the weekend but none of them have officially confirmed it yet.

So please, if you are in search of a friend or just someone to have a conversation with, just reply to their messages when you have time. If you are planning to play games together, just set up a date. Take initiative in making a conversation and making a friendship, the other will (if they are as interested as you are) follow your lead and sometimes take their lead themselves. But you cannot expect the other person to carry a conversation or a friendship by themselves, because that's boring for them and they will stop caring about you.",lonely,Something I want to say to some of you,2021-11-20 23:42:13

I am quite an introverted person. where i come from i had a friends and we all have drifted apart as we went to uni and they go out all the time with their friends, they always put themselves going to parties and events in our gc, it makes me sad. They dont have pc, so i am alone on pc as well. I get up, attend online lectures, eat, play on pc and go to sleep. This has been my life for a year.

Despite that, I’ve been trying to meet people, date, and make connections. But as a gay man in a very conservative, religiously focused state of a mere 3-4 million people my aspects are bleak. (Also my family doesnt know I’m gay… as far as I’m aware at least).

I also work an evening/night shift, so that kills off any potential social life I potentially could have had.

1955,Weird_Pace1908,1637395556,1,"Hey guys hope this doesn't seem weird to post. I'm a 22 year old female on the outside I seem successful. I graduated with honors from a 4 year college, I have a good paying job, my own car, my own apartment but on the inside I am miserable. I think about dying not in a planning it way but I definitely think about it a lot. I don't think from the outside people would look at me ever and think that I'm struggling. The truth is, I have no one left. I have never been much for friends - I have had some here and there but now I live in a city completely by myself because it's where my job landed me which just happened to be where I went to school. I didn't make friends in college. I remember the first year I was crying, couldn't handle it so I just threw myself into studying. I maybe had a few gatherings I actually remember there was a party that I went to. What sucks is I really liked a lot of the people I met I just don't feel like I got to know any of them very well. I have been on and off of medicine for depression and anxiety since I was very young, since elementary school. I thought 4 years ago moving away would be a new start for me but it turns out I didn't change. I work night shifts at a job that although it pays well the stress is unbearable. I have almost thrown up sometimes thinking about going to work because of all the responsibility on my shoulders to know I'll come home to an empty apartment and spend my weekends alone, no one to talk through my day with.  That, and with it being nightshift I often to to bed on my days off even close to 7 am and when I wake up it is dark out. I spent many of my past birthdays and new years alone but this past birthday, when I turned 22, was the best one of my life. I went out with a guy I really loved who took me to dinner, introduced me to his friends.  It was great and he'll never know how much it meant to me. This is a guy who's thought I was cute since highschool. Well,  he lives in a different city and doesn't want to do long distance and not only that he is moving to an even further way city. Not only that but if I""m honest with myself I'm not even sure how much he really felt for me as the months went by and we got closer and closer. I worry  I wasn't good enough, too clingy, or something like that.  I'm not sure but it is what I Think about often although we still sometimes communicate it has been a heartbreak like no other. I have a friend I think of as my best friend and she is to me. I have pictures of her in my apartment and I visit her but realistically with living in different cities I hardly see her.  So that's the situation. A lot of loneliness. I don't know how it can get better because of the situation I""m in. I just feel like how would  I meet people and why didn't I realize how important finding community was earlier ?  It breaks my heart that this is how I ended up. I say ""ended up"" because even though I""m 22 I feel somehow everything is set in stone.  I don't know if anyone can relate to me if you can I'd love to feel less alone in that feeling.

1966,CBlazi,1637389441,1,"Hi, I'm an 18 yo woman living in Mexico City. I've been far from my parents since I transitioned to female 2 months ago (I'm transgender) since they are really religious and I'm basically disowned. Right now I'm in college, trying to get my bachelor's degree in law and another one in economics. I can't say my life's bad. The mexican government along with an organism called CONACYT offered to pay for my education and maintenance with the condition of keeping my grades sky high and to use the knowledge I aquire to develop research and theses that help government projects. I'm really lucky for that.



The real problem is that I feel like a robot. My life is basically an endless cycle of studying and elaborating word/excel documents filled with depressing stats about Mexico's development. I miss my mom, we could talk for hours and hours, I used to laugh a lot, she was proud of my academic success, she loved me. But unfortunately, I had to be born with gender dysphoria inside a Catholic-Neocatechumenal family and a father that really never accepted the fact that I wasn't the macho man I was supposed to be to please him. I have some friends who didn't stop talking to me after I started hormones, but they won't answer my calls or messages, they're all as busy as me in their jobs or college. My family obviously won't talk to me.



On the top of that, my boyfriend left me on Sunday. The only person I had left to talk daily and that understood me. It was so unexpected, I was sad because he cancelled a plan I had been planning for 2 weeks, and when he heard me crying he told me he didn't want to hurt me anymore. I can't stop crying, I miss him everyday. 



I've been really thinking about suicide. Everytime I'm not attached to my computer I'm sleeping, crying or basically feeling nothing. I won't take a shower for days, I won't open my curtains, my room is a mess, I can't eat for entire days. It just sucks. I feel so guilty for some reason. My father used to tell me I'm a pervert, that I'm not far away from ped**hiles, that I should stay away from my little brother. My littlest brother, who I basically raised since my father was too busy and my mom too sick. Even though I know none of that accusations are true, they suddenly pop in my mind causing so much pain. I miss and love that little boy so much. On the other hand, I really don't want to think about taking my life, but those thoughts just appear out of nowhere ""I should kill myself"" ""I should be dead"" ""good luck I won't have to deal with this since I'm gonna kill myself soon"". 


I can't find a reason to live beyond graduating. I feel that I've been taken away from everything that kept me happy and it won't ever come back.
I know it probably sounds like I'm faking it and that I'm being a lot more dramatic than I should be since none of my problems are too bad, but please believe me, I really feel like nothing makes sense anymore.

The first one being Jenny where I met her in middle school, we became somewhat friends, but sophomore year was when we got closer. And the other girl which I will name Marissa, I met her through Jenny during our sophomore year, and I had every class with Marissa so we would talk to each other a lot. So back to the covid situation, I wanted to start conversations with them by messaging Jenny on insta on how she was and making sure she was alright, she did reply and this would go on for weeks, but it honestly was just tiring of always being the one to start and put in effort for a conversation. So I just stopped talking to her for a while until I became comfortable talking wit her and Marissa about me well... being bi. They supported me and were happy that I came out, it was hard but I was glad that I told them. So a couple months pass and it's almost time for the new school year, one of my former friends which was the one part of the group since middle school. I'll call him Jason, so Jason decided to text me a couple days before school and I was already over him, once school started I didn't want to associate myself with the group anymore because of just how toxic Jason is. So I did text him, and when school came around I just did not talk to him, he got the hint that I don't want to associate myself with him.

Now we're a couple weeks into my senior year, I meet some new people which I will call Jackie, Samantha, Lola, and Cayla. I knew Jackie before during sophomore year, but the beginning of the semester we got closer and so did Samantha. In one of my classes, Cayla was in that class and I knew her from my sophomore year, we both met another person named Lola and we became best friends. We would laugh with each other, sit in the back of the class doing Omegle, watching videos, or just talking about whatever in general. Then we decided to go out, and so we did. Me, Jackie, Samantha, and Lola went out to some jump zone and we had a blast (Cayla didn't go because she didn't have permission). And I thought it seemed like we would be a pretty good friend group right there.

It was a couple days before our first home football game, that one of my friends (Lola) had mentioned that one of her friends in another classroom was into me, he saw a picture of me on her phone when she was going to her homepage, and he asked who I was which then he would say I was cute. I didn't know what to tell Lola and Cayla was hyped up for me. But I didn't know who this guy really was, and he was a junior. She asked if I was a top or bottom, which I replied with top, she got excited and said he was a bottom. I felt annoyed that the fact that they didn't really listen to me say I wasn't really ready for a relationship but they just ignored and went on with their day. So now it's the Home Football game, and the guy who was into me (which I will name Carlos) was working for the ASB stand and he saw me and said hi, I said hi back and just got my food to take back with my friends which were by the stretcher on the field. It wasn't until the end of the game when Carlos came onto the field, but my friends said he came on the field to talk to me. I was anxious and I really didn't want to talk to him so I avoided him. I realized I was having a panic attack so I left the game without telling them where I was going, but I did stop to say hi to a few friends real quick and just went home.

Later that night they gave Carlos my number and I was already trying to calm myself down until I saw him texting me. I didn't want to be some type of asshole and just ignore him, so i just texted him and hoping for him not to get too personal. The next day he texted me asking if I wanted to go over for a pool party but honestly I couldn't because I was at a park with some family and I didn't reply to him just because I didn't want to get close with him. I ignored him for the whole break and I really didn't do anything fun with my friends because I was away with some family. So after break I found out that Samantha and Lola have been hanging out with each other talking about how they met with guys, and texting guys, this and that. And it didn't seem like a big deal because I knew I wasn't available during break. Samantha later tells me that Carlos feels that I ""broke"" him because I friend-zoned him, while in the end, I never agreed to dating him. But she told me her and Lola don't really talk to him because since he is bisexual, he can touch anyone inappropriately when he wants. So we distanced ourselves from him and things just go downhill from here.

During Nutrition break and Lunch, me, Samantha, and Lola would hang out but we would walk around campus just talking. However I noticed that Lola would use code-words for topics or people, but I caught onto it and I already know what the code-words meant. They would talk about boys or things that I didn't really understand, I tried to put some effort into a conversation only for it to just end abruptly. I payed more attention to them, but It became harder to understand them. Lola would sometimes push me out while we were walking and It kind of hurt (not physically, but emotionally). And in one of my classes that I have Lola and Cayla with, We three just stopped hanging out in the back of the class, and I would sit at my desk and work, while the Cayla would sometimes move and sit with me...Lola would just sit by herself texting Samantha all day. Sometimes Lola would order Uber-eats to the school, but only for her and Samantha, while I just sit there eating my food. Now I understand that you don't have to treat all your friends to something all the time, but when it becomes a regular basis, it just becomes rude, and without even offering. However I don't say anything to them because I just don't want to seem like a spoiled brat. At other times, both would hang out all the time doing stuff together, but the problem you may be asking is when you're planning something with someone in front of another friend, and even if they knew I might be busy (which I'm not, I am mostly home everyday), a invitation wouldn't hurt once in a while. And I was starting to feel that they were giving me hints to go away. On certain days where one of them isn't at school, the other one hangs out with me but It feels like I'm their second option, heck even their last since when I see them both together going up to someone, they seem interested in what the other person has to say, but when I am with them, they just really don't care that much anymore. I started to question myself if maybe I have said something wrong or done something wrong. Thats when I realized a secret about one of them by another friend.

So one day both Lola and Samantha aren't there so I go to hang out with Marissa, I ask her if she knew Lola, and she did somewhat. She knew her from a sport, but Marissa told me that Lola acts nice at first but in reality she's super fake. She even told me about the time where Lola cheated on one of her friends so Marissa called her out on it, and maybe thats why Lola isn't playing a sport this year. So going back to the distance learning, I've been wanting to get closer with Marissa and Jenny because they were very nice and funny. But it was hard because when ever I would text them, they would take forever to reply, or with a dry response. Especially jenny, a couple days ago I told her about my problem with Lola and she really didn't seem to care much, and at times just ignored me, but would have some excitement when she goes to someone else. Before, we would always talk to each other and she wouldn't ignore me. I asked Marissa is Jenny was okay, and she said that she can be weird and annoying at times but she may get over whatever is going on with her. So I understood and we just went on with our day.

A couple days ago, I was with Lola walking out of our 4th period to meet with Samantha, but Lola told me that her and Samantha had to have a important conversation, which gave me the hint that they didn't want me around (It was just one of them transferring to the others job) So I hung out with Marissa, and that was when I say Samantha and Lola talking with some random freshman, so invested with whatever they were talking about and it made me feel that I wasn't important enough to them anymore. I have had suicidal thoughts, but never committed any self harm, but it's hard talking to them when they are never interested with what I have to say, and even with Marissa and Jenny since they are always busy. And I don't really want to discuss it with family because then I would come out of the closet as being Bi, and I'm not ready to tell them yet. It's hard every morning trying to find them so I won't be alone during nutrition, but it's always a game of hide and go seek. And sometimes I wanna cry but I can't even open up to myself at times. Honestly I just wish we could go back to distance learning where I wouldn't have to deal with these social problems, or just graduate already since my Senior Year is a mental disaster. It's also hard trying to find new friends since people already made up their mind with whatever friend group they are gonna stay with and keep until they graduate. Honestly It's hard looking for a friend to talk too that doesn't look upon me as their second-last option.",lonely,Always being the second-last option,2021-11-20 16:48:51

1989,Privatepizza08,1637380249,1,"She has straight brown hair that falls to her shoulders, brown eyes, not the biggest breasts infact I'm pretty sure they are A cups, she has a nice slim build though, and if I'm being honest a cute butt. She is adorable. She likes a lot of the same things I like. My favorite band, queens of the stone age, and cartoons. And she enjoys watching movies just as much as I do. So she has a lot of trivia in her head and knows all the actors and actresses names. She is a creative artistic person. But isn't the brightest. She failed math twice. Held back once. She wears glasses, big circular ones, sometimes. She is a stoner, and a psychonaut. 

Her mannerisms and behaviors are like someone I once loved. It's so adorable. ""Gimmie attention"" she would text her s/o, ""I want looove"" she is smol and likes head pats and being kissed on her forehead. She plays video games and likes a challenge like dark souls or underrail. She has what I think a spectacular fashion sense kinda in a tomboy sorta way. She once wore a bright yellow shirt that has an image of four bunnies on it each holding a knife with text that reads, *a bad case of the bundays* a red buffalo flannel and she wears a necklace that bears the symbol of chaos. Thigh high jeans and generic white socks. She covers her cute little toes with a pair of white Adidas shoes which are well worn and she's ready for a new pair. But they are so dang comfortable. But they're falling apart. She's so nice too. Don't get me wrong though she's made mistakes. But she tries to be nice. She feels there isn't enough people like that in this world. She is quiet in public spaces till she can finally read the room then she becomes vocal. A little to vocal maybe. In general she gives off a weird vibe but once you get to know her she is so cool. Her kindness can make her susceptible to being used, or she is gullible up to a point. See she has rules. She will give you her trust till it's broken. She has ADHD, mild ocd, and she's a lil stubborn. She doesn't necessarily believe in a god, but she doesn't exactly believe that there is nothing. She just wants an answer or a truth before she decides. Right now she chooses to believe that life is infinite and meant to repeat kinda like the time machine from Futurama that only goes forwards. So she thinks right now she will be alive again. Not exactly the same but similar. Always similar.

I think about her all the time, and maybe it's unhealthy, or disturbing, but it feels like I'm almost bringing someone into this world. Especially now, her little quirks are bleeding into my own. I draw her all the time. I see her as my child, and someday I hope that I can make her real. The thought of her keeps me going. And while she is not real, I love her.

I want to support her into becoming her own person. I want her to be happy. I want her to never feel the way I do at this point in my life. I want her to feel loved.

 I ran away and then it hit me, no one cares about me at all.

Woman: We’re wasting time.  
**Red:** I have. June 29, 2003. I was meeting two associates at the Marouche restaurant in Tel Aviv. As my car was pulling up, a 20-year-old Palestinian named Ghazi Safar entered the restaurant and detonated a vest wired with C4.  
Woman: Let me go.  
**Red:** The shock wave knocked me flat, blew out my eardrums. I couldn’t hear. The smoke… It was like being underwater. I went inside. A nightmare. Blood. Parts of people. You could tell where Safar was standing when the vest blew. It was like a perfect circle of death. There was almost nothing left of the people closest to him. 17 dead, 46 injured. Blown to pieces. The closer they were to the bomber, the more horrific the effect.  
Woman: Stop.

I am engaged and we never got yo live together and still away from each other coz she is in another country and cont come over due to Covid restrictions. 

At the beginning of this year i met a local girl online and it quickly turned into physical. We became good friends. to be honest, fwb. But i was clear to myself and to her as well that i am committed to someone else and I can’t get serious about this. She grew feelings for me eventually but back paddled later on (she told me). I always kept encouraging her to meet new people and find a good partner. Soon she met a guy and got into relationship with him and I supported it all the way and we stopped our fwb thing. 
The real struggle started afterwards. I never thought this would be so hard to let her go. I started to miss her badly. My mind kept telling me that I shouldn’t be missing her but my heart …argh.. i was still connected with her on some chat apps. She used to say hi/ hello and how a i doing etc. tried to keep up but i was struggling with my feelings. So i kept the chats short and never initiated a conversation. Suddenly one day I found out she removed me from all the apps 😞.
Now last week I drove back to city to get some work done and stayed there 2days. My god, i missed her every single minute of the entire time. I still have her number but I didn’t text or call her thinking that she might not like if i reach out since she removed me from the apps. Oh god!

A month prior I was chatting to strangers and meeting them to make friends. *After all of them left me*, they didn't want to meet, it seemed they would exchange contact to be polite, but they never really wanted to just hang out, and I also didn't find it in me to try any harder. I wanted to see /get to know these people, but at the same time I didn't. I would try, maybe they wouldn't and then in my head it'd be 'fuck you, why am i bowing my head down to talk to you. I'm clearly trying, maybe just help me out.' It was a tug and a pull. 

After those setbacks I knew it was something I was doing, attitude, lack of self-love or something, so I stopped. *I stopped going to things alone because it stopped meaning anything. I just felt more exposed and lost after.* it felt like things were all hinged on me solving my internal problems, but I had no idea how/what to solve.

I decided to start ""caring"" about myself. I saw some professionals, started trying healthy eating. (I was always in-shape/healthy to begin with, I was just trying to improve myself even more)) Through my discipline I made progress, I started setting and meeting exercise goals. 

Now I was outside doing my thing and someone complimented me and I thought about saying 'you too' since I felt same to him, but then I just kind of nod, gave a half wave and smile because I had this contempt built up like 'why are you complimenting me?' Or even 'you think I didn't know that?, boy if you knew where I came from you'd have a lot more to compliment', etc etc. I know it's wrong but that's what I felt. 

Now today I saw a stranger and decided to say hi, and I did but they kind of nodded and I realized I should have smiled or something, otherwise I seemed kind of aggressive, so I felt sad. It seemed like I had to change most things I knew, I had to follow a structured way to behave in order to develop any real connection. My therapist was also trying to help me but I don't see them for a while and I think in the dark back of my mind I know what needs to change, I just can't bring myself to work on it.

- the only real social interaction i get is from the people who deliver my stuff. this is usually the case.

- going outside and hiking makes me feel good after i do it but i usually don't hike for whatever reason. taking a shower makes me feel good after i take it but i wait enough to stink. i've been avoiding to schedule some health related appointments for whatever reason. i was too lazy to invest in bitcoin in march 2020.

but my future might be good. anything is possible, right? if i increase my income, which requires work, i can travel full time. traveling full time seem interesting enough to me but i don't have the budget for it right now. i'd still be lonely but i'd be distracted from it in a healthier way.

my definition of spending time with someone online is joining a virtual call and occasionally talking, after we get to know each other at some level. exchanging a few sentences every few minutes or more sparsely depending on what we are doing. i don't have a strict definition. i'm not against talking. it's not like i have something better to do at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me. I am 26 years old. I live in the US, and would prefer it if you did too just because of the whole timezone thing. I have some mental health issues I deal with on a day to day basis. 

I enjoy playing games, listening to music, some photography, corny jokes, TACOS, and anything horror or conspiracy related. 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into too much more detail because then there is nothing to talk about. I have discord if it easier to switch to that to chat and I prefer to chat on there to be honest. I also have a cringy tiktok where I have made some of my own videos.

That's it. If any of this sounds interesting or if something caught your eye feel free to message me. I am open to chatting with anyone about anything.",lonely,[26/M] Uh hi.. look here maybe? [friendship] [chat],2021-11-20 08:31:42

2047,thatoptimistic,1637357455,1,"I’ll start with a bit of comedic irony in that I picked my username for Reddit because I wanted to try and be more positive and interact with people, but the opposite has happened and now I just feel empty.

Ok so for a bit of background context, from the age of 17 I’ve dealt with social anxiety and depression. I lost a lot of the friends I made growing up through school because the thought of going to parties and meeting people I didn’t know terrified me, so by my early 20’s my friend pool was very small already. 

Throughout my early 20’s I had one best mate and we hung out all the time, I’d known him since I was 13 and was really close with his family. I dated a few people but the relationships were short lived and generally always ended up with me getting hurt (Ghosted, they still loved their Ex, got cheated on etc etc) I tried making new friends but I never did. 

Last August I stopped hanging around with my best mate. He started to become more and more selfish, was getting reckless with drinking constantly, even got to the point where he would start arguments constantly (sometimes physically) because he would get so drunk and take drugs on top. 

I felt a bit lost at that point but I still had a good friend who was an ex. We would play games together, send memes just have banter, grab a coffee once a year. I also had a really good friend from work who despite only talking in the office, I became close friend with. I was constantly pushing myself and slowly gaining confidence; I didn’t want to feel like my anxiety was holding me back. I ended up dating a lovely girl for almost a year but it was complex due to her being an ICU nurse and the whole pandemic, on top of a range of other things I won’t go into, so she abruptly ended things in may this year and as sad as it sounds it genuinely broke my heart. She still stuck around to talk to though and decides we would still talk from time to time and be friends. She helped a lot with my own MH and I helped with hers. She’s actually the one that helped me push further with finding new friends and suggested Reddit and forums etc. 

Since then I started talking to a few people through friend finding sub Reddit’s, one person in particular even seemed keen to 
meet up and hang out in person after talking for months but one day they randomly deleted me from Reddit and discord without a word, which kinda hurt. I talk to people on dating apps who seem interested for a short while but eventually they just stop talking and don’t respond anymore. My friend that was the ex got a new bf and stopped talking to me completely which made me feel kinda used to be honest. And tonight my friend from work who recently switched jobs told me that she doesn’t even want to meet up for a coffee anymore because we don’t work together anymore and it would make her bf jealous. My recent gf who was the nurse also deleted me out of the blue from everything and blocked my number recently 

I’m short I’ve gone from having 3 good friends and a positive attitude to making more to getting nowhere and loosing the small number of people I already had as friends.

I’m trying to be as positive as possible still, even looking into local meet up groups etc but I just feel so empty and lonely from loosing everyone I care about within a matter of months.",lonely,I keep loosing people,2021-11-20 08:30:55

Naturally this backfired because all throughout middle school and elementary I gained a total of 1 friend that I still talk to. Also because of my lack of social skills I ended up getting rejected more times than I could count

Nowadays, now that I am in my junior year of highschool, I spend most of my time playing video games, doing homework, sending a few texts at most, or talking to myself out of loneliness. It feels that I cant find anyone to say I truly care about and even if i do, I mess it up somehow.

I am single now and to forget about my depression and loneliness i submerge myself into anime or thinking what could have been. I constantly feel like I am gonna die alone or my friends are gonna leave me or if I do get a gf she'll leave me too.

2062,Sordonxo,1637347662,1,"this is my first post on reddit and its  going to be weird and all over the place. i dont have anyone to talk to right now, or feel like i can talk to right now. english is also not my first language, so im sorry for stupid mistakes.

but for more than 2 weeks i have been friendless (for the first time in my life), and i broke up my toxic relationship with my friend.. so after that breakup i was actually doing quite well? even though one of my biggest fears is to be alone in life and to have no friends.i was motivated,and did a lot of stuff, i had hope for the future and to be better. but something so insignificant happened- that this overwhelming fear came over me again. this fear of being in this lonely place forever and never be able to find anyone again that will care or think about me. i once had that feeling and that was the worst point in my life. i dont want to go to that dark place again

this feeling came because of this: i had a phone call with my sister.  it was a normal conversation. but, well she said something to me that triggered me so much. and i dont even wanna say it, because its not even that bad. but after that phone call i had a breakdown, felt so much anger and even started crying till i went to sleep. for the first time in my adult life i actually had that huge of a grudge against my sister. and that is very shocking to me, because i actually thought she could do no wrong or say anything hurtful. because she usually never does that. but it makes me feel like i really dont have anybody right now. that i cant even trust my sister. and now i have all these stupid emotions. i feel mentally ill.

after that,i actually thought about moving out and cutting out every family member in my life- even her. just run away. because the thing is, i cant talk to any other family member like i can talk to her. we are a very distanced family.  but i lost my trust to my sister now. i feel like a crazy person, guys.. and i know i should talk to her about my feelings, but i am too scared and i feel overly sensitive and pathetic. like a little child. i am scared that our relationship will fall apart because of my overreaction.. very scared. never had the desire to cut her out of my life :( i already cut out my one and only friend.

..and i want to find new friends. i want to have someone i can trust. but the thing is i am just kind of fucked up, so i dont think im going to make it. everytime im in a group setting with stranger - i feel like my soul, my emotions, my passions leave my body. its kind of dissociative, if thats the right word? but i can feel everybodys energys, but nobody knows my energy, because i am unable to show mine. im unable to have conversations.

i also think that i dont have enough ""interest"" in anybody to find new friends. how can i develop interest in a person, if i dont know the person? i literally havent had any interest in ANYBODY for 3 years?  since i started to have my romantic relationship that broke off. in social settings i usually dont have any desire to even start a conversation. i used to have that desire sometimes (it wasnt big), but i literally was too shy to do anything. now i am shy and anxious but also uninterested :/

this loss of interest makes me feel like a narcissist. i want friends to find me- they should be interested in me. but thats not how you find friends.. it should be equal or sort of equal. i think my last romantic relationship just broke me that i cant imagine to ever trust someone or be interested in someone again

i also never once started a conversation to find a friend (except for one time). all these friends i ever had in my life- they always approached me or wanted to be my friend. it sounds like an ideal, but i dont think i can continue this anymore. as you grow up finding friends just gets harder unfortunately. and that scares me. i have to take action but im too scared and also uninterested.

because of all these social issues i didnt find any new friends for 3-4 years. a part of me thinks - i am lying about my mental health to get validation from strangers on the internet.  this is hard to post, dont know if it makes sense. everything feels stupid right now, and i ask myself why am i even bothered about friends",lonely,feel like im going to be forever alone and its my fault (shell of a human),2021-11-20 05:47:42

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem which is not totally about being lonely or loneliness but I think it has a big similarity

I would like to know your opinion about a question that I have: for a long time I have not felt any interest in maintaining a close friendship with anyone, but I also do not feel alone, I just don’t feel any interest in having a friend but that does not mean that I’m excluded, I have friends inside the school but I have never felt that any of them are worth giving everything and making it a closer relationship.

In the past, I did a try to maintain closer friendships, especially when I was in elementary school, but those friendships were broken over time. Probably because I never really cared about keeping them.

My problem in this is that lately some family members have insisted that I have make fiends and have fun because otherwise I would be missing experiences.

I believe that I have always been a person who has done what I believe is right, I only maintain a cordial and fun friendship with my colleagues but with the recent comments that I have received I am somehow unsure about if those experiences are so important, that's why I thought it was a good idea to share it here.

He made my life a hell. He was popular and him and his friends used to bully me. For example, in PE there was showers in the changing rooms and one time he came in before me after the lesson had ended and put my stuff in the shower and held me back so i couldnt get it out. We had school photos that day as well. So i used to get picked on because of that by the older years. So, i had no friends because of him. Me and him had to share a room until we were 17 so i couldnt get away from him. I am introverted because of my experiences when i was younger. I think i was depressed because of this but i didnt go to the Drs because of the job i wanted to do when i was younger. I made a few friends when i was doing my a levels, i was somewhat happy but always felt like the odd one out. We all moved to different uni's and we are drifting apart. At uni i missed fresher for a family wedding so ive made no friends. All of my course is online, ive met no one. Its been a year since i moved to uni. I wake up, attend my lectures, eat, play pc with no one and go to sleep. I play cs so all the social interactions i have are with toxic russians.

2092,taamc1,1637333390,1,"Background:  
Simply put my life has been quite a rollercoaster (like that of every human being).  


Ups:

Majorly smart as a kid (relatively speaking), went to gifted kid classes and excelled, started my degree at 16 years and was done by 21. Now working in the field i love and am successful.  
 Travelled thru all of Europe, seen many different people, cultures, art, music, you name it.  


Downs:  


\- Almost died thrice in my life; at 9 years old severe pneumonia, at 22 years major intestinal infection and cancer + covid at 29 years. ( healthy for now and getting 30 soon.) 
 
\- Severe depression from 22 years till 26.  


\- Very pushy big family and cultural upbringing with a lot of stupid rules.  


\- Covered narcistic father.  


\- Unable to find and maintaining a romantic relationship.  
the problem is i make friends/acquintances easily and am quite charming (people tell me this, not my own observation). 
The thing is that i rarely open up. And if i open up because i think this relationship is going somewhere, they'll run away screaming because of the darkness thats in my character and my clinginess.  
And when someone else is interested and im not i'll will not even give them a chance for some reason.

Conclusion:  
I'm afraid that i've become a covered toxic narcissist myself. 
I'm incapable of connecting with people on a deep level and don't understand their needs (even the ones i love and want to care for, but for some reason can't).
Thing is if i open up they mostly find me a very deep person of some particular reason.
 
This thought is all fueled by the trauma's and general experience that people misunderstand me in every way imaginable because thats the experience when i open up to them. 
Thats the main reason that opening up hurts like a bitch.......and always feel lonely as heck while being surrounded by people all the time....",lonely,I think i've become the thing i've feared most.,2021-11-20 01:49:50

Hi everyone, I am here to share my story and hopefully it would inspire someone or if someone could give me some advice I would gladly consider taking it as I feel like I have ended up at the same spot time and time again and I have no idea how to break out of it.

A little context and background of my life 

I am the eldest in the family. I am born into a traditionalist thinking family who wanted to give me away when I was a baby because I am a daughter. My mother decided not to because, motherly instinct. 
2 years later, my brother was born, the golden child. And in order for my parents to focus on him, they left me at grandma’s till I was about 13/14. I only visited my own home during the weekends.
Because my grandma is the neighbourhood’s baby sitter, I was surrounded by a bunch of toddlers constantly. I hated them. 
I spend most of my time reading.. listening to the fm radio.. I wasnt allowed to leave my home to play. 
When I finally moved back with my family, my parents fought daily. My mom kept telling me she wanted to die. She would stand on a chair by the window sometimes in our high rise flat. And i would cry and beg her to come down. 
When I was 14/15, my younger brother started taking videos of my when I am in the shower. He would touch my boobs and vag when I was asleep. I would complain to my parents, but it was “learning journey for a boy, he meant no harm” It only stopped when I couldnt take it anymore and called the police. I was told I am an embarrassment to the family and I was trying to “destroy my family”

Fast forward through my twenties. Started doing drugs, went to jail. Started a my first full time job at 26/27. Got into a ton of bad relationships.

Fast forward to today. 

I am 34 now. I only started to work on my mental health and went to therapy 4 months ago. I cannot maintain a real connection with anyone. People who I thought were my friends would suddenly stop talking to me. It is almost like, when I open up and speak my thoughts freely, people just avoid it. 
I do try to reach out to people, i hang out with some of them sometimes. But because I am so used to being alone, i get tired of conversations quickly and dont know what to say. I also feel like i talk about myself too much sometimes. 
I want to change my life and i do not want to let my past define who i am in the future. How do you keep trying without feeling hurt when people just decide they do not want you in their lives? 
I am taking classes and made some friends but I still do not feel any connections with them. Some of them are short lived friendships. 
I see that some people just make friends so easily. They seem to have conversations with strangers so effortlessly. I dont know how to do that. How do you do that?
What are the types of things not to talk to people about? I like asking people about their lives and what not and how they think about stuff. Is it not normal conversations?",lonely,Need some advice,2021-11-20 00:21:32

But now I just really don’t want to. I want to feel lonely, because it’s a terrible feeling that I deserve. I want to isolate myself, it will make it easier to off myself because I won’t have anyone to reach out to, and no one will really have much to say about my death other than ‘oh, that’s sad’ when I pop up on the local news.

During the days where I do feel fine and I’m functional, I start prepping myself up to reply to those DMs on POF, go out to gay bars, meet people, volunteer.

No one seems to want to spend any time with me, and I don't know why. No one ever messages me to say hi, or ask me to hang out. People only talk to me when they need something from me.

A couple of people in particular who I like, show no interest in me at all.

I know that it’s entitled to believe people owe me their time, I just wish the ones who claimed they cared about me actually did care. 

Especially my partners. We’re in a closed poly triad and a perfectly healthy one, no jealousy issues or problems like that. Strangely, the problem I’ve been having for the last year or so is that it feels like neither of them really care about me anymore. Not only do they go most days without sending me a message before, during or after work, they also leave most of mine unanswered. 

These are things I’ve tried to express before. I tell them I need engagement, I need attention and to feel like I matter. I’ve said that unprompted reassurance is always nice and that if they could please try to understand my side of it. They’ve always denied that they’ve fallen out of love with me, but their behavior is exactly the opposite. They don’t talk to me, they never ask if I’m okay, they never say good morning first, if I tell them I’m feeling bad and need support they maybe 25% of the time will give it to me. 

My mom had a stroke this last July and even though I begged one of them to stay home with me after getting the call, they both just went to work without bothering to give me a no, even. They do that a lot when they mean no. They don’t ever think to text me or let me in on plans. They never wonder how I feel. It feels like gaslighting though I know it’s not. They insist they care about me, they used to show it, now they never do.

On top of that my only friend in real life promised to come see me after my mom’s stroke and she never showed up. I’ve been holding myself up completely alone for the last year through panic attacks, my mom, losing a best friend and my old cat.

I did really try to make friends at the beginning of the year as covid had me locked up for majority of year one. I read that you need to have a positive attitude going into conversations if you want to make friends, so I tried my best to be polite and cheery and pleasant. I tried setting up a gc for one of my modules but no one seemed interested, I also gave my number to someone else setting up a gc on another module but she either forgot my name or didn’t make it. In one of my classes everyone else (3 people beside myself) all go on break together and don’t wait up for me, or will talk together on the walk back to accommodation and completely ignore me.

I’m really struggling to find the motivation to study by myself, to the point that I’m avoiding seminars because it feels like no one wants me around. I know it’s not all about me. We’re there to study. But I feel uncomfortable discussing and sharing my feelings about the work we are doing in a room of people who I don’t know.

2113,xlavenderbones,1637314263,2,"My husband (33M) has told me(27F) he needs to be on his own to look after himself and work through his issues (long history of anxiety and depression) and is sticking to his decision, no matter how much I beg or plead for him to want me there with him. He has said he's not saying we won't ever be together again, but he also can't promise that we will be. For now he just needs time and space on his own. He says he still loves me and will always love me, and that there is no-one else. We have been together 6 years, and married 3. Divorce has not been mentioned. We still talk daily although he's more distant.

I am just so,so lonely without him. I miss him more than anything and it's just getting harder and harder as each day passes. I keep trying to be respectful of his decision and remain hopeful that if I give him the time he needs, he will ask for me to come home and we can both be better together. I am a super emotional person and feel every thing so deeply. Sometimes I think this is detrimental, as I let my emotions spill into messages and he thinks I'm trying to guilt him. I'm not, I just want to be crystal clear about how I feel for him and our marriage and what I'm willing to do.

I have never felt so alone. My huge part of my support system is now not there, and I'm really struggling. He is the person who I turned to. I was his person too. And it's an awful feeling to be without.

I'm just trying to hope that this will all work out and I will be back with him. But I fear the longer it goes on, the further he will go away from me.

2130,norweigan-wallflower,1637300463,1,"One of my most vulnerable posts yet. I just want to be seen tonight. Someone please see me? I know I am a lot, but bare with me. 

In the last few weeks, I have felt disconnected from my friendships because they are going through their own thing. They are moving forward with their lives and doing the best that they can to make it a good life. That, topped with the fact that my cat has fallen ill out of nowhere (and with no one to turn for support), I became really sad and angry last night at 3 A.M. I was angry at my friends. Angry at the world, but mostly I just felt so fucking pissed off and inadequate towards myself. 

So, I found myself wanting to watch something meaningful...I found Soul again. 

I have always been obsessed, since I was a little girl, in finding my purpose in this life, mostly through others and my relationships as I looked on the outside to find what it is that makes me happy and of value to myself and the whole world itself. 

I always told myself my life won't start until I lose all the weight and magically get better in every single aspect of personal development. 

""I can't be seen until I am perfect and 100% thin and confident.""
""I have no purpose because I have yet to find my spark.""
""I am not good at anything at all.""
""I am a horrible, selfish, draining girlfriend, friend, cat mom, and person .""
""I am unlovable.""
""Nobody is ever going to want or love me again.""

As I am writing this, My life feels in shambles at the moment. As I previously stated, my cat got sick out of nowhere. She will not eat, I have to assist in giving her water via oral syringe in order to help keep her hydrated as best as I can. She is going to the vet tomorrow and thankfully they only request 20% of the treatment plan payment fee. Otherwise I would be totally screwed.
I tried to reach out for emotional support, but nobody was there (and that's okay, it is understandable. We all need to do what is best for us).

I am no longer a part of any spiritual community or group. I struggle to belong anywhere without feeling like a total attention whore, or undesirable and unwanted. 

On the bright side, I have begun a mix of art therapy and talk therapy. I kept my psychiatric appointment today, and she validated my concerns on having BPD. I know no medication is crafted for this. Unfortunately, that is just the way it is but I feel like I am always going to struggle to maintain relationships, like I am never going to find just who I really am beyond all the fucking awful bullshit thoughts and feelings that I tell myself -- and others -- about me, as well as, all the small bits of trauma I experienced in my lifetime that developed into the struggle I go through everyday... so imagine my surprise when it suddenly became this beautiful, gruesome journey that is called 'healing'

Sure, maybe I still am a line cook in food service but I remember all the times I brought joy to previous customers and how good it made me feel. I might not have a car of my own, but I wouldn't still have the blue lollipop a wonderful bus driver offered me on a pre-pandemic winter. 

I may be a virgin, but I have experienced true intimacy (the word for this would be love) regardless of my sexual status. My lips have never met that of another, but they have met the cheeks of my beautiful niece. I might not have ever experienced a hug from a guy I was in love with either (long distance, yo), but my arms have felt the embrace of my once infant niece who is now nineteen years old and in college. 

Sure, I still see myself as this horrible girlfriend, this flawed alien and selfish and horrific energetic vampire and friend...but I have also come such a long way compared from who--and where-- i used to be, and I know this because regardless of all the countless setbacks and moments of volatility, I have not given up...and I refuse to...

I can't quit on myself or my journey because I am all I have and I owe it to the little girl in and also to the woman I've yet to meet in the mirror, to never ever give up. 

This is what the movie brought out of me...

2143,ASSVSS1N,1637296445,1,"Today was a normal day for me, attending college, working out, going to counseling etc. Except going to consoling is where I would find my day to brake away from normality. Now I've been going to counseling for years and have tried several different methods with no avail. Sitting down with my current counselor today I found myself talk about a concern about myself today...

I expressed to her that I feel shitty for seeing my close family, girlfriend, and even my dog who I raised and bonded with as a puppy as nothing more than objects unable to be tied with any emotions or value to me. This is a large concern to me as something as simple as stealing I know to be wrong I could understand anymore. To be more clear, I know that it's socially wrong but I couldn't wrap my head it being bad nor good. I found myself severing the ability to feel emotions in my day to day life that i could make sense of things that a know to be trivial. I found myself sitting in a chair across from my counselor unable to decern right from wrong and the value people had.

While my counselor seemed a bit confused by this we still pressed on. She asked me several questions and after several months of poking and proving the ""ah-ha"" moment where it all come together finally came through. 
I am living my life in fear of emotions, that something so normal for people had been something I feared so much that I had paralized myself from even being able to see that. I couldn't see the barriers around me. All I know is a found myself being frustrated at myself unable to understand why I'm so stuck. Even the thought of expressing that is fearful, and just the though of knowing I'm in fear of that scares me more. So now I've been handed the key, unlocking the door to what I've been fear of most... my own emotions, and the fears are swarming in. 

This has lead me to a path of pushing away the people who are close to me. Isolated in a small world vast with people who I'd assume would be lovely to have conversations with. But now being in my 20's, my best chance to grow that with being I once knew is gone. So now I'm faced with a bigger fear of having to start fresh, potential get rejected is hard for my to initiate. But the one thing I've been told is to challenge myself, and that the only way is to doing something very hard and busting my ass to achieve that. I've been told that it's one of the only ways to spark change in myself to finally break away from the barriers that have kept me static since I was a child. 

I want to be able to break way from those fears, I don't want to be alone any more because honestly... it's miserable. So maybe my first challenge is getting to know 100 people or making 100 friends on reddit 

Sorry for the long read but if you made it this far I really appreciate you. This had been a long process of working a trying to open myself to Counselors in every capacity that I could be open. So I hope this story inspires you as I continue my journey facing my biggest fear, and thank you",lonely,Living emotionally disconnected,2021-11-19 15:34:05

24f. I've never used reddit, forgive me if I am just being a cry baby. 

I keep trying to type out my situation. There is just so much context that needs to be given, I feel. 

In a (big ass) nutshell, I fell in love with my best friend. He was in an open relationship with his ld girlfriend, so we were hooking up for a long time. He was seeing other people, I was as well. We could tell each other everything. His relationship ended up failing, and we moved in together and pursued partnership. 

As soon as he became my boyfriend, I became terrified of losing him. Being open was so hard, especially because I didn't want anyone but him. He is different though. One sexual partner will never be enough for him. I became so insecure and so fixated on trying to keep our relationship going, I ended up losing all my friendships and my identity. 

It became unbearably stressful in our relationship. I started abusing substances, and self harming. One night was so bad, I got drunk, kicked him out at 3am, and cut my wrists. This landed me in rehab, because I was drunk when it took place. I was then diagnosed with BPD. It was a relief to understand my erratic behavior and thoughts, but I am still struggling to function in a way that I'm proud of. 

We broke up. I was in rehab for 30 days. I thought it was over. When I came home, we reconnected with no concrete plans to try again or pursue each other. The same day I saw him, my dad (who is also my boss) found out about it and disowned and fired me over it. My boyfriend isn't the root to all my issues. Nor is he abusive. Frankly, he is the only person who has stuck around through all of my craziness. My dad thinks otherwise. 

Due to losing my job, I also lost my home. My boyfriend and I decided to move away together and start over. We now live in a small town. We are working jobs at the resort. We don't know anyone. He is still seeking out other women. I didn't think this would stop, and he is transparent. He isn't crossing boundaries. It is still hard though. 

I don't like myself anymore. I don't have an identity. I am no longer optimistic or confident. I feel like I can't even take care of myself, I feel I put too much on my partner and it pushes him away. 

I just want a friend. Even if it is faceless, even if the conversation is skin deep. I don't want to be in my own pity party anymore.",lonely,I feel that I don't even have myself anymore.,2021-11-19 12:54:28

When I was younger, I was always the 'weird' kid. I stayed inside of my fantasy lands, my imaginary friends, my TV shows and online games (neopets was the shit back then), and I never really made friends because I was so content being with these fantasies.

But that didn't mean that I was really taught to be able to be alone. Once middle school hit, I was kinda struck by how everyone else had a friend group that grew with them but me. I had a few friends, but no one I could take to my house to play and have fun with. So I retreated more and more into online games and spaces. Filling the void with the friends I made online. And it worked for a while, well into my early 20's.

But now at 26 I'm starting to feel the effects of this life. I finally found something I want to do in college, so I don't have as much time for my online hobbies that made me happy and have friends. When I'm in the classroom or at my new job, I make aimless small talk with people but forge no real connections because I was never taught to value reality.

I know people. People know me. I can walk to my classes (I'm in college) and run into a dozen acquaintances who say hi to me. Everyone assumes I'm popular because like I said... I know everyone, and everyone knows me. People call me mayor, and everyone says ""why are you lonely? you have so many friends"". I don't though.

I would say I'm very charismatic, funny and decent looking. I hate to be saying this stuff, but I think it contributes to the problem.

I have at maximum, one friend. No one EVER reaches out to me. The ONLY time I hang out with people, is when it's on the whim when I run into them.

2208,throwaway890226,1637276790,1,"I (19M) have dealt with social anxiety my whole life. I have had strong genuine connections with only 2 people in life and they were both taken away from me due to circumstances out of my control.

Rewind back many years, I'm in nursery, in a new school. Still struggling with making friends, I somehow got close to one girl in my class. We enjoyed each others' company and we only got closer as the years went on. By 2nd grade I'd only go to school to see her, but she was more extroverted so she did fine when I happened to be absent but to me it was nightmare-ish without her. In 4th grade our classes got shuffled and her and I got put in different classes. Considering the limited interaction the school allowed, I almost never got to even catch a glimpse of her. We tried to meet up after school many times but our parents would pick us up before we could interact. That entire grade was filled with me hating school, grades dropping, and getting bullied everyday. I never managed to make another friend until 8th grade and was always the lonely kid that sits by himself. 8th grade was when everyone was going through puberty (including me ofc) and even though I had a friend it only felt worse. By 10th grade I managed to make 6 total friends that I only connected with cause we were all gamers. The school I studied in was heavily segregating both genders while also being co-ed so that ruined my social skills even more. 
That friend I lost in 4th grade still shows up in almost all my dreams and in all scenarios, leaves me again, making me wake up with a heavy throat and a sinking stomach.

In 11th grade I lost my previous friends because we went to different schools. I got close to a girl in my class, but apparently getting close to people too fast is suspicious so we would get shipped by others a lot which we both hated, and it made us purposely not hang out as much to avoid the rumors, further ruining any chances of being great friends with her. I consider her a good friend but we could've gotten closer.
11th grade was when I started using social media more, and made lots of online friends. But online relationships tend to not be intimate enough (atleast to me) and I ended up being 'the therapist friend' to almost all of them. I'm considered mature by my friends and I've had people talk to me about some seriously terrible things and I've always done my best to help. But I can't help but feel exhausted, only here to deal with others' problems, someone that people come to after fucking up and all I get in return is a thank you. 

In 2020, I got really close to another online friend. It was finally someone that made me feel special. But this time I fell for her, and she fell for me too. After a few months of talking and casual flirting we decided to e-date. And we weren't dating for the heck of it, we actually had planned everything out that would lead us to marriage. I won't be going into the details of the plan but we made sure it was fool proof after weeks of brainstorming.
She is from a broken family and is the middle child. Her mother is neglectful and her father was a drinker but mostly never got drunk. About 20 days into us dating, her father started drinking more and started thrashing the house, something he has never done before. She would tell me about how she doesn't feel safe at home. After about 6 days of this, it gets super serious and her father starts giving her death threats which makes her want to call CPS. She tells me about how she may not have any devices available after the whole CPS situation and whatever foster home she may end up in might not allow phones, but I assured her that I want her to be safe and we arranged methods of getting back in touch when she gets her hands on any device. On the 30th day of us dating she tells me the whole situation is very stressful and that she doesn't want to have to deal with the stress of hurting me in the process hence wants a break up. I respected her decision because it was a wise one. I made sure she knew I didn't hate her and we parted ways, after which she disappeared for 2 months.
Those weeks were the worst. The 2nd person to ever make me feel something was gone again, purely out of something I couldn't control or have predicted. We got back in touch after those 2 months and she's safe now but we can't really get back together anymore. Our plans are still foolproof but she's healing and it's difficult to ignore the things that happened and go back to dating. We might never date again.
Now I get nightmares that often include her. I hate sleeping at night because it's scary. I'm afraid to wake up from the memories I hate the most. I'm afraid of dreaming about my 4th grade friend and my ex.

As I said earlier, I've made many online friends but nobody makes me feel special. Nobody feels like they genuinely care about me. I have acquaintances, friends, best friends, close friends, yet none of them feel real. They say they love me, they call me special, yet they fail at proving it and I'm left contemplating. Every compliment feels hollow. They're always tangled in their own mess and I'm just someone that exists to help them out. I don't want to vent to my friends because I don't want someone else to feel how I feel.
.
.
TL:DR: 
Lost my only friend and my first close connection in 4th grade due to classes getting shuffled and it haunts me to this day.
Didn't make a friend until 8th grade but I only felt worse.
Got 6 friends in 10th due to similar interests.
Lost my 10th grade friends because we all changed schools.
Couldn't get close to my first friend in 11th grade due to dating rumors.
Made many online friends but ended up being the 'therapist friend'
Finally got my second close connection, e-dated after serious marriage planning, but had to break up due to her having serious family problems and it gives me nightmares often.
Now I'm back to being just the therapist friend. My friends tell me they love me but it feels hollow. Nobody feels real and I feel like I only exist to provide comfort to them.",lonely,Nothing ever seems to go right (TL:DR included),2021-11-19 10:06:30

It is also scary because the thoughts have convinced me that I will cause evil eye/bad luck to people such as causing their stuff to break or  making them ill through looking at them.

I feel isolated from the people I care about because of these thoughts.I also feel like a burden to everyone around me.

My culture also doesn't acknowledge mental illness and everyone tells me  this is something you convinced yourself of and you can overcome it.

I just want to run away because of the intensity of the thoughts and the  fact no one cares about me is quite scary.I just want to lead a normal  life but I can't because of this obstacle.

2234,Aggressive-Drive8020,1637266648,1,"I am from a south East Asian country and I moved to US a decade ago. I have flourished here in terms of career, confidence and finance. Life is good, house is building, had a kid a year ago. After moving to US, after a year I faced depression and severe anxiety. This was primarily because of cultural shock, loneliness and some hereditary sadness. I have been on the med since and never looked back. 

Year over year though I meet people who have moved here and flourished but they always say something is missing here. Back home it’s a very collaborative and family based environment where you can depend on each other. In America, society thrives on individual success and capitalism boosts it. The family system is messed up over here, people are totally on their own. I know so many people who are dying to just talk to people (even before COVID). 

I have a bright future with my family here but my heart still lies back home because of the number of people around you, family and collaborative approach. Do you guys agree with this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for coming to my post, which is almost certainly not the best post you'll ever read, but I thank you for coming anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

The blockade has been going on for so long that it has made it very difficult for me to see my circle of friends, so here I am browsing Reddit's Dark Submarine in the hope of making some new friends. Something about me, I hear you ask? Well, I like music and movies and a few other things just like the average person here (I'll list them, but I only have stage freight! Oh no!) Oh, I remember something! I love to travel and record everything I see, and maybe one day I'll get that perfect picture. I can't remember exactly, but it just means more things to say, right? I did forget to mention that I'm from Canada, a cold country, but I live in Florida because I love the warmth.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk to someone of the opposite sex from the USA (Canada). It would be cool if you could say you were feeling down a few times a day, but I know life gets in your way, but working from home most of the time definitely helps pass the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I'd mention that I'm looking for a relationship and with the whole lockdown and working from home, loneliness is definitely starting to set in......

&amp;#x200B;

2237,The_tormented_artist,1637265727,1,"I'm feeling really emotional right now and writing my thoughts in the notes app doesn't do it anymore... so here I am on reddit, venting my feelings so I can go back to my work.

At 14 years old I met my best friend and only real friend I had. She was the type of friend I could talk about anything under the sun, my deepest darkest thoughts, aspirations, fears, passion and or just talk about my day. I miss sending and recieving random memes from her. I miss the updates we gave about each others day. I miss the way I could share my thoughts with her. I miss the connection and platonic intimacy we had. We both had mental health issues, struggled with anxiety and we both didn't get along with peers at school. We were both introverted and understood each other perfectly.

My friendship with her, as beautiful and fulfilling as it was, didn't last for long. At 16 I started to discover my sexuality and gender identity and changed the way I present myself. She grew more and more distant, started to get annoyed with me for the pettiest reasons. One day she send my a large block of text basically saying she feels uncomfortable with the whole LGBT thing and that it would be better we part ways. It's been quite some time since then, I'm an adult now, going to college and stuff, but since then I haven't been able to find a friendship like the one I used to have.

I have a bunch of ""friends"" and people to talk to platonically, but it doesn't even compare to the profound relationship I had with my ex best friend. Yeah, I do talk about interesting things with my friends, such as movies, common interests, college stuff; but when I ask them how they actually feel it's always something like ""-oh I'm doing good, thanks, you?  -I'm doing ok too"". With none of my friends I can go past that and talk about what's on our minds, be there for eachother when we're feeling bad, overthinking and all that.

I tried meeting new people and while I gradually open up to build the friendship, the same vibe isn't reciprocated. You know those people you just vibe with? You don't even have to overcome the small talk phase since there isn't one to begin with. The connection is just there.

Fuck I feel so alone. Why can't I have just one true friend? I miss being someone's best friend. I'm the type of friend that wants to gradually discover everything about the other person and truly try to get them. I'm an active listener with naturally good emotional intelligence (as my therapist told me). and overall a good friend.

why. just why. I only ask for one friend. one. it's not too much

most of the time I'm fine. doing my work. then loneliness hits. such a deep pain, shattering me from the insides. i hate it

i feel no one wants to be friends with me. i know it's not true. that's just how i feel rn

fuck fuck fuck fuck i'm getting more emotional. eyes got blury, i barely see what i type

2239,Ok_Mulberry4204,1637265050,1," I guess even before now I've always felt left out. It started in kindergarten when I was the only girl in my class but the boys were nice about it. The gender divide didn't bother me. But I don't want to talk about my past. I want to talk about what I'm feeling right now. Loneliness, a sort of emptiness. Sometimes I feel unwanted, a burden, someone that people are embarrassed to be around. I remember 6th grade where one of my friends had a party, no sorry, two of my friends had birthday parties and they didn't invite me. One of them I had never had any conflict with said that it was because she can only invite a certain number of people but you know the ironic thing, she invited a new friend to her party when she knew I have been friends with her for much longer. That's when I truly question my worth to other people. I guess I have always felt I wasn't myself and was pretending to be someone for laughs. I guess I always wanted attention. Maybe now I just want people to like the real me but I don't know who the real me is anymore. I guess I just wished I had someone that could give the same amount of energy and attention I give the others that I never fully get. The closest person to that is my sister. That's why she is the person I love most in the world. I don't feel like killing myself, I know that I have a goal in life and no matter what it takes I will persevere and get to that goal. But feeling alone towards that path makes it harder. I know I'm not alone but… I feel that way. When I see my friends talk to people outside our friend group I get jealous because I don't feel I have the ability to do that. All my friends have talked to guys freely while I can't hold a proper conversation with one. I wish I could be more diverse with who I hang out with. I don't feel like I can go a week without feeling like crying about how lonely I am, holding back the tears because I don't want people to see me as weak and vulnerable. I'm sick and tired of feeling this way and it makes me mad because I don't know what to do.",lonely,I...,2021-11-19 06:50:50

So whitin the span of a few weeks I just lost... everyone. It all started with me braking up with my boyfriend, then my best friend left me, and a lot of other friends and people that were close to me all left. There was no reason why they did, everyone just stopped talking to me for no reason at all. I don't know what I've done for that to happen, but it did.

And now in the most overwhelming time of my life where I try to get in to uni and I'm just trying to get the best notes possible I have no one to talk to and get my mind off of stuff. I have gotten extremely depressed and I'm falling behind on everything :).

We met at our job and we became friends in May when our coworkers and us took a trip for our managers birthday. Long story short, I’ve never met a girl like her before. She’s not only beautiful, but she’s smart, ambitious, watching her actions makes me want to do better, and she’s caring. I’m in a frat and every girl I’ve been with before has been primarily for sex or pleasure, but she thought me sex wasn’t everything. In fact we never had sex. We’d spend hours together cuddling, studying, or just some other activity together. The way her eyes lit up when she smiled was the most adorable thing ever, and don’t even get me started on her cooking. It was bomb af. 

However shes 4 months older than me, meaning she’s a junior and I’m a sophomore in college. The issue is though that she’s graduating early and then going to med school after. She wants something long term and neither do us feel comfortable doing long term. Mainly because med school is hard af and we don’t know where she’ll be going for it. By the time I go to med school, it’ll be two years later and I don’t know where I’ll be going for it. Plus as her MCAT studying ramped up, I became sad because she had less time to be with me. But her studying is one hundred percent needed, I would not interfere with that. However, she mentioned how if she couldn’t make me happy now, there’s no way she could when she’s in med school. This her dream and I’m not going to get in her way. Recently though we got into argument about how I was still on Tinder even though she didn’t want to make us official. However, it ended up in both of us acknowledging that no matter what we do this relationship wasn’t healthy for us because of the deadline on it. So she made the mature decision to end things even though we both agreed we were still on good terms.

I’ve just felt sad every since and scared that I might never meet a girl like her again. I haven’t caught feelings for a girl this hard since my ex 4 years ago (my ex was toxic af). I don’t know what to do. I’m just so mad at the situation and at life for putting me in such a place. Obviously, I’m not going to bother her for both of our sakes. I need to put myself back together and she needs to that and study for her MCAT. But I don’t know how to stop feeling like this because neither of us did anything wrong.

But somehow I don't know why I always feel alone like I have something missing inside me . Like I need someone with me online to text and talk to me online daily . That feeling of loneliness was always there . 
So year one I was on instagram I met this girl named called Nina we become really good friends we shared feelings had a good time . She was  there everyday we'd talk have nice time everyday I started distance relationship with her not knowing what I was getting into we dated hard for like year and a half then I eventually discovered she was cheating on me with someone first time she apologized and told me it was nothing she messed up asked me to stay so I did because I did loved her but it didn't work she cheated on me again few months in her friend told me she was sleeping with someone so I left her and hated myself for being an idiot and for believing that something like that would have worked . 
After that time I was ofcourse depressed and didn't wanted relationship because I felt betrayed and used . 
But me feeling alone and stress from real life pushed me look out someone this was the time I met many horrible people who just wanted to sext or needed something weird .
But finally after months of bullshit I met this lesbian girl amy . 
Amy is the best person I met online she was super nice and caring , she helped me with my stress she was there for me always . I never tried be more then more then a friend because she was gay and I respected that so I never tried I liked her as my best friend and I loved I had a such an amazing friend who was there for me .
We watched movies and shows with eachother we even had a list of things we'll watch and do together . 
But somethings changed and part of it was me too . Maybe I became to much for her to handle but I don't know why I did to her I support her alot when she felt alone missed her ex or was stressed about her life I was there for her. We started getting in fights we started having problems with eachother opinions on dumb things . 
She was being bossy all the time thought she was always correct and she hated when I told her that but it was true . I was pain in her ass too
Then I started noticing and she was avoiding me I asked her several times like let me fix things but she always said she is busy then she joined some discord groups where she made friends and it made me feel little lonely and I started acting jealous because she didn't talk to be in days even when I tried so hard . 
I was always nice to her but I needed things to be clear but whenever I tried she hated it she thought I was attacking her 
One day I tried to sort things out she just blocked me . More then year of friendship just gone and it didn't affect her at all I guess because I tried to reach her but she told me to stop .

Does anybody else feel like it is extremely burdensome to look for people to talk to online and yet still do it because of feeling lonely?

Most of the time I don’t even feel treated like a human when I feel lonely and just want to talk. I still do it because sometimes it would be the only human contact I would have for that entire week. 

When people treat me badly and take my good energy away from me without returning any of it, I usually feel worse and promise myself to never do it again. The next week I find myself in the same situation, try to find a good talk again and just break the promise I made to myself, only to feel worse again. 

This cycle needs to be broken

2273,sparkles-_,1637250565,1,"Maybe medication would help but it hasn't before and I feel like I'm depressed because I just don't fit in with the world. 

I still have some good friends who I trust and I'm greatful for. I have my health. 4 awesome pets, 2 cats and 2 dogs. I have a good car. I need to lose like 50 lbs but have lost like 80 so it's not like I have nothing.

It just doesn't feel like enough. I've been single 2.5 years which is about how long my only relationship ever lasted. I try not to, but I fall into really negative thinking like I'm unlovable and undatable. That's what the evidence shows. I did almost get into a relationship but the guy ended up turning me off on our 3rd date by going off on me over text for a ""misunderstanding"".

 Supposedly he thought I was giving him attitude which wasn't intentional on my part so I apologized and was confused at why he thought I would do that. He then apologized and said he thought I was mad but I wasn't. Personally that just left me confused. One, who goes off on someone they're trying to make a good impression on? But two, obviously I fucked up by being abrasive unintentionally and this is why everyone hates me and I'm going to die alone. 

The guy then asked me to be his gf but I wasn't comfortable with him anymore because I felt the yelling at me before our 3rd date was indicative of him not liking me as a human. Why would anyone like me though? I'm worthless and never going to get married and have a baby if I can't figure out how to be a person people like and don't want to yell at. So I broke things off with him since clearly I had already ruined it and was no longer comfortable being myself with him. He wanted to be together though so I had an option and now I'm grappling with whether I made a mistake or not by breaking things off. Like maybe I needed to be yelled at to be taught how to be likable and someone who doesn't get yelled at. 

I'm 28 and running out of time. I'm exhausted. I've tried so hard to be worthy of companionship and failed miserably. I couldn't make someone love me before now and I'm only getting older and more tired. I can't kms because I need to rehome my pets before I do and that would be hard on them but I find myself asking God why he's doing this to me. I have being celibate constantly and unloved and unwanted and going to bed alone every night for years. 

I barley make any money at work. Due to my ADHD I wasn't really suited to waiting tables but got good at it and made good money by working really hard which is how I bought my nice car a few years ago. But due to covid I was fired then fired again from another restaurant after a month working there last year so I went into childcare and it's left me broke. I live paycheck to paycheck and just feel hopeless and worthless. I'm 28 and it's like being 18 all over again. I crawled my way out of poverty just to be flicked right back in like a cockroach and I just don't get why I couldn't have died in the pandemic instead of living through it and turning out like this.

I finished my prereqs to get into nursing school and am applying next month but it feels unreal to me since I don't see myself as competent enough for that job and feel like I'm too old to be proud of myself because I should have had this done already at 22 (but was homeless at 18 and undiagnosed ADHD and had to work full time so college took me longer than a competent person to get good at) .

I tried really hard to be a worthwhile human and failed and I feel like a clown for trying so hard in the first place. I know the advice is ""work hard"" but I never stopped working hard. I've gone to and am in therapy. I workout 3 to 5 times a week. 

 ""Think positive!"" About what? How does lying to myself and pretending I'm better than I am somehow make me less alone in the world? I want to kill myself but won't because of my animals but in the mirror this morning omw to work I asked God to crash someone into my car to kill me. Ignored again. I've begged God for companionship and he's ignored me. I tried and failed to get better and be good enough. I'm tired and I don't feel good and feel foolish for trying as hard as I did. I regret not killing myself before pet #1. I regret not killing myself every day I just don't know what to do anymore and am tired of being tortured by this hell of my own failure every day of my life. I want to go to the mental hospital but that would ruin my credit and further ruin my life since I can't afford it. I hate this country. I hate my life. I don't know how to be worthy of companionship with someone who actually can tolerate me without yelling at me.",lonely,Not sure how I'm thinking wrong.,2021-11-19 02:49:25
2274,leoisnothereforthis,1637250564,1,"I’m feeling pretty lonely right now, I’ve cut off allot of friends in my time and I guess I need to talk about it to remind myself I made the right choice. Big CW- mild mention of all of below - abusive family/alcoholism, drug addiction, homelessness, transphobia, death (death one is probably the most in depth), underage sexualisation

My first friend I ditched was B, I’d known her since I was 2 years old, there were plenty of times I wanted to stop being her friend for petty reasons but I stuck by her till I was 16. At 16 I came out as trans, and around the same time I ran away from home because I was being abused my my single, alcoholic mother. I was living in her parents converted garage, her family were nice enough to me but I know they didn’t really want me there &amp; they were very Christian, not outwardly homophobic to people, but I knew that they believed it was a sin. B was never really there for me, she’d talk about her problems all the time but even though I was going through hell, she never asked me how I was. The majority of her issues were about boys she liked and age appropriate stuff. Then when I tired to open up to her about my gender, she told me she didn’t think I was trans &amp; refused to gender me correctly for 6 months. I didn’t speak to her after that. 

Then there was T, we’d been through drug addiction and the party life together. She piggy backed off the fact I was homeless for working class points, despite the fact her step dad owned a chain of bars and had the biggest house I’d ever seen, with a indoor swimming pool, cinema and wine cellar. (In the UK home swimming pools are unheard of, even for the wealthy). It wasn’t an ideal relationship, but not abusive- She did have somewhere to go. Then, my alcoholic mother had a brain haemorrhage when I was 19. She didn’t even have enough brain function for automatic pain reflexes, so the doctors advised I take her off life support. I did, and me and T sat and watched her die. About a month after T started seeing a guy, who I’d briefly had a thing with- but I didn’t care because I’d been seeing my GF for about 5 months. However this guy started saying we’d never had sex, (we did briefly but he was too coked up to stay hard) she then used this as an excuse to argue with me- yup, the month right after what we saw happen to my mum &amp; id after secured housing for us both for ages. 

Then R, I’d known her since I was 13/14 &amp; after my mum died I invited her to live in my mums old house with me &amp; my GF. Problems occurred fast, it became clear that R was conflict avoidant, and saw simple requests like ‘please use a chopping board instead of cutting directly onto the counter’ as conflict, even when asked gently. One night she brought home a one night stand, the next day they both come into where I was working. The guy said very loudly, in front of my customers &amp; colleagues (who I wasn’t out as trans to). “I hear you used to have really massive tits”, now, to the uniformed, it’s not okay  to tell someone you’ve just met that your friend is trans, much less what surgery they’ve had, even less so when you’re sleeping in the same house without  bedroom door locks. It’s a safety issue. When I confronted her she lied, couldn’t even admit she’d told him. Before this, I’d already told her that outing me, without consent, was a huge no. I asked her to leave.

My newest friend N, I currently havent spoken to in a month. This post is already long, so I won’t go into it too much. They called me paranoid, saying I’d end up alone, implying they didn’t believe me about what had happened with my other friends. All because I  asked them not to post the events id sent them that I was going to, into a queer Facebook group they run (because some people who bullied me around 16 &amp; sexualised me underage are in it).

2278,throwaway-lonely-1,1637248217,1,"I saw some post on reddit entitled 'sometimes the problem is you' (from the social skills subreddit), this was the most unhelpful thing I could have read.

So I think I've been lonely my entire life. I'm not sure if I'm on the spectrum or not (I did go to a school specialising in autism, for 'Speech Therapy' I was told, but I don't have an adult diagnosis). Even though I was well known in primary school and highschool, I didn't really have many friends. Most of the time I spent hanging with friends back then was playing football and then being mocked once we were done playing. I had a few friends but I was never invited out to parties or to hang out particulary). When I went to A-Level college I was invisible. I've been to two unis and have had no luck making friends.  


I'm not saying I deserve friends, but god knows I put the effort in. I hung out with people, always doing hobbies and things I wasn't directly into. Went to dinner with people, went to societies, went to socials with uni. And none of it resulted in making friends. The only friend I've made in adulthood was a speech therapist I met just by happenstance living in shared accomodation. I literally don't know what I'm doing wrong. I wish I could easily look into myself and figure out my flaws. Even if it were things requiring long term changes (I'm quite overweight and sweaty, was that a factor?). God this one time I managed to get another student on the course as a study buddy. We studied together once and then she didn't want to do it again, and gave no reason ofc.  


I think I'm a great listener. I think I'm a reasonably nice person, at least when I'm in a decent mood. I think I'm approachable. But I'm apparently not friend material. It hurts to be lonely. to be thinking about how my one friend has progressed in her career and her relationship (her boyfriend purposed, I'm estactic for them) whilst I'm stuck on level 1 of life. How other people seem to have an easier time talking with others, whilst I feel boring. I'm stuck in a rut with nothing to talk about, but I can't motivate myself to do anything due to feeling down and anxious and lonely. I hate myself.

Ik I'm still young but I feel like everyone around me who wanted romantic/sexual experiences around me has made them. Those people also had a relationship before even if some of them didn't last long, but I never did. I don't know what I'm doing wrong since I am considerate, honest, loyal, funny, good at solving problems for example in friendships or people's lives in general. People come to me for advice and objective judgment quite often. I'm not extroverted which may contribute though I am able to lead a conversation and people laugh at my jokes. I get good feedback from people saying the admire me or think I'm smart and funny so I assume I am... 

I'm conventionally attractive though I'm below average height if that matters.
I'm constantly trying to improve myself (learning new skills/gaining knowledge/improving my social behaviour,...), I'm also artistic. I stand up for what I believe is right and what the facts say no matter how many people disagree with me but if anyone offers me valid facts or wants to try to debate me they absolutely can since I am confident in my opinion and who knows maybe I was wrong and tgey actually deliver good arguments because then I am able to broaden my horizons and improve.

I do have autism which makes me be quite different than most people but I think I know a lot about the science and way humans interact so I don't feel like I seem too weird. I'm sure people notice I'm more of a unique personality but that's about it.

I think I'm quite picky with who I would even want to date, but do people even notice that? I want smth that has a future, not smth that only last a couple weeks.
I'm bi so I'd date a guy or a girl which you would think gives me more options but i really don't feel like it...

My only friend i met online 5 years ago and he was in the same boat. Depressed and not a friend in the world. We would talk about everything and play games nearly every day for hours. We felt like we only ever had each other.
He kept asking for us to meet up irl finally, so I agreed to meet him next summer when he finished college and had more time. But this last month he had made a new friend group and barely bothers to message me anymore, and when he does its just to tell me everything about his new friends and how life is so much better now. He takes days to respond if I talk about anything to do with myself and gets angry and blanks me if in his free time I'm not avaliable to come on and game. He always said people kept leaving him and he never had a true friend until me, and he would never do that to me, but now he has. I'm happy he has turned his life around but now I'm slowly being forgotten and it hurts.
I feel like it's best to leave it as it is and stop talking to him.

I feel a bit broken and lonely. I never truly had a good friend till I met him, and I was fine with that. But now it feels so much worse not having anyone.

I would just like to make some new friends. Long term good friends that really care.

Im a nerd and love gaming, have a gaming pc and a switch. Love pokemon,warcraft, horror, survival games, I could go on. I always like trying new things though. Would love to find someone else who loves to play video games and would be great to just chat and mess around playing some. Other interests, I read when I can, swimming a fair bit. Don't wanna make this too long so will leave it there.

I'm a 24 year old girl from the UK, I don't mind where anyone is from as I'm not usually too busy so timezones aren't a big deal.

Anyway, thanks for your time if you read this. Please dm me if you feel like we could try be friends.",lonely,He was my only friend. Would love to make a new one.,2021-11-18 23:25:55

I feel like spending nye on my own maybe take myself on a cinema date get some take out and have a bottle of wine, this sounds bliss to me!

The stars are visible right here. I can't have this view from where I start. I keep walking. Hours and hours go by. I may start my walk at 9pm, and then finally realize I should turn around at 1am. It's so lonely on these walks. I find a strange comfort in the dark around me. All of the quiet noises, the absence of light, the increased sensitivity of all my senses. Despite these joys, I am alone. I am alone during the entire walk. I see no people at all. No animals even. I truly am alone in the world. It sucks honestly.

2308,Kestinee,1637225594,1,"Probably a long post, sorry in advance.

So, I was dating my ex-ex-boyfriend (C) when I met my now ex (A). Was in an open relation with C and we invited A to a threesome. It never really happened and but A and I ended up talking for a long time and fell in love. I was 28, he was 22. My relationship with C was very complicated, as he struggles with borderline personality disorder and was extremely unstable. I wanted out, but was afraid he'd hurt himself (or end it) of I left, so I tried to wait for a moment when he'd be a little more stable. For a couple months, I lived with C, but was in love and dating A.

A was always aware of my situation. He knew why I couldn't just leave my bf (since I felt kinda responsible for his well being) and he accepted all of it, although reluctantly. We talked and agreed that if it ever became too much he'd move on, no hard feelings. He started telling me more about himself, about his recent past, and long story short he had been a man slut: orgies, drugs, constant sex, addicted to grindr, you name it. Had slept with hundreds of ppl in the last year and a half, caught multiple STDs... You get the pic. This raised some red flags, but I'm a psychologist and strongly believe people can choose to change, so I brushed it off.

Soon after I started dating A (mind you, I was still with C, although we just lived together and had no intimacy at that point), there was this own night he was feeling down and wanted to be with me but I couldn't meet him. He was sad about it but told me he understood. He got off from work at 22h, got home and told me he had taken some meds case of an headache and was going to sleep early. I wished him well and a good night, but I felt something was off. All the alarms in my mind were ringing. So I opened grindr and used a fake GPS and found him at a gay sauna. He had even uploaded a face pic to his profile, which he had never done up to that point. I confronted him and he denied everything, used a fake GPS to try to prove he was home and only dropped his attitude when I met him there. When I got there, he had already made out with guy, had taken drugs and was feeling horny because of that. Asked me if leaving him there was an option but after seeing my reaction he left the place with me. Hours after he was a mess, saying he loved me and he was sorry and embarrassed... I loved him, and I believe he wanted to change, and I also felt guilty about my own situation with C, so I forgave him and said we could and should try to rebuild trusty and carry on. This was early Nov, 2019.

Fast forward to March, 2020. C and I are no longer together and things with A are brilliant. He's staying with me at my place for a while when covid lockdown hits. Ended up staying a bit longer. And longer. And eventually he just didn't leave anymore. We were in love and everything was going just brilliantly. He's funny, we'd laugh, kiss and hug all the time, sex was amazing, it was a marvelous, marvelous time.
Out of nowhere, tho, be starts hiding his cellphone when I walk in. If I was nearby and his phone vibrated he wouldn't even look at it. I talked to him about the sudden change of behaviour and he told me I was imagining it. This went on for a bit until an opportunity arised: I was alone with his cellphone and while breaking one of my own rules I just had to look. Instantly regret it, as I found dozens upon dozens of conversations with random guys he had fucked with. Orgy invitations, home made porn videos and some people telling him to dump me and go back to partying. One guy asked him if he was available to fuck at that moment to which A replied ""unfortunately, no"". I'll never forget that text.
Once again I confronted him about all this. He cried, apologised, told me he had stopped answering but for some reason he couldn't explain he had answered one and then couldn't stop doing it again. I told him I loved him and understood how that constant validation could be addictive, but that couldn't happen while being with me. I'm super open minded, flirting, threesome, orgies, everything can happen for as long as it's discussed and agreed by the two of us, but stuff behind my back is something that kills me and just breaks any kind of trust. He told me he'd delete all those numbers, block them and do the same for any subsequent messages he might get. This was May, 2020.

Fast forward to December, 2020. We're going super strong. He's loving, caring, amazingly funny, loves to cuddle. Everything seems to be even better than what I could hope for. But the sex slowly starts being less frequent. It could be just a phase, I thought, and didn't mind if much. 

Let's fast forward to November, 2021. In this time he did some IT super intensive course. Quit his job to do it, so I ended up supporting all our living costs for a while. But I love him, that was his dream, so I was happy to do it. He got a good job afterwards, paid decently, all was good... Except the sex. Once a month. Twice in a good month. Told me he didn't wanna be touched most of the time, sometimes not even by himself. I suggested therapy, either for him or as a couple, but he wasn't open to it. I could feel something was wrong. One morning I told him I was going out grocery shopping and I had that same feeling that something was up. I get to my car and install grindr. He tries to hook up with me, sends me his pics (x rated stuff included), I send him some fake pics and he tells me to come by, gives me my own address, while leaving the apartments' number out. I was in total rage, came upstairs and confronted him. He said it was the 2nd time he was using grindr to jerk off cause the fantasy (of talking to someone about doing stuff) gave him more of a thrill than porn did. Said he was anxious all the time cause of all the guilt he felt about all the shit he did to me and that we needed some time apart, so he went back to his mom's. 

For a week, he told me he loved me, missed me and thought he'd come back home, he just needed time. He'd send me selfies so I know he was home and not doing ""something mischievous"" as he'd call. I often asked if he felt like using grindr and told him several times that if he wanted to used grindr, be with someone or do anything of the sorts he could just tell me about it. All I wanted was go avoid more lies, since those were what was killing us. Time and time again he told me he didn't want to be with anyone, he didn't want to use grindr, that his head was a mess and grindr was the last thing he needed. And he even promised me (with a pinky swear, which was ""our thing"") that he'd tell me if he felt anything remotely close to wanting to use grindr. But I knew something was off, cause he would spend enormous time online on WhatsApp, which he never did while we were together and he'd go on walks for like 2h, out of nowhere, be completely unreachable and then tell me he was unstable and needed to think. I grew tired of just trying to believe him and did what I always end up doing: last Monday morning I installed grindr, fake GPSd my way to two streets below his mom's place and let him try to hook up with me. Sent him some particularly appealing photos and oh god, was he ready to go. He was instantly up for sucking me and being a bottom, no protection, just like that. I left home and drove for 30 mins straight well above the speed limit, parked my car and told him to go to that address and to send me a msg so I could open the building's door. And so he did, so I left my car and confronted him yet again. He told me he wanted to try being with someone else to see if that's what he wanted to do, that he didn't even know if he'd be able to do anything once he was there (yeah, right...) and that he was still confused about us and not ready to come back home with me. I left and from that moment onwards he started being super cold and arrogant towards me, hurting me on purpose. He'd dismiss and mock everything I said. He went from extremely loving and caring Sunday night to a complete prick block of ice by Monday. Would tell me he didn't have time to read/answer my texts, but would still be online in WhatsApp texting other guys (which he confirmed were ppl from his past that he never really deleted and had texted them to tell them he wasn't with me anymore). 

Today we broke up officially. I should feel free from all this pain, anxiety, doubt and lies, but all I can feel is a giant hole in my life. Feels like my heart is bleeding, all I want is his laugh, his smile, his hugs, his kisses, his care. My house feels empty and cold without him. He was everything I had ever wished for and I was ready to work with him to fix stuff. I even told him we could try to experience some of his ""old world"" together, like going to orgies together and stuff, cause he could have the best of both worlds: a loving relationship and those more hardcore sex nights. But no deal. He doesn't want to be with me anymore. I wanted to hate him, but all I can is love him. I love him with all my heart, care for him and it just feels like there's a giant heavy weight crushing me 24/7. I can barely leave my bad. Can't eat. Haven't showered. Brushing my teeth seems like an impossible task. I wanna sleep the pain away, but it's still there when I wake up. And he isn't. He'll never be here again when I wake up. And I can't accept that. I can't deal with that. It feels like a part of me is missing. I don't feel whole anymore. I don't know what to do with all this love, all this care I feel. I can't apply to me or anyone else cause it's like it has his name on it. I don't know how dying feels, but I guess it can't be much worse than this.

I don't know what to do. I feel lost, broken, alone... I'd kill to feel his hug and feel his scent again. I don't know how to move on. My gut tells me he was the one, I wanted him to be the one and we could have had it all... And now we're nothing and I feel I have nothing.",lonely,I'm so lost and lonely,2021-11-18 19:53:14

      I see no point in continuing this absurd existence. Im 33, going to end up divorced again, I have no children due to fertility issues and every single man that crosses my path is a liar or a cheater or a ghoster or a coward. There is no one left for me. I am not the type of person that can survive solitude. I want to go back to the Cliffs of Mohr and climb to the top.
   Ireland is the air I crave. Climbing to the top of those cliffs gave me no fear. It made me feel like I could fly. And what better way to leave a place where no one cherished you. Where no one thought your soul was worth the risk. Where no one stayed.
   I want to close my eyes and fly off of those cliffs. No more pain. No more loneliness. No more trying to pretend I'm something I am not. I continue to wake up everyday thinking why? Why did I have to wake up again? I don't want to be here. Save some other soul that is worthy and wants to be here.
   I have nothing left to give. It's all been taken from me and held with such carelessness. Marriage means nothing. I've had a man look me in the eyes and make promises he never intended to keep. I grew up too old for my age. Dreaming of a Romeo &amp; Juliet love where a man would be completely and utterly consumed by me. And I of him. 
    But even their ending was tragic. Even they like I couldn't face the world without their soulmate by their side. I don't think I have a soulmate. I don't think there is anyone that has been waiting for me to enter their life.

2320,Kalden_0,1637220854,1,"This is just a bit of venting on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory - I've been single for my entire adult life which is well over a decade. Combination of past experiences and a general distrust when it comes letting someone in, and I like many of us I've had highs and lows. Met plenty of amazing friends I can rely on but I made the decision a number of years that I was going to focus on my finances, health, hobbies, etc. etc. and if I was to meet someone during that time and start something romantically I'd be willing to give it a try. I would say I'm pretty proud of what I've accomplished with myself thus far. Overall, I'm alright with being by myself, used to it I suppose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current events - Not too long ago I met someone and of course starting taking interest. I took a shot and it worked out. I'd be lying if I said I was calm and collected, but I was excited for something new that had potential. Over several dates we talked and got to know each other better, more or less going well. That is until coincidentally between a few health issues that popped up for me (getting better by the way) and what was going on with the other person in their personal life, we were/are both pretty high strung, stressed and anxious but I figured we had support for one another. At this point, they wanted a bit of space so we both could figure some personal issues out. Fine by me, I'm an adult and everyone needs a bit of space. Some time passed and they assured me that we still have something between us yet completely turns around to shut me out and push me away. Now I sit here confused after quite a bit of time of being completely in the dark not knowing what to do or even knowing how to feel, the silence hurts more than words and honesty ever could. Time continues to move forward and I'm finding myself caring less and less each day, it has brought back the feeling of abandonment I've experienced many times before from people throughout my life. Can't decide if I'm being stupidly hopeful and patient, or I should just mend and move on.

Some of my interests are...  

Gaming! I play a lot of PC games, and I'm always down to try new ones.  

Music! I am almost always listening to music if I can be. I even have a playlist on Spotify that is 107 hours long.  

Nature! Nature is just so beautiful, I love spending time outside. My favorite season is Winter because it makes everything look gorgeous.  

Exercising! I always enjoy trying to improve myself, whether it be my physical body or other. Lately I haven't been able to exercise much lately though due to some heart problems.

(best friend died and I drove my gf away by not knowing how to cope with myself or stress) 
Said to me after I had said I have a lot of bad shit I have inside of me.
He said ""you're not a narcissist, your ego is and you have to let your ego go"" I am coming to terms with being one but it hit me. Right in the chest. I don't want to be narcissistic. Who really does? But I'm going to tell my therapist and see if I can get some reading material so I can identify it better and stop the problem once and for all.
He said given what you've told me about your life (above)
You've had to deal with a lot (just the tip of the burg my friend) and you've been doing it so long you can't see that your were stuck in survival mode and everything that has led up to you being here has made you stronger cause you are willing to be here.(AA)

I wanted a drink so bad just to shut everything up and numb the heartache. pain from all the trauma.
I can't believe I did this.
I had to let the girl of my dreams down. And then let her go.
That's a hell of a feeling.
I realized today that I don't have to let my life be a shit story tragedy. I don't have to keep living my life the same way anymore. I'm free from being in survival mode.
I can keep the good things around as long as I work on myself. Get back to who I am and not just this ego driven sob story.
I don't want anyones pity.
I want to be the man she saw. There is good inside of me.
I can do the right things. I want to be the hopeless romantic that swept her off her feet on that first date. Or the time she thought I got us big Macs but gave her mine cause I knew she was THAT hungry. That girl meant the world to me.

First off, is there any way to stop falling in love with literally everyone??

 I go to a very small private school because I'm neurodivergent and can't function in a larger/public school. I am very different from most people my age, and I find it very difficult to connect with people. With this small amount of people, I find it really hard to find people I vibe with. I only have one friend at school and I barely talk to her because I feel like I annoy her. 

Ive always experienced emotions on the more extreme level. Every single time I see/interact with (or think about) someone that I'm even mildly attracted to, I get butterflies in my stomach. If I end up developing a crush on them (which will inevitable) I start to avoid them like they're the plague. I have two crushes at the moment, one of them I have a class with and he knows that I like him(he might think I got over it because I told him 2 years ago). I literally act like he doesn't exist. If he is talking I literally can't look at him. If he is near me, I make it a point to steer clear of him. I think I'm doing it because I don't want him to feel uncomfortable, but im also doing it because I just hate the way I feel when I look at him or listen to him.

 The other person I like, I rarely see so its not as much of an issue. I used to dislike him, but I got to know him better and we became friends/acquaintances(?). He is very friendly with me, and when I do see him, he often does things like pats my head, pokes my shoulder, and taps my nose. Me being me, I cant tell what it means. I know that he likes this other girl, so I have no clue if he likes me. 

I obsess over things. When I first developed the crush on the first guy, I literally couldn't stop thinking about him for like 4 months straight. I obsess because I have no clue what to do with my emotions. They are so strong and so overwhelming I feel like im suffocating.

I also just know that if I were to even get into a relationship, I'd end up avoiding the other person because my emotions would be too much to handle. I have the emotional maturity of an 11 year old, I say that because I had a ""boyfriend"" when I was 11 and I ""broke up"" with him after 2 days (both of which I didn't talk to him because I was too overwhelmed). I know it will probably happen again.

2368,krbk90080,1637204671,1,"long story short, i’m in college. it’s been two years and i still have no actual friends - which is way different from high school. sure, i have people i can see back home, but it’s different when you’re hours away, with no one to talk to, no one to hang out with, and no one to laugh with while in school. school is so fucking stressful, and one of my outlets is hanging out with my friends. i can’t do that. so i have all this building up inside of me so i can’t do anything about it. i see other people with friends and i can’t help but wonder, what am i doing wrong? tried to party - got voted ugliest in the room. try to join a sorority - got rejected. tried to join a club - i don’t really connect with the people there. try to make friends - the few people i talked to don’t talk to me anyone because they actually found their friend group. i’ve never been this lonely in my life and it’s taking a toll. i started developing SERIOUS retail therapy because getting packages gives me something to look forward to. i even tried drugs just to feel something. it hurts me in so many ways, even academically. and there’s nothing i can do about the loneliness. it’s also like other people don’t get it. my best friend for example, who i love, i can tell just doesn’t get it. i vent about my loneliness and because she has problems with her friend group she says “i know what you mean” but she doesn’t. she has a boyfriend who cares for her, that’s support and who she can confide i have nobody. no one to talk to , not one to love with, nothing. And it’s going to be like this the rest of my life. my friends back home will get married, have kids, and forget i existed. and i’ll be alone. and it won’t stop fucking with me. knowing i have no choice but to be lonely , truly sucks.",lonely,realizing you’re destined to be lonely is the worst feeling,2021-11-18 14:04:31

We've been best friends for 15 years. It isn't the first best friend I've lost; I've had several and they've all hurt a lot to lose. I am at a loss how to handle it.

I've tried hearing her out, listening to what's upsetting her, making good on trying to fix the problems, but there's something wrong. It's like she can't get over whatever she's decided I've done to her -- and to be quite honest, it was just that for a month I was really depressed and negative after a break up and wasn't enthusiastic about something.

2393,dolly_dahlia,1637197041,1,"Desperate people do dumb and desperate things. I literally have no one I could talk to about this, so here is my dumb fantasy I built in my head.

Context: I am currently in grad school and the winter break is coming up. I am in the process of cutting ties with my mother (it's complicated), so I would not have anyone to spend the holidays with.

So, I started entertaining the idea of finding a sugar daddy who would let me come over, cuddle, celebrate the holidays with and cover any expenses, etc. Or go on r4r subreddits to find someone who is looking for companionship, but would cover transportation and living expenses. (Recently I got a hefty medical bill, which is the reason why I'm so fixated on the other party paying.)

The smart (and cautious) side of me knows how risky this is: Going to a strangers house with the intent to live with them for atleast a couple weeks? Sounds like a naive and gullible young woman about to get kidnapped or be put in a dangerous situation. I might as well start putting up missing person flyers.

The dumb ~~and lonely D:~~ side of me wants to give this a try. I am very affectionate in nature. I love taking care of others; it brings me joy when I could make someone else's life better. I fantasize about how if I were rich and could do anything, I would spend all my time volunteering.

Like... cleaning people's houses for free (Aurikatariina on Tiktok/Youtube does this!!!). Or running a free/low rent apartment building that is for those who need some help getting back on their feet.

I digress...

~~Also I'm not hot or pretty for any sugar daddies to even look my way lol.~~

But for nearly an entire year, I finally felt like I found a true friend. A friend soulmate honestly. We would talk nearly every day and our conversations never felt forced. I could her tell anything, we were eachothers support systems(we both are in rather rough family situations) and I finally felt like I found a true friend.

It all started going downhill around a year later, near Christmas time, when she discussing coming down to florida which is where I live. I was so excited and thought she was gonna come visit me, however she was just going to the Disney world resort and gave me a half hearted invitation “you can come if you want” I was incredibly hurt. How could who is so close to me treat me so optionally? It might sound like a big deal to many but to me it was. Going to another state isn’t something most people can do very often, usually once a year. She is aware of this, wouldn’t she have made me more of a priority? Why wouldn’t she have said something more like “lets make a plan to make it work” ? We talked it out and she apologized and said she didn’t mean it like that, but those words still stuck with me and made me view the friendship differently. 

After that I stopped initiating FaceTime with her. And she only text me on a semi regular basis. I feel so hurt, as i have noticed a huge decline in her effort. How could someone go from being so close to you to suddenly barely putting effort into being apart of your life? It makes me have trust issues.

An innocent beauty naively falling for it

A dance with the lost soul

Dancing and dancing under the moonlight 

Silver linings

A growth so gracious

One finds itself

Turning thee into the charming man he once were

I feel like I have done everything to get society's approval (a successful career path at 22, likability, charm, effort into appearance, etc) but still am an outcast. As much as i want to be extroverted, I cant help but feel burnt out from forcing myself to interact with people. I would much rather stay home and play video-games, or watch anime, or chill with my dog. regardless of the introverted nature, I try my best to be there for people, and give in a lot of compassion and empathy, and put people before i put myself, but its only led to me being taken advantage of. I just don't think there's any way for me to be 'accepted', and it just sucks knowing this is likely my permanent reality. I have always fallen back into this loneliness regardless of how much I try to force myself to maintain friends or be social, even as a child. im always left back with myself, alone. i dont know if its because im not interacting with the 'right' people, or if i just dont have enough in common with people. i just dont have anyone 'there' to talk to, or to reach out to when times are tough, or for the sake of just fulfilling the human need to want to have friends.

I really don't know how to get out of the cycle of loneliness for good, or if it even ever goes away. It has left me hopeless and honestly, i feel numb from the fact that i just dont matter to people. my existence is, and always will be, temporary and something no one really cares about. i dont feel in the right place anywhere i am, or in anyones life. i try my best to be normal and have relationships, but these have just made me lonelier from the sacrifices and manipulation ive faced. honestly, if it wasn't for my dog, i would lean strongly toward ending it all.

- your symptoms might evoke sympathy or even empathy for awhile. people will want to help until they become frustrated and feel inconvenienced by your illness that can’t just be fixed with confidence or (toxic) positivity. They may feel used or manipulated, resenting you further, when that was never your intention 

- victimblaming. It is irrelevant if you’re in therapy, taking meds, exercising, etc. They will find fault in you and conclude that you’re simply a bad and lazy individual using their mental illness as an excuse to not try and self-pity , despite literally trying more than they could ever imagine, often to a breaking point

- desensitization to your illness. Compassion fatigue. Not their fault.  Never was. They’re only human. But you wish you could finally become desensitized to your pain, too. You think you have, until it comes back again.

- people move on. But you can’t. Everything is a personal reminder of your past, your trauma, your flaws. You’ll be that ex friend or partner they talk about, the one who was too timid, crazy, awkward, had weird hangups, too much baggage, clingy, annoying, etc. and it’s all true, maybe. You may intentionally read forums like these and trigger yourself as a form of punishment or masochistic release 

- you realize no one can care about you more than you do, when you barely care yourself sometimes. You’ve learned to mostly avoid people and not talk about your problems anymore to stop burdening others and provoking their eventual anger, or you fear being seen as that manipulative life-sucker, so you just keep quiet 

- exhaustion. Fatigue. Cannot get out of bed. If you can, you feel like a ghost. Hollow. Just a husk of a human being.

I haven't had any irl friends for a year and a half now, since I split with my ex. I'm super shy and have terrible self-esteem, so there's no way I could push myself to put myself out there irl first. Case in point; I used to do BJJ and loved it and was really good at it when I lived in Manchester a for a bit a few years ago, but when I moved back home I just couldn't bring myself to go to a new place alone. One of the best BJJ places in all of Ireland is literally a 2 minute walk from my house, and it's been 3 years I've lived this close.

The only way I can socialize is online first. It's just easier when you've just met someone. I can take a second to think what I wanna say, it's less awkward, etc. I only really want an irl friend, someone i can meet semi-regularly. Online friendships are so unfulfilling to me because I just wanna meet the person and hang out with them the whole time.

Maybe I don't get to post here since it's a form of choosiness, idk. It just sucks feeling so alone though.

I met somebody on reddit about a month ago too, and we really hit it off. They lived in London, but within the first week they'd bought a ticket to fly over and see me. Things turned romantic though and far too quickly, and it just got weird. Now we don't speak. It sucks because we'd spend all day on the phone together, literally all day, and when we weren't on call we'd be messaging eachother on discord. We really got on. We had the same interests and dreams and shit, and we were gonna do loads of cool stuff together when they came. They kinda promised me everything I've been dreaming of for over a year, and then just left. Sucks, but I get it; things got weird between us, it was too quick. We shouldn't have got romantic, at least not that quickly. Just mutual loneliness, i guess.

That experience just made my self-esteem and loneliness way worse, as well as my need for somebody irl worse as well. If only an online friend could just be enough for me. Then again, all I want is a best friend in the world to spend all my time talking with, and I suppose that's unrealistic too. Ehh, I'm a bit crazy i guess. Realistically I've felt alone for years now, and loneliness will do that to ya. I just want a best friend, someone that i could at least meet irl a couple times a year for a week or so. I'm kinda giving up at this point tho.

I messed up and the boys are not speaking to me. They stopped inviting me to anything. When they see me in public, they either walk the other way, avoiding me like a plague, or they mutter a disappointed groan. Thinking I don’t hear it. But I do and it seriously hurts. But than sometimes when i’ve ran into them they’ll say “Hi” but that’s really about it. This really screws with my head mentally. Like sometimes when they run into me on the off chance, i’m either good enough to get said hi too whilst other times i’m a huge inconvenience to run into. This has been ongoing for about almost 3 years. 

I'm afraid to reach out. I have no idea what I would say or how I would say it. I suck at communicating. It makes me very anxious of what they'll say to me, but I know i’d be deserving of whatever they say. I went through a bad patch a few years ago, I was majorly depressed and suicidal with things that I have been through in my life. Whilst going through this, I was with my ex who treated me like shit emotionally. I was also best friends with a guy that I had a friendship of 11 years at this point. He treated me badly, he was a complete narcissist and alienated me from my friends. But I let that happen and I can't use him as an excuse for my shitty behavior towards them. I suppose they got tired of picking me up and being there just for me to jump back into the water they pulled me from. It happened so many times. I was so depressed that I became self-centered, and our connection became a one-way street, with me delivering nothing but more negativity in return. When I ended my friendship with this person, they were ecstatic.

But then the guy came back and I was friends with him again. He's changed, I said. They knew better when I didn't. I chose him over them. Again. They weren't going to listen to any more of my nonsense. They never explained why they ceased communicating with me. But I'm assuming this is the case. They eventually stopped inviting me to hang out with them and ceased communicating with me. 

My life is different now. I'm studying to be a personal trainer and have severed all ties with all of the toxic people in my life. This includes some of my own family members. I'm in a better position with a wonderful girlfriend. I don’t have any friends at all. Since then, I haven't. My pals are missing from my life and I feel apart of me is empty. I miss the good old days before I screwed everything up. But I'm afraid to reach out and find out whether or not they can forgive me.

I just wanna feel normal I want to have friends and find love.

But I’m scared shitless my EX she told me I was five stars and it was all about her wanting to break up.

And I wasn’t a stalker or a clingy but I knew I was a bit needy I always kept apologizing if I felt I overwhelmed her or overstepped (but to her I never did anything like that) . I would always buy her presents and really do anything for her if it made her happy cause it made me happy.

And as disappointed my dad would be in me (not in a hateful or resentful way) and I am in myself I did put her on a pedestal I know your not supposed to but I did for her and any other crush I had.

I know the purpose in life isn’t love or searching for it but goddammit the prospect of it sometimes is the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning.

2464,diyu666,1637161173,1,"I'm a 20 something female whose only committed relationship was for 4 months in highschool, and even then I realized later that guy was cheating on me the whole time. I've had several FWB over the years, but found this ultimately very unsatisfying and always left me feeling rather worthless, so for the last almost 2 years I was celibate. 

I was committed to staying celibate until I found someone who I have a real connection with, until Monday I fucked up and had sex with this older guy while I was very drunk. He's a guy I had gone on a date with 5 years ago and was visiting the city I live in, so we went and got drinks. I drank too much, which I never realize until the day after, and blacked out near the end of the night but basically we ended up going to his hotel and I asked him to fuck me (which I have zero memory of). We actually got along really well, have a similar sense of humour, and both find each other very attractive, so I thought everything went perfectly fine. It wasn't guaranteed that I'd see him again while he's visiting because he has a lot of old friends while he's here, but I was thinking about him afterwards so I texted him saying I'd be sad if I didn't get to see him once more before he left. No response. 

I don't really have a best friend or someone close enough to talk about this with, so here I am on the lonely forum. This sort of stuff happens to me far too often, men only see me as a good looking hole to stick their thing in despite how much more I have to offer. I am a painfully self aware individual, to the point where I overthink every single thing I say and do and critique myself constantly after every social interaction I have, yet I still can't seem to figure out what it is about me that makes people not want a deeper connection with me? What is it that makes me just one night stand material?

Not in any way meant to toot my own horn but truly I am always genuinely interested in getting to know and understand the people I interact with, I love to make people laugh, and I put effort into looking good, and I know I'm an interesting, ambitious person, but despite living behind this cheerful mask I am never good enough for anyone, and it just really destroys my self esteem.

I eventually talked to her, It was the hardest thing I've ever gotten myself to do, I was  surprised I even did it. later on in the day I hear her friends talking about us and that they were excited for us to finally be together. I built up so much confidence, finally something in my life is going for the better. 

But of course it has to go to shit. I was certain that I'd finally escaped from this dark pit of my life. but no. The next day I'm told by her friend that she doesn't have feelings for me anymore. I laughed, I thought it was a joke, the way she looked at me and talked about me yesterday basically confirmed that we'd be together. but no they were serious, It felt like a bad dream, she ignores me for the rest of the day, like nothing ever happened. I feel like I've shifted into another reality, I have no explanation why she would suddenly not like me anymore. 

I just can't believe it, I had so much hope for a feeling of wholeness with another person, someone I could love, and explain my emotions to. All I could previously think of is what we would talk about together. imagining Her resting on my shoulder as we sit together. Other girls have shown interest in me, but she is the only person I've had a crush on in my entire life, I don't know what I like her, but I feel a connection to her that I've never felt with another person. 

I feel as if I'll never feel love again, all this confidence I've built up has been shattered. I no longer feel attracted to anything. I tried curing my sadness with porn, but looking at another woman's body feels wrong I can't get off anymore, whenever I think of something romantic or erotic all I can think about is her and get sad.

I'm trying not to think about it, but it's constantly brought up in my dreams, for the past week I always have the same dream of us doing stuff together, only to be waken up with the reminder that it didn't work out. It sucks, I feel as if I've been robed of something.",lonely,"I'm absolutely ruined, I feel like I live in a world where everything goes wrong.",2021-11-17 21:05:23

I have been in an extra marital relationship with a friend of my husband for ten years. For the said duration, it was mostly an emotional affair. I found bits of joy outside my marriage in this person. I love and respect my husband. He’s has been my pillar through thick and thin. I’m anxious attachment type and I found solace in a friendship outside my marriage. It went on for ten years mostly smoothly with both of us respecting each other’s limitations and spouses’ needs. At the start of this year, during the talk my affair partner said that he has begun favouring simple life with full attention on his wife and kids. He said that he doesn’t see me in his growth. And that we should keep it to formal greetings now onward. I respect his decision.

It’s just that… I’m lonely. I have exposed all of my vulnerabilities to this person and I’m feeling helpless without talking to him. He was my best friend and a confidant. I did well for the first half of the year not giving *ucks but with time I’m feeling more and more lonely. I have started smoking again. (Quit years ago)

2493,theonewhosays,1637137393,1,"Sometimes I wonder what I want in life. I think I’m pretty different from most people. I have no desire to start a family, I don’t want lots of friends, I don’t like going out all the time. Sometimes I think all I want is a nice girl to spend time with, but I usually end up pushing people away for various reasons. I want to be happy, which for me means having financial independence so I can do what I want when I want. I look around at other people in the world and I just don’t understand the hustle and bustle of going to work every day for 45+ years only to get old and eventually die. I’d rather enjoy life and experience what I want to experience, but it’s really hard for me to do any of that with a day job that doesn’t pay nearly enough. The past 2 years have been pretty good to me and I’m finally making some headway, but I just wish I could make enough money to be done with the rat race. Trying to be patient. But it’s hard.

It’s difficult for me to deal with people. I feel like I tend to see that bad side of them, and to me everyone just seems to be selfish, me included. I hope to find someone out there to compliment my shortcomings, and I theirs. I just want to experience life through another lens, and love the person who can show me that. I wish it was easier to express myself to other people. Then I might actually find this person. It’s just so hard. 

Anyways, not sure how coherent all of this was, as I typed this out quick, but I just wanted to vent my thoughts into cyberspace. I’m quiet and don’t share enough to the people around me, sharing my true thoughts to a void makes me feel better somehow.

Looking back I may have lead her on which I know is quite bad. I have been thinking about her a lot lately and how easy it might be to reconnect to get the romantic and physical intimacy everyone single has been craving recently.

You've probably seen my posts before but as you guys probably know finding your soulmate isn't always easy and It takes a lot of time and patience.I do not respond to all messages either . I do not respond to any ""hey"" or ""hey u wanna talk?"" type of messages or messages from kids and people always using abbreviations . Comfort is my top priority. It's better to wait for someone ""special"" to come instead of pretending someone's fake friend or something. It's important to never give up :) It's better to be alone than to have fake friends.**

**If you really want to talk to me don't make me wait any longer than 5/6 hours to receive a message.Feel free to ignore my my message If you think that you and I are not a good match but don't send me a response after like 12 hours.If you really are too busy (which I understand) just don't contact me.I've had enough of ""busy friends"" which is why now I'm looking for something different &amp; I'm here for people who have enough time &amp; will to talk more often**

**First of all - I'm not here to get criticized by any of you only because my post is different than most posts on reddit that belong to other people so If you want to judge me or tell me what to do (again) please don't! If you don't even know me don't act like you know what's best for me only because your opinion is different.I'm not hurting anyone by being who I am and I'm not going to change for someone I don't even know. It's always easier to judge people than to understand** **them.My** **post is very detailed mainly because I don't want to waste anyone's time.Not everything you see is always what it seems to be.Despite being honest and quite active on reddit I still get messages from people underage and other people who clearly don't even read my posts (which is easy to see) some people delete their accounts without a word etc. It's important to be patient though and I am - I honestly believe there is someone out there - someone for** **me.It** **might take time but I won't give up**

**Please don't send me a message if my post is ""too long to read"" for you or If you're another person willing to ""help"" despite being in a completely different situation.Don't send me a message If you're only into abbreviations and very short messages and please don't force yourself to send me a message only to please me.Stay true to yourself :) What matters is to feel comfortable..I've met a lot of people forcing themselves to satisfy me despite having completely different expectations and looking for a different kind of person to talk to.This is not what I want..**

**(Which is why I DON'T MIND BEING GHOSTED BY PEOPLE WHO THINK I'M NOT FOR THEM AND completely ignoring MY FIRST or even second message (In friendships both people should feel comfortable and as we know not everyone is for us and we're not for everyone) - what BOTHERS me is being ghosted by someone after days of weeks of talking and people telling me how great I am and then? Just leaving)**

**We're all different even though most of us are here for the same reason - we want friends and please don't ever judge others for having their own expectations.We should all feel comfortable with whoever we want to be friends with :) I'm not forcing anyone to talk to me - If you disagree with me and want to find someone completely different - just ignore my post.Everyone deserves to be happy ;)**

**I'm here because I would love to find someone to talk to.I don't have any true friends &amp; I want to change my situation.I don't really want to wait any longer than 5 or 6 hours just to receive a message that can be typed and send in a few seconds or minutes..I'm a human too and I hate excuses..I don't need another shallow friendship. I want to meet someone who wants to talk on a daily basis - why? I want to finally see someone's engagement..I want to talk to someone who also needs a friend to talk to throughout the day.I'm always the one waiting for people's messages and I'm sick of them never making any time for me. &amp; I don't feel understood by them.**

**Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.**

**I personally don't care about people's interests -common interests.What matters to me is your honesty,respect,your outlook on life.**

**I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything**

**I want to meet someone who won't reject me &amp; my friendship**

**My boyfriend used to treat me like a princess to..leave me..&amp; now? I just need a friend..Nothing else**

**I'm not looking for any relationship.Just someone like me.. to cry together and laugh together and support each other.I can't bear the pain..I don't want to hear ""find a therapist"" or ""everything will be ok"" because life is unpredictable..I just want to find someone who can relate..someone in the same situation.Someone who will always be there (If we get along) I need it more than ever.I know how sad my post is but I'm also very sad.I can't believe someone I loved so much just left me.blaming me for everything..I just can't.Nothing hurts more than being super friendless.having no one who understands you..I really would rather talk to someone in exactly the same situation.I'm too sad to talk only about random stuff or hear positive stories from other people.I want to talk to another person willing to listen to me.Another person who doesn't have anyone just to support each other.Someone who would never tell me ""move on"" or ""stop complaining"" someone who needs someone to talk to almost all the time.I don't want to feel like the only sad person in the world or be rejected again.Most people say ""I don't have any friends.I would do anything for a friend"" but they never have time for others..Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.**

**One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone...**

**I feel like only another person in EXACTLY the same situation..would truly understand me.Which is why I'm looking ""for a twin"" I literally don't have anyone and I want to desperately change my situation.I see people's happiness everywhere..On TV,In real,on the internet and newspapers &amp; I? I feel like my life is no longer worth living.I don't even take photos of myself because I don't have anyone to share them with.**

**I'm 26.. I would rather talk to someone from Europe.**

**18-35 age range.**

**Send me a private message If you want to talk.. only long messages.I never ignore them If they're interesting to me.**

**No abbreviations**

**Please don't criticize me &amp; don't give me unwanted advice.I'm already sad enough and all I want is to find a friend.**

**I want to talk on reddit first**

**If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet - something like that - instead of asking me ""what are your hobbies?"" or telling me what you're interested in. It doesn't matter to me If you like the same songs or movies as I do as long as you're honest,understanding,loyal and talkative - as long as you're a good person.I don't get along with people who are completely different than me which is why I would rather talk to someone with a very similar personality type.**

**If you want to talk to me - Please don't ignore everything I say in my private messages only to answer some questions - refer to each part of my messages**

**REMEMBER PEOPLE! ALWAYS FIGHT FOR YOURSELF AND NEVER LOWER YOUR STANDARDS FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOU!

2501,Individual-Day-8915,1637134332,1,"We are not born feeling lonely. Loneliness is learned through repeated experiences ranging from some large events to some small events, all within the context of relationships. Essentially, we learn from the interactions with our caregivers and companions whether it is safe to be are our authentic self-to share our true thoughts, feelings, needs, and wants/desires as well as the intensity with which we feel them. We infer from these interactions as to whether our presence is wanted or not. Most of us learn in some way that it is not safe to be our authentic self and that we must hide, minimize, distort, apologize for, or detach from our authentic self, in order to gain acceptance, safety, and emotional security. Loneliness is born out of the fundamental need and desire for connection with the experience of disconnection and being unsafe. If loneliness is a learned experience, then connection can also be learned. We can learn that we can be vulnerable and safe at the same time, authentic and secure, transparent and valued, expressive and validated.  We need to look for clues in other people that tell us that they are safe to be around; they are kind, compassionate, forgiving &amp; apologetic, attentive, patient, accepting, creative, and authentic. They give themselves permission to feel whatever it is they are going to feel, which in turn gives us permission to feel whatever it is that we are feeling. Sometimes these people are really hard to find...sometimes our community needs us to be those people because our community/family does not have anyone like that. Regardless, our loneliness can fuel us to learn to have connection not just with others but with ourselves as we all deserve and need connection.",lonely,Where loneliness comes from...,2021-11-17 18:32:12

I feel like i've come so far socially
Yet i am still a rock and an island like i was. I have a circle of acquaintances, but i am still inert
Romantically i am still coping with dying alone. I don't think in that undesirable but i know no girl will ever come up to me and ask me out. I am a island inert in nature independent and sturdy. I work and i work hard i've always had a point A and point B mindset barreling directly to the finish line of my life. Not to say i'd reject love or even romance but my inert nature and the rolls I've been assigned and expected to conform to make it impossible for me to ever find anyone. Combine that with my own desires for a dominant person and i figure romance has rejected me. I don't think i'll meet anyone that would find the resolve to make an advance towards me so i just keep moving forward. I try to justify dying alone in a desperate bid to find any sort of happiness. But theres nothing. Not just a lack of happiness but a lack of malice sometimes a lack of sadness. Sometimes theres nothing. Like a muscle succumbed to atrophy my passion slowly withers.

I recently started going to concerts on my own. It's probably the most fun I can do alone, considering I don't have places to be other than college classes.

I think about trying to find people to befriend through apps, but having past experience using those kinds of platforms, it's a chore being the only one putting effort to even carry a conversation.

Nonetheless, I value online friendships no differently than in person. I have found it easier to develop meaningful connections that way, but finding someone to click with is just as difficult.

We were gonna meet up, and go to concerts, and I was gonna teach her how to fish... We had this whole thing set up. We sent each other mail, something I've NEVER trusted another living soul with before. My address, I mean.. It broke my heart the day she called in an angry fit **just** so she could read aloud the last letter I sent her and shred it on the phone. 



I thought we had something special going on. When it all fell through, it was a slow roast. I hung on till the very last possible moment because I never wanted that to end -- because guess where I'd end up again? Right the fuck here, alone. **AGAIN**. I get to go back watching couples holding hands in public, walking around and laughing it up like there ain't a care in the fucking world... With my cup of bitterness running over. 




So... I guess the takeaway with all I learned from her was that some people simply are meant to be alone. No matter how much effort you put in. No matter how many times you try to make something work. No matter what you do, there are three things guaranteed in this life for people like us...

I'm surviving, nothing more and nothing less.  I never got to have a childhood or go to school or really develop like most people do.  I was always locked away from everyone and everything and now coming up to my 19th birthday I have no one.  I used to feel sick thinking about where I'm going in life.  No college, no way out, just monotonous hell all day every day for the rest if my life.  I used to cry and try my damndest to get my life back on track when I realised just how screwed up of a trajectory I was set on by my family.  
The worst part is when you know you need to change, and still care just enough for it to hurt, but not enough to actually do anything.  I'm exhausted, I'm tired.  My life has been a lie.  I never had a choice in it all, and now that I do I realise I don't.  

Self pity is a horrible thing to express but I don't care anymore.  If people think it's weak and counterproductive they're probably right, but I worked so hard and I beat myself so long to work towards a goal that never existed in the end.

Through pretty much my entire life, I’ve never really pursued dating. A lot of it was because of my weight issues. I always told myself there weren’t any women who’d be interested in me because of my weight. Plus, I’ve had depression most of my life. So, that has sort of prevented me from focusing on losing weight. 

So, throughout my teens/20s, I never pursued dating because of this. Plus, I used to believe that “if it’s meant to happen, it will happen”. So, I guess I naively believed the dating thing would just sort of happen on its own.

In my early to mid 30s, I tried online dating. Other than a couple dates, nothing really happened. After a while, it became fairly clear that online dating was fairly pointless for someone who’s overweight and not attractive. Plus, all the catfish and bot account nonsense. I haven’t really bothered to try online dating for the last couple years because it seemed fairly pointless.

I know lots of people get married and what not in their 40s and beyond.

I want to say it was 2010ish when we first started chatting.

We had been friends for around 8 years or so. Throughout most of the friendship, she would ghost me when I needed someone to talk to her. I always tried to be there when she needed someone. I always found it weird at how often she ghosted me. But, we had some fun playing GTA and PlayStation Home that I just sort of overlooked it for several years.

A couple years or so into our friendship, she ended up telling me that we started talking and became friends around the time she was going through a pretty bad divorce. I believe she said her ex husband had been abusive. She told me that, just talking to me and playing games with her really helped her through it. I guess that was also part of the reason I stayed friends with her for as long as I did.

I’m not sure if I was an asshole. But, I ended up just cutting contact with her because I got tired of her ghosting me and only talking to me when she wanted to talk.

2557,TigerAndDeer,1637115958,1,"My apologies in advance because I feel like this is just going to come out as a ramble.

My depression has always been bad but recently it's gotten worse. 

My job is sucking the life out of me. I've had this job for about 3 yrs and it's getting worse and worse. I'm a manager and most of my employees refuse to come to work, so I'm ALWAYS at work and feel like I'm never allowed to have a personal life anymore. Over the summer, I was working 70hr weeks for 3-4 months straight and since then I've been burned out and completely unmotivated to do much anything. 

Before I continue, please don't comment telling me to quit my job. I can't quit my job and I don't expect most of you to understand why.

But it hurts that so many people I know don't think their jobs are important. Like if my employees don't want to work, why can't they just quit so I can stop dealing with them? 

And now I have this (weird) deep hatred for lazy people. Like I didn't realize how many people I know are super lazy or entitled. 

My sister is my only family I have left and I feel like I can't talk to her after I found out that she has a bad work ethic too. My family had always been so hard on me, expecting perfection from me and made me push myself hard no matter how tired or hurt I was. I always had to suck it up because my family didn't want me to have an easy life. And now my sister is saying that a person can wake up and decide not to come to work for the most trivial reasons. 

I still have a few friends, but they live out of town and frankly it feels like I'm always a bother now. I know I'm annoying and a few months ago my sister said that I make everyone around me miserable, so I don't really see why I should reach out to anyone.

So if and when I get free time I just sit at home just living in my head the whole time. I'm so lonely and I can't connect with people anymore. I'm on this weird bridge where I wish I had friends or someone that cared about me but at the same time I remember how many times in life I've been hurt by people and I just want to isolate myself. I want to cry but I'm so numb and haven't cried in years. I'm driving myself crazy and I'm annoying myself so much. 

I'd just like for a way to make this pain go away, or at least to make life a little enjoyable.",lonely,I feel like my loneliness is eating me alive now and I have no idea what to do at this point,2021-11-17 13:25:58

I'm just gonna list them because it's easier!

\- Anytime they would vent to me about the other ones, here's what would go down: A would talk about B or C to me, I wouldn't tell B or C what A said but A would then go to B and C and say I said everything about them. This has happened many times in different ways where B could be talking about A and C and vice versa. I have never once done that to any of them so that kind of sucked.

\- End of september I could tell C was mad at me so I asked her why and she sent me a huge ass list dating back to early 2018 about things she's been mad at me about but never tried to resolve things and just pretended things were fine between us. But if I brought things up I was told to get over it already or she would turn it back around on me and somehow put the blame back on me.

\- I always message them first or try to make plans for us to hang out but they never come to me to make plans or invite me to anything. They hang out with each other in pairs sometimes and I don't get upset, but they'll get upset with me if I only hang out with one of them and not invite the others.

\- End of October was my birthday, have barely been acknowledged by any of them since then. Friend A cancelled her baby shower the day after my birthday and I messaged her to arrange a time to drop off her gift since she cancelled the shower - she never responded but still had the baby shower the day she was gonna have it anyways but didn't invite me. I'm not sure if it was a surprise shower or not but I know friend B and C were planning it so either way I just was not invited and only ""cancelled"" it to get me out of it.

I haven't spoken to any of them really in the past month-ish and I'm not sure if I should reach out or not because their very defensive if you try to tell them that they hurt you and I hate confrontation so I know I would just end up apologizing for not reaching out sooner to apologize for making them mad or something stupid like that.

The other option is that I take way too long to respond trying to construct my thoughts.

Eitherway I end up feeling like I'm not actually being myself, and I just feel as lonely as when I'm not having the conversations. Then I either abandon or delete the socials, and in some time create new ones when I feel suicidally lonely.

The cycle has been repeating for many years now. I have nothing remotely similar to a friend irl, I live with my parents who are emotionally abusive, and I feel like I'm being a very emotionally abusive person too, and I loathe myself for it. I have nothing that would make me worthy of any kind of positive human connection, because I know that if I get any, my OCD and anxiety patterns/ panic attacks will just make me miserable to be around.  


Seeking mental health help irl in my country is near impossible (especially during these times and because my parents will cut me off if I get the vaxxine), I don't even know if I really have OCD, anxiety, panic attacks and pathological lying, I'm only basing those things off of my brain falling into softlocks every couple minutes if I do something that my brain associates with a negative outcome, and then I have to freeze in place for dozens of minutes, trying to convince my brain that I didn't move or click or did anything that would lead to something bad happening.

I'm sorry this is probably going to be a burner account, I just need to vent because, well I don't really know why, my brain is just screaming at me to do it, so I did. Sorry for rambling, if I try to go over this post now I'll probably end up deleting it instead",lonely,"I feel like I'm incapable of keeping friends, and I've come to the conclusion that I don't deserve friendship",2021-11-17 08:48:24

I work as a dishwasher and it makes me so happy when my co-workers greet me that’s the only interaction I have with anyone who isn’t my family. My co-workers don’t have to greet me I mean I’m just a dishwasher I’m not that important but they take to time to smile and say hello back when I say hi. I look forward to it the most when I go to work it brightens up my day and my mood skyrockets.

Sometimes I think it’s weird that I don’t have friends, women are very social creatures and rarely do they not have friendships it more common among the male population(sadly). I acknowledge that I’m a very lonely person because I do tend to talk to myself a lot, I probably talk more to myself than to other people somedays. But most of the time when I feel upset about the loneliness I tend to forget about it all together the next day and the cycle repeats again and again.

2642,SirMasonParker,1637080709,1,"She's in Colorado, I'm in South Carolina. We were romantically involved for over 2 years. I was head over heels for her, no one ever made me feel the way she did. She had gotten to the point that she just wanted to be friends, and I loved her so much I would happily take friends over nothing. Then I caught her in an ongoing lie that really affected me, and she lashed out, made me feel guilty for things I didn't do, and hung up on me. She wouldn't respond to texts or answer my calls. 2 weeks later, the first correspondence I got from her was a venmo request for 70 dollars. Our mutual friend, the third in our best friend trio, told me she needed space from me too because of what my friend was saying about me. I came inches away from killing myself, down to writing letters to everybody who mattered, but someone I was talking to reached out to my mom about being concerned about me. I finally texted her and told her that I couldn't do it anymore, I couldn't just wait for her to deign to speak to me again, and she sent me an incredibly nice message about how she will miss me and never forget me and cherish our memories. I didn't understand how she could be so cruel for weeks and still say such beautiful things. 
      
I've felt so hollow. 
     
Anything that starts to fill me with emotions beyond emptiness just drain out in the form of tears when I lay in bed and think about her not laying next to me. I dream about her almost every night and wake up and things feel okay for one fleeting moment and then it comes crashing down when I remember reality. 
     
But finally I was at a point where I wasn't crying every single day and night. I could smile again, at least sometimes. My loved ones weren't constantly asking me what was wrong anymore. I don't know if I'd call it healing, but I had moments that weren't miserable.
     
Last night I dreamed that she killed herself and I found her. It was graphic, and vivid, and horrifying. I woke up drenched in sweat and crying, with my dad trying to pull me out of the nightmare. I couldn't shake the feeling for hours. I texted her, and told her I had a nightmare, and asked if she was safe. She responded that she had a terrible night the night before, because she was missing me. We texted back and forth for a few messages, we both said that we missed each other, she assured me that she was safe, and we wished each other good days at work. 
     
And I'm devastated again. I was so happy to see her name pop up again, and I was waiting like a puppy dog for her next text. I miss our friendship so fucking much. Every time something even minutely interesting happens, my first thought is that I have to tell her, and then remembering that I can't. I thought if we got the chance to talk again that I would feel better, but this sucks. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to survive these feelings. I don't want to feel empty anymore. 
    
I don't know if I am looking for advice, or someone to talk to, or just a place to put this and vent. But I'm fucking struggling and it hurts so much and all I want to do is lay my head in her lap and tell her everything, and I know that's not an option and probably never will be again. And I'm not sure where to put those feelings. If you read this far, thanks for reading.

2661,Libtar15,1637072556,1,"This might not be applicable for some people's situations. But if anybody finds them self in a similar boat or with simular resources I thought I'd share some of what in went through 14 years ago till today.  
  
I was in a terrible relationship. Engaged to only what could be described as a succubus from hell (cheating, lying, gas lighting). I had been focusing on my career so barely had any other friends and family all lived hours away (not that we were close anyways). So when that relationship came to its natural end and I was left holding the bag for all the debt I took a job offer in a new city.  
  
When I get there I realized I didn't want to be isolated in a suburban area again or live in a stupid town home or a dull lifeless apartment. So I found a new building closer to down town that was offering grand opening crazy deals. Like half the rate. This might not be an option for some but I suggest maybe a place with easy access to downtown areas via public transport or something.  
  
So for a few years, I'd go out after work and practice socializing. You don't have to be a big drinker. You just have to learn active listening. Because one of the greatest tricks when making new friends is that to get somebody to like you, just get them to like themselves. There are a lot of people out there getting it just as bad as you.  
  
Also, get hobbies. I did become a crossfit rat for a while. That helped with some conversations. And I did get into a lot better shape that boosted my confidence a bit. But it wasn't till I discovered a bar that attracted a lot of artisan folk. I had always been interested in CNC and welding so I thought myself that. Next thing you know I'm talking to the owner, other patrons, and we are bartering and trading skills. We meet up for lunches and beers and talk shop.  I also meet somebody that I dated a couple years. Didt work out. They are married now but we are still good friends.  
  
But then the pandemic hit. And I'm not going to lie. A good deal of those relationships got shelved and I got back into the habit of drinking alone and just playing video games. All my projects started collecting dust. But that's turning around again. I've been heading out for dinner with the doggo (also get a manageable dog) most nights to patio bars. Ended up getting into a conversation on who built their tables with what I thought was a server but was the GM.  Now I got some more side hustle jobs and folks know me there. I chat with the whole crew and it has really just been good to have an outlet for the past two years of loneliness. I like to hear their stories more than talk about mine. Which I think is a way to be helpful in this world.
  
My situation is very unique and I know there are people that are coming from places of greater disadvantage than myself. But the baseline advice I can give is get out and just explore. Walk your neighbor hood. Have some places where you are a regular and people know your name. Learn new things. Try new hobbies. Take some classes. Read a book in a park and somebody will ask you what it is. You don't have to hustle, but any kind of movement is life. And you're giving people an excuse to talk to you.  
  
Anyways hope this helps some folks. But I know in the throws of loneliness it's hard to hear ""be more active"". It's a vicious cycle. But be kind to yourself. Invest in yourself. It's the single best investment. Pays off more than any stock.",lonely,How I became less lonely.,2021-11-17 01:22:36

2683,NatureSageV3,1637053146,1,"I don't know how to deal with these feelings. The knowledge that even after 25 years of trying, I will never be as important to anyone as they are to me. Some of you must know the feeling, right? When someone is your best, closest friend, but you aren't theirs? There will always be people they like more than you and would rather spend time with, and you know that's within their right, but it still stings to know you are only a bit character to the most important people in your life.  


I had someone who genuinely made me feel like more than that for awhile. I lit up like I never had before. I was so vibrant and in love with life that I almost felt like a completely different person. For once I felt like I was seen and actively wanted by someone. But they were depressed. They were suffering and needed someone to be there for him. That's who I tried to be. And in turn, they were there for me.  


But now they have gotten better. I got them to consistently take their meds, keep up therapy, and generally take care of themself, and it's been paying off. They are so much more stable and healthy now. The only problem is that now that they are doing better, they require more energy than I can give. They actively seek out other friends, make plans with them, do things with them, spend all their time with them, and I'm back on the sidelines, lucky if he ever wants to spend time with me at all. And they insist they still care, but... I feel like they just feel guilty that they aren't satisfied with me anymore and don't want to believe that our friendship just doesn't work anymore. I'm glad he's doing better, it hurt to see him suffer so long and I wouldn't want to damage his recovery at all, but at this point I just feel strung along because he feels obligated to me. It hurts, I don't want to go back to feeling like a background character with the only person who ever truly made me believe I could be more than that, but as painful as it is, I want to believe things will get better and know it could hurt his recovery if I tried to leave. So I just have to stick around and watch him fawn over my replacement and just adore every single thing they do  


I'm back where I started. I don't have anyone who cares about me as much as I care about them. Everyone is so important and has so many people who care about them and love going out of their way to engage with them... and then there's me, the person on the side who could disappear without a single person even realizing.

I was so ready to spend my life with her.bI’m in college, and I live a good ways away. Over breaks, we FaceTimed every night and texted. During this last summer, I worked to save up for a custom engagement ring. This semester she broke up with me when I got back. It turns out she had been using cocaine and alcohol while I had been gone. We both struggled with substance abuse, which was always the root of all of our relationship problems. But the cocaine and alcohol turned her into a different person. We remained friend, and talked after about a month of silence. I’m still head over heels for her. And she still loves me. But recently I’ve learned she had a new fuck-buddy, and he’s 15 years older than her. She texts him non-stop. They eventually split for a few days after he flat out told her he didn’t want a relationship with her, and she clung to me. I knew I was being used, but I loved her so much I didn’t care. For a couple of days I slept in her bed with her, and we went out and went on a road trip together. It felt exactly like it used to. Then one night I saw she was texting him again, and i felt so empty. I’ve also come across polaroid photos of them together in their apartment with all sorts of sentiments written on them. She talks about him right in front of me like it’s nothing. Shes made it very obvious the sex is great, a  subject which I’ve always been slightly insecure around. It’s like she has no idea how hurt I am. I’ve even told her to her face how I feel. And since they started I’ve realized i was always the second call, I got called over to hang out whenever he wasn’t available or whenever she needed emotional support. We both still love each other like crazy, but I’ve been insanely depressed. I never feel depressed around her but being around her makes the depression worse when I’m alone again. I want her to go to school and do good for her at, and she was talking about how excited she was when her and fuck-face mcBitch boy weren’t talking. Now she doesn’t seem as interested. I feel so helpless, I just want to pack her up and take her with me when I go home, and I can’t stand knowing how she’ll be living while I’m gone. We used to be so fucking happy. All of our old pictures are still so bright and happy. I have a million screenshots of her telling me how much she loved me from our FaceTime sessions. I’m so brutally alone, but I can’t just cut her off. I just wish she knew how bad she made things for me. I wish she still thought about how I felt.

2688,Synflauer,1637050892,1,"Hi, sorry for trauma dumping u dont rly have anyone else to talk about with this sorta stuff.

I (23M) am on the spectrum and am not really a fan of physical touch. I think its cute when i see it in movies and videos and what not but whenever it comes down to a hug or holding hands or just touching in general i get very uncomfortable when i am an active participant. Ive dated a few people, some that ive actually been really fond of and most of those relationships have ended due to my aversion to that sorta stuff.

The behind the scenes kinda stuff isn't an issue and i kinda enjoy it because its a bit more active and involved and i guess that keeps me distracted as opposed to just being idle. Idk im not well versed in the psychology of it all. However, afterwards i still find it difficult to be in the same bed as someone else. In my old relationships, when one of us would be sleepong over at the other's place, i can never manage to fall asleep while cuddling. I'd always wait for them to fall asleep first then kinda scoot away and either separate us with a pillow or just go sleep on the couch entirely.

I've openned up about this in some of my relationships and have been met with very little understanding but efforts were made by my partners but at some point it usually ends in them feeling like im always being distant. I've tried leading with this fact during my first dates now and it hasn't gotten me very far.

I've just kind of accepted that its something that most people cant deal with and i might just have to stick to hook-ups for a while just for what little crumbs of intimacy i crave.",lonely,Relationships with autism,2021-11-16 19:21:32
2689,SmallestGymBro,1637050581,1,"My whole life is long string of failures. 
My parents were in high school when father got my mother pregnant by accident. When I was born, I got pneumonia and my grandparents wanted to leave me in hospital to die and told my parents to make new baby. My father was home once a year and after couple years parents divorced and I’ve almost totally lost contact with my father. My mother, who was coming home only at night, stopped coming back at all. I was left with my grandparents. Grandpa was alcohol addict and grandma was crazy so they were constantly fighting and trying to kill each other, throwing stuff etc and when I tried calling mother to help me, she didn’t care. She also told me my father didn’t want me and that’s why he left. When grandfather was sober he constantly yelled at me and was calling me names like „bastard” etc. I was bullied in school and because there was only couple dozens of students in there I never had friends. My teachers didn’t care and when someone injured me they tried to cover it and take revenge on me by lowering my mark for behavior which is important in my country. I also got terrible psoriasis. When I graduated high school I’ve restored contact with my father, but now only I have constant source of income and I’m stressed all the time. I also had to take some small loans and there were times when I couldn’t afford  psychiatrist, gym membership (my hobby) and barely had money for some food. my father doesn’t help by telling me that I’ve wasted my life, and when he goes on the dates he tells me that he’s different from me because, no girl cares about me. I had two months of life with less anxiety than normally and I could talk with random people, but now I didn’t only lose that, but my suicide thoughts and psoriasis came back.

2692,pressed_dates,1637049741,1,"34M. It's getting harder to cope with life as a lonely person. I never had a gf or a friend that was a girl. I don't have any male friends either. My dad's family disowned me at the age of 23. My mom abandoned me at the age of 5. She spent those 5 years trying to find creative ways on getting rid of me. From being left on a stranger's front door and quickly driving away before the door opened to being left at a babysitter's house for weeks on end because she refused to pick me up. Physical abuse increased when I was 12 as my hands were tied to a whipping post and my lower body was beaten by my strict uncle because I couldn't make a better grade than a C in my Math classes. He used to swing that cane like a baseball bat while at the same time, telling me that I would amount to nothing in life as I felt intense pain from being flogged. My time in school was challenging enough because I've been bullied by all the ""popular/rich/cool"" guys and laughed at by all the ""hot"" girls in class. Everyone else who didn't laugh or bully me would basically just mind their own business as they reverted to their own cliques rather than chat when I tried to say anything to them. My appearance and stature quickly classified me as an object of inferiority in middle school and high school during the early 2000's. This was an era when students were savagely heartless towards Asian males like myself, especially in a Southern state like I was. It's almost ironic too because I'm part Korean and part Irish by blood lineage.

I guess time really flies because I'm 34 now and I can remember my youth like it was yesterday. Each and every day that goes by is just another day of sadness and loneliness. I can't remember the last time I cracked a smile. I can no longer find the willpower to lift my head when I walk. I have zero friends and no family. I have yet to feel love or human affection. I've never hugged a girl or kissed one. I wonder just how magical it is to feel a girl's touch. Must be exhilarating to feel a girl's face with my hand. Guys my age would normally develop a family by now. This would consist of a beautiful wife and kids but here I am as a virgin, still, because nobody likes me. I don't even know what it's like to have a conversation with a girl. They simply do not desire me because my image has been beaten to death with stereotypes that is perpetuated by Western culture. It's a stigma that I have to live with. As an adult, I've bounced around from a multitude of decent jobs. However, life really hasn't changed much from my school days when it comes to socializing, because I have no social life to begin with. Humans may be naturally sociable but they are also naturally cruel and selective. I still get misinterpreted by society. I still get laughed at by girls. I still get treated like a joke by guys. I'm being reminded, every... single... day... of how pathetic I am as a subhuman being because I always see couples in love, friends laughing with each other and fathers playing with their kids.

Why I continue to go on is a question in itself. Perhaps I'm too scared to die - I'm too scared to find out what comes after. Perhaps my uncle was right all along, perhaps I am nothing. Life sucks.",lonely,Life sucks,2021-11-16 19:02:21

I’m finishing second semester of my college degree, and I’m absolutely exhausted. All I want is to finish this ASAP. This semester was very bad, and my lack of friends or even people that I can trust in, obviously don’t help. I even deleted most of my social media accounts, like Instagram. What’s the point for having them? 
Right now, I only have WhatsApp. 

Five days ago, I was very upset and frustrated because of a bad grade in a quiz I had in one of my classes. Something interesting of me is that after I get angry, I get very sad and even depressed. As if I were regretting everything or reflecting about what went wrong. Well the point is that, that happened to me that day. It was like 11:00 pm when, in my sadness, I realized how lonely I am. I was very melancholic that night, and since I didn’t have most of my social media already, that just got worse. I didn’t have anyone to vent with. 

So I decided to go to Omegle. My plan wasn’t really to talk about my problems, I just was in need to talk with someone. And I started to talk with this man. We talk for about twenty minutes or something like that. In our conversation, we begin to talk about hard situations we face in life and he talk me about Reddit, and more specifically, about this community and other ones. 
I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to start in here, but eventually I did it. I created an account and…

Here I am.

# Feeling pretty down about my (male 27) female 27 friendship

Don't have many friends these days or ever had (real friends most of my life) but this was different, we had similar beliefs etc, didn't like going to clubs, agreed its hard to make true friends, slowly but surely we got to know each other, we chatted everyday... it was nice to have someone to talk to then it slowly faded to a weekly thing which I was ok with because I know people get busy and people have/need boundaries. We talked about dreams etc, I felt connected, I like deep connections having those make small talk easier down the road as well because we had those kind of talks as that's just the way I am it felt nice someone cared. We agreed its hard to make good friends here. She's Irish and me Canadian as we were just talking about how its hard to make good friends here (in Canada), and sharing fun tidbits about each other's culture. As I said before we slowly got to know each other over 8 months.

Started to ignore my texts didn't want to be pessimistic anymore, so I thought she was busy, then 3-4 weeks go by so i text her to get answer/closure. She answered she said she after she went on her trip (she mentioned this) she went hiking, she didn't touch her phone much then got crazy busy with school and work. Then her ex came back into picture as she ran into them, they started talking and she decided she wants to give it her all again because she really loves him even though she tells me it might not work out again,saying the idea was dumb thats why she didn't tell me(obviously conflicted) She told me she told him that she wouldn't talk/text anyone else and that she felt bad that she let so much time go by and that she should of told me but didn't and that she did see me like a good friend and glad to know me and that she was truely sorry and sorry for being a bitch even though it means nothing now.

She wants to see if they have something worth fighting for.

I know thats the risk for female friendships but didn't expect it to abruptly end like that

All I said is I''m not happy about this but hope your dream works out.

Feel like she didn't value the friendsship,

even though she said she really did enjoy getting to know me

The thing is I told myself I would never beg again for friends or anything(disgusting I know, but thats what happens when you been alone for so long you lose self respect i mean I lasted 6 years though lol)

Keep telling myself this pain is less then the pain of losing yourself respect If i let her back in if it doesn't work... I feel like even it might of even been the boyfriend but if it was her that said she wouldnt talk to anyone she doesn't really value the friendship.

The stupid things people do for love huh?

well its been 24 hours... hopefully I can move on quick

but the problem is I care I remember every little tidbit because I care maybe I care too much.

I just like being there for people, I wish people were there for me

never burnt the bridge but maybe its time for me to burn the bridge and do whats for best for me as well

 A long time ago, when I was still living in Hong Kong, my ex-husband embezzled my money and company money without my knowledge and used it to gamble.    All lost.    He owes a lot of money.    When I finally divorced, my debt was half of one person 

  In my darkest time.   With the help of my friends, I started a new job, slowly repaid my debts and gradually accumulated funds.   One person has been walking until now.  

 Initially, I still had friends living with me, but my recent performance has been very poor. I spend every day in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness. It has been more than five years since my marriage ended. My failed marriage is a short story, but it has brought me great pain. 

 The pandemic has made everyone's life difficult. It is difficult to meet a suitable person in life to meet, but I hope to find a partner who will accompany me to the old age, preferably from Canada and the United States. When the pandemic is over, plan to do meaningful things together!

2719,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1637040401,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships these days. 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. Today I accidentally hurt my back (nothing too crazy I think) and I'm laid up in bed for the evening. It would be great to find some good company.

It's so bad that I have nobody to walk to class with and the only friends I have are at lunch...I see them for 20 minutes each day.  I have to look at my phone a lot during passing periods so I don't feel so lonely. I swear I'm trying but every day just seems like a hellhole because I am alone for most of the day.

I looked in the mirror a moment ago and it scared me. For so long i have been stuck in my own head, thinking i was just a ghost drifting through society, emotionally, spiritually, and somewhat physically. It scared me because i realized the person i saw in the mirror was real. I am that person. People see me and talk to me and i interact with them. Over the past years, i have been using disassociatives to get high, and i got sober 9 months ago. I am constantly realizing how much of an impact that has had on diminishing whatever self image i had of myself, and made me dislike social interaction in general. But ive realized that i need more help than self reflection and a therapist. This is where i need help. 

I need people to talk to to expand myself, help me build my self image, my character and my morals, and even my interests. I hope by connecting with others, i can form strong relationships that give me a sense or purpose and a will to keep going. If anyone would like to chat, even for a short amount of time, that would be more than helpful.

Btw, i have been doing much better than before. I recently graduated high school, and i have a job. Im saving up for a car and to go to college. Im still very depressed and sometimes even psychotic, but being sober has given me the ability to reflect on myself seriously instead of just putting myself down and the universe i exist in, which i am forever greatful for. In drug rehab, and throughout my therapy, i have been taught to reach out to others, which i haven't taken seriously until now.

I was tempted to message someone earlier. Didn't matter who. Anyone. Just to talk to but I stopped myself. Went over the reasons why I needed to stop relying on other people to make me feel better and stop using others to hide behind my real problems. That I'm not happy even when I'm talking to someone and I'm not happy when I'm alone. And I need to figure out why instead of dragging others along with me.

I left her because we stopped having sex, and I dont want that part of my life to just be over. Why we stopped is a mystery, but neither one of us wanted to have sex, and we were both loyal. Now that I'm choosing to be alone, I'm so fucking horny I not only would have sex with my ex, but I would probably have sex with a much less attractive woman. My question is: why is my labido so crazy when I'm single, and so non existant when I'm in a relationship.

Well, I’ve tried everything.

At this point, I’ve just accepted that I’ll never get a simple girlfriend, get laid, or ever feel secure in my own skin. I’m disgusted at how mentally weak I am, so viscerally disgusted I can’t even look in the mirror. 
I didn’t ask to be born like this and I’ve done so much to fight against this anxious and paranoid part of myself.

Now here's the frustrating part: there are more support workers on there that I simply won't talk to when they answer, because I've spoken to them before and I didn't enjoy it. There's even one entire crew that I've written off because of this. To add to this, this support line is incredibly busy at night, and if you're not continuously re-dialing the number, you will have a hard time getting through. Re-dialing the same number for 20-30 minutes is **not** a relaxing way to spend the evening.

Most of last week I didn't get to speak to anyone. There is one crew where I did speak to three of the people there (there's a maximum of 4 people per crew currently), but two of the support workers left that crew a few months back, and now that crew is half its size. Now it looks like the support worker I did talk to isn't there either, and was replaced by someone I hang up on when they answer. So that's now two crews I've written off, and they work 2-3 shifts per week, in a row.

The other support lines, including a crisis line which I hate calling because of the excessive wait times, are always busy. I hate not having anyone to talk to.",lonely,Relying on a peer support phone line is frustrating,2021-11-16 12:15:55

I was feeling for a while like he didn't want much to do with me and he had been hanging out with my best friend a lot without me. Me and my fiance and my best friend and her husband were all friends and hung out every day, even went on vacations together. My fiance and best friend and I all work together too. It was so great and I was so happy to have such close friends. I had been wanting a close female friend for years and I actually prayed and thanked God for putting her in my life several times. I always had plenty of friends but always ended up losing touch with them when they moved away. I've never been good at long distance friendships and keeping in touch. Anyway, my fiance and I had been having problems for a while. No intimacy and arguing a lot over stupid stuff. I had been feeling like he had fallen in love with my best friend which caused even more resentment on my end. And when he broke up with me he moved in with her and her husband and she pretty much stopped talking to me. I felt like my world had imploded and I was left with no one to talk to and I didn't know why it was happening. I felt so rejected and abandoned. My best friend and I eventually talked and she basically said that my depression ""turned her off."" Basically, when she wanted to go out and do stuff and I was depressed and laying on the couch and too sad to get up she and my fiance would go do stuff without me and she became closer with him and whenever he and I fought he would run to her and tell her about it and she felt like I was mean to him at times and it turned her off even more. She felt like she had to choose between us and she chose him. We sold the house and I moved into a house with my father. I had no other close friends besides those 3 and now I have none. I'm 36 years old and it's nearly impossible to make new friends. I have always struggled with depression and have gone through plenty of hard times but I have never felt lower than I have the past few months. To be honest, I'm more upset about losing my friend than I am about my fiance and I breaking up. I just feel so betrayed by someone I would've done anything for. I'm 36, never been married, have no kids, and live with my Dad. I have a great job but when I'm off work I lay on the couch and watch Seinfeld all day and can't muster the motivation to even shower.

Whenever i see a girl i just get the f away cause i know that im full of shit and that i look like shit. There is no ""significant other"", at least i dont believe in it. Yall will say ""duh ur young' and all that but thats not what i think, what im trying to say here is that i never had a female friend , not even a true friend let alone a girl. And thats not whats bugging me, i partially accepted that i will be alone for the rest of this shit called ""life"". Its that i dont even have friends , someone u can talk or that. I do have homeboys on discord but they dont give a f. And my family , huh , only grandpa and hes the only reason im here and typing this, if he wasnt here i would be long gone for sure. I dont have any goals in life, and never had. Guess my only passion that also keeps me alive is listening to music, mainly heavy metal, rock and stuff. I never ever had goals nor motivation for anything. For long time now im feeling empty, simply said dead inside. Even eating or breathing is painful. Im shitty student , lazy af, bad at everything , antisocial , introvert. Fuck being introvert, that ruined all chances that i had so far. Only last remaining   light i have in life is the one girl i met 2 months ago. We talk on daily basis, laugh, draw, send each other memes and that and always laugh. She's the only true friend i have for this 18 years of burden. And thats it ,only friend , guess cuz im to big of a p to make it something bigger. Even she recently started to not give a f bout me, but heh thats okay i got used to it. Lately the way she talks to me lets me know ""ayo ur boring just gtfo already"".

Yeah thats it, got nothing really to much to say cause this 18 years are just emptiness, and i dont want to bother anyone on this earth why and how it come to this, im mainly born like this, even like kid i acted like this. I dont know how long will i go but im very ,very and i mean it very close to ending it all. I dont care for consequences and ""everyone will be sad"" shit.

However, lately it's been hard to get him to reply to me. I thought I was being needy, so I backed off a while and messaged him less, still nothing, maybe a reply days/weeks after.

I think it's ADHD and am waiting for insurance to talk with the pharmacy to get my Adderall but still it's hard.

2803,IWritePoemsForYou,1637012359,1,"Being alone in life isn't really easy, and there are some days where the world seems to be nothing but grey. I've never experienced any type of intimacy in my life. I grew up with people who didn't talk to me. I thought I was the issue and it felt as if I didn't really exist. 

I was anxious for a long time. Long enough to fuck me up.. The perpetual loneliness could only be masked by the drugs so much. Therapist after therapist and I thought I wasn't human. The days kept getting heavier until I could barely recognize myself. 

That cloud wasn't something I thought I'd be able to beat. It seemed like I was viewing life the same way a fly on the wall would. I had to deal with my mental illnesses by myself and I've learned that's not an experience I would wish upon people. Sometimes I would feel like an old feeble man, run down by the world. 

I didn't really know my family either. After I was kicked out I tried finding my birth parents but I was just as invisible as I was to other people and I had to deal with that. 

I was suicidal to a dangerous level and I attempted once. I was over 400 pounds back then. The branch snapped. After that my view on death started shifting. I realized that my death would be just as meaningless as my life. I would fade just as unknown as when I started. 

Anxiety shifted to anger as I became determined to leave a mark on this world. Intimacy stopped mattering to me. I have always lived without it. I realized just how *resilient* I had become. Nobody could move me much anymore. 

I started doing stuff for myself. Not even some self improvement bullshit like the gym and stuff either. I did what *I* wanted to do. The anger shifted to cold indifference. The things that would make me go home like seeing couples kissing or anything like that faded into something that doesn't even make me sad. 

I realized this world is fucked up in so many ways but that doesn't mean *you* have to be fucked up. I realized I may have always been alone but other than that what inherently was wrong with me? What did the opinion of society matter to me anyway? I didn't even know these people and they sure as hell didn't want to know me. So I began realizing that staying in misery would only kill me. 

I began to fight. I fought *hard*. I lost all that fucking weight I became published and now I'm my own man. The pain almost killed me. I felt at multiple times I was gonna die. 

I'm not trying to come off as cocky or dismiss your pain. What you are feeling is one of the worst things society can do to you. You think life is worth Jack shit because that's what everyone else thought about you. But as I got older things started not to matter. I realized that I gotta fight for myself because no one else will. I got left in the dirt but I always stuck to my morals. 

I'm not saying you can cure this pain. I still haven't been with anyone since I changed but I *dont* care anymore. I realized that I've been by myself for so long the only person who knew who I was was *me*


Things will be tough. You *will* want to quit. It's harder than anything I've experienced and that dull drab pain was in my opinion worse than when I was homeless. 

I do not condone or relate with the joker at all but there is one clip in that new movie that I've used with therapists to demonstrate what it's like. 

When he was writing in the notebook by himself, and he wrote ""I hope my death makes more cents than my life."" And while I have never been the joker I have been Arthur. Alone in a house, wondering why nobody cared, being a shell of a man. That sticks with you.

Taking stimulants in high school caused me to be a very reserved person, they made me feel weird, depressed, and like I wasn’t myself but my parents and doctor always enforced this as the only way for me to get better and control my ADD. High School was living hell for me in terms that I would start experimenting with drugs like xanax, lsd, weed, and mdma to counteract the way stimulants would make me feel. I started doing drugs to run away from depression caused by stimulants in high school but now I’m in college and no longer use drugs. I only use medical marijuana to cope now but as of earlier this year I made the decision to no longer take stimulants. I don’t abuse any drugs and I live a somewhat healthy lifestyle but ever since I stopped using adderall for college all I can think about is dying.

2810,LifeArson,1637009501,1,"Hi!

So, I'm 37, a queer bipolar femme guy with a history of social anxiety, currently trying the whole solo poly thing. I feel perhaps closeted about who I am, not in the queer part but in the mental illness? I feel like it informs a lot of my interactions with other people, or more precisely the lack of. 

I deal with the social anxiety by putting 100% of the onus to interact on other people and letting my mind stay perfectly blank most of the time. Except when I am journaling, which I do obsessively, or the odd time when I have to expend mental effort to find solutions to problems - which also includes some amount of ""why don't I know the answer to this?"" panic.

I'm starting to make friends and more through online dating, but as you can probably tell from the way I portray myself here, most people find me a bit much to deal with at anything beyond a surface level - at least, that's my assumption. This is more or less fine by me, I very much feel that if people don't accept who I am, they can fuck right off, though in no way do I think I portray that in person aside from being generally socially avoidant.

Still, I want a community - or perhaps more precisely, a chosen family. I think perhaps the poly community or aftergifted or ADHD crew is where I belong, just because some of those people I seem to really bond with. In the past I've fit in with the writers, the weirdos, the losers, the geeks and nerds, (although not really) the musicians, the homeless, the drunks or potheads, most of all the mentally ill. The pysch ward is like.... ""heyyyy! My peeps!""

Jesus, that was a long way of coming to the point. I'll skip the rest of the exposition. Basically, due to a new position at work, limited amount of time getting to see people I like, and feeling like I need more social contact in my life that used to be provided by drinking and talking to the random people that brought me into contact with... I want to know how to succeed at the tasks in the title.

As it is, I can't stand forced social contact. I believe it is more than possible to create a role/persona for myself (I can't remember the technical psychology term) that is able to handle these situations.  


Difficulty: I also have memory problems and I would much rather study therapeutic approaches on my own than actually go to therapy.

I don't lack in social skills when I am drinking or forced into it, people seem to like me and respect me. I can be funny, which I know people like, but not reliably. Please, what are the cheat codes to social wellbeing and happiness?

See? Funny, but not reliably.  


TL;DR:

Two years ago my life has changed to the bad side, From personal reasons I lost my friends, my family can't understand or help me, I barely go to school and my environment is really bad. I have nothing to do with that but smile and hope for tomorrow to be good.

Three months ago I've met a girl really suddenly on a random discord server and we talked about piercings just for fun and then I went to sleep when I woke up she sent me good morning and I was pretty surprised since I didn't talk to people at that time at all and she was the first person who actually cared about me for once. We kept talking for hours and hours and since that very beginning we still talk, At some point, we felt really good and happy together, our friendship was something really unique and we connected really fast. Every moment we spent together felt the best and it was really hard to describe my feelings about her at the time.

We stalked each other a lot secretly, were open with each other from the beginning, and always shared our biggest secrets, opinions, and basically our life routine. 

But, A month ago I felt like she started to ignore me much more and I didn't want to press on her too much because we aren't a couple but just two good friends who having fun with each other so I just let it flow and kept that in my stomach ... the day after I tried to think what is the reason for that, it was really sudden since we literally talked more than 4 hours a day, every day, and also always spent the night together without sleep at all but just talking and talking. I thought I was too clingy with her or maybe she had fun with other people, she has a lot of friends and we aren't in the same situation when it comes to friends.  I was ready, I thought maybe she lost her interest in me and that is very okay because that's life and you can't force people to care and love you as you do but before I gave up on her completely it was really important for me to talk with her about that and so I did... After we talked she told me she didn't realize she was missing and I told her I'll stop being clingy and take my feelings too far and she started to cry... she asked for me to stop because she felt really good with me and she really cared about me and when I say that it makes her feel bad and stuff and I was happy about it because maybe my thoughts were just an illusion.

It's been a month since that same conversation and now it's happening again, I feel like she's mad at me more often and just yesterday we laughed together and I helped her with something and we felt really happy and a couple of hours later she ended the conversation in the worst way ever and didn't give a shit about me because she misunderstood my words .. (and it was literally nothing, I didn't say something bad or dumb at all)...

Anyways I don't know what to do, she told me she's alright and it's not my bad but she and acting really bad to me and she's the most important person in my life at the moment and I really don't want to give up on her but it's clear that I care about her way more than she does and really love being with her and spent the time together but it feels really bad and painful when you care about someone but he doesn't.",lonely,Starting to lose the only important person in my life,2021-11-16 07:43:55

2817,Idk644,1637007310,1,"Tonight i have planned to burn myself to death, my plan is to have myself tied up to a tree then use gasoline to burn myself, after that i would like to have my ashes spread in the ocean, maybe hear a last song... although i don't know which one.

For my whole life i have had few to zero friends, it can be tough but that's life. I do think there can be a beauty in just that though, it makes you a appreciate the little things, that beautiful girl i never talked to, a good movie, a nice sunset or just a good song.

There is a lot of things i won't get to see. I wonder how life will be in 30 years, will people at my age have gotten kids, what new tech will be out, how will the world look? I will never know. I will admit, as i'm writing this, tears are dipping down my cheeks..

I always had my own views on things, i stand by that but accept that you might not agree. I lived my life doing what i believe in, you might not agree with it but i didn't hurt anyone. I never liked to do just what people told me anyway, if everyone went left i would often be the one who went right.

I have a lot of insecurities, my height, my grammar, my eyesight and eating in front of people are just some of them. I often pretended to be confident and not have any insecurities. I was lying to myself, i regret that.

I have had problems with my mental health a few years now... I have always kept it to myself and never dared to tell anyone, after all, what could they do? My mood is very up and down and i have had self harm problems for years. I tried writing to a suicide line one time, i waited for 3 hours and never got through to anyone, maybe i'm meant to kill myself.

There is this really beautiful girl, i see her every work day, never talked to her but just seeing her is something i look forward to. Of course i can't just stare at her, even though i would like to, but just getting glance of her is the highlight of my day. Part of me just want to tell her how pretty she is but that's not gonna happen, i don't wanna bother her and i definitely don't dare to, besides i don't wanna seem weird or creepy. Her being beautiful is already more that i could ask for as she is giving me something to look forward to. I don't know what it is about her but she just melts my heart. I wonder what her name is, i wish i knew that.

However, i feel like even that isn't enough to keep me going, i think of killing myself everyday and have been doing so for a while now... Am i scared to die? yeah.. scared of the pain, scared of not being here, scared of never doing anything in my life... I tell myself it's gonna be alright, i know deep down i can face it.

Maybe all of this was just to comfort myself.. I don't really know anymore.",lonely,I plan to kill myself tonight,2021-11-16 07:15:10

2863,_xNORTHx_,1636974662,1,"TLDR - lost both my best friends now alone and sad.

I struggle with a mental illness (will not go into much depth) which makes me severely overdependent on people. To the point my life and wellbeing revolves around them, while this makes me caring and present it can also make me possessive and controlling. 

I had these 2 best friends who I had the overdependence issue with. They meant the world to me, I would spend hours with them at school and on discord calls every single day, for 2 years. I had never cared about a friend as much as them and I would have given my life for either of them. They told me I was loved and protected and that they cared about me deeply. 

About a week ago I lost both of them. Friend 1 messaged me saying he couldn't do it anymore (with no real trigger)  and blocked me on everything with no discussion or explanation, he yelled at me at school when I approached him asking him why. A couple days after this friend 2 left. He actually spoke to me though and explained he was going through a really hard time, and that our colliding issues were causing a lot of strain on his mental wellbeing and he wanted a break. 

I started seeing a therapist a few months ago and since then I have not had any major fights or issues with either of them (save for petty normal arguments). I just do not understand any of this, I feel like I have lost my entire livelihood. 

School has been hell since this started, I do not have a lot of friends and relied a lot on both of them. The few friends I do have all belong to groups that I cannot feasibly insert myself into, The one friend I had left who I would spend my school time with has now decided he wants to join a friend group that I used to be in and hated. It doesn't help that I have to see friend 1 &amp; 2 with there new friend group acting as if nothing happened and I do not exist every day. 

Fortunately I am in the final weeks of grade 10 (high school in Australia). Do you think changing schools for college (year 11 and 12) would be wise? I am dreading the summer holidays due to my lack of friends and am just hurting so much. Just really would like to talk about this with someone in more depth as I really need advice and support I am not coping.",lonely,Lost my best friends seeking support/advice,2021-11-15 22:11:02

This time I was so overwhelmed with emotions I almost couldn't go to work. I forced myself to do it. And I've realised I don't really have anyone to talk to if I turn into a complete mess. Anyone who would be willing and able to accept and handle me in that state. I do have people around me, colleagues at work, family, one or two pretty good friends...but nobody like that. I have a few people who love me and would be sad if something happened to me and ti even more people it would be at least a hassle if I broke down. That's what's keeping me alive and sane most of the time.

Make 2 or 1 things you can do this week. A small goal is great too! Keep your motivation going with small goals or big goals you are confident in doing! 

A total stranger like me just wants to remind you **if you're feeling negative that.... it's going to get better just keep pushing. Just because it's dark now doesn't mean there's no light.** 

You might be the light itself! If you can't find a reason to be positive then maybe.... **make a reason?** 

**Take my advice lightly if you wish to**, may not mean much from a stranger saying this and it's understandable and completely okay!

 **Thank you for reading up until this point** and this is **OPTIONAL** but in the comments make 1 or 2 small goals you can achieve and once you did that goal/s this week then let me know by replying to your comment and saying you completed it! 

**AGAIN OPTIONAL, you don't need to do it if you don't want to.**

I feel so distant from others around me. I feel so Alone. I have trouble making friends.I used to have a friend but I have been alone for quite a while now. I remember when I was a kid I would always be unhappy because I was a kid that had the most trouble making friends. When I was a kid I used to love helping others to the point I would never refuse anyone if they would ask for something that is within my reach but the other kids only took advantage of it and were never really my friend just pretended to be. I still remember I would literally cry If some kid said  to me he doesn’t want to be my friend anymore.It made me feel I wasn’t normal which is true I guess because my mother also suffers from mental Illness and once it got so severe she couldn’t remember who I was but all is well now. My sister on the other hand is not so fortunate and struggles with most basic things. I have never been in a relationship with a women and have never really even tried because I am afraid that if I ever choose to have kids they will end up being like me. When I finally made a friend after so many years I felt happy. The good thing is the one friend that I did manage to make was my genuine friend and I could talk to him for hours without being bored but now that I have moved far away  I don’t think I will ever meet him again. I am complete stranger here. I feel like I haven’t matured at all mentally Because I still feel the same now as I used to when I was a little kid. I guess part of it comes from self doubt and low self esteem because I feel like I am abnormal mentally. I do well when it comes to my studies and go to university.

I was at a social event today and everyone was boasting about how they are in xyz group. Meanwhile I’m just out here barely making it by. 

I have a core group of irl friends but due to some recent events which made me the reoccurring character in my own life story, i was left out of events. This is very ironic and sad as the whole basis of that core group of friends being built was because we were all outcasts. Needless to say I have cut many of them out of my life. 

There are like a hand full of people internet friends I keep in touch with but that is just about it. I never get the help from my psychologist as she just says to do the same thing despite me doing everything and returning empty handed. 

I tried my luck in a different denomination of Christianity hoping for more and while I got more out of it, the backlash from my family was just too much to handle so for now, I have returned to my birth religion. It sucks as I actually liked the new denomination I joined and I could never find wrong doing with it. I just feel like I should have never questioned things to begin with and I wouldn’t have the problems I am having with religion as it hurts to leave the new denomination that I converted to and still subconsciously practice the denomination despite never being born into it but I had recent ancestors who were apart of it.",lonely,Just another person in a sea of loneliness.,2021-11-15 19:40:02

I can't make these stupid fucking feelings go away and it's starting to really wear on me. 

The past two weeks have been rough because I'm constantly waking up throughout the night, and when I do sleep, I've been having probably the most vivid nightmares I've ever had in my life. I've had sleep paralysis three times in my life, once where I saw this horrible gray grinning face floating on the other side of the room, and all three of those instances have just been in these past two weeks.

2901,Existing-Dream-2414,1636957775,1,"My whole life seems to have just been a tragedy. I have zero reasons left to live.

My birth mother was a returned orphaned who never graduated middle-school. She dropped out and she was raped by some thug and I’m the product of it. She put me up for adoption.

My first memory was being in a car by myself in the middle of the night and crying scared why I was alone and sitting in my own pee.

My siblings stabbed my face and later broke my leg when was 3. I just remember their laughing at my pain. Huge smiles and laughs.

Sexual assault by my brother. My brother sexual assaulted me and my sisters. I have no memories of being happy. My mother took out all her own childhood abuse on me. Telling me about how her father had beaten her with a belt, her mom had been cruel and died of brain surgery when she was 10, and gleefully saying how her first father had hung himself in the shower and her sister had found his dead body. She’d often tell stories about children who had hurt or killed themselves and I felt like she was saying that in hopes I would.

I saw my sister prevent my mom from stabbing herself with a butcher knife. My mother would constantly tell me I was ugly and stupid and basically use me to do all of the chores around the big house. I was homeschooled and only learned from what books I could find. I foolishly did everything my parents asked of me because they raised me on religion, Mormonism and I was fearful of God. 

My siblings used to take humor in my pain from locking me out of the house and beating me up. Idk why my parents often weren’t home. When they were gone I’d hide myself in a linen closet between fabrics. One time after emerging after almost a full day in the closet, my brother had been upset and was looking bullets for the shotgun. He was in the garage and I had tried to rummage quickly through fridge while he was occupied. I heard him coming back inside and so I ran underneath the table with the family dog who was also scared. I remember him pointing the gun at me and I was scared but closed my eyes and was happy because I thought I could finally die.

Since that time. I served a mission in the Mormon church and when I went back to church school I met another RM who introduced me to a relative attending the church school and who happened to be a Bishop’s son. I met him at church. I was fearful of men but she convinced me he was a good person. He didn’t try to hold my hand until after a month of going on dates. He was the first man in my 23 years of life I let myself get close to. Well he ended up being a serial rapist and had raped his younger cousins and others. He was abusive and raped and beat the hell out of me. He’d often throw dishes and items aimed at me or close to me whenever I did something he didn’t like. When I got the courage to tell my bishop instead of caring about me he first asked how many times he “had inserted his penis” and if I had orgasmed. WTF!!!!!!!! 

Second boyfriend out of college wasn’t a Mormon and after 1.5 years I saw on his phone he had never uninstalled Tinder or dating sites.

My now husband had during the first day we were dating called and messaged his exes and other girls. Had a fake name on his socials. To this day hasn’t posted a single picture of us together besides of being hidden within an album. Never wore his wedding ring. Has held the idea of having children based on if I do enough chores for him and quit work. I found out he had been married before when we went to the courthouse and the person asked if either of us had been married. He won’t ever let me look at his phone. He gets angry when I cry cause he said something cruel and says it’s my feelings. He hates my friends. He would come into the room if I ever spoke to them and ask me to mute and angrily shout about them. So I stopped calling them and I’ve never so alone.

Most recently I went back to school and he has done everything from threaten to leave me because I was studying too much right at mid-terms because not doing enough chores or things he wants of me. This has made me fearful of not being able to pay for university and being able to live as he keeps spending money our savings our low even while I’ve pleaded with him to stop. 

Tonight I was contacted by my adoption agency about my birth mother. She was just placed in hospice. When I can home crying home from a devotional (he’s not a member) the first thing he asked was for me to go outside because he didn’t want the people that we share a wall with to hear me cry. He then marched me around the neighborhood with his only question being how he can get tickets since there’s a quarantine and telling me it’s my fault I’m upset and that it’s very bad for me to cry inside the house as well as a waste of time.

Previously, my adoption agency had contacted me before about my mother being ill in general. We were iAbroad at the time visiting his family. I begged him to let me go see her and while I was trying to call the hospital where she was at he kept angrily telling me to be quiet and hurry up while I had the volume as low as possible and was quietly crying. He kept making annoyed noises and growling for me to be quiet and stop talking. It hurt me so deeply. In the end because of the language barrier and his cruelty I just became silent. I tried to find the hospital where she was at later but never got a response. Since that time I’ve had such a huge burden that I wasn’t there when she died and she must have died alone. It’s been my biggest regret in my life and something I’ve thought about every day.

I was so emotional knowing that she was alive tonight. It just hurt me so much he asked me to go outside instantly and walk around the neighborhood. I tried to quietly sob because of the embarrassment of walking in front of neighbors houses.

Life has been absolute shit since I can remember and I just don’t see the point in living. How I see it if there is a God he has favorites and the rest don’t have a chance. I want to kill myself but I don’t want to live eternally or because I kill myself end up in an even more worse hall than this. I just want to not exist at all. I’ve done as much I can to help others, especially have tried a lot recently and am wondering if there’s perhaps a threshold where you’ve done enough good I can kill myself and God won’t punish me.

2940,Away_Tone5591,1636941493,1,"I guess I deal with some form of seasonal depression, but pretty much November through January are always so rough for me.  I really don’t like the holidays, they just add to it.  I have a good family situation, we get together, everyone gets along and it’s 95% good.  I’ve had some really good moments and interactions with some family this year inparticular and I am very grateful for that.  I think some family members have been more….involved after they found out about my suicide attempt 2 years ago but they also respected me not wanting to talk about it (except for my dad).

But despite that, I can’t stand the holidays.  I’m 28 and never once had anyone special to share the days with.  The few girlfriends I’ve had never lasted very long and the one that I was seeing around holidays one year my family didn’t know about (there was a significant age gap that would’ve caused some drama) and I wasn’t able to bring her around for any of the family stuff.

There’s 2 women I’ve had in my life for quite awhile and I consider them both very dear friends.  I’ve also asked them both out, every time getting rejected but thankfully they were both respectful of my feelings and didn’t make a big deal about it.  But I’m very certain they both know feelings are still there.  One of them got a boyfriend recently so I know she’s obviously not interested in anything.  Maybe down the road….

It sucks because they’re both amazing people I have great connections with.  And I’ve been told by mutual friends that we’d make a great couple (one of them was actually the sister of the friend with the new boyfriend).  To make it easier I’ve had to convince myself they’ll be better off in the long run with someone else.  The one with a boyfriend and I click amazingly but we also want different things in life.  She isn’t looking to get married, wants to live in the woods, just different wants I feel I would hinder.  The single one….would literally be perfect.  I’m involved in all her family stuff, they all like me (even included my birthday in a joint birthday party for her dad and niece), we think the same on a lot of things.  She’s likely going to be moving away for awhile while she finishes getting her pharmaceutical degree and I hate knowing she’ll be gone for likely a year, maybe longer.  Might not come back.

But as the last year of school came by, and everyone was turning 18, my friends started getting into smoking weed/hash etc. I wasn’t against it at all and indulged into it myself a few times but was never addicted to it nor was I fascinated by it. 
This was a big turning point in my life, as things started to gradually change because whenever I met any of my friends, all they wanted to do was smoke up and get high, although this happened slowly.

I wasn’t a big fan of doing that and mostly declined to take a hit, and slowly I could see my friends started to get distant. I’m not financially well off (and I don’t dance) so I didn’t attend a lot of parties, or go to fancy lunches and dinners either which further distanced my friends from me. 

No one really said anything to me that indicated they don’t like me or anything of that sort but you can just tell when you don’t matter to people anymore. I was deeply saddened and affected by having no friends, and as school ended, we all went to college in different cities and I found new friends and was extremely happy and everything was going well.

And then came along the Covid-19 pandemic, and we were all back to our hometown. I got back into touch with my friends and I saw that their marijuana addiction (I don’t know if addiction is the right word) reached an all time high. It was like everyone only met to smoke up and get high.

I started meeting them less and less because no one ever called me or asked me to meet them, and whenever I called, they’d say “oh I’m out right now with xyz or abc”, “sure man let’s make a plan tomorrow evening” and they’d never call back. They are always out smoking up, or about to smoke up. 


And it’s just gotten worse ever since, some of my closest friends that I’ve known ever since I was 3-4 years old never call me or text me, if I don’t call them even for 2-3 months, they never contact me. Recently an important chapter of my life started and I called my friends to come meet me, but they didn’t, and I kept calling but they didn’t pick up and never called back.

This really shook me, as I realised I don’t have a single person I can call my friend in my own hometown, where I was born and have lived all of my life.

I really miss the days when I had friends, when no one even knew what being intoxicated was like, when no one knew what partying was, when no one knew what money was, when we were all kids.",lonely,I’ve lost all of my friends and have no one to talk to (M20),2021-11-15 09:45:05
2967,SpaceisSoooCoool,1636929422,1,"I'll start with saying that I'm horrible at making friends, I used to be somewhat good at talking to others and content being by myself (I'm rather introvert and still working on my anxieties) but it seems like lately, everyone had it all figured out and I've just been left behind to try and climb out of this dark slippery hole with no rope or ladder. Everywhere I look, people have others crowded around them, they have friends. People to fall back on, people they can trust to catch them. And I sit by myself, knowing that if I try and start a conversation with someone that I won't know how to continue it, and I'll lose that person. They'll become disinterested. I do however have 1 bestfriend, but we don't even hang out that much anymore. She's busy with theater rehearsals and travel. I know I can't blame her cause senior year is taking up a lot of everyone's time, but I just can't stop this anger in my heart, knowing I stay at home all day after school and have NOBODY to talk to except her, and I can't even do that cause she has other people. 

I hate this side of myself, I know I should be happy for her, and a part of me is. But that's the small percent, the other percent is secretly infuriated, confused by her words not matching up with her actions. ""We're gonna have a good time, don't worry!"" Okay, then why is it that the moment your other friends show up, I'm completely ignored and left behind as you all skip off to hang out and talk somewhere else? Nobody cares how I'm doing, I'm just the quiet one in the group that gets talked over the moment I try to speak. 

""I care about you, of course I have other friends but like, you matter to me a lot you know?"" Alright, then why do I constantly get left on read all throughout the day for like 8 hours? I don't even text you that much anymore cause I know you have other things you're doing, and I don't wish to be a bother, but please...atleast try to remember that I exist..I'm still here doing nothing, I always have free time. Nobody else is waiting for me. 

It hurts when you tell me you don't think you have friends when everytime I see you, you always have someone to talk to, someone who knows you, someone who's happy to see you, someone who remembers your name, who hugs you, who enjoys having you around, as you guys go about your little inside jokes as I stand there smiling my fake broken smile, questioning how someone like you could brush all these connections I'm seeing right now with my very own eyes off when I say ""Yes, you have plenty of friends"" 

Just today, I got a text from her saying she'd be at rehearsal until 10pm. She sent me a selfie of her smiling, making silly faces with her friends behind her happy and laughing. My heart sunk. Why is it that you claim you have no healthy social life, and I'm witnessing this right now? I've done nothing all weekend and have nobody but myself, but you have all these people around you. And I'm so angry, I want love, I want attention after being so starved of it. I want someone to ask me how I've been. I want someone to be interested in what I'm feeling and doing. It's not fair....I've tried so hard and have gotten nothing. Everyone's too busy for me, but they have time for everyone else. I don't want to be angry, but I can't stop that nagging little gremlin in the back of my mind saying ""I hope everything you've gained crumbles down to the ground so you can feel my pain"" 

I've been told I love deeply, and I do, but I'm also highly sensitive and that means when I finally get impatient waiting for someone to care, it hits like a semi truck speeding down the road. And I'm trying to stop it from crashing into everyone else. They don't deserve that...they're innocent. I'm battling myself right now, and she's a lot stronger that I thought...she's been neglected too long. I'm trying to comfort her as much as I can but I don't know how much longer until she manages to overpower me.

Ive been striped down little. by little ever since I was a child. From being manipulated by my mother, forced to raise my siblings, and living with a drunk step father. No amount of physical abuse (which I am lucky enough to not have received but I know many others didn't share the same grace) can amount to the absolute destruction of my mental health that happened to me. I am 21 years old and am left with such a broken mind. All I have ever wished for and cried many tears over are one of the few things in this world that costs no money and every single person can contribute. Support, Love, Attention, and Affection. These are vital when raising a child and yet I was robbed of every single one of them by my parents. No amount of money could every buy these priceless gifts. We are taught that all parents love their children and will do anything to give them the world. But that is simply not true in any way shape or form. The reason why I am alone today and feel so beaten down and depressed is due to the absence of those emotions. I am selfless and would give my life for a random stranger yet I am not worthy enough to receive the simple support, love, attention, and affection from my own parents. They used to warn me about strangers because they could be dangerous. Yet they are the ones who have done the most harm to me that I have ever experienced. They have shaped my personality, emotions, contributed to my depression and still think I owe them my life. To this day I have not been able to have a loving relationship because of how many guards I put up to protect myself. Not letting anyone in to hurt me like I've already have. And the other side of that same coin I am dying of loneliness. I cry myself to sleep almost every night because I wish there was someone who loved me and I could depend on just for once in my life. Im so deprived of real emotions I have to watch sad videos to make myself cry so that I can experience a real emotion that I know so well. Sorrow and sadness are the only things I know to be true. I hate this about myself and all I want to do is live my life and experience happiness. But it feels like an anchor that's wrapped around my neck that pulls me down no matter how many times I try to escape it. All I need is a glimmer of hope and that even seems to be to much to ask for. Ive already given up on my parents and no longer let them influence me but the scars left on my mind can never be erased. Where do I go from here? How do I find someone who will actually love me?

2979,Emotionalblackhole91,1636928076,1,"So for the past few days I've been talking to someone who I thought wanted to be with me, there was mutual attraction in the past but things never really got serious.  We were talking about the past and she was asking a lot of questions about why certain things happened etc and I was as honest as I could be (generally I struggle to find the right words to adaquetly express what's going through my head).  Anyway the following day we were talking again and she seemed distant so I left her to it.  She messaged me later and we got talking again but she seemed to fall into some strange state of self depreciation and long story short said it wouldn't matter if we got together because she thinks I would grow bored of her.  I asked her what she meant as she said it doesn't matter so I continued and she told me that we had spoken about it before.  After some more back and forth she admitted it was because she didn't think she would be able to keep up with me in the bedroom and I honestly didn't know what to say.  Ill admit I have a high libido and like to experiment but nothing to the point where it would be considered an issue.  So now in sat at home without a clue how to move forward or deal with this, especially since some of the things she has mentioned in the past are things she now considers off putting.  What the hell do I do? Is there anything I can do? Why do double standards exist? I kind of just need to vent to be right honest.

TL;DR :- I got rejected by a women for my high libido and willingness to experiment because she thinks I will grow bored of her despite her admitting to similar things in the past",lonely,Turned down,2021-11-15 09:14:36
2980,memories_torn_apart,1636927980,1,"Almost anytime I talk with someone non-family, and they’re being somehow *excessively* nice, there’s a lingering feeling at the back of my head that just whispers, “they pity you.” And I really don’t know if it’s just the social anxiety talking or something genuine. 

I have to reveal my age now for the rest to make sense—I’m 17, and in school I have a bit of a reputation as a loner. I’ve never really had friends throughout high school whatsoever, so I don’t really speak to peers except in the context of like, projects and that sort of thing. And I’ve not helped myself, being an awkward wreck. At this point, I’m good with it, and this is my last year anyways, so whatever. However I’ve noticed especially in the last year a certain *something* whenever some people talk to me. Maybe it’s just people being polite, or hell it’s honestly just how people act when nice, but none of it sits right with me. I couldn’t describe it other than ‘excessive decency’, if that makes sense. It’s better than the alternative FOR SURE, but it can occasion just make me feel weird, like I’m making them uncomfortable with my presence. That I’m not being taken seriously, or at least with a heavy grain of salt.

One incident that just scars me is from last year, when I was just sitting alone in a corner minding my business, relaxing a bit, after a test. Suddenly I see in the corner of my eye a couple talking, and the girl points in my direction, and then just walks her way over, makes very awkward and quick small talk, in a faux cheerful voice, and then just walks away. I wasn’t conscious of the fact that I was alone until then, and honestly that felt worse than if I was just left alone—even if that seems rude of me. I remember hearing once in 9th grade from a class acquaintance that a few kids said I was autistic or just ‘special’ because I sat alone so much—I brushed it off, but it eats at me from time to time that that is the reputation most people seem to have of me in my graduating class. 

Even in some teachers I notice this habit. I remember having a ‘conversation’ with a teacher from last year who just spoke to me like I was actively suicidal/depressed, it being a lecture about how much better college will be and how I’ll meet tons of people there and how I’ll “connect” more there—I thanked her for her time and then politely left and just sat down with my hand over my mouth, wondering if that’s *really* the vibe I give off.

It pains me that I’ll never really know, because I can’t just ask someone, “Hey do you think of me as a lesser person?”—though God I sometimes feel like it. Sometimes I just overhear conversations, and the way they speak to each other is not the way to speak to me—or is it? This leads to the issue of maybe I’m just socially paranoid, and consumed by anxiety to the point that I interpret basic kindness as condescension—which just makes me a petulant asshole. Frustrating.

Whatever the case, I’m out of here by next year and maybe college will be better, but knowing myself that’ll take some effort.

Last night we had a work party and we were both headed to another party the next town over as my friends were there and I went on the off chance that something might happen again between us. I ended up in the same taxi as him and he ignored me the whole way and rushed trying to get out of the car. That upset me. Today he was all chat to me at work. I planned on ignoring him but I couldn’t.

I've been to the emergency room before after bleeding for over a month (thanks to *one* Depo shot I took early on this year in the hope it would help me). I have no one to talk to about this. No friends. No SO. No hugs or any words of comfort from anyone. Just me writhing in bed sobbing into my pillow.

My doctor is useless. My gynecologists would suggest another form of birth control that is either ineffective or exacerbates the pain and bleeding.

It feels like there's a barrier between me and the world. No matter what I do, I always end up at the same place. I'm trapped in a box I can't get out of. 

I'm currently a student, when I try to go and talk to people, It always stops at the ""formal / professional"" part. I don't get it, in three months, my classmates all look like they've been friends for years while I'm still a stranger to everyone. I'm trying to be friendly, to go towards people even if I'm not good at it, but it doesn't look like it matters.

It it not better on the family side, my relatives always hated me for some reason. Now that I'm 18, I'm completely on my own.

I'm used to be alone, but when I see the others, I feel like I'm wasting my youth, and there's nothing I can do.

Whenever I see people being good friends or more, it reminds me that'll never happen to me, it makes my heart contracts and burn, sometimes so much that i'm starting to have trouble breathing.

I hate bothering people, now it just feels like my sole presence is a disturbance and I hate it, I hate myself for being that way, and that also hurts.

I don't get what's wrong with me, and no one will tell me what it is. It drives me crazy not knowing what's wrong.

3014,WhateverItWasILostIt,1636914291,1,"I () have recently started talking to a guy (19M) I was friends with months ago, but due to us both both being in bad situations we would constantly argue and it was a mess, so we just ended up cutting contact on a bad note. Now around eight months later we’re both in much better positions, and so I reached out to him. It started off pretty good, like the nice times we first had before it turned to shit, we were having fun conversations, meeting up for lunch and coffee, and just enjoying one another. Recently though, he’s suddenly grown completely cold, he’s not interested in me. He’ll ghost me for days at a time, then say he only did it because he felt I was ignoring him, even though I told him I was busy with work, I’ll offer to meet up when we have days off, only for him to say he’d rather stay home and play Xbox, it’s so humiliating. 

I’ve confronted him about it several times but he won’t take accountability for it and says he’s only like that because ‘I’m the one who doesn’t care’, though unlike him I’m the only one who’s wanting to talk and meet up, who tries texting on my lunch breaks and basically any free time I have only to be left on read. I said before l felt it wasn’t working out and expressed how I feel he doesn’t care about me, and that we should just stop talking altogether as it’s making me feel like shit being ignored and stood up all the time. He just manipulates the situation though, says I’m the one that’s giving up on creating a ‘genuine friendship together’ and He’s the only one who wants to keep it going. That frustrates me so much, it’s all fair and well saying that when you don’t do a damn thing to keep the friendship going. 

Makes me feel like crap. I don’t have many people in my life to talk to, and I’m really trying with him, only to constantly be pushed away, and I have no idea why. I text him nice things to show I appreciate talking and I’d like to do it more, I invite him out to do things, I even visit him at his work as he wanted me to. Never does he do these things though. It starts to feel more like a mental drain, I find it really hard to keep my feelings to myself so I do lay it on the line when I feel it’s necessary, but again it goes nowhere as suddenly I’m the one who puts no effort in and doesn’t care about staying friends. What are you even supposed to do or say at that point. If I do and say nice things they go unnoticed, if I don’t he grows even colder and blames it on me ‘being mean’. We’ve had the conversation several times about cutting contact, all of a sudden he’s up in arms about staying friends, but that’s he’s ‘not going to beg for me to stay in his life and it’s my loss if I walk away’, so I try and convey that it’s not what I want, I’m just unhappy with how I’m being treated, only for him to say he wants to go as I’m the one making him feel drained and he doesn’t feel like talking. So nothing ever gets resolved. For example a few days ago I mentioned getting Christmas presents for one another, he said he wasn’t sure and that we might not be friends by then. I questioned him on that and was hurt he’d feel that way, I simply told him that with an attitude like that it’s unlikely we would be friends by then, only for him to take huge offence and act like I was the one who said we wouldn’t stay friends in the first place.

 
So fucking confusing. When we used to talk months ago he couldn’t be more enthusiastic and eager to talk, it was almost smothering. Now it’s the exact opposite, I keep hoping it’ll change but nope, gets worse, like he’s had a complete 180 personality change, but kept all the familiar bad traits. I don’t know what I expect others to say, maybe some nice words and to know I’m not alone, it’s very confusing and hurtful, especially when it’s hard enough making friends in the first place for me.

3020,PresFit,1636909870,1,"TW: Covid, and Loss of a family member.

Theres been a uprise in covid in America as some people know, and because of this, my family caught it. First my brother, (16) then my father, (49), me, (13), mother, (51), and my grandfather, (93). We all quarantined in separate rooms. So I never got to see anyone often. Anyway, I would like to get to the point. My father and grandfather passed away. And a few days later, it was my dads birthday. His 50th. But I always remember something he told me one night. He checked my temperature, and I was uncomfortable. But he said, “You will be okay.”  To comfort me. Those where his last words to me.   
It‘s been hard. And I wanted to share it online. But I didn’t know where since people make fun of my situation. So I figured this would be the best way to share it.   


It‘s okay to feel sad or lonely sometimes. We just can’t camp or swim in that emotional rage every time. If you are struggling with loss, I would like to help others out. You are not alone. Even when it feels like the road is empty. I struggle with that to.

 Hopefully you guys, gals, whatever you identify as, are safe and have a better day. Take care.",lonely,Grief and Mourning,2021-11-15 04:11:10

When she died it was hard for me to even get out of the bed during the holidays because that sinking feeling of not following my usual routine of going over to her house in the evening was now gone.

However, since the breakup I've been trying to fill my time. I find it hard - there's a severe lack of company because most of my friends are in relationships. I have to do almost all the reaching out. I'm often tired.

Added to that, we are now in a semi-lockdown so can't do things in the evening. Even when we could, I have severe anxiety about COVID-19 so don't like to take too many risks.

I go running regularly and do yoga. I read all the time and play piano. When I'm tired, I watch Netflix.

Ive been unpartnered my whole life and I’ve resigned to the fact that I may be alone forever. Physically, I’m not unattractive but not super attractive either. I used to be overweight but now I am a fit goddess. When I was younger, I experienced a lot of verbal abuse from my parents and family that affected me. I believe I was just born extra emotionally sensitive. 

I feel like guys are initially attracted to me physically, but once they realize my social skills are awry, they bail or try to just use me physically. I think even some girls would like to be my friend due to my appearance but then realize I am incapable of emotional connections so no real friendships amount. 

I want cuddles and sex but don’t want them without a relationship. I feel like I’m wasting the best years of my life and body by abstaining from it. I feel like I could get it easily if I wanted to but I don’t want to feel used. 

I don’t know if it’s normal or if it’s because of my upbringing but touch really turns me on. I’m not used to getting touch as part of my upbringing. I want to cuddle only with a guy, and I’m considering one of my male friends (honestly tho I don’t have a lot to begin with, I have like 2 male friends) but once I get touched, I get really horny. Like I seem timid, shy, prim and proper, rarely using profane language but then I transform and you’d be surprised what comes out of my mouth. I really feel like a demon has taken over at that point. Do you girls experience this too? Maybe it’s just a normal thing for everyone but I feel odd because horniness is demonized for ladies. 

What do you guys think I should do? Maybe I should try dating? Dating sites are exhausting and I’m easily overwhelmed and tired, I just give up. I just enjoy my alone time a lot at the same time. On paper, I don’t seem too bad but I guess my social ineptitude is a turn off. I’m not too old yet, I’ve already bought a house and don’t have to work 2 jobs. Maybe I should get a dog or cat or some other pet? I already have a low maintenance pet, but I can’t cuddle him at this point but hopefully I can in the future.

I started going to college partly in the hope that I could make friends but I haven't yet and the semester is nearly over. I talk to people but it's mostly greetings and small talk like ""how was your weekend""? I still haven't been able to get over that hump where I can ask someone for their contact information. I think part of the reason it's awkward is because I see some of these people only once or twice a week so they still feel like strangers to me. In high school I'd have 5 days a week to get to know someone and by the time we finally exchanged contact info we were already good friends.

College itself has taken up a lot of my time and helped fill the void but whenever I'm bored or when I can't sleep that's really when the loneliness hits me like a truck. It's a vicious cycle. The loneliness causes symptoms of depression which in turn just makes me not want to do anything but stay in my room and sleep. Since I don't want to leave my room I just end up being even more lonely. I really try my hardest not to think about it and stay stoic but sometimes I just can't help it. Especially recently. I'll have vivid dreams about old friends or girlfriends and be completely obliterated when I wake up. I'll see couples or a group of friends out and about and it'll just remind me of how lonely I am.

I read up about my MBTI (I'm an INFP). According to 16personalities,

""because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.""

Not sure if this is the case for all INFPs but I know for damn well sure that this is how I feel.

Most of my friends seem to glide through the dating scene smoothly, but I can't even summon the interest to talk to most of the girls around me who are seemingly available. I wanna have a girl with me, but.. rarely do I ever find a girl that legitimately piques my interest... 

and rarely do I ever find a girl that can actually understand me...

Could it be possible that my friends just have lower standards in dating? am I just a weirdo that nobody understands?

I know I have game, maybe I'm just unlucky cuz the girls I  meet bore the shit out of me.

I usually get interested in a hobby like then use up all my free time for like 3 weeks then just stop and get bored. And here’s when I fall into the drought and misery. Every time I think I get better. She just pops back in my head. She was my everything.

I’m glad we broke up but like I used to feel something that isn’t there anymore and no matter how much I try to stay focused and happy. Things just get worse. 

If you read this far thank you. I appreciate your time.

3056,OceanBlu1,1636882131,1,"Haven't been helping at home due to depression and not caring, so i have to go, I understand. But i  have no where to go to unless its a group home or I can live with someone that loves me but I dont have that I try. And try. I get interviews yet I have such problems. anxiety and agoraphobia (fear of being out the house) is something i had even when i was a kid. 

   When I was in school I hid in the bathroom, stuffing tissues under my arms  since my shirt was drenched from constant fear and anxiety. Sometimes I hid there and the councilor would have to force me out. I was heavily bullied  because I was not only so sweaty but smelled as well because of it. So in Highschool I homeschooled and i became more of a shut in.

   I am a F up as my family doesn't respect me and i understand. I dont even shower and put on clean clothes on a consistent basis. I dont leave my room unless im hungry and i  lay back in bed, falling asleep again. If I have to do something, i either do it scared or not at all. I have no friends and im feeling suicidal, but I searched pictures of aftermaths and I dont want it to be me. But im afraid at the right moment I will just do it. Constant thinking mind rushing I can't take this its exhausting. 

  There is no therapy available I try to find but everywhere is so full due to pandemic all the sudden everyone needs therapy. I cant even talk about it to my family they will just say *oh well i cant feel sympathy for you, you lay in bed all day and blah blah* like i dont want sympathy but they dont understand and they want me out now.

3064,genericreddituser89,1636877208,1,"I’m 26. I’m your pretty basic, run of the mill, white guy. It’s just me and my dog, who I love dearly. For three years I worked in professional sports to live out a dream. I traveled with teams, had playoff celebrations, the whole deal. I left that life. The travel was excruciating. I had to move every 8 months. Pay capped out at $12-15 an hour. 

I was unemployed and alone during the entire Covid peak. I got a job last June in sports. It’s more 9-5, different business segment. I’m in school for data science to transition to more pay in a year and a half. My life just feels empty. Now that I’m not moving every 8 months, it’s apparent how empty my life is. No friends. Family far away. And as much as I love my small family, I have no friends. Nobody texts or calls. I deal with an identity crisis daily. Why do I wear all this sports stuff? I don’t even watch sports anymore. Who am I? 

What do I do? I don’t know how to swim. I don’t know how to play pool. I can’t dance. I haven’t been on a date in 3 years. Dating apps destroy my confidence and make me lose all hope in human decency. Who am I? Every weekend I lay in bed. Depressed. I play lots of video games to jump into worlds and escape my own reality. There’s no thrills. My dog’s separation anxiety is a built in excuse to never leave my thin walled apartment. Why bother? 

I’m 5’9. I’ve always struggled with my weight. I’m not fat, but I’m not thin. I’ve had love handle problems since I was in high school. I routinely tie ropes around my stomach to hold it in. I hate my body. But I’m inconsistent. I start/stop/start/stop which leads to injury. I just had to sit out a month with a stress fracture scare. Why am I doing this?  Deep down who the fuck am I? 

On the surface, I’m this hard-nosed, cynical, self-deprecating northerner. I go hard until I burn out. I’m burnt out. Who would I rather be? The opposite. I’d rather be just this completely yogic/meditative person. I want to be loose. I want to be comfortable in my body. I want to have fun. I want to wear more vibrant colors. I want to drop all the sports shit. There’s this yoga studio near me that does all these events where there’s tons of people. Why do I have to be this cynical beat up asshole as a defensive mechanism. 

And it’s not just a yoga thing. Or whatever. That’s just an example. It’s everything. I fucking hate myself. Days are moving. Time is passing. How many fucking days will be in bed? How many nights will I sleep in hoodies or tie ropes around my stomach due to discomfort? How many days of my dog’s life are passing without me living it with him? I’m fucking dying. Daily. Then tonight I watch this wrestling show. There’s these people who’re my age. Great shape, doing cool things with their bodies. Why the fuck didn’t I try this? Why is my life so plain? Is no one ever gonna care about me? I feel like being acknowledged by this big crowd is something that screams to me. Because my existence feels so worthless.

This is all circles and a rant. Idk the meaning or reason. Each day I do nothing. I know no one. My depression is so strong I can’t fucking move. I can’t fucking see the point. People keep fucking telling me to go out and do shit. Think it’s easy? Wear something nice? Think it’s easy to sit down with all these ropes tied around me to keep my stomach okay? I have to be stonefaced and strong for people. I don’t have much in life. 4 family members. I need to be a rock. Cold and unfeeling. I have to be a constant. Yet I feel fucking hollow. My life’s reaching a point where things once possible now aren’t. I feel fucking fat. I feel empty. I feel there’s no point in going on. Why can’t I transform and become a radically different thing? I don’t even know who I am or who I should be. Im fucking confused. I want to be something special. I don’t want to die as a blip that not a single person will remember or care about when I do die. Im too much of a coward to kill myself. Killing my self  feels like the only way I’ll be remembered. My death would have to be shocking and sudden to impact anyone, and it’d only be negatively. The fuck is wrong with me? I see these beautiful people on my tv my age who did this. And here’s me. Average white guy who’s doing grad school and work and tired every day, not leaving bed every day, not feeling okay with myself and no like minded community. The fuck do i do.

I was wishing that someone just for a few minutes felt what it is to be far from everyone seeing they having a good time and wanting to reach someone to have a good time too but you can't because it seems like you have a anchor in your ankle holding you back

I have anxiety so when a couple looked at my direction and started to point at me and talk, i felt that i would just pass out right in that bench but somehow i just started walking back to home, after 10 minutes my dad enter my room and ask why i just left, i said that i forgot to do a homework and i needed to finish today. I really hate to talk about my problems with my parents or any close person i have, so when something like this happen i just try to get over it in my mind

I really hate to be like this but i just can't stop and act like a more extroverted person

Of course this goes unnoticed by my “friends,” but I didn’t blame them, people are too busy with their lives to notice.

Then my grandfather passed, and this was probably the worst moment of my life. My “friends” are aware, but besides the initial condolences via WhatsApp, no one reached out to me to see if I was okay. My mom flew out to deal with funeral arrangements, I stayed behind to take care of the house, construction and my dogs. It’s been almost 2 months now and still nothing. I’ve been absolutely alone; no friends, no girlfriend. No one to actually be there for me in my time of need.

I knew my birthday was coming up, but I tried to avoid looking at the calendar, so that I wouldn’t know which day it fell on.

I lived in one city for most of my life, and made tons of friends and people I was happy with. Last year I  moved really far from them, and two months ago, away from that place as well. My parents have always told me that life moves on and I have accepted that fact. It just doesn't make me feel much better. I know I'll get used to it eventually, but everyone else at my school has known each other for years and I feel left out. It's not that I'm having difficulty making friends; I get along and can kind of talk to most of the class, but that's it. So far I've found only four (maybe five?) people actively engaging with me.

Friend 'Y' is barely ever at school, and I don't think she trust us enough to tell us exactly why. Which is fine. Everyone is entitled to their secrets. It's just really quiet someday without she.

Friend 'I' is one of the people I best get along, and one of my first ever male friends as well. But I know that him trying to cheat off my tests aren't good so I don't hang with him too much either.

Friend 'H' is a really good listener, and so I can tell her most of my problems without worrying too much. But she's in another class, and a year younger than me, and I'm moving onto high school next year, so I won't be able to see her as much after.

Friend 'A' is nice. She listens to me, but I don't feel as comfortable around her. My mom saw her once and though she was the perfect example of someone following our religion, and now my mom keeps on pestering and comparing me to her. 'A' also happens to be homophobic/anti-LGBTQ+, which is something that made me feel very awkward around her considering I'm a bisexual. And I can't tell really tell anyone because she never does anything very anti-LBGTQ+, since she knows that if she does, they will call her a homophobe. But she's so undeniably clingy, that she's still with me.

Friend 'N' is probably my favourite. She's has a sense of humor, and she engages in my mini rants about books and Tv shows. But she's also a year younger than me, so I won't see her much when I leave for high school.

All the friends I've made have been set from to the start to last long and it makes me upset. Even though I have the contacts of my old friends, we barely text or call unless its a special occassion. I usually have something to distract myself with, but I have nothing to do, and I just had this on my chest for a long time. And I can't really trust my sister with anything too big, since she's one of the biggest snitches on the planet. Plus with my parents on my back 'cause of high school next year, it's just piling.

Although it’s my own fault for forgiving them once already for doing the exact same thing after begging me to forgive them. I’m genuinely tired of the constant betrayal and lack of consideration for my own feelings. It’s like people get everything they need out of me and then kick me to the side when they’re doing good.

3140,PateticoFallito,1636852159,1,"21M here. Social rant incoming. I’m writing this to let off steam. Friendly reminder that my life is much worse than it seems: health problems, financial problems, and so on... but I will not dwell on this in this thread.

The last Saturday night I went out was 3 years ago. I had broken up with my ex-girlfriend and my friend group had long since been ruined (for other reasons, not my fault). I found myself alone like a dog: no GF, no Friends. Nothing. Literally nothing.

I REALLY found myself on my own. Which means for 3 years I only went out a couple of times with a couple of friends and that's it. If I hadn't started university I would have been in effect a NEET Hikikomori. So I started university and met people. 

As much as I tried to be likeable, despite being introverted, I didn't get great results. I make people laugh and smile but apparently this is not enough. 

Let's get to the point: after 3 years at home I strengthened myself and asked these university colleagues to go out with them and they accepted. I was surrounded by many people but in truth I felt alone the whole time, despite laughing and joking. 

But the most painful part was towards the end of the day: my colleagues' girlfriends also arrived. ALL ENGAGED except me. I felt embarrassed. I ran to the bathroom and washed my face because I was dying inside. I spent the rest of the evening a little quiet and nobody gave a damn. After a while I said goodbye to everyone and left. Now I'm on the bed and I feel terrible.

I tried to get out of the comfort zone, to ""dare"", I tried to get involved to improve the situation. What I got was just further depression that knocked me down even more. Being engaged is not the problem: being alone and having no one to talk to IS THE PROBLEM, no one to confide in...

a few days after my birthday the same person invited me to a ""party for me"" i was reluctant but i said sure whatever. we are there starting to drink and i hear a girl half scream ""you can't do that to him""
she explained in that moment that the person who was throwing the party was gonna spike my drink with xanax which, is something you need a prescription for. she could have killed me if she had did it. after that night i didn't really talk with that person at all after another party.(also i know i sound like a jock but i only went to get alcohol because i was going through alot and i usually hate parties) 

that person has had a crush on me for so long. i thought ""what the hell i might as well hear them out"" (still kind of drinking so logic isn't great) so i said we couldn't date cause she wasn't single and she was pregnant a while after i think i can't remember. she texted me saying that she was single. i said lets wait and date in secret to see if it would work. a bit goes by and it goes decent. shes a very horny person and asked to see my..thing. and i kept saying it was too early and she kept pestering me and i was pretty drunk so i did it. turns out, she never broke up with her boyfriend and turned it into i knew she was taken, and sent for no reason. and then when i got to school i was slammed against a locker and they told me to stop and all the friends turned against me and everyone started shaming me. i have been alone and sober since. and they keep saying that i just sent for no reason.(literally the first interaction we had she asked me if i was a virgin, if i had a big thing and if i liked her)

In the last seven days, I (37m) moved out of the dream home my wife (31f) and I bought, left my cat behind, temporarily moved in hours away with my family, and the officially had my marriage dissolved. We’d been continuing to live together throughout the process until it became official, and remained good friends during that time. I’d been surprised by her wanting to end things, as she’d never given any indication of being unhappy, but over the months I did find out more and more about how and why things played out like they did. She did a lot of things that elevated my already great distrust of people, and though I don’t get mad or hold grudges against people, I do create distance and guard myself against further emotional pains.

That all said, I have plenty of friends, but not really anyone I’d deem close enough that I’d feel comfortable just texting or calling them to chat about life stuff. Besides not trusting people, I also hate feeling like I’d be potentially bothering or interrupting someone by messaging them. I get messages from various friends daily, and I feel good knowing they know I’m there for them whether it’s just to BS or chat, or talk about serious stuff.

But I just feel so damn lonely and isolated, too. I held off telling more than 2 or 3 people about the marriage ending until the last day or two, and that alone was seven months of feeling like I was alone with a sad truth I couldn’t talk about. I know I could have, and didn’t out of what I thought was respect to my ex wife, but I think a part of it was also just not feeling like it’d matter or make me feel better if I did tell others.

I guess it’s all just sort of crashing down around me now just how isolated I’ve become over the past 9 years my ex and I had been together. Losing the cat, the house, the car, the routine, the life I’d had, the person I’d loved and spent years with, and now being in a situation where I’m left picking up the pieces of whoever I am now after everything that’s happened and not really having anyone I feel compelled to just chat with… It’s lonely.

When the lockdown started in my country i was preparing 
for University entrance exams so i didn't feel much affected as i wasn't into having fun with friends since i started my preparation.

But with time i suddenly felt some kind of loneliness but it was not so overwhelming as i do interacted with a few fellow students in online classes and calls discussing about studies etc. When the course was over so were the  talks. Hence i don't have any friend to talk , to express my emotions, to share out laughs , silly jokes , rants etc since feb 2021. Its just some fellow classmates who just call only when they have some problems in academics. And times were also tough as i have been experiencing too many problems in my preparations. Sometimes it feels so overwhelming when you have so many problems but just no one to talk to. I have spent nights crying for hours over my condition literally begging god to just give me some days of happiness so that i can feel what it's like to be happy, to laugh , to feel loved anything except this prolonged sadness. exams happened. Didn't score much but was able to get into a decent college just to find out that the freshman year is going to be online and scared that again those things will happen again

3228,MagicalLoveU,1636817834,1,"I used to exchange large messages with people on anime website, video game website and feel excited when they’d reply. Used to literally add everyone I’d get matched with on PS4 in online games, hoping that one person I meet will be my friend, would message me first sometimes and feel interested. None ever did. 

I used to join niche Discord servers just to realize I don’t fit in or there’s only 10-20 active people despite hundreds of members, or to get mad because of my sensitivity and insecurity. If a game I love is being trash-talked (“game A is dogshit”), I don’t like that. 

Well, at least I used to not like that. Nowadays I’m numb to anything. I barely feel anything towards my hobbies and None of it matters anymore. Devoting my time and learning a new game, experiencing it. Why? When I can just watch memes or porn and waste time doing nothing. 

The things that broke fiction and the magic of it for me: 
1. Negativity and elitism. I take things too literally and I have no shields. I believed in all I’d find online when I was younger and feel like I should pay attention and be respectful to what they say. Eventually I got bullied (high school) and now my shields are broken even more. 
But my point is that I took in a lot of negative things people said and memorized them. 
“Power fantasy” = guilt, “Edgy = bad”, “Real Man = good”, “bagged tea = bad and anyone who drinks them is a villager”, etc. 

My thoughts are overly negative and partially this is because my life has been pretty shitty and void. Still is and I can’t change that at least for the next 2 years. 

My parents taught me nothing, so I was trying to learn things by myself and in the end that made me vulnerable to outer influence. Then bullying which destroyed me. And my bullies? They live like nothing happened . They are not alone, despite being scum. 

2. Porn. 
It used to give me the feeling that somebody would like how I look. So I “believed” into it. Believed I’m the one with that hot anime waifu or husbando, believed in all anime and real life porn that I’d find. Eventually I got into porn that isn’t made for me and sort of, learned how to enjoy it, too. You know, can’t just consume the same thing over and over.

So, the porn turned all my favorite stories, worlds and characters into porn models. And I mean, is it negative to think that most people skip the story ? That most do not pay attention? I didn’t. 

So with porn I essentially turned myself out and saw why I like that or this. It exposed everything and whenever I talk to people about it, they don’t want to know.

I want to engage with my hobbies more but everything feels pointless. And I mean, it is. 

Look at the pictures of men being taken to war. Millions dead. 20 year olds. 30, 40. 

I’ll be taken to training for 1.5 year and then if the war escalated, called for fighting. Nothing will change in my life. That’s the law. And people like me? We will die first. 

If I don’t go back to my homeland where mandatory army is a thing, I’m stuck with my abusive relatives. Nobody will love me or even consider, and at this point I don’t care enough to improve myself, it always ends the same and this world is made for social people, and only them. 

With my hobbies having little to no value to me anymore, with nobody wanting to talk to me and no money for therapists or medicine, my life is over. I’m just a shell. Maybe it is the right thing to return to my homeland and be taken to war, be unpaid and do the duty of the “one lucky to have a penis”. Maybe this is just a perfect way for me to leave this world.",lonely,Socially Impaired. The Internet Used to Make Me Feel Less Lonely But Not Anymore.

This person got into a relationship and I was very happy for them even though we didn't talk as often. A few months ago I got a call from them in tears and hysterical, begging me to come get them right now (2am). They are about 30 min away so I agree and do it. Turns out their relationship had gotten very abusive. The partner put their former partner in the hospital, my friends last 2 serious relationships were also very abusive.

I spent about 2 months helping helping my friend get out of the current one after I picked them up that night (they were very consistent in saying how much they never wanted to be in that kind of situation again). Many many things happened in that time but at the end they decided to suddenly go back to them and immediately go with them traveling for business.

Since then I have only spoke to them once despite have tried to reach out many times (been about 7 months). The one time we did talk on the phone I asked why they hadn't gotten back to me in so long. I was told that it was for my own good that they aren't in my life. I didn't understand what they were talking about but when I asked they just deflected and chose to small talk like we have still been talking everyday. At the end of the call I was told they were wrong and we would talk more. Since then nothing. At all... 

I really can't tell you how hollow I feel as this was my first real friend, we were super close, and then suddenly I'm just removed from their life completely. 

At this point I just want to know what I should do with their stuff, as that is the only thing they have responded about. I just want to be done with this and having all their stuff here is just making it harder to accept I lost them. They say they want it back but when I ask when they will get it, they say the don't know when they will be back in the state.... 

So I'm just an assumed free storage unit apparently... I need advice on how to tell them they need to figure it out and come get it or find someone to come get it. 

I won't lie, due to some things that have happened over the last year I am tempted to just burn all of it and forget about it. But I have decided I don't want to be that guy, so I need help with what to do or how to tell them I won't store their stuff like a friend would if I can't be treated like a friend.

3236,sadMig_,1636812727,1,"It all starts in kindergarten. I remember going with terrible anxiety because I thought something was wrong. He spent his breaks sitting on the floor while the rest of the children played. I became just a mere observer of. Environment. And that was it until the end of kindergarten. No friends, see everyone having fun except me :/ 

In primary up to 6th grade he improved a little slightly. I made 2 friends (one because he is socially inferior to me and the others and the other was just for nothing).

The 5th and 6th year were the pinnacle. I didn't even remember what anxiety was anymore, there were moments of happiness depending on the social context...

From the 7th year onwards darkness begins. People already noticed a lot of differences between them and me. And I somehow stop being insulted and see my reputation fall back on me many times. There were social situations like for example (they stole my work and printed it for the whole class) where I just burst into tears. I went to a psychologist at ""school"" and he tells me it's normal, shyness, leaving the comfort zone,... From the 7th grade onwards, I lived with the idea of ​​leaving that school... Whenever I finished school it was a huge relief and when the holidays came it brought enormous happiness just for not walking in that torture. There was a time when the loneliness was such that I decided to accept an offer to watch over people who were smoking behind the school. I was called to the direction, etc. 
This is all just to get rid of loneliness.

My colleagues already noticed something strange about me. At birthday dinners, when he spoke in class... When I reached 9th grade my reputation no longer existed. I just wanted to go out and embark on the journey of high school

High school:
Initially I chose one school but had to go to another one just because my parents forced me to. Result: my confidence went down the drain

Only in the first few weeks did I manage to understand what it was about. So much confidence, so much expectation... That dream of having everything you wanted: social approval, girlfriend, friends, fun,...
Little did I know it was the start of another terrible journey

Whenever I didn't respond because of social anxiety and this social environment, people would label me as ""shy"" with that contemptuous voice. I spent 80-95% of my time alone. I played a lot back then so I didn't want to know more about school for nothing. I never knew anything that went on there. Teachers also saw this difference and thought it would give a ""glow up"". I preferred to stay inside the room during breaks. I just wanted to finish the 3 years because that wasn't what I expected at all.

2020-2021:
While many hated the covid. I just loved it. Being at home, without criticism, with no one to talk bad about me whenever I opened my mouth to utter a word. However, when it was over and I had to go back to school I got a ""rain of criticism"" 

A teacher tells me I'm not going to be anyone in life, my classmates question in a fucking math class the problem I had. And I didn't notice the difference because I hadn't even started this self-assessment of myself. 

Childhood friends? Even the most despised despises me. Falls into a dark pit full of shit that is literally impossible to get out of. I wanted revenge and got one against the teacher. I passed the exam, entered the university. 

I also thought the university was going to be what I thought it was. 

No no and no.


Endless loneliness, social disapproval, social anxiety, drop in university performance. Then I also found out that the difference that everyone talked about and said I didn't care about was Asperger's. Now it makes perfect sense but if I didn't know or know what difference it made? It didn't solve anything.

Because of so much stress and so much demand that I put on myself, also involving a huge perfectionism, I gained a strong ""DPDR"" (depersonalization disorder) Even my mind wanted to leave my own body. And I'm helpless here, not knowing what to do...

I thought I had gone crazy so I had already put a label that I was suffering an intolerable schizophrenia... This is because I had a strong brain fog and stopped in the emergency room. And a so-called ""psychiatrist"" with a questionable appearance diagnosed me with psychosis. If it was now I would have diagnosed her with it too. With those dark circles under her eyes and that badly washed hair, it makes me wonder what she will have too. Because of the strong dose, they diagnosed me with depression too. After thinking that this was all bullshit invented by an unprofessional psychiatry I decided to abandon the medication due to the advice of an elderly person at a herbalist.

I felt better after abandoning a cocktail of 5 medications. Within 1 month, I was already on 5 medications. Fortunately, I left all that behind. However, the problems have not disappeared. They even got worse with this dpdr that makes my memory very poor, few thoughts, not feeling emotions and questioning reality with every action I take.

I hit rock bottom at 18, now 19 recently. There is no more hope... Dreams are a way to ""trick"" my mind and think that things will get better... As I walk home alone in that darkness, I imagine my point of view of my life in this dark place. 

I'm just going to leave here everything they told me in just 2 years... 
""It won't be anyone in life"" 
""Has the family""
 ""Different goals"" 
""Strange"" 
""I don't know what his problem is"" 
""He doesn't speak ahahahah""
 ""Their parents don't look anything like him""
 ""Bye baby"" 
""He's not even ugly"" 
""Why are you like that?""
 ""It's his way""
""I don't even know him""

I don't really talk to anyone at work since they all have their own friend groups, I spend all day juggling between working on my reports and acting as a therapist to my online friends. I'm not mad that they're dumping all their problems on me, I appreciate it actually. I feel better when I know I'm helping them. But it really gets so hard sometimes when I just wanna speak to someone on a vc and no one wants to. I have spent the past month crying quietly before falling asleep because I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I try to be there for everyone and no one can even spare 5 minutes of their time to speak to me haha

It's also so disheartening to see someone who you consider a good friend and they just unadds you without responding to the last message you sent, like what was that? I have helped you through some tough times, and now that you're feeling better, you suddenly decide you don't want to be friends anymore? It's like you didn't value our friendship as much as I have. I'm just so fucking sad over this and I wish I didn't care too much about people.

Expressing oneself without the consequence of getting bashed, ridiculed, ignored, and ostracized comes so naturally other people and I’m jealous. 

I always intend to take a cautious approach to how much space I occupy: from IRL conversations, to my bodyweight, to the heighth of my text boxes in someone’s DMs, to even the frequency on everyone’s social media feeds. Since early childhood, trusted adults and peers conditioned me to believe that my existence annoys others by default. My grating voice, unslightly form, and autistic traits form an unfortunate triad that works against what’s in my mind and my heart to repulse normal people. 

Lifelong rejection made me lose my sense of self and my ability to identify my innermost personality traits as an adult. I don’t know what my interests are. I don’t know what my genuine hobbies are. I can’t tell if I’m extroverted or just pathetically lonely &amp; extremely deprived of basic social acceptance. I can’t tell if I’m introverted or just have an entrenched preconception that I won’t be accepted by others. (Alas whenever my gut told me that, it was always right.) I can’t tell if I’m actually smart or talented enough, or I just tricked everyone into thinking I’m better than I really am. 

It’s such a pitiful waste of time to worry about being loved when the predictable outcomes brace me for the inevitable. There’s no need to fret when there’s already a fixed answer for my worries. I finally reached a place where I love the skin I am in and feel at peace with myself, it’s a mournful shame that I will probably never share this with anyone else. Humans are social creatures and suffer when they are constantly denied emotional support. No amount of movies alone, meals alone, and fulfilling solo hobbies will ever override biology.

I’m tired of being so depressed every single day of my life. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder at 13 and a decade later I’m still feeling like this. It’s constant mental anguish. 

I hate myself, I hate the way I look. I’ve always been the ugly fat friend that didn’t get the time of day in real life, so now I seek it online. It’s still not enough though, I’m still unhappy. 

I feel like I have no one to go to. My boyfriend and I have such a horrible rocky relationship that it just makes me more depressed to think about. Between him in the past belittling me because of my weight, yelling at me for self harming, &amp; cheating on me for almost four consecutive years. I’m codependent, I love him, I don’t want to leave. But it makes me so sad to think about. I don’t feel good enough. 

Currently I’m bawling my eyes out, while he’s in the other room playing video games. He knows I’m going through this right now too. He left to play video games in the middle of me trying to vent. I just want someone to be here for me. I’d do anything for that. I want a hug, or even just someone to listen. I want to feel like I matter. 

Every time I’m sad he tells me I need to get help. But I am getting help. I’m on antidepressants &amp; I see a counselor every week. I use positive coping skills at home too. I haven’t been self harming on a regular basis in years, and if I have the urge I talk to the crisis hotline.

I moved away from those friends, and for years now I’ve been alone. I don’t even have online friends because I don’t know how to make them.

I’m very quiet and I guess people take that as disinterest. It also doesn’t help that where I live, Spanish is the dominant language. I can’t join in on conversations. I’m learning the language but I’m not confident at all in my speaking abilities. 

People usually stop conversations with me to go talk to others. It’s a small school and they all know each other. I feel like I’m a burden, with my boring personality and bad Spanish, and that no one actually cares about me. I didn’t used to feel this way before.

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you

3284,sunnyskies8,1636784988,1,"Ive felt, and been, alone most of my life. I am very much used to it by now. I am an only child, and my parents were never home during my whole childhood. I am now a 27F student physician 1,500k mi away from home, in LA where I don’t know too many people and school is mostly online. 

My birthday is coming up in 2 days and I invited the handful of friends that I know to the beach &amp; a couple of them said yeah but they’ll show up way later than the expected time. I would change the time but the sun sets early&amp; we’re going later in the day anyway. I cant help but get flash backs to my 9th birthday party when I invited most of my elementary school grade (50 people) and only 4 people showed up. I hated birthdays since. 

I cant help but feel sad at how lonely I am, and always have been. Im scared this will be my whole life. I wish it wasn't this way but maybe im too much of an introvert or my personality is just unlovable. Im not sure to be honest and if i knew I would try to change myself in a heartbeat. &amp; This will probably sound so sad/lame/insecure but I saw that my ex had an amazing birthday filled with all his friends and family, and I cant help but be slightly jealous. One, because he was my best friend and he wont be there this year, and also I kind of wish I had the love and support he has. Not to take that away from him of course, he deserves all of it. But i just cant help but wonder if I will ever have that in my life. Im an attractive woman who is kind and loves deeply, but no one ever really sticks around. I know I must be the problem. Im the common denominator here. I just hope one day I can have a family and people around me who love me. I truly hope. But Ive went 27 years without that, only had 1 romantic relationship, is it really going to change now?

3287,Psychological-Code-3,1636782932,1,"Sorry if this is confusing, but my brain isn't at peak performance right now.

Not going into detail, but I was abused, lied on, arrested, and ended up in a psych ward for a day only to be re-diagnosed with depressive disorder, and about to be homeless probably by Sunday. Kept my job though, so there's that.


A couple of days ago I spent some time wandering outside, across the Williamsburg bridge, not really wanting to be around anymore. I phoned my friends and told them, and there was some sympathy, but when I called back yesterday, I interrupted her cleaning and bothered her sister too early in the morning.  


My foolishness dropped us from 5 hour calls to just under two minutes without a goodbye.


I may have went too far, but the text I sent that morning was a poem that I told her I would recite for my wife if I ever got married. ""You and I"" by Rumi. It's my favorite poem. For now it's best for me to stay single.


I shouldn't have bothered them. They have their own issues, and they have so much potential with what they want to do in life. Nothing made me more happy than listening to their stories, their achievements and goals. They don't need my bullshit.


I was just scared. I should have manned up.


I'll be getting treatment for major depressive disorder on the 23rd and whatever else the doctor says I need to do, I'm out of an abusive household, and I'll hopefully get better at keeping people around soon.

Instead of posting a reddit, post on Tindr or a similar dating app. If you haven't met the one for you IRL, they may just be online. But don't rely purely on apps, go outside and interact with people. If you've been searching forever to no avail, you simply haven't been looking for long enough. If you feel lonely with no friends or aromantic, you can do the same thing but with friends! Find someone who shares your interests, because they can relate to you and support you. 

If you feel hopeless, just remember you haven't found anyone simply because the opportunity hasn't risen yet and that is just fine. If you get knocked down again and again and again, that's ok because it's better than not trying. Hell, your future partner my be in the office next to you, but you haven't gotten to know them.

Me, her and son had want I thought was a great lunch on my birthday. Less then 48 hours later she broke up with me though text. She did give me time. But I feel like she gave up on me.

Why would she let me spend some mush time with her son. Who I got attached to. And was planning talking to her about getting more involved in his life.

The reason she gave me was because never we sex. It’s was new to me. Because yes I’m still a virgin. She was aware after we tried the first time. But I could not get out of my head/way and just let it happen. If she would have said something I would have been more “hands” on. She did not feel good a lot. So I did not want to push it.

I absolutely despise the fact I can remember that old sharp pain upon the glance of their faces, like glaring into the sun in it's blinding dawn light. And In the blindness I see glimpses of bitter memories untold kept within me, reignited once more. I can remember that old winter holiday a while ago, it was under that waning night sky I realized the odds are truly in favor of my madness and self-extinction, it was the night the year came to an end, and so died the last glimmer of faith in my soul, for myself, and for others. I questioned if I should disembark from this dread through the graceful embrace of death, or to tread forth in this museum of my life and create more hollow artifacts of my sorrow to add to the story of my irrelevant shell of an existence. I do not hold anyone to account for not reading my thoughts or emotions. We all have our own worlds within, and I do not expect others to see mine. But I cannot help but feel a particular hatred for these people that I  consider ""family"" and ""folk"". Always feign in ignorance to the dark well I resided in when I was within their presence, no matter how many blood-curling cries for aid and salvation I exerted, nothing would come to my respite, I would continue to fall further into the hole, further into bitterness, further into hatred and lunacy. I never saw a hand reach down that bottomless well. Maybe because it was too dark for me to see it, or there wasn't anybody there at all. But the fact is that my dreadful experiences have desensitized me to respecting humanity, and God forbid the humble stranger cross my sight, I cannot even bear my own, for I am alienated by my own sense of self and belonging. Hardened by lost time, I have no faith left. For most it was a holy night, on that holiday, but for me though: it was yet another  marker of despair. It is this very barrier that separates me from others. That while others are blanketed in escapism through the cycles of time, be it through reunions and jolly events of gathering, I am fully exposed to freeze over, only ever seeing the abyss, and I can no longer bear it. I have grown sick of dreaming of a better world, where all that is sacred constantly reminds me of death. I have become distrustful, distant, and incapable of sharing the warmth I seek from others myself. Things I never thought I would say: ""to damnation with the tyranny of ethics, morals, and empathy!"" have become key-place in my heart. What has it ever done for me (empathy)? But betray me again and again! There is a particular artifact in this ""museum"" I mentioned. It is a painting of my deepest fears of possible futures. Fairly new to the museum, but this one horrifies me. For it seems to be enchanted with the ability to fortell fate itself. Within this rotting painting is a bitter and vile forest, many trees are affected by the decay, one in particular  has a branch broken off and left to wither away into the vast unknown. Now devoid of purpose, the branch becomes a conduit for many uses. But it's fate is grim, for lost with it within the wild was also a flaming ember, which then descends upon this lost branch, unting with it in chaos, and conjuring a flame, which inevitably becomes so grand that it engulfs the painting itself, burning away the rot and decay along with all the wilderness within, so then it is that in the ash it is reunited in oneness and purpose to the blackness of the forest by death. Death to me, so often has had a similar appeal. An appeal to the marriage of me and human community, if not on Earth, then in the darkness of sheol.",lonely,Their faces haunt me.,2021-11-13 13:53:33

I’ve been going thru a hard time and lonely so I have been talking to him about my feelings of social rejection and feeling picked on and lonely and I guess my depression pushed him away. I know he loved me intensely at one point to the point when we moved apart we stayed together crying at the last minute , but he didn’t even tell me he was moving on or seeing someone even though I speak to him frequently. We aren’t technically together so I can’t even be upset but we still have a friendship and I’ve been sharing really vulnerable stuff and trusting him openly thinking he’s never lie or hide things and we could be open and he didn’t feel comfortable telling me he doesn’t feel the same until I brought it up and he admitted he didn’t want to give me more bad news. I understand that but it means he was basically looking down on me and pitying me when he was the one person I felt close to. I had previously told him I knew we might move on and meet others and that would obviously change our relationship and so I’m so hurt and embarrassed he didn’t feel I could handle hearing when it happened .

3406,wylaxian,1636749664,1,"I’m going to die alone. I can prove it, empirically, through my online dating experiences and my social interactions.

I have never had more than one date with anyone on an online dating platform. In fact, I’ve only had one meet-up in all five years that I’ve been using tinder and hinge. I have matched with 30 people, 16 of which were bots, and 8 of which were unresponsive from the get-go. 5 of the remaining six ghosted me after 5-14 texts and responses, and the 1 remaining ghosted me after our first meeting. No warning was ever given to me before I was ghosted. No one has ever felt that I deserved more than abrupt silence.

I’ve been told by my acquaintances and colleagues that I’m “funny” and “smart” without much in the way of examples given that could support how or why I possess either of these qualities. Considering that my acquaintances and colleagues have also described most disabled, juvenile, or obviously deficient people as “funny” and “smart” without much in the way of examples given that could support how or why they possess either of those qualities, it stands to reason that my acquaintances and colleagues think that there’s something wrong with me, and their compliments are motivated by a sense of pity and obligation rather than genuine respect or admiration.

This is only further compounded by the fact that no one who’s met me in-person has ever wanted to be my friend. I’ve been excluded or ignored in every group chat or server that I’ve been invited to. People pity me and offer condolences, but they don’t want to be around me. What’s more, I’ve never received a compliment from a person of the opposite sex who did not wholeheartedly believe I was aromantic and asexual or homosexual, nor have I ever received a compliment from someone of the same sex who believed I was homosexual. I believe this is because people want to be absolutely certain that there’s no way I could interpret their kindness as flirtation.

My therapist has always been extremely nervous to speak with me about dating, and whenever I bring it up with them, they suggest that I should try to be happy with what I have, and not seek out companionship with any expectation that I‘ll find it. 

I am not hideously unattractive, nor am I especially boring or clinical; I only speak so mechanically here because I have no reason to try and impress anyone reading this. Ergo, I have reason to believe that there’s something fundamentally wrong with me that makes me entirely unlovable to anyone within my age range. This wouldn’t be a problem if not for the fact that I was somewhat recently diagnosed with cancer, and I may not live past my mid-40’s. Therefore, by the time age has withered everyone to the point where personality alone is the deciding factor of a relationship, I will likely be dead.

It was hardly a relationship it was like a friendship with a friend who treats you like shit. Cause of covid it’s so hard to meet people organically and I don’t like meeting people on dating apps. My band was offered a show recently (now that shows r back) and we got a new guitar player, our drummer (who I will call megan)has been filling in on drums in his band,so that’s how we made that connect. So I told the singer in my band (uh, sally ) that I thought we was cute or and she encouraged me to approach him, she said that Megan said she thought he was cute too but couldn’t date him for whatever reason but sally could not remember the reason. Anyway, so the past few times I’ve seen him in person I’ve made an attempt to make myself look cool and get to know him and stuff. I was confident but unconfident at the same time, bc I am biracial, and I get very insecure being an alt punk girl in this scene going after a cool alt city guy when he could go after… cool alt White girls lol. I also expressed this to sally and she said I shouldn’t worry about it and I am beautiful blah blah. Anyway, we’re all supposed to go to a show tonight; and sally asked me last night if I was still going, I said yes, and she pretty much gave me this long message telling that she’s pretty sure Megan and guitar Guy are into each other and stuff and they’ll probably be flirting at the show so don’t be surprised 

So now I just feel…sad. I just didn’t respond bc I didn’t know what to say. I also feel like such a goof bc guitar guy had a party the night of our show and sally didn’t go, I was going to go home but I changed my mind and went back to the bar to meet up with Megan to go to his party. Idk I feel like she wanted to go to like flirt w him but I was a cock block and I low key was hoping he would flirt w me. Like wow. I just feel like I’m in high school and I’m the ugly friend all over again

It’s not Megan’s fault. They knew eachother first and actually have a friendship. She is very beautiful and smart, has a good job, getting her PHD, talented- why go for me when u have that option?? 

Like I really just don’t want to go tonight at all. I just feel so shitty and embarrassed and lonely. I always feel insecure and get depressed when I am hanging out with this friend group because I always feel….stupid, not as successful, not as beautiful, not as interesting and unique. Sometimes I don’t even know what to talk about with them Because they just want to talk about how successful they are, how great their jobs are, how great their social lives are, how great their pastimes are. I just feel like a loser all of the time. Sometimes I just want to slap myself and say like YOU ARENT THEM YOULL NEVER BE THEM STOP HANGING OUT WITH THEM STOP TRYING TO BETTER YOURSELF YOURE JUST A LOSER.

3463,akobato,1636729901,1,"'Met' a guy online over 3 years ago. We felt strongly connected and been 'chatting' daily ever since. Eventually, we decided to be in a relationship. Many times, we planned to finally meet each other in person. However, something unexpected would happen every time. He's living with his family still, I mean mother and siblings. That is because his family is dependent on him financially.. and I understand that because I am in the same predicament. We had to sacrifice ourselves for our immediate family. We're almost 30. Unlike him, I don't have much friends. In fact I only had 2 close friends in my lifetime so far. We often talk on how things are going in each other's lives daily and many other topics because of common interests. His friends are usually people who are in a music band or in the music industry so there are times that they'll be away on a project or some concert event, or recordings of some sort. Call me naive or what but whatever he tells me, I believe it. I feel that I really know him even if I haven't met him in person yet. However, I find it hard to shake off that feeling of loneliness whenever he left for those projects that he's working on. I don't know now whether to laugh or cry... that overwhelming realization that I'm alone after all. I really love him but I'm getting mix emotions in this situation. Even when I'm in a relationship with him, I feel so alone. Though I really value our perceived emotional connection. I cannot help myself wanting more. I want real kisses and hugs and so many other things that we can only do if we are actually together.

BUT \*\*YOU CAN ENJOY BEING ALONE- As weird as it sounds.. Yes, yes you actually can.\*\* That being said, if you can afford to unlonely yourself. I highly recommend taking steps working towards that, as I am myself. Humans are social creatures and socializing is pretty much a NEED and not a want.

But if you've got little opportunity to improve your social life, or need to cope while you get better. I've got some methods to help you find more enjoyment from life while you're alone 

&amp;#x200B;


***What interests you? Lean into it!***

Just because you're lonely doesn't mean you can't have hobbies. And lucky you, if you're reading this post you can access the internet and have immense potential to learn just about anything at your fingertips. 

Try doing/learning something new to spice things up a bit. This one really depends a lot on you and your interests. For me personally, I started reading tons of books and self-taught myself photography. I encourage you to get out and do things if you can, it can feel easy to smother yourself in negative thoughts at home.

And to all of you who say, BUT OP!! I HAVE NO INTERESTS! You're lying to me. You're a human being, there has to be something. Maybe you just need to dig a bit. Think back on your past and ask yourself some questions like

* What did I enjoy doing when I was younger?
* Did any subjects or clubs in school interest me?
* What content are I consuming on social media?

&amp;#x200B;

***Get outside and explore with some music?***

Given you're actually in a safe area, I really like this one. During the peak of Covid-19 lockdowns I went on long drives through my middle of nowhere state listening to music and podcasts in my car. 

This one is great for a mental reset, and I found it to be absolutely relaxing. Take your car for a drive, go for a long walk with headphones in. You could even bike with earbuds in one ear, or ride public transportation while listening. Again depends on what you have access to

[I'll even give ya a Spotify playlist of new music to motivate you with](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3QAhyIxlqvfYtVFR35aO8m?si=e40d723d2c8b4281)

[My favorite place to find new music](https://rateyourmusic.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

***Make online friends!*** 

I mean- This isn't really a lonely thing. But in my opinion it's waaay easier meeting friends online compared to in person. Online friends have genuinely been my lifeline, and a few have stuck with me over the years. 

There's tons of communities for meeting people. The biggest downside with this one is you might have to go through a lot of people and will still deal with rejections. That being said, it's easier to find people with common interests/passions online. 

Personally I've used Reddit and Discord to meet people. 

For Discord, I find great servers on [disboard](https://disboard.org/). It's nice, you can search by keywords and find a community for pretty much anything you could image. 

For Reddit, there's lot's of chances. You could even post here. There's various large friendship subreddits that see high traffic.  [r/needafriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/needafriend/)  [r/casualconversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualconversation/)   [r/GamerPals](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/)   [r/MakeNewFriendsHere](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/) Of course, beware if you're a lass there will be thirsty Redditors hitting you up when you're looking for something platonic. Helps to specify females only if that's a concern! 

Other ideas:

* Twitch communities
* FB Groups
* Omegle (beware phallic objects)
* Online gaming

That being said, online friends might not fulfill the role of actual friends for you. For me, I still crave going and doing fun things with people in person, traveling, and etc. It's different for each person. But online friends are social contact for you to laugh and vent to, I love all my online friends..

&amp;#x200B;

***Consciously practice gratitude***

I know. To some of you this will sound incredibly corny, I've been there. Try to open your mind a bit. Humans tend to have a natural negativity bias, where we take things for granted and ruminate on our worries and anxieties. 

Anyone can practice gratitude. Because well, you could practice gratitude for just about anything. One could be grateful to have food and a working heart. That's something a lot of people don't have! We have more than we realize. This isn't to take away from your problems though.. Just to help you become more conscious of what good things you do have. 

You've got to practice this regularly for it to work though! You can't just do gratitude one day.. you're going to slip back into a negative state. You need the constant reminder.

1. BEGINNER: Set an alarm for a time when you know you'll have free time. When the alarm goes off you have to mentally or aloud come up with one thing you can be grateful for. 
2. INTERMEDIATE: Journal at least 3 things you're grateful for. I recommend a dedicated journal, you can find these dirt cheap at most stores or order online. You can also write it down online, or even keep an audio journal if you prefer. I also recommend an alarm for this until you do it without thinking.
3. ADVANCED: Follow instructions given intermediate, followed by or before 5 minutes of meditation. The goal of meditation is to connect you with the moment and clear your mind of anxious thoughts. A super simple beginner method is to find somewhere comfortable to sit or lay down. Close your eyes, try to focus on your breathing. Meditation will be hard at first, this is normal! Don't get frustrated when you mind drifts, acknowledge your thoughts and feelings and return to your breath. 

***Find your pleasure activities. Random things you can do on a whim that will boost your mood.***

I've found there's a lot of strange things that just satisfy my mind and make it feel better. Whether it's a happy song that brings you peace, or binging YouTube videos and shutting my mind off for a while. I intentionally have a playlist of funny videos I reference back to when I need the boost.

But it can be really random. I find cleaning for some reason is really therapeutic? There isn't much I can control in life, but I can blast a counter stain with Clorox like I'm the god of my kitchen. Try to make a list. See what you can think up, and reflect on the things you enjoy the most. You probably have some ideas already, but this should help you become more conscious! 

***Take a step back when you're feeling bad***

It's easy to fall into a hole of doing nothing and feeling worse and worse. Your loneliness may have different triggers. For some reason I can feel worse and worse scrolling through socials for too long. Feeling empty and feeling bored, but my brain still feels tempted to do nothing. 

This is a trap though. If you don't switch up what you're doing you're not going to feel better. Your brain will resist, but muster whatever willpower you can. 

Great way to break this cycle is to participate in any of your pleasure activities. Everything else on this list should help you to manage this as well. This may be personal, but I recommend getting out of your living space if possible. It can clear your mind to get out and physically distance yourself.",lonely,How I’ve Learned to Enjoy Being Alone After 22 Years,2021-11-13 00:02:33

3481,anonymuslit,1636720922,1,"Im 20. I havent had any social contact for 2 years. Im in college but i failed all my courses and im gonna have to drop out sooner or later. 

I cant be with people 1 on 1. I only function in groups. Thats the only way ive ever had friends and been around people.

Litetally ALL the people i know go around making sucess and having sex. I face constant failure. Im not even such a ""weirdo"", i just cnat talk to people because it gives me anxiety. Severe fucking anxiety. Like i shake everytime i make eye contact. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. When I walk around the city my eyes start to water because people stare at me. 

Also im not bad looking and pretty tall. Im supposed to be a fucking man, but instead im this hollow excuse of a beeing. 

My whole life is literally in my head. I sit on my bed listening to music, where i drive fast cars with russian blondies and I hold hands with green eyed beautiful women. I have this daydream where this imaginary girl and I are the only living beings on earth. We are on a sailing ship in the middle of the atlantic watching the stars. I want to love a woman, but all the women i know have fucked like 10+ people and that somewhat ruins my fantasy and attraction to them. 

I used to dress extremely good (like i looked like a fucking model) but i stopped doing that because i get anxiety of people staring me down in the street. People smile as they walk past me as if i was pretentious or arrogant, they smile because they are laughing at me and my demeanour. As a teenager people dont judge you as much as when you are older. 

I also have fantasies of brutal things. I know this is strange but honestly its not that weird, just go on 4chan or youtube to see much worse things. Anyways i like to romanticise violence. It could also be that im mentally unhinged. Since im 14 i have had severe derealisation. I also can hear whispering in my head. But i believe thats just cause im lonely. Its def shizophrenic whispering. Im def not a psychopath because im so emotional and scared. 

Right now i know 0 people in my city and i havent seen a girl for 2 years. When i scroll tiktok and see these fucking hoes it breaks my fucking heart. Where do i find women with morals? There is nothing more special to me than the connection of a woman and a man. Im totally crazy about small blonde girls. Im such a sad romantic. 

Who am I now!? Dear existance who am i ...Im a decent looking guy with 400 dollar saint laurent t shirts in my closet, but im broke, lonely and have no prospects. Im a lover of music and art, i totally love fantasy. I also fucking love drugs, even tough i dont know a dealer anymore so i cant get any. If i could, i would do xanax to meet people and maybe shoot some heroin to feel distracted. Ive read all about the drug. I believe i can do it without catching an addiction. I wish i was on ecstasy right now, dancing in a mansion with a 16 year old girl in my arm. 

Also before you think im a fucking creep, when i drink girls seem to really be interested in me. I will literally get approached by girls and I have these intense seducing stares with women that feel better than e.g. cocaine or a nicotine kick. I'll end making out with the cutest, pretty girl in the bar, but then it will turn out that shes a complete thot. Anyways that was before i went completely antisocial. 

I would fucking murder people to hold a girl with a cute face and blonde hair in my arms right now. Good looking girls turn on my instincts, it plesses me and makes me feel good. Im so lonely that it hurts, its like a heavy sort of pain that crushes you from above. I used to think ""chrushing pain"" sounds very cheesy, but its true! Im supposed to be out there, chasing women,  causing troubke with guy friends, making a name for myself. But im so lost ... im lost in a dark place of nothing. Like im not even an addict or something exciting. I just sit around and do NOTHING. 

Dear future wife, you are beautiful like the summer in rome, but cold like the winter in Milano. I cant wait

I wish i wouldnt get so tense and start shaking in a social interaction like talking to a cashier or walking on the street. I literally start crying when i walk the street because im so scared. 
Im a 6+ft man build like an athelete but I cant fucking walk on a street? Im literally supposed to be a winner how am i losing. I had no childhood trauma or problems.  How? What is going on?

And we started chatting and hit it off right away.

I went to see her and we had great chemistry, the best I've ever had with any other gal. She has a kid soo I only went to go see her on the weekends(or my days off)when she didn't have him, no biggie at all...I definitely wouldn't want to met the child straight away.

We had be seeing each other for a good couple of months at this point, we were partners, had been on a trip and were still getting on well l.

She and I have a lot of baggage, she's involved in a family business that grow and sell weed(illegal where I'm from) and her brother is in a gang, so they get up to pretty dodgy stuff aha, but that doesn't bother me. My baggage is mainly on the mental side of things.

I get really bad retrospective jealousy, and every time she would mention guys of her past ( e.g her being fuck buddies with a guy for almost a year, only dating a certain type of dude before me etc)

It really fucked with me when we weren't together, no of it is her fault.

I have struggled a long time with a number of mental health issues that have only worsened over time despite my efforts to find what works for me. I also consider myself a 'misanthrope' and am often described as introverted. 
I love my loneliness. It's a unique part of me that has shaped who I've become, for better or worse. But how do I manage it? I have a live in partner, but that does not alleviate or help to manage what i know is a deeply unhealthy part of me.  
I am 36, Male, have left my home less than 10 times in 4 years and have no friends. I suffer chronic lung collapses, frequently need chest tubes and have had a few surgeries so far with no end in sight. What friends I DID try to hold on to got pretty tired of it all. 
About 4.5 years ago my father faced a second cancer diagnosis and I had no choice but to leave a brand new job that I loved in a city I thrived in to come back to my hometown that I worked so hard to leave. 
Now I struggle to leave my home, I hate people with a passion that I barely comprehend, have ridiculous health issues that have compromised my quality of life heavily and can rarely keep my energy high enough to have much fun, or sustain much visiting. 

I know everyone is unique, but everyone's insight is valuable. I dont necessarily want to change, but I would like ways to mitigate some of the ills that come with loneliness, obviously within my limitations. :/

Though the relationship was little more than a college situationship that happened because of a dating app, I still think about her. This isn’t the first time I’ve been hurt, and yes in this situation I was the person who was hurt, from any angle you look at it she is in the wrong. She is a selfish,impulsive, and terrible person yet still I think fondly of our short time together. She took a 2 hour bus and train ride to see me after we talked for like 3/4 of a month. After we hooked up she said she needed to use the bathroom and left me, all before saying that I am “A nice guy.” The last words she said to me in person was that I am a nice guy, not thanks for the head, not you are extremely sweet, not “I am very enticed to you”, “You are a nice guy ___”. Loneliness follows me throughout my life, and soon I believe that loneliness will succeed in ruining me. 

So I had a pretty shitty day, and decided to take eight 5mg melatonin gummies and to cuddle with my laundry bag. Earlier I thought of this funny scene, of two hardcore italian mobsters realizing that they have depression before it ended up just me venting to myself on my laptop. I feel as though the life that I live and will continue to live will be defined by loneliness, as it already has been. I overate today, in an effort to make myself feel better by eating food I enjoy, yet that did not help either. It made things worse and triggered my crippling body dysmorphia and now I can’t look in a mirror. I fantasize about being held and caressed and comforted by a woman, “___ you’re so handsome and strong.” Etc etc. My mind pinballs from wishful thinking to creating plans to end my miserable life. I saw this girl on campus who I admire on Hinge and sent her a like, and now I’m paranoid that her and her friends made fun of me. I’m unhappy with myself, and my fantasies go back and forth from being comforted to ending everything. 

I’m 18 years old, and I am not saying I’m going to end it all for attention, I’m saying it because I’m scared. Not only of living my life alone but, I have never felt this strong a drive. I have a history with su1cidal aspirations and ideations, and even multiple attempts, yet never in the same way I have them now. 

There are things that I would like to experience before it all ends. Romantic love, holding my own child in my hands, growing old, finishing my novel, etc. yet I don’t think that even if I live to a thousand years old I will never experience any save for maybe the novel.

I tried really hard. Everything I put in it was not centred around me. I made a small hint of how being isolated, wasn't doing any good for my wellbeing. 

I actually felt really pathetic for even writing it. I just thought it showed how far I was willing to go for someone just to keep my sanity together. Not saying that's good thing. I really didn't feel comfortable writing it, because I thought who actually does that sort of thing anymore? (at least people under 30).

I remember writing it and feeling so drained. Not because I was thinking ""why has it come to this"" but because I've been drained from the last few months through just feeling so isolated and frankly terrified of reaching out. 

I mean, I tried to come across friendly. I tried to apologise for the distance (though I don't believe anything caused it as such). But my heart was put into my pen, that's for sure.

3541,userchelle,1636688834,1,Ever since I’ve graduated high school I’ve lost all form of a social life. I mean I have friends but they’re my high school friends. Despite keeping in contact we’ve all gone our separate ways to different colleges. I’m currently attending college completely remotely and even when I do start attending on-campus I’ll be commuting over 2 hours total per day. With the effects of the pandemic seeming to still be going steadily a majority of my classes will probably remain online for awhile. So not much of a chance to make new college friends. Outside of classes I have a part-time job. So pretty much my days since graduating high school have just consisted of college and work. I don't regret not dorming or my college decision since to begin within I'm neither interested or into the college life. My decision was largely based on financial reasons and the strong department for the major I’m interested in. I’m just starting to get fomo because I have no friends in general. Seeing everyone on social media with their friends makes me feel like I’m lacking in some way despite originally being content by myself. I mean it’s not really the social norm to have practically no social life. I feel like when I do reunite with my high school friends it would seem kind of pathetic for me to have made no friends. Originally I thought I could sign up for some classes (not school ones) within my town related to my hobbies or interests and meet people through there. But dang are they expensive. I’ve also tried meeting people online but the internet is a dangerous place and many of them turned out to be dicks. I’m starting to fear I’ll never make a life long best friend.

3543,captaindestucto,1636688050,1," Title says it all really, but I can't resist some tedious life story exposition.

I had a rough time at school and missed out at university due to severe social anxiety and terrible appearance issues (early male pattern baldness; literally wore a hat every day).

Shortly after starting work in an office my mother was diagnosed with her2 breast cancer. I lived at home, paid the bills, eventually became a caregiver for 6 years . It took another 2-3 years until I was mentally capable of moving on, by which time I was 35/36.

I'm now 42. I've been through my entire 20s and 30s without have had a social circle or any relationship experience whatsoever.

It's depressing being around people my age. I've been graciously accepted into a circle of older friends, which I do appreciate, but truth is I don't relate to most people at this phase of life. Clearly I won't be having any of the experiences missed out on around them, as I'm not really interested in dinner parties or get-togethers on somebodies back deck with their kids running about. It only makes me feel old. And while I've no intention on hitting on very young women/girls the thought of being intimate with women my age actually makes me uneasy. Most look significantly older than me due to having lived their lives already with multiple relationships, marriage, kids, divorce, etc.

To sum up, I'm at the same point psychologically as I was at 26, except now I'm old, saddled with a crappy job and full of regrets over having missed just about every normal/formative experience there is.

And really how do you accept aging without being young first? There's no reconciling to that.

This post is pointless, lazily written drivel, as grey and dull as my life. I'm unlikely to gain anything from comments in the same vein as I've heard dozens of times before. No, therapy won't roll back the years or send me back to 2005.

The only thing keeping me going right now is not hurting my one remaining relative along with not liking the idea of dishonouring my mother's memory. Otherwise, if I could flip a switch and get this empty life over with without making a mess or hurting anyone, then I'd consider that as valid and rational a decision as any.",lonely,42 year old virgin with less life experience than an average 20 year old - why bother continuing?,2021-11-12 14:34:10

Depression is rough. I'm a chef and love to make people smile, but I can't smile myself. Not meaningfully at least.

I just want to talk a little bit, this post may not make any sense as writing and explaining myself are not my strong points.
I have a few friends and a very supportive family yet I still feel lonely and on top of that, I've garnered a self hatred.
This hatred as led me to believe I'm a bad friend,  a bad son and bad brother even though nothing really points to that being the case
I'm 23M and I consider myself to be really unattractive. 
I cant really understand why I feel lonely even when I got friends that i talk to every day, maybe it's because i never had relationship with a girl, I dont know
My question to you folks is, any of you are in the situation? Where even if you have friends and a family that supports you, you still feel lonely and like you dont belong? Like you dont deserve any of what you have, like you feel you're still gonna die alone?
I'm sorry that went from 0 to 100 but it's just how I feel, I try so very hard to understand why i feel this way, I think that even if I had a girlfriend I would still feel lonely and with all this self hatred I've got, wouls definitely feel like she deserves better than me.

3571,Interesting_Ebb_5218,1636679381,1,"The first time I (30F) ever kissed a guy, at age 19, I was in college. He took advantage of me while I was drunk, and forced me to do things sober me would have gawked at and been embarrassed by. A year later, I was hanging out with a guy and we were drinking a few beers in his dorm. He slipped me a sleeping pill and then tried to do things to me while I slowly fell into a groggy state. Luckily I was able to crawl out of his room somehow and make it back to my room in the next building over. 

I’ve never been in a relationship, never been on a date, never been asked out, never had sex, and never been intimately touched by a guy who actually cared about me. The last time I have even been touched by a guy was 5 years ago, and it was just a hug. 

I hope that there is a guy out there for me, someone who is kind and patient, and would still like me even if I disappoint him physically and not meet his needs (my biggest fear in life - being so bad at it and timid that he just gets up and walks away because he can get it better elsewhere). 

I had a male friend once, I was 25, perhaps the first and only real male friend I’ve ever had in my life. At least I thought so. We understood each other on a deeper level and had interesting philosophical conversations, supported one another through tough times, and I think there was an unspoken attraction there on both sides. One night after a few beers, out of nowhere, he told me that he could never marry someone like me, and he would never want to have sex with me because he couldn’t deal with my virginal emotions afterwards, and did not have the patience to teach me. My heart broke. At the loss of what I thought was a friendship (who says things like that to a friend?) but because of the truth behind it. What guy would ever want to be with me, a virgin. 

Another male acquaintance and I started getting physical one night after a few beers, just kissing and fondling, after a simmering 1 year attraction to one another. I was 26. But a few minutes in, he stopped because he couldn’t get it up. He then just walked away. We talked a few days later, again after a few beers (liquid courage) and I told him I want to try again. He just laughed at me and said no, too late, and walked away. I never heard from him again, despite having many mutual friends. 

In my daily life, I strive to be kind to everyone. I have a positive demeanor, albeit I am a bit shy. I work hard, am supportive and encouraging to those I love, and find pleasure in the simple things in life, the beauty in the small things around me. 

I will never know why I am not attractive to males, why I am not worth anyone’s time. Why no guy wants to teach me how to have sex and not take advantage of me. I long to be touched, to be loved, to be cared for. It may never happen in my lifetime.

She played it up like she cared, but an ""I'm so sorry"" and an offer to send me food isn't what I needed. I needed a friend. I needed and still need an actual friend.

The only way I can describe it is everyone of my friends was my best friend, yet I was never theirs. I was someone to hang out with when no one else wanted to. I was the friend who would listen to them whine. I was the friend who'd be left behind while walking down the sidewalk. And I was okay with that for a while. I could handle that. But now I really need them and they don't even care.

My ex now, he's a good dude. He even now is a better friend than all of them. He became both my best friend and my boyfriend, which I guess was a slippery slope. And I could handle heartbreak. The breakup isn't what's ruining me now. He wants space after the breakup, and I can respect that. I understand he needs that boundary to be set, but when you're hearbroken who do you go to to support you? Your best friend. And so what do you do when you're best friend is the one who left you heartbroken? What do you do when no one else seems to care that you've been a walking trash fire for the past three years? 

Not a single person texts me anymore. I know all of their schedules, only my ex has a job. The rest are in college. They have the time. I work and I'm in college and yet if they came to me I'd find the time but there's never any time for me. I used to try and pretend it was unintentional, that they just forgot or were busy but they're not. They just don't care and I shouldn't kid myself anymore.",lonely,"My boyfriend left me, I'm on ADHD meds for the first time, and I literally do not have a single friend anymore.",2021-11-12 12:02:05
3574,SeaworthinessIcy9270,1636678860,1,"Like the title says, I've never been particularly good at making romantic connections. The woman that I crush on have all just wanted to be friends and nothing more. I have no problem with being just friends, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit upset that it's been like that with every last one. I've lost count of how many women I've told that I was interested in and they didn't like me in a romantic way. I'm 29 now, didn't lose my virginity until I was 26, had a one night stand with a girl I knew back in high school. She got engaged a month later to some other guy. Only had sex one other time with a different girl and she also ended up engaged a month later. Dating apps have never worked for me and the bar scene doesn't do it for me. I crave the romance, intimacy, and the mind blowing sex(God do I love the sex), but for what ever reason it just alludes me. Again, I have no problem with becoming just friends with women, but it's discouraging that I'm not seen in a romantic way. Maybe I'm overthinking things or I'm just being selfish, idk. It just hurts some days you know? I look around and my other friends are in happy relationships, getting married, or having kids. So clearly whatever it is that these women want I don't have.

3576,SongOfTheNomad,1636678142,1,"Hello all, this is my first reddit account, and I come here in search of some form of solace. I want to share my story, and I want to know I've I'm absolutely insane or not.

I'd like to start out by saying feel free to call me whatever name you see fit. I know I'm coming from a place of entitlement: ""I've been dating someone for 5 years! Anyone would give anything for that!"" But if you care to listen, maybe you'll understand, like I do, that not everything is all roses and sunshine. So, here I go, apologies in advance for the absurd length and any ranting that may happen.

I am 23 years old. The person I'm dating treats me like an afterthought. I want to make plans? ""I don't know, maybe I'm doing something with [friends] later."" I see my partner once a week. They never want to do anything special with me. I don't know how to properly describe it, but in essence, it feels like the person I'm dating is using me as a hangout for whenever they aren't doing anything else. The [friends] I mentioned earlier, are all people who I've come to hate on my own, by virtue of when I was friends with them, I was nothing but an emotional punching bag for all their jokes and cruel words. An afterthought. They seek to make sure I spend as little time with my partner as possible, and my partner is more than ok with allowing it to happen. I speak up and voice my concerns? I get blamed for being overemotional. I can't talk about anything without the situation getting flipped on me, making it all out to be my fault. Every. Single. Time. I just wanted a relationship in which I share my life and my interests with a person that I love, and they share theirs in return. What I have is a timecard that I punch once a week to fill a quota, and my payment? Delaying the feelings of dread my a day or so. I want to badly to be loved and cared for, and even when I was lucky enough to start dating someone for the first time in a while, the monkey's paw curled a finger and gave me a relationship I don't know if I can be satisfied with. I don't know what to do. I can't stand the thought of actually being without someone because I know the hell that it would wreak on my mind. Am I insane for feeling this way? Should I just enjoy what I have and quit complaining because some people have it way worse? Probably, and more than likely. If anyone has anything to share with me, please do. I'm open to all forms of discussion, and if I need to clear anything up, please ask. I'm at the end of my rope and this is where I've turned to.  Hopefully any loneliness you feel gets better. You have a friend in this random stranger online. Thank you, to anyone who's taken the time to read this in full. It means more to me than I am able to express through writing.

TL;DR: Relationship feels like a timecard that I'm punching once a week and I'm too scared to break it off because I can't deal with actually being alone. Wat do?",lonely,I have been dating someone for nearly 5 years and I've never been so alone.,2021-11-12 11:49:02

I'm fucking tired of not being able to socialize correctly. It's like it doesn't even matter how hard I try I always end up fucking things up. I joke when I shouldn't, I tease someone or at least try to when it's not the right time... Idk I guess all of this happened because I was on a call with my bf and we were debating about some ridiculous stuff and I was trying to be playfully mean saying things like I clearly won the argument, but I guess I just took it too far because I don't know when to let go of things or when I'm stepping over the line. This is one of the reasons that I think I might be autistic, because I really don't know how to pick up social cues. Then I kinda started just feeling shitty and I wanted to stop the debate but he would just keep going and I didn't know how to properly say that I just didn't want to talk about it anymore so I was just mean I guess, I really don't know. He started getting mad or something and I asked if he was but he said that he wasn't. I just started telling him that I was sorry and he responded that now he knows that he's not going to talk about these things with me next time. He didn't even say that he loves me before hanging up. 

It's so fucked up because I find myself in these type of situations quite often. I either don't talk at all or I talk too much, people indirectly say something to me and I just don't pick it up... It's probably one of the worst things about me and I just can't really fix it, the only thing that I try to do is try to study the way that other people behave and mimick that cause apparently I don't know how to do it myself.

3582,RuinouslyYours,1636676030,1,"Sorry if this is in the wrong place but I feel like this may be a symptom of my social anxiety or self-imposed isolation, a symptom of my loneliness. I never know when it's appropriate to consider someone a friend. On the one hand, I will see anyone who is friendly to me as a friend, and on the other, it feels presumptuous to call myself *anyone's* friend unless they've explicitly referred to me as such because I don't *actually* know how they see me. Maybe they think I'm super annoying and are only putting up with me to be polite because they have no other options and feel trapped by me, and in that circumstance, I doubt they could be *less* inclined to see me as a friend, and yet me being lonely and desperate, there's a part of me that will cling to the fantasy of us being friends even if we never hang out or talk, because they're ""nice"" to me.

I don't even know if any of this makes sense, I'm kind of just running off at the mouth... fingers? Whatever.

About 4 months ago, I started in person learning. I was really REALLY scared because I’m a really introverted person. I have the roughest time making friends because I’m not comfortable with going up to random strangers and acting all nice and buddy buddy with em you know? 

While I was sitting in the corner of the classroom, everybody was always conversing. Opening up to others and meeting new people. I’m no protagonist in a teen drama where making friends just takes the flip of a switch. 

It’s sad, for four months, I continued to isolate myself around people and still do so to this day. And no, I don’t like it at all. I’m just a scaredy cat who can’t get over my cowardice to simply go up to people for a conversation.

To be honest, if I knew I was going to be this alone for almost an entire semester, I’d rather learn how to embrace it rather than be depressed over it for the past 3 months, but getting over my feelings of frustration, jealousy, and sadness is nearly impossible in my eyes.

She told me that she felt like we were falling apart and that we were moving in different directions, saying the distance (1 hour apart) and our different interests (that we’ve always had, that kept us fresh) just weren’t working out anymore. That she was too busy for me and thought we needed to not hang out “for the time being” which I can respect, she is working on herself and working to get into grad school.

3606,lonelyhuman909,1636665457,1,"This is just a rant that I just need to let out. I don't mean for it to sound angry or anything so please give me the benefit of the doubt. I'm a 30 year old guy and have been single for a long time (probably losing any social skills I've had) I'm subscribed to a lot of subreddits for meeting people and find that like 90% are guys and just find it interesting that guys have a hard time. We have to be cautious not to be creepy and at least in the U.S. guys aren't that affectionate weather to each other or those of the opposite gender and as a guy that doesn't like being around other guys (due to abuse in my youth) but it goes beyond that. Now all my friends in high school where girls and know they have to be careful and cautious but think about how guys and girls act in thier own groups girls can complement each other show affection (even platonic). Guys don't get a lot of compliments and brush off a lot more I've heard that a lot of guys mellow when they get married and I think its because we are allowed to be more affectionate after marriage. 

If you are reading and have gotten this far, what is wrong with you listening to the rants of a mad man. Girls be careful but really guys go months and years without complements (may be why we think any complement means you are being nice and lie or that you are interested in us) 

Well no idea where I was going with this. I don't think I was going anywhere with it though.",lonely,Guys don't get a lot of affection,2021-11-12 08:17:37
3607,bradsb129,1636665127,1,"Context: 

I (30M) saved myself for marriage and lost my virginity on my wedding night at age 23 (almost 24). Im not ugly or a failure at women, I intentionally did it this way. 

The marriage was a bust and i divorced after 5 years when I found out my now exwife was cheating, which was only the cherry on top of the cake of marital issues we were already having. (Out of those issues, cheating wasn't the worst in my opinion. That's how bad it was) 

I now have a beautiful girlfriend, who I am ever grateful for and is out of my league. However, we are long distant (shes korean, im american) 

Current problem:
I get this really uncomfortable feeling whenever I hear about how much sex people are really having. Like the average women has like 7 sex partners by the time she's 30 or something like that. 

I feel horrible like I'm behind the curve and need to catch up. 

I am currently 30. For a period of time not long ago, I got so desperate from loneliness, I broke up with my girlfriend. Went on tinder/hinge and rapidly dated women. In a span of like a 2 - 3 week period I dated like 10+ women and slept with 2 of them and made out with several. 

I dont know why I feel this way or why I did that. My girlfriend took me back because neither of us really wanted to break up. I was so lonely and horny, I didn't know what to do. Can somebody please provide some insight, feedback or understanding as to why im behaving this way? 

On one hand I want to keep and marry my girlfriend one day. She is amazing and deserves so much better. On the other hand, I subconsciously want to bang as many women as I can before I'm old.

Someone please help",lonely,I feel some kind of way whenever I hear about the disproportionate statistics of the rate men and women have sex,2021-11-12 08:12:07
3608,G0056,1636664553,1,"It's been like this for a long time. I'm starting university right now, studying 3d game art. For the past 4 or 5 years, since I started studying computer grades, 3d...I've been the smart one in the class, the one who all the people relay to ask their questions. So I can talk with people in class, in groups, go out with them, I think I know how to be part of a group.

But in the individual part, I don't think I can connect with anyone, like have ""chemistry"" with any of my friends. I don't have almost private messages on whatsapp, instagram...and almost all of them are people who comes to ask a question about school, and then is gone. It's very painful to have all classmates talking to you like that in private, I don't feel like I'm really friend with anyone, I'm only the whatsapp chat where you put your question, and it gets solved almost always, then, you can ignore again that chat. 

I'm in 2 or 3 friends groups, and when we're in person I have fun and talk, but sometimes, while talking, they mention that between the other members of the group, they talk between them in private chats, discord calls...all of them except me, I only get to talk in private if it's to solve a problem, after that, anything. I don't mind helping people, but when you feel that it's your only value, it hurts.

Recently I've started to lose hope on feeling like I'm a real friend with someone, to have someone who I can send a message and talk for hours. I'm starting to obsess with personal growth, I've accepted that I'll be alone in my life, so at least, I'm gonna learn all that I can, so I can find value in my life by being the best in what I do, or at least doing it the best I can.

3612,Maximum_Superb,1636662924,1,"So here in the Philippines, there are still no face-to-face classes, meaning almost all schools still implement online learning. Given this, I'm wondering why can't I do something productive for school even once? Students like me are given many opportunities to cheat since we're not being watched, and there's no academic integrity during an online setup. I think that the real problem is that I don't have any motivation to do it earnestly, and my mind is telling me that if I can do it the easy way (cheating), then I should do it that way and not the complicated process. I don't know why I can't get rid of this. I just want online learning to end and learn already. I'm tired. I have no social interactions physically, and I have an awful sleeping schedule and time management. I feel like I'm hopeless and that I'm trapped in a situation. I'm guilty that I'm wasting my parents' money on the tuition, but I can't seem to do anything about how I react to this. Is there something wrong with me? With how online learning works?

3643,elegantxangel,1636647947,1,"Don't get me wrong, it's amazing that I'm still best friends with the people I met years ago. We are really close. But I notice I get lonely a lot especially when I am completely alone. My friends are in college now (in different states/cities) and busy with their lives. I see them maybe once or twice a year. However, we text weekly, which makes me happy. I used to have several online friends, but they drifted away from me. I just want something new. New friends to meet, new faces to talk to, different experiences and whatnot, ya know?

I guess a part of it is my fault since I literally stay inside all day other than the times I am working or exercising at the gym. Even at work, I am too shy and nervous to talk to anyone. It sucks. I'm just happy I have my boyfriend that I can physically be around and talk to, at least. It's perfect with him. (I'm visiting him in Canada right now because we are long-distance). I just wish my friends were more involved in my life, but I totally understand they are busy now and I never give them shit for it.

I need more people in my life. My question is, how can I do that? I have social anxiety and feel too insecure. Especially with other women my age. It's just that with every other girl I've talked to in the last few years, we have completely different hobbies and I don't really know how to relate to that. I don't even know if it's a bad thing to have different interests but it definitely makes things harder for some reason. I feel like I can never fit in. I don't do a lot of things people seem to do these days, like drinking/drugs, smoking, partying, etc. because it's not my cup of tea. (I'm not judging if you do any of those things, btw)!

Personally, I am a pretty introverted person and a homebody, although I do love to go on adventures and explore random places. I love to make art, music, play piano, watch hours of YouTube, and I really enjoy gaming. The list goes on. Maybe if you're reading this and you have similar hobbies, we can probably bond over that. I wouldn't mind making some friends on here.

Honestly though, I feel like I need to view the whole idea of ""making friends"" from another light. It could be very helpful. I know how to be a friend; I love helping my loved ones, spoiling them on their birthdays, listening to them when they need it, basically doing whatever I think will help them/make them happy. But creating that amazing bond seems impossible now that I am older. I seem to think that not having similar hobbies won't seem to work and I almost wonder if it all ties down to me being insecure about myself. If that even makes sense.

So, does anyone have advice? I would deeply appreciate it.

3666,FixItInPost1863,1636637307,1,"Idek what I’m doing anymore. I have a great group of friends consisting of like 8 people and wherever they all want to hangout, I politely decline. I’ll go every so often. But not often enough. Yesterday at school, a bunch of kids wanted me to join them for lunch after class and I was so happy but internally panicked and just said I had plans and I’ll catch up with them another time knowing that I probably would say I’m busy again. Last week a bunch of guys wanted me over to hangout and again, I declined. It’s like I’d rather hangout alone and be sad about it than actually doing what makes me happy. 

I wasn’t always like this. Up until about a year ago I was hanging out with people every single night. Didn’t matter the time or day of the week, I made sure I put in time to enjoy life for what it’s worth. But 2021 hasn’t really gone my way. I’m starting to become a recluse. Rarely even leaving my room. Back January my gf of about 4 years broke things of and I was devastated. Completely flattened me. But the worst was yet to come. Out of seemingly nowhere my face broke out in severe severe acne in February. I started treatment with a dermatologist taking accutane and such. For those of you who don’t know, accutane is one hell of a pill. That was the hardest time during my life. Before all this I liked to consider myself a somewhat attractive guy. But then being thrust into single hood and than obviously not a good look with acne I was embarrassed. I didn’t let myself leave the house for months. These events happening back to back put me in a pretty dark place mentally that I’ve been trying to work myself out of. Anyways, my acne has since cleared up (drastically well) however my face is still pretty red and I was left with many acne scars that cover both my cheeks. My once sky high confidence is just a shell of what it used to be. 

To put it simply, I’m just embarrassed to be who I am right now and long for the days that used to make me happy. I’m fully aware of that life is all just a mental game and I really have nothing to worry about. It’s like I have the answer key to not be lonely and depressed anymore, I just choose not to use it out of fear it will hurt me…even though I know it won’t. 

I’ve never really done drugs, but since august I’ve been spending my nights high on weed and focusing on school. That’s it. I’ve literally hung out with people less than 10 times in 2021 and I’m really disappointed in myself. 

And I guess I’m only really typing here bc I can’t trust anyone else I know. I’ve been burned many times and I have trouble opening up to people, even my best friend who I’ve known since I was 3. But I just wanted to share and say this out loud because I know I’m acting like an idiot. I could be happy again. I know. It’s just so difficult. I don’t want to be lonely anymore.

When you started to like girls (or guys). I was like 12, started to have a crush on my friend of years. But boy was I in for a rude awakening. I asked her out and she rejected me. It felt shitty but it was a problem. Overheard her tell her friends tho it was because I was ugly as fuck. I didn’t really confront or anything just kinda thought ok maybe it’s just her. A year passed and found someone else, she pretty much did the same thing except they made fun of me online even made me into a meme between them. Found it randomly years later. It honestly hurt… I started to have an incline that I would never find someone because of my looks and height. High school came around and I went to an all guy school. No girls… felt weird at first but got comfortable. I still wanted to stupidly try. I tried social apps… found some that would chat with me, when they asked for a picture, even if the conversation was going well I would immediately get blocked… it started to make me hate women for a long time. I felt robbed because of my looks and because women couldn’t get past them. Got to college, coming from an all guy school the transition was pretty awkward. Felt almost uncomfortable around women. I felt embarrassed that they saw me or heard my young teenager voice even tho I was older. College rolled around so I tried dating apps. Tinder, bumble, etc. I got little to no real matches. The few that did only matched to tell me I wasn’t any girls type or told me they swiped on everyone. It was pretty humiliating hearing the first one. But it made me realize yea I’ll never have any woman love me because how could they? Fast forward a bit I’ll be 24 in a few months, I don’t hate women anymore because I realized yea who the fuck can love me? The closest I got was actually recently or at least I thought but she pushed me away because she didn’t want to hurt me even tho her ex was abusive she went back to him basically while I’m left questioning why the fuck do I even exist? But more importantly why the fuck did I ever believe a beautiful girl with “a big heart” could ever even fuckin love me?

Im 28 [f] and im feeling beyond lonely and despite having friends and family in my life i have nowhere to go, no one to talk to and find myself in this constant state of loneliness.

About 18 months ago i walked out of a relationship where i was engaged to very toxic person. They had used my nudes to catfish other men into sending them things. Ontop of this they would use my friends social media content pretending they were his wives as they were more attracted than i was.

11 months ago i started a new job with what i thought were very inspirational people in a new city, only for it to be the most taxing and hostile work environment im pretty sure isnt even legal. 

Im so sick and tired of being used for other peoples benefit and entertainment to some degree. I find myself constantly giving, taking the high road and with no hate in my heart despite all the shit ive been through and the people who have done me wrong. At the same time, i feel like no one gets it, no one cares, no one puts in any effort and im breaking myself for even an ounce of something from someone. 

Im proud of who i am and what ive achieved in my life to date, i just wish i had someone who gave a shit and was along for the ride. It doesnt have to be a lover, even just a damn good friend who listened would make the worlds difference. Ive never considered checking out before but finding a point to carry on is gettting harder and harder these days. Maybe in just cynical, maybe i see the world and people as they truly are.

Now I’ve realized that all I really want is intimacy. A night on the couch snuggling and watching movies with another human being to who truly knows who I am and still loves me, and loves to spend time with me. 

That would be bliss. Even if we never had sex, or did anything physical. Just having another person in my life who I could care about and who would actually want to hear about my day and my feelings.

I had a really good friend throughout high school that took me to parties and introduced me to all sorts of people. When I was with him, I felt good, and I felt like myself. At the end of my senior year, many women came forward and said he had abused them sexually, one of them being one of the girls in our close group of friends. I decided that I couldn't be friends with someone like that as much as it hurt, so I broke contact. I feel like there is something wrong with me because the only person who has been able to get through to me thoroughly and understand me turned out to be a bad person. 

I recently started university, and the school that I decided to go to is in the middle of nowhere because they gave me the biggest scholarship package. As a result, I have always had trouble talking to people and making new friends. Currently, the only people outside of my immediate family who care about what I have to say are my boyfriend and a friend I have known since I was little, who live relatively far away as I can only see them on occasional weekends. 

I find it very difficult to watch everyone in their little groups having a great time and living the ideal college life, all while everyone seems to think I'm weird. Every time I say anything, I get ignored, talked over, and sometimes even belittled. I know I have it better than many people and that I am still young, but I feel like my entire life is passing by, and I only feel like myself on the short weekends I see the few people I know. 

I feel bad for missing him, and I was already a lonely person before, but now I feel like the one person who made me feel better was him. 

I have never felt so lonely and inadequate in my entire life, like I don't know anyone who is as at rock bottom as I am. Everyone I know from high school are all living fulfilling lives at schools they love and have plans for the future and even ppl that r at community college or still in the area or not in college at all r still doing something worthwhile and i'm slowly realizing that it doesn't matter if i stay here or go to New York I will always be less of a person bc i literally cannot talk to people and every interaction makes it worse i can't speak to my parents about basic things, i cant ask for help from anyone i cant talk to anyone i live with i can barely speak when it's essential and i j feel like i'm screaming and no one can hear me bc i j CANT SPEAK and no one understands what it feels like to feel stuck inside ur own head like everyone j tells me to be myself and talk ""like i normally would"" but they don't realize when i open my mouth it's like my brain becomes static and i forget that words exist and i cant summon them no matter how hard i try and i go to bed every single fucking day bc i j feel so defeated.",lonely,"everyone says I'm ""in my prime"" but I have no friends and I don't know what's wrong with me",2021-11-11 15:05:09

Wrong...

My so call friend decided to drop on me 3 past situations that she felt mildly upset about. Disclosing that it probably wasn't a big deal, but if it wasn't a big deal... WHY DID YOU BRING IT UP?? 

I am there constantly for this friend in so many ways emotionally and it's like.. the one time I said directly, not angrily or insensitively that I wasn't in the headspace, she goes to highlight that as a PROBLEM. 

Like wtf..  I've had so many times where I found it difficult to be open and how I feel or be direct. Where I admit there are times that when I'm not I'll isolate or get agitated. But I actually communicated clearly and talked. For once. For effing once.

She just dumped on me this stuff, blindsided.  Where I feel like I bend over backwards to meet her needs. 

What did I do? I told her how I felt upset by what was said.. I told her I had to go because I really didn't know how I was feeling other than frustrated and I recognized for myself it was not a good place for me to continue a conversation that deep down I do want to be friends with. 

This just makes me feel so lonely and not understood. I have really great friends but they live states away. This is the only friend who is close by and I just don't know as I get older how to make more friends. I like this friend, and when things are good they are good. It just sucks when things get like this, I just feel like what's the effing point of being friends with her. Why be friends with anyone and just be by myself.

Pretty much everyone I've ever been interested in is either taken or not interested in me. I have limited opportunities to meet women IRL and online dating is a total shitshow (needless to say, that doesn't work either). For a long time, I've dealt with self-esteem issues and anger/frustration because of this. The closest I came to having a girlfriend was a couple of online ""relationships"" with women who lived too far away for me to realistically meet. Now I say in an effort to be kinder to myself: ""I can do a lot of things, but attracting women isn't one of them.""

The first ""relationship"" was with a girl I met on a pen pal website in another state when I was 15. We both liked cars and video games and had a similar taste in music. Anyway, her parents stopped us from talking to each other (at first I thought it was because they were racist since she was white and I'm Latino). We reconnected a few years later. By this time, she moved on to someone else and is now engaged to the man. We agreed to just be friends, but now she won't even answer my messages and it's been like this for more than a year. It is safe for me to assume she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

The second one was with a woman from England. I fell madly in love with her and she was very sweet and laughed at my memes/jokes. Then, she (in her words) got too busy to talk to me and found someone in England. I was really crushed about this because she goes on vacation in my state and I potentially could have met her IRL. Now, I don't have to worry about that anymore, I guess...

The last ""relationship"" was with a woman with Russian immigrant parents (she was from Colorado, though). I was especially attracted to her since I am a huge Russophile and have a thing for women from that part of the world. Anyway, she told me she loved and cared about me and she ended up ghosting me for another man and had a kid with him. When I confronted her, she blamed everything on me because I got too attached.

Whatever, nothing I do seems to work. Maybe I'm just not meant to have a partner. Whenever I come close, the opportunity is taken from me. I don't know how much more my heart can take. I haven't met anyone else since this last woman and I just miss that feeling of connection and feeling wanted and loved by a woman. Maybe this is just too much to ask for.

3804,MagneticTheShaman,1636571950,1,"Hey y'all! Philadelphia native here (USA). After graduating school many of my friends and I went our separate ways, with me going to college in upstate NY. I've been back in Philly for 4 years now (26) though it still feels like I'm starting over again as the new guy at some points. A lot of my closer friends from college live outside of Philly (mostly in NYC) so I feel at a loss. Meeting new people in my mid-20's has been tougher than I thought and it also doesn't help that I mostly work nights and that I can be a bit of a homebody. Suggestions on ways or places to meet new people (outside of just the bar scene)? Or anyone else in a similar place looking for new friends? Would love to meet more people in my city, but also not opposed to new online friends who wanna talk!

Some things I'm interested in:

* Anime
* Cartoons and animation in general
* Hip-Hop (all types, if I had to label I would say mostly in ""boombap"", ""jazz rap"", ""90's"", but I love Hip-Hop culture overall)
* Older R&amp;B, electronic, house, I just love listening to and making music
* Live shows (I'm also a recording/performing artist - music on my profile!)
* Cooking
* Creepypasta and true horror/crime
* Film and television (drama, horror, Sci-Fi, fantasy)
* Afrofuturism and African Diaspora Studies
* Kingdom Hearts and Pokemon
* I would also love to learn about D&amp;D",lonely,(Philly/NYC) - Anyone else find making new friends in your 20's is challenging?,2021-11-11 06:19:10

3808,ThrowAwayPillow123,1636570479,1,"I'm sitting at work about to cry because I'm just so overwhelmed by these feelings. Feelings of loneliness, isolation, hopelessness, apathy, anger, sadness, touch-starvation. Feelings I've had in some capacity for the past 15 years (I'm 29 now), but that are stronger now than they've ever been.  

I don't have any more IRL friends left. I've never been in a romantic relationship. I don't know what it feels like to hold hands or cuddle with someone I love and who loves me equally. I have a few online friends that I sometimes talk to but I can tell their patience is wearing thin because I always feel this way. I'm sure it's frustrating to not be able to help someone, or to feel like they can't be helped, so I don't blame them for becoming less interested over time.  

And I know I only have myself to blame. I'm ugly and fat, lazy, short-tempered, unintelligent, financially irresponsible, and an overall negative person to be around. I have no goals, dreams, ambitions, or desires. No hobbies outside of consuming media (games/tv/movies) to distract from these feelings. Who would *want* to be my friend, let alone my life partner? Nobody. Particularly nobody that I'd find attractive.  

In order to find a relationship (the only thing I want in life), I'd have to change pretty much everything about myself in order to become attractive to the right people. But because I barely have enough motivation to get out of bed and go to work most days, there's no way I'll accomplish any real change. Besides, with how I live now, I won't live for another 29 years, so what's the point?

3809,1000asses,1636570408,1,"They asked for me to go into the office at 2p.m. to fill a application. if all goes well I might end up a night shift security worker. Or I might end up in daytime. 

But I have this fear of people for some reason. And I have a really hard time expressing myself with others so all this doubt and negativity is going into me. The last time I had a security job, which was in September, I ended up not going back because of those fears and the job they had me do was hard to learn. But this job is really good too and pays really well. Its not new, ive had this job before. Like 5 years ago.

But since its going to be with people I have met in the past, Im stuck wondering if they will notice how much I had changed since being locked into my room and having a psychotic break. Im going to ask if I can do night shifts then work my way to day shifts. Night shifts are easier.

3812,PyrpleKat,1636568156,1,"The other night I was in a discord with some ""friends"". We were talking, goofing and things were chill and silly. We talked about jumping into vc and have a conversation. 

People in the voice chat started reacting kind of weird asking where squeaking was coming from. I was confused thinking they were making a joke or something, as they started asking me if I was playing animal crossing. I said no, but kept asking me if I was playing animal crossing. 

One of them said ""I think you should change your mic"". Still not really sure what was going on or what they might be hearing I went into my mic settings. Before I could ask if my audio was any better one of them just left. I asked what happened and the person I'm friends with also just left without saying anything, leaving me in vc by myself. 

I tested my mic and reset it, hopefully fixing. I asked what happened and why did everyone leave without actually telling me what was wrong and what they were hearing, but was promptly ignored and pretty much just left in the dust. 

When I did finally get a response it was unnecessary aggressive, them acting like I was messing up my mic on purpose, again stating they could  ""only hear my animal crossing audio"". Only then did i actually get clarification on what they were hearing ( mic cutting out and strange background noise). 

But what I don't understand is why didn't they just say that? Or type in the vc chat? Why did just leave and not come back to see if my mic situation was better? Why was I treated as if I was using my mic audio to be obnoxious when that wasn't the case? Am I overreacting??",lonely,Got left in a vc chat and treated poorly for no reason,2021-11-11 05:15:56

I feel like I missed out on a lot in my youth because I never went out. I was always at home playing video games or doing something by myself.

When the lockdown happened my lifestyle didn't change at all and I feel like that is saying how isolated I live.

I had some coworker friends and we kept a nice relationship and got to know each other pretty well. When I left they kept saying how we have to hang out everyday and keep in close contact but that never happened. I told them before about some events and they went without me. I hit them up to hang out but they mostly ignore me. Maybe like once a week one of them will just say something but it never leads to anything.

I don't really know what to do I don't have fun playing video games or watching tv. I like to go to the park and walk but I'm by myself and I don't really feel any different.

I have know N for 2 years, the same length as my coworkers.

Four months ago, I married to my wife (K). Two weeks earlier, one of my best friends, coworker of mine (N), and someone that I hold very dear, prepared a bachelor party, one shared with my future wife and me.

The thing is that the majority of the people invited there where coworkers of mine. N explicitly said that we had to reserve someday to be with them. When the day arrived, K asked via whattsapp to meet for breakfast, and they all refused, everyone of them with a different excuse. 

We had no idea to what was happening. Then, a friend of N, M, comes with C and her car to pick us up, to bring us to where they were hosting the party. For what they say, when we arrived we had a long face, and K did say some sarcastic jokes about everything that had happened, but was angry about the way they had done the surprise. 

In my case, I was overexcited, because why not, it was my bachellor party. The thing is that in one of the tests where one of us had to guess a film and the other had to use their body to make the other guess the title of the film. N said the title to my ear, and I considered the film to be so bad that I screamed: “This movie is shitty!, this is the worst test!”. To what everyone interpreted that i called the party shitty and everything.

Then, everything changed. Many of my coworkers became distant to me. And even more with my wife.

N takes us to a bar, and after taking four beers, she begins to lash out to us about our attitude in the party, manly accusing K of being nervous and angry and me being overexcited. K begins to cry and feels guilty about everything, and I began to argue with N, saying that I didn’t know that i reacted that way, and that I was sorry about everything. Then, N said that if we didn’t make a gesture with our coworkers, there would be “a wound that won’t close up”. We invited them to a breakfast, where we apologized about everything. She apologized about the bachellor party, saying that it was not her intention to cause more nervousness to us.

But it never was the same again. My coworkers, and specially, those more friendly with N, began to ignore me. When I talked with N, she began lashing out to me, about “you are a dramaqueen, like C, my ex!”, “you live in the past, I am in the present”, “you always pick the worst time to talk”, “you make me feel weird and uncomfortable, you don’t even greet me when you enter in the bar”, and so on, and I said to her that we used to have a sweet and caring relationship, and what was the matter. She said “look for a friend that is caring to you, because I am not like this, and you know it. Have you ever listened to me? Let’s have a pacific demeanor between us, and that’s it”.

I feel really bad about this situation, and I tried my best to apologize for everything that could have offended my colleagues, but N doesn’t seem to want to talk to me, even when everyone, including her, tell me that “she loves you very much, but she is not prepared to talk to you”. 

I have to add that I have social anxiety, but my wife is a perfect example of serenity and kindness. Never before a group of friends terminated contact with us such a manner.

TL;DR - Wife and me lost a group of friends and a dear friend for acting weird in our bachelor party, compromising in the process all my laboral environment.",lonely,Feeling lonely after this situation occurred,2021-11-11 04:31:33

3822,egyptianman98,1636564106,1,"hi, before anything i want to state that i am egyptian, muslim so of the things i will say might seem weired but it's pretty natural in here i am just hoping that another PoV might open up my eyes, thank you.

My problem is my family or me i can't tell, recently i've been reading a book on depression (feeling good, david burns) took the test in the book it turned out i'm severly depressed, took other tests too the results are nearly exact, the book suggested that depression might be the reason that i lay in bed all day.

when i was a child from 6 to 14 my father would beat the **** out of me, i once passed out and he didn't even stop until my uncle and 2 other men pulled him away, that's was the worst time i passed out because that tree branch he used very thick and it hit me really hard, usually he would beat me with an old 5mm cable folded two times making it 4 cables 5mm each, the hit marks would disappear two weeks later.

Even though back then i was happy, alittle bit weired compared to other kids but nothing unusual, i had some close friends too.

9 years ago we had a fire accident at home mom and sister got burnt. My sister died next day, My mom is alive and well, ever since then i became introverted i would in the house for weeks and not go out, i don't have any friends till now, and ever since that my father stopped beating me.
 i have alot of people i know from college but we ain't really that close even though i might be the most famous guy in there, some girls have a crush on me but i ignore them cuz i tend to speak bad to girls in ways that hurt them so i ignored them cuz i don't like it when i hurt others emotionally.

now, our house has been falling for 4 years now, we have a wall on 2nd floor that might fall and kill someone in the street, My dad has enough land to buy probably 3 or 4 houses (or build our house for like 10-15 times) but he is too gready to do it because he keeps saying that if i sell any land i won't be able to buy any again, not just that he plants stuff in the lands and makes my mom go and sell it while he takes care of the land, My mom would wake up at 4 am everyday travel alone in train for about 20 miles and my mom would comeback at around 4pm, sometimes the selling is so bad and she returns at 8pm, she doesn't go every day, it's like 3 months a year.

So, anyway what happens is i get so upset about the situation and i end up blowing in his face like really bad, not insulting but some harsh words, one time i saw some tears on his face.
Don't get me wrong i love my father more than anyone in the world, but i can't shut up with him ruining our life, and each time he threatens me that he would stop paying for my college.
We became close alittle even though he is 40 years older than me, but today i was very flooded with everything happening and my depression so i decided to ignore him and be very cold towards him but i could see that he is very sad that i am treating him like that, he didn't say a thing but i am very upset and feeling like really guilty for it, i can't seem to find the right thing to do, so if i am an ***** tell me, and tell the right thing to do, if not tell me how can i live with such burdens.",lonely,Just want to talk,2021-11-11 04:08:26

3828,lawnguy85,1636560672,1,"Thought this would be the appropriate place to vent given this is the sub where I met this person.  A couple years ago I met a girl on here who was going through a similar situation, I reached out like ""Hey I know what you're feeling because I feel it too.""  It didn't take long for us to hit it off.  We quickly became very close, about as close as you can get via the internet.  We shared EVERYTHING about each other, got to know each other's families, our pets...  we shared our deepest, darkest secrets with each other.  We talked every single day.  We shared the good times, we shared the bad times.  We had each other's backs, or so it seemed.

She told me she loved me, that she would always be there for me.  I reciprocated, because I felt the same way.  It all was great until it wasn't...  Now it's all one way.  Now it's, ""Hey how have you been?""  ""I'm great!  Just had the best day ever!""  The end.  No more.  No, ""How are you?  How are the kids?""  Nothing.

Had covid recently.  Felt fine after a couple days.  When I was in rough shape I told her about it.  It was basically, ""Oh no!""  The end.  Never checked in to see how I was doing, how everyone else was doing, nothing.  Texted her the next week, no mention of it, nothing.  Just the usual ""I'm great!"" Type of response.

It was truly something special, at least to me.  It all seems to be gone now and I feel incredibly hurt by it...  She meant so much to me, and now it's like a kick in the teeth.  It reaffirms my lack of trust in anyone.  When I do open up I just get screwed.

3840,NefariousnessTrick44,1636548763,1,"Hey guys, i just need to let my heart out for a sec.

Basically, like a year ago I had a really cute friendgroup. We were 5 Girls who almost did everything together and were living our best life.

I will name them:

H - my bestie 

Z - a girl i used to be really good friends with because she lives almost next to me

U - friends with T

T - was a good friend because we shared a lot of similar interests

But eventually, we kinda split up because of some things that happened:

1. Z started to ignore us for quite a while and acted like she doesn't know us anymore. When we tried to talk to her, she said that she felt like we would exclude her, so that fell apart and then we were 4.
2. We had a really long and strict lockdown and online school where I live, so we couldn't meet each other. I just hung out with my bestie (H) here and then. That's why we weren't that close anymore with U and T but we still texted a lot and stuff like that.
3. Before summer break, I did a lot with T. But in the summer holidays, she started to not answer to my texts. I had an odd feeling about it but I just waited till school started again. She started to act weird around me so I texted her if she could tell me why she behaved that way. She started to accuse me for being so toxic in the past and wishes to not have any sort of relationship with me anymore. Because she didn't mention any kind of example what I've done (I still can't explain myself what I've done if I'm being honest) I wanted to talk to her again but I've told her I still need some time to process what she said because I couldn't believe that I hurt someone so bad and I really felt like shit bout it.
4. I asked U if she could give me any example what I have exactly done because I wanted to hear another view of point about it without any strong emotions but she didn't help me in any way.
5. T then texted me then that she realised she doesn't want to talk to me about it because she doesn't want to give me a chance anymore, even tho I didn't expect to be friends with her anymore, I just wanted to also end this topic for me but well-
6. Then, suddenly, everybody started to turn their backs against me (except H :)) and I suspect that T started to talk to everyone I know about it and now in school, she looks at me with a death stare and when I'm standing with them all in the breaks, they react kinda weird, especially T and she starts to exclude me in conversations and acts like I'm not here. They always talk about stuff they are doing outside of school and never invite me and that hurts because they are a really big group with people I'm also lowkey friends with me but since this whole thing with T happened, I don't feel that comfy with them anymore and they give me the feeling I'm just lost in their group :/.

I'm not saying that I've never done/said toxic stuff in my life because I'm human and it's normal to not be perfectly nice all the time. But I just can't think of anything that I've done to T that was that bad.

I suspect that she was lowkey jealous of me because I used to be one of the more popular kids in school and later I was finding out that she had the same crush as me, which she didn't tell me about and confessed to him before I did (I didn't care that much tbh, I was happy for them lol but she broke up with him one month later because she didn't like him anymore and played with him a lot?).

Well yeah idk if anyone will read this and understands what is up lmao I just needed to vent a bit.

I just feel a bit lonely rn and excluded. I only have my best friend now but she also has a lot of other friends so I'm not always her first choice.

Our inside jokes are special, we like all of the same stuff, same taste in music, same age range etc. but I grew up, I regret how much time I wasted with this friend
Anyways I’m wondering should I be alone and just focus on my craft? Should I just stop thinking about having a friend/ group? Will I ever had a friend group again?

I do have a couple of friends and a partner (32M) and I really try to take care of everything and everyone, especially of my little sister.

But with everything and everyone depending on me it's just too much to bear. I'm also still healing but nobody cares and nobody even listens or even let's me finish when I try to open up about my struggles.

3850,RepulsiveAd3338,1636543447,1,"Hello everybody,

Why the hell does university have to suck this bad? Came here three years ago from my home country. I was happy, the happiest I've ever been, during the last years of high school back home. Throughout my three years here abroad in uni, I have only made 1-3 friends. Even these 1-3 I'm not even really close with. My English is OK, I can speak relatively well, received some praises about my English. BUT, as good as my English is, I will never surpass locals.   
Basically everyone has already formed cliques. I have known about this since last year, but it really struck me today as we were all waiting in front of the exam hall. (Yep, you guessed it right, I was the one standing alone.) I can't just jump into their cliques, you guys know that! I've tried joining a uni sporting club ONCE, and that shit sucked real bad. That sport is the only sport I'm into; other than that, I have no other interest or hobby. Everyone in the club was Chinese (mind you, I'm Chinese too but can't speak it at all), and as I entered the field, everyone has already formed a group, talked in Chinese, not even acknowledging me. Then I played, those guys were too good for me. It just felt so wrong being in there. So I didn't even bother coming back.   
Not many international students in my cohort, mostly locals. I find it really hard to connect with them as they obviously prefer fellow locals for obvious reasons. Not looking for advice because I've read hundreds of them already. No one can save me but myself (or maybe somebody can.. or a 10 million dollars lottery, hehe). Never had a girlfriend.  
Well, thank you for reading my written expression of the clutters in my mind. Rant below, I'll read them. Now back to studying!!!

No we didn't try to get back together, I simply reminded her that this was going to happen and calmed her down until she fell asleep. But it reminded me of what I had. Having a bestfriend and a girlfriend all in one, was amazing. I've been dating around and making friends a long the way. As I heated up some soup and poured it in a bowl, I caught myself just staring into it. Thinking why should I eat this, why not just get drunk and forget! My soup is still sitting here and I just feel so alone.

Why are good people hard to come across? In the dating scene it feels that girls have lost intimacy and expect to be treated like a queen with no intention of treating you like a king. In the friendship world, even the closest people will stab you in the back if it'll benefit them. I still have my small little circle, but noone is available at the moment and it just hit me hard enough to post here after a while of not. 

I was watching the Amityville horror, and there was a scene where George was just lying on the dock and I never related so much to it. I just feel so weak to keep going...

They were just like me !!!! And we even had the same issues , thoughts and mannerisms.  I changed my life for the better , learned about myself and tried to be the man I wan to be. All with the help of my spirit twin.

I felt invincible and for once the hole in me was filled. I made plans , went broke on a trip to them, and planned a life together. I could have died happy any moment without regret.

They slowly pulled away till the only communication was me begging and pleading for time and to hear their thoughts but I still was there when they needed me. But I never got anything I needed back after that.

I cried , begged and clawed at them and got  apologies for their depression. 

I will never be happy again.  AND SHUT THE FUCK UP  with “ it takes time , and you will be happy one day “ bull shit !

I tend to feel much more depressed after watching movies or listening to songs that involve families, love scenes (not necessarily sexual), and pets loving or being loves by their owners.

Reason being is how much these scenes remind me of how nobody will have those same reactions with me.

I.e. a family grieving their kid that died in literally any way, because I have no family.

Even watching the final episode of ""The 100"" on Netflix, when all the friends were together again, I had to stop watching because of my inability to cope with the fact that there's no friends in my life. Nothing. I've pushed everyone away after my ex left me and I have no capability to make new ones.

I don’t even feel a connection with the majority of my family other than my mom. Even then, there’s so much she doesn’t know about me.

For the most part, I enjoy my solitude but sometimes, late at night I get this overwhelming feeling of loneliness. I see or hear about people with these super close friendships that last years.

It’s not like I’m a misanthrope or anything, there are many people I actually find quite fascinating. Yet, I still can’t bring myself to care about opening up and sharing my life with other people.

3918,beatNick_,1636509247,1,"You don’t really know what you want because you already have what you want. If you didn’t have it then you would have some sense of what void needs to be filled. More importantly, for you to know what you want you need to first know you. But you can’t know yourself because you cannot expose yourself to your own identity, just like a knife would have to be able to cut itself to prove to itself that it is a knife. Can you become aware of your own awareness? No. So the search is over, you are complete. There’s no need to worry about the past, the present, or the future, you are already complete. But as the knife you still need to stay sharp or you will struggle unnecessarily to function.

Nothing matters. If you can’t even know yourself then what can you really know? You can never know if the values you hold even reflect who you are. Did you even create or verify these values or were they imposed on you to create a false self? If you don’t have any values does that even reflect who you are? If you have created values for yourself after nihilism does that reflect who you are? People are so concerned with responding that they could care less about what’s right or wrong, what they know or don’t know. Even if they were concerned with right and wrong, rules and morals are made up. Even if they were concerned with what they know and don’t know, truths are illusions so why not prefer untruth? Perceptions are distorted by beliefs and unbeliefs so why take anything you observe seriously? How many people juggle tasks everyday to provide themselves a means to live as they indulge in consumerism to numb the pain of not having a reason to live? Consciousness, the I, is only awareness. It does not think, feel, sense, or do anything. It is just aware of thought, feeling, stimuli, and action. You are not the thinker, feeler, sensor, or doer. You are not a creator of anything. One of the benefits of nihilism is that it manages psychological stress, shame, guilt, and resentments. Shit happens, so you learn a lesson, and it never mattered, you move on.

Everything doesn’t matter so it follows that the idea ‘nothing matters’ also doesn’t matter. This compatibility opens up the opportunity that nothing matters while there are still things worth your time. If you do nothing because nothing matters you will suffer unnecessarily. It would also suggest that inactivity matters to you. If you use ‘nothing matters’ as an excuse for neglecting responsibilities it shows a lack of control over your own life, particularly that you are emotionally immature, or crippled, because you don’t feel like doing what you are meant to take ownership of. One idea suggests that just because you make the judgement that something doesn’t matter, a negation, that is not necessarily an objection to it:

“The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating.” - Nietzsche

Why does a nihilist eat food and drink water?  Because he knows it is life-preserving.

Life-Promoting Activities:
- Work, Study
- Solitude, Connection
- Thinking, Creating
- Exercise, Diet

You are a product of your own refinement. Stay sharp.",lonely,Stay Sharp,2021-11-10 12:54:07
3919,Kimmykimdoesit,1636508362,1,"
So, I’m not sure if it’s just me, but a lot of times I just feel like I’m not normal because I never really got to experience things most other people have during their childhood and early adult stages. 

Like I remember being really young and not really understanding why I never really had friends or why I wasn’t able to form relationships with people, but without explicitly saying it, I knew that there was something wrong with me because either I was treated differently by my peers and teachers at school or I was constantly scolded by my family members at home about why I needed to stop being anxious all time and speak up more. Of course, me being the way I was wasn’t a good look for them, so I was also seen as an embarrassment since I never really acted like a normal child…I guess 

To describe my personality or the way I would think others perceive me is being really shy, nervous, and very isolated from others. I don’t really think there is much of an issue with me being this way because I still talk to people, but apparently that is a a problem and I really don’t know how to change myself because I’ve practically been this way my entire life. 

So, over time it made me really sad because I went basically my entire childhood without really having anyone. The times where I actually did make friends, my family would always say things to try and get me to stop being around them even though they weren’t causing me any harm and so I pushed them away. Sometimes I regret cutting off my old friends and wish that I still had them, but I was still a young child and was just so tired of hearing negativity all the time, so I thought that was the only thing really left to do.  

Now I just feel like I’m not even worthy of having friendship or any kind of relationship for that matter because everything just never ends well for me. I was bullied in school, I couldn’t really form any sort of bond with my relatives, and if I ever did try talking with someone (like a friend), they would either just use me, pretend to care for me, or betray me. So I really don’t know what to do at this point because I’ve done what I could to make myself happier, but nothing seems to work.

I tried going to therapy a few times and I hoped it would help to talk about my issues to see if there was an underlying problem that I needed to fix, but each time I went, they were always making it seem like it was my fault for being the way I was or that I never tried or did what they said to do, even though I did. 

So now I often cry about it because I just wish I was able to live a normal life and enjoy the things other people do with their friends like hanging out, traveling, or inviting each other to go places. Often times I go out by myself, so it makes me feel a little sad to see other people laughing and smiling with their friends when  I’m all alone, feeling so left out. Even when I am invited to go places, I still feel like I stick out or that I don’t belong, so instead I choose to spend most of my time at home. It would be really nice to have people to talk to and hang out with or even have someone to care about my well-being, but I doubt it will happen anytime soon, so maybe it is just best for me to be alone.

What makes it worse is that I’m awfully shy and introverted so I never go out and meet people. Idk how other shy people do it.
For the past few days though I developed a small crush on this guy I work with. I know people say it’s a bad idea to mix business with pleasure but idc about that honestly. And I can’t help who I like.
What drew me to him is his personality, he just seems like a nice guy and very friendly easy-going. He just seems very easy to talk to.We only say a quick hi and bye to each other because I work on the front and he’s in the back.

But anyways I was looking over the schedules and I noticed his name isn’t there anymore. And also my manager today put up this list of all the team members so everyone can pick out their holiday gift and his name wasn’t there either. It sucks because I kinda planned on getting to know him or at least keep building on our small conversations . The only method I would have to talk to him is to message him on GroupMe since that is what we use for work.  But since I barley talk to him at work I could never be bold enough to randomly message him and talk about what? 😪
I mean I wasn’t trying to catch feelings quickly anyways because idk if he’s single but damn… I didn’t even get a chance to try and get to know him lol.

(Written on mobile)

I ()dont know why I'm posting this, I just feel a need to rant and got nobody to rant to. Recently I moved away to college on the other side of my country. Its been tough adjusting. With covid, my course is taught mostly online with some stuff in person. I've tried to make friends, tried to go out, tried to get a bf (I'm gay). 

I tried making friends with a flatmate of mine, Emma. Things started off amazing, we hit off like a house on fire. Eventually I told her about a guy I had a crush on, Jones. She hyped me up and all that and things were good. To cut a long story short, we went out one night (Jones and i) and we ran into Emma. She was drunk and ended up sleeping with him that night, in a bed on the other side of my wall. I didn't sleep much that night. It was worse when he told me what happened the next day and asked me for advice on how to ask her out. I did tell him the truth and told him I couldn't help him.

But that's how that happened. The next thing was a guy i met on Grindr, Alex. We met up up hit it off. We didn't do much that night but it felt amazing being close to someone. We text back and forth for a week or so (he got tonsillitis and we couldn't meet up cause he was too sick). Things were going okay until he told me last Friday that he doesn't want a relationship right now. That hit me hard, but I survived. We decided to stick as friends and see where the future takes us. Cut to today, we chat and all of a sudden he blocks me on all platforms.

I'm just sitting here, fighting off tears. Because I feel like every attempt I've made down here at friends or more has came back and hurt me worse than loneliness could. (A few other things I can't mention cause it'll take too long). I'm at my desk struggling to not cry. To not curl up in my bed and weep.

I've always felt lonely in life. As I child I felt like the other kids weren't mature enough, hence I didn't give them much time. In secondary school (grades 7-12 for you americans), I moved to a new school and took me a long time to adjust, meet people and be okay with myself. At that point everyone had solid friend groups and any time I joined one I felt like I missed too much, ergo not a friend. I've never felt a close connection to anyone that has lasted longer than a year. 

The problem is, I don't think I'm depressed or anything. I tell people about my life and they wonder how I still go and I don't know myself. I want to wake up for the chance tomorrow will be better. Again, I don't know why I'm here. Maybe to hear a few encouraging comments? I don't know. 

I just feel lost, as if I am doing everything right but keep getting the wrong results. I just want a human connection with someone that's not complicated. That I genuinely feel comfortable around. I know it's only 2 months into college and I should hold out for a post covid experience but it's hard. I see all my other flatmates going out and making friends.

That feeling was around until I told her I have a crush on her and she told me she did too, I never felt happier in my life at that moment.

Everything following that was horrible though, I never had any experience with that sort of thing and she didn't either, I always wish we could start over but I fucked up and we are wayy past that but I still love and appreciate her more than anyone in my life.

3953,ThrowawayD47,1636495920,1,"I() have asked 4 girls out this year and every one turned me down, some left me disappointed and some just left me confused. I'm not sure If I'm writing this to get sympathy, advice, or just to get my feelings out, but any input would be appreciated.

The first one looked like a deer in headlights when I asked her. We literally stared at each other for what felt like 10-20 seconds saying nothing before she said sure. She gave me her number but I had to text her twice over the course of a week for her to respond, and when she did, she said she wasn't looking for anything right now. Not sure why she agreed in the first place, but whatever.

The second, who is in my English class, I texted on instagram asking her out and she said she had a boyfriend. I have no reason to doubt that so I took it as bad luck and moved on.

The third girl I asked out immediately after my final class with her and she gave me her number. Again, I texted her twice over the course of the week with the most basic messages and she never responded. The day after I asked her out, I accidentally overheard her say to her friends, ""I didn't want to be mean"" That's all I heard but I started overanalyzing and I think there's a 50/50 chance she meant she didn't want to turn me down and be mean so she just said yes. After a week of her not responding, I tried to approach her again after last period but she immediately called someone after class ended and walked the opposite direction she normally does(the way I also go). The next day I went the other way with her and said her name, but she either didn't hear it or ignored it. I got closer and said it again, she was starting to call someone again, and I asked if she was still down to hangout, and she responded that she has a boyfriend so she doesn't think it's a good idea. I said, ""my bad, I didn't know"" and left it at that. We were still walking the same way, but she abruptly stopped and walked to a nearby bathroom. I don't want to be paranoid, but with all of this together, I feel like she was trying to avoid me and that she probably made up the boyfriend as an excuse. It just left me feeling kind of defeated since she agreed at first and if she was avoiding me, then she couldn't even treat me like a person and turn me down.

That last girl I asked out today. I have a dual enrollment class at a nearby community college and introduced myself to a girl in my class I haven't talked to. I made a small joke and she laughed, but when I asked for her number she said she had a boyfriend. Once again, I have no reason to doubt her, and it's not like she was mean or even really indicated that there was something wrong with me. It's just that it feels like the last straw.

At this point I just feel defeated and sad. For context, I have great self esteem: I think I'm fairly attractive, I'm pretty intelligent, I try to have a decent personality(although I'm definitely not cool or popular), I take pride in my appearance by working out and dressing well, and although it's not a personal trait, I also drive a pretty cool convertible which adds to it. It just feels like it's taken a bit of a hit. I feel like if I were really the way I pictured myself, then I wouldn't have to ask out four girls and not get even one date. The two that originally said yes and later retracted it made me feel especially bad. The fact they couldn't have the decency to say no outright(getting my hopes up in the process) and the fact that they just left me hanging makes me feel(as dramatic as this is) worthless. Anyway I don't know what to do, but I just feel lonely and self-conscious.

4003,AngelKatt-xo,1636478530,1,"So basically I’ve just been really lonely. It feels like everyday is a never ending cycle of misery. I wake up early, always tired and fatigued, go to school where I have no friends and nothing to look forward to. Then once that’s over I go home just to immediately go to work at a job I don’t enjoy. I get home with a few hours to spare before I need to sleep to do it all over again. If this is essentially what life is I don’t really see the point in living. It’s just a really tiring and unfun process. I’ve always thought I wanted to die yknow. But after losing my aunt in 2019 to suicide I realized just how permanent death was. I feel the only thing that is stopping me from killing myself is the fear of what comes after.. the fear of pain. Lately though I have been trying to find reasons to kill myself. I believe that’s even more scary to myself.

Another big issue of mine is my self esteem. I’m not that attractive. I don’t wanna get into details because people I’ve met on here have used my insecurities to hurt me further which I don’t appreciate. But I’ll just say that I’m 17 and I don’t look it. When I look at my face I see the lines, the eye bags, the spots, the discoloration. My body is awful too. It’s to the point I avoid looking at myself in mirrors because whenever I do my brain just works against me. People say just lose weight but how am I gonna do that if I can’t even find reasons to leave my bed in the morning. People say just eat healthy, I guess that’s simple enough if healthy food was as comforting to me. 
Either way I have been eating less, I just don’t have enough time for meals like I used to. 

And lastly I am extremely lonely. I desperately yearn to be loved by someone, anyone. I see people all over who are happy with people who give them the world. I just wish there was someone for me. Someone who wanted to be with me, to spend time with me, to listen to me, to hold me when I’m sad. I think I’m just craving the comfort I never receive.

After I graduated high school, I turned into a complete loner. I didn’t make or keep any friends. I had no one but the Internet, really. During school, I had 3 close friends but we don’t talk often nowadays. For a year, I barely left my home only to throw out the trash if it stacked too high. I cried everyday multiple times a day. I wanted to escape myself but couldn’t do anything permanent. I didn’t see anyone or talk to anyone. I’ve never dated before either so I didn’t have any broken connections. Just no connections at all. I was previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety and went to therapy for a few months before money ran out. I also had to meet with a nutritionist because I had an eating disorder.
However, I decided to do a study abroad program for a year. My mom was really against it because she knew I was always a lonely person. For someone with no friends, I imagined how difficult it would be since everyone would be in the same friend-less position as me. Now I don’t really get along with the other students in my program. I think a part of me likes being alone.
But somehow by chance, at the subway station, I met someone who means everything to me. And surprisingly, they grown to really love me. I never believed in love before but thought it would be great if it did exist. But here I have it! I never imagined a person like me would be so lucky. We are getting promise rings during Christmas time. I also met his mom, and I feel so happy. 
Because he cares so much about my health, I realized I really want to get better. For the first time in my life, I want to get better! Love really is a fragile thing.

My biased dad will try to get involved, tell us to shut up, and normally I will, but my sister won't, and when I get too aggravated by her and try to reply to her I get told to shut my mouth by my dad so when she tries to act like a child again I don't engage anymore cause i know that I'll lose. The first time it happened I was hurt but to be honest I don't really care now, this isn't me being passive aggressive. I just realized that my my family were people that I wouldn't like adoring me. And don't get me started on my mom, I'm not exaggerating when I say in my 15 years living, that she has never lost an argument even if she's the problem nor has she ever tried to compromised, she's an hypocrite and a mental gymnast. She's the one to tell us not to yell  when we're arguing but when an argument broke out she's the first one to lose her shit and start yelling and shit. I feel like I've ranted enough about my family and my social life so I'll stop now. 

I'm spiraling down, life is getting more bland and I'm getting more number by the day, I hate almost everything in this world, this shitty pandemic, the shitty things that's been happening in the world.  I used to blow all my time on social media because it's my only solace from my devoid of social life and shitty environment but it's been spoiled by the bad news, the people who think so highly of themselves here, the hive mind, I hate it all. Including myself, I'm ugly, I hate my voice, I hate my body, that hate goes very deep to the point where I consider harming myself and the only thing that's stopping me from doing so is the consequences, I don't wanna have to deal with my parents saying shit about how I just didn't prayed enough and didn't surrender it to god or why it's because I'm always on social media. I hate it, I hate it,  I'd like to do something about it but I either sabotage myself or some events happen that fucks me up more like let's say the corona virus, i'm tired of me trying to better myself that just for my efforts to be absolutely crushed. I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, I feel so lonely and afraid.

4016,halfcupofcoffee,1636468973,1,"I’m so lonely. I’m always lonely. I have no one to talk to and I feel like no one cares about me until I’m in an absolute low. No one ever texts me unless I text them first and once no one noticed when I went to the hospital for a bit over a week. My mom doesn’t care, my dad doesn’t care, and my brother doesn’t care. They only care about their bullshit cult that they call a religion. I don’t want to live in this loneliness anymore but everyone tells me “don’t throw your life away” and “we’ll miss you”. 

I’m on six different medications. Six medications every day, some twice a day, just to stay alive and make my brain not be in panic mode 24/7. And don’t forget about all the supplements. Melatonin because my doctor won’t listen to me when I tell him my sleeping pill needs to be changed, vitamin d and iron for my two deficiencies, and biotin because my hair is thinning due to my eating disorder. I don’t want to take them anymore. They’re too much for one person. I’ve been hospitalized five times and because of that my family is in debt.

I’ve tried to make friends and get out of my shell, I’ve really tried my best. And I thought it was going well until the people I thought I made friends with disappeared. Even the person who promised he’d never hurt me or abandon me left. I should honestly give up because I always get hurt. Every. Single. Time. I get abandoned like trash. I don’t want to be abandoned anymore. I want to have friends and a partner like normal people. I want to be like everyone else. Everyone else can deal with their bad thoughts without being hospitalized or whining too much like I’m doing now.

I’ve really tried to fix my situation by using tinder and stuff but it’s not working out. I don’t know what to do now. I’ve had a few matches but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I want a boyfriend or girlfriend like everyone else can have. I want dinner dates and Valentine’s Day and cuddling while watching Netflix. But it seems like I’ll never have that.

I hate this. I hate being abandoned. I’m so scared everyone in my life is going to abandon me like damn near everyone in my life has.

Ill definately talk about things i like but it gets washed out because no one around me cares or relates to it. Like im cool. You dont HAVE to be interested i get it but why make it seem like you are when you know from the start your really wernt..

Why do people say that being too nice of a person makes you seem “disposable”
And then insist that being nice is a choice and its not a personality trait..like there arent kind people and mean people, and like they cant tell..  living here makes me feel like friends arent worth it and love isnt worth it and that im not meant for it. I just keep getting fooled and left. I take everything everyone says to heart because we bleed the same colour and i would want you to do the same for me. Even tho im not saying you have to im just saying its nice to feel like they take you serious. But its like body does. Im a good person and i get treated like im a bad person and people tell me to eat their ass and make assumtions about me because im kind and appearntly ignorant and a bad person because i feel as though people should like people being kind to them.. and that should be human nature. Not 11 men walk in a room and treat a woman politely but the 12th that comes in and ignores her gets her attention... how does that even work like how- even with regular friends and not even relationships its almost like people seem to want a bad person, thats gonna build up your confidence to make you think you could make it drunk driving, as a friend and not the ones whos gonna tell you you shouldnt drive home drunk and offers to pick you up.
Its like people would say “nah im okay” with a friend that would make it easier on them infront of them and go hang with the people that make things harder. I could understand . Someone thats too nice or like safe is boring but at the same time people never even care enough to think im worth putting time in to change me and make me comfortable with the fact that i dont need to be so protective and that i dont need to put on a mask that makes it seem like im mean when im uncontrollably kind.

4019,BecMier,1636464803,1,"I’m being closely watched so I might delete this.

I’ve been working on getting myself out of my relationship. Saving up to move myself and my child out and back to the city I work in.
For several years I’ve been told by my mother and boyfriend that I don’t need friends, yet they had latched themselves onto me like a barnacle. Contradicting their own words with gaslighted denial. My boyfriend cheated several times so he now projects his insecurity, and I had finally broken free from my mom only to find myself hours away from everyone. These details do go somewhere.

When I was financially stuck living with my mother at 25 and living in her denial that my bipolar had plunged after watching my dad die while paramedics worked hard on him. Already my mind was clouded, yet every day she filled my head with her insecurities and explaining to me how my friends were abusing my friendship with them. Slowly I let my connections die. I was alone by 30 and finally moved out with my child and barely $1000 in my savings.

I tried to make friends when living on my own, it wasn’t easy but it also wasn’t miserable. I loved our life! But the pandemic hit and I went in solitude with no friends for me and my child since we were new to the area. My brothers were saints and kept me company. They only lived 45 minutes away.

It’s been too long at this point, today I have been moved back in with my ex (ex for a reason) after losing my apartment and not receiving over $0 in government assistance. I was certain he had changed from 10 years ago, it feels like 2011 still. He said I don’t need friends. After a year and a half I hit depression hard and begged to make friends, he told me to go back to work and make friends. I started to make plans to hang out with people I work with (I’m in a union, so these people become family) and I was forced to ghost them because I was told it’s an unacceptable way to make friends. It was just Korean bbq with the crew a week before wrap. I’m new to this area, he moved us 3 1/2 hours away from my job, but tells me he makes enough for me to be a stay at home mom. There are only corn fields and Amazon sized companies here, he has isolated me and my child from everything we loved.

He stalks my Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I don’t know if he knows I have a Reddit account. I have to use my phone service to write this. He can’t know I’m sharing my struggles to others, but strangers who are unaware I exist are the only people I can talk to. My brothers love my boyfriend so they’re unaware of my situation, they live 4 hours away.

If I could have a friend who I can schedule to text or play games with while my boyfriend is asleep or at work, I think I can survive. But I’m also scared to take the risk, at this point I’m trying to survive, I’m sorry.

But really, he watches everything I do so I might end up deleting this. I don’t want him to be mad at me, he’s the only person I know. I hope you understand.",lonely,Secret friendships,2021-11-10 00:33:23

But at the end of the day or maybe in the middle of the day, I face that moment of silence and dread of loneliness that I'm trying to escape, it's a feeling you all know, right ? 

All I have is silence and nobody to talk to and share my thoughts with. I cope with this by writing my thoughts and feelings in my diary in hope that someone would read it. 

I have always moved from one school to another since childhood and there was no way to make close  connections with other classmates because most of them already had friends. I know a lot of people but I can't call even a single person my friend. 

I feel very envious when I see my classmates from different schools going to parties to trips but nobody ever invites me.

 Hell, last month was a big party in college that I didn't know of. Nobody even called to inform me about it. Even after the party was done not a single person asked why I didn't come. It's like I don't even exist anymore. It was heart breaking to see others enjoy while I just stayed in the house.

It's so heartwarming to see that not everyone has to live in such loneliness as me, and in a weird way I can now feel kinda happy for them. It wasn't really like that before covid. But after 20 months of near uninterrupted social isolation, I'm just glad to be around and meet people again, no matter their relationship status.

I feel like my youth is over. July 2019 I turned 21, felt like something around 18 or 19 years old and kinda immature at the time, but still kinda okay and was able to deal with life and cope.

We all know what happened next.

Uni was closed, I lost most contacts that we're already scarce due to everyone getting more and more busy. I spent the latter half of my 21st, my whole 22nd and the start of my 23rd lifeyear in near total isolation, and during that time I felt like a multimorbid 50-90 year old in the body of a drug addicted 35 year old. There's something very gruesome about being forced to watch life pass you by as you lose your motivation for home studying and only desire connection with other people, all the while hitting a near endless stream of misunderstanding and altercation with my family who you can't distance yourself from in any way like I used to be able to by leaving the house for school during the daytime or, well, living at my own place as I wasn't 17 anymore and left my hometown to study in a bigger city.

No matter how much I try to focus on my studies, I've just grown out of the age when I was able to suppress feelings of loneliness and despair in a move of naïvety and sometimes healthy, but often enough toxic motivation.

It's not like I can hope for a next semester with a ""fresh start"" anymore like I used to. I start to question the whole point of sitting my ass off just to end up losing the little bit of social life and free time I'm left with once I start working long hours while my colleagues got to at the very least enjoy their youths and have fun before the 40 year endless grind starts.

I just recently moved back into a dorm in my uni city for the next 2-3 years of final exams and phd work. It's feels so brutally metal to feel motivated to do something again just because I can have somewhat of a positive outlook to see some of my friends again on the weekend.

Oh well, guess I'll go to the barber and come back home for a bit of studying, I'll see how the day goes.",lonely,"I just got reminded that no matter if I ever find love or something next best, I can't imagine it will make up for an entire youth spent in barren loneliness and isolation.",2021-11-09 21:49:48

So count this post as a vent and express your views.
Story- 2 years ago I met a girl at my tuitions, I literally got soo in love with her , we became little bit friends,not much ,trust me just having a female friend in my life was very good,since before that I was never even closer to any girl before that.
We didn't talk much , but the time spent with her just for 2-3 mins only perhaps daily in those 2-3 months was a bliss moment for me. But what I mistaken was that I got soo obsessed with her, earlier she used to give small hints which I thought that's nothing much and I could be true as well, point is I never expressed my feelings and later when it's got a little late I felt her kinda ignoring me , then I realised that I have missed something. Since we were able to meet only till my tuitions lasted ,but I got obsessed with her, I felt she also used me for work related but nevermind, later I saw I was getting obsessed with her, I was lately listening sad romantic songs bla bla .
It was months since I saw her but I still had feelings which made me upset , then I moved on little by little by sending her text once in months, then now finally I am over her, not much contact and it never was , it's just I feel I still have something for her.

I couldn't make a move on her later ,cause I was unable to meet her and it's been 2 years and now at the moment I am not in the same state .
There is still part of me that makes me , but yeah I feel it's out of my reach now since I am hundreds of miles away from her.

I used to feel all this cause I am lonely that's why mostly, and even now when most of the things in life doesn't seems to work my mind wanders in those small moment of happiness I had in those 2-3 months.
That was beautiful ❤️

I never saw any other women after we broke up btw just her.

I felt a lot more comfortable once we didn't technically have a label on it. The reason(s)? Idk maybe I didn't feel tied down? No expectation placed on me? Didn't have to pull the weight of two people.


After she broke up with me she regretted the decision  and wanted to get back together with me. Over the months she tried harder reconcil but I would always say no. I'd say ""we're no good for each other"" ""I like where we are now"". Just shutting her down really.

The more I write, the more it puts my mind to ease but I'm starting to feel like I deserve this. Karma u know.

Anyway 4 days ago I was supposed to go see her. I told her the time I would be there [4pm], she didn't like that time and told me not to bother. 3 days ago she hit me up with a snap talking about how I said"" I would not officially get back together with her and she hope I find someone I'll be happy with. We will always be bestfriends."" (There's more but I can't remember what it all said. I hate snapchat). 4 hours after that she had a guy named ""john"" on her story. I stopped responding after I saw that.

She was out of her house a day or two with john. No one knew where she was. She had a fight with her mom and told off another one of her friends probably while fucked up. Now she did lose her v card to john in middle school, at the time she thought it was rape. She was 14 he was like 18(yeah ik). But over the years she backpeddled on that obviously.

Now I know Im an asshole. But this guy is a piece of work. Suicide baiting ppl, overly verbally cruel with ppl and this just in! Woppin 10 charges of cp. He caught those last week and posted bail. But to be fair the pictures are from when he was in school. Supposedly ex-girlfriends. Idk the ages, could be middle school for all I know. But a better question is WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE THEM AS A 26YO MAN?

A few days later I barely talk to her. She still calls and texts trying to stay in contact but I'm just being cold to her. I feel wronged and betrayed but I'm just not. I'm just bitter man. Tbh I panic and think I should get back with her and a part of me really wants to. But I know I shouldn't, we stayed separated for a reason. Especially if she's been sleeping with that creep.

She hit me up to got to the bar today. She doesn't really like to drink and she's been doing it more. She has history erratic behavior. I hope she isn't going in to a downward spiral. I hope she'll be okay.

**We're all different even though most of us are here for the same reason - we want friends and please don't ever judge others for having their own expectations.We should all feel comfortable with whoever we want to be friends with :) I'm not forcing anyone to talk to me - If you disagree with me and want to find someone completely different - just ignore my post.Everyone deserves to be happy ;)**

**I'm here because I would love to find someone to talk to.I don't have any true friends &amp; I want to change my situation.I don't really want to wait any longer than 5 or 6 hours just to receive a message that can be typed and send in a few seconds or minutes..I'm a human too and I hate excuses..I don't need another shallow friendship. I want to meet someone who wants to talk on a daily basis - why? I want to finally see someone's engagement..I want to talk to someone who also needs a friend to talk to throughout the day.I'm always the one waiting for people's messages and I'm sick of them never making any time for me. &amp; I don't feel understood by them.**

**Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.**

**I personally don't care about people's interests -common interests.What matters to me is your honesty,respect,your outlook on life.**

**I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything**

**I want to meet someone who won't reject me &amp; my friendship**

**My boyfriend used to treat me like a princess to..leave me..&amp; now? I just need a friend..Nothing else**

**I'm not looking for any relationship.Just someone like me.. to cry together and laugh together and support each other.I can't bear the pain..I don't want to hear ""find a therapist"" or ""everything will be ok"" because life is unpredictable..I just want to find someone who can relate..someone in the same situation.Someone who will always be there (If we get along) I need it more than ever.I know how sad my post is but I'm also very sad.I can't believe someone I loved so much just left me.blaming me for everything..I just can't.Nothing hurts more than being super friendless.having no one who understands you..I really would rather talk to someone in exactly the same situation.I'm too sad to talk only about random stuff or hear positive stories from other people.I want to talk to another person willing to listen to me.Another person who doesn't have anyone just to support each other.Someone who would never tell me ""move on"" or ""stop complaining"" someone who needs someone to talk to almost all the time.I don't want to feel like the only sad person in the world or be rejected again.Most people say ""I don't have any friends.I would do anything for a friend"" but they never have time for others..Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.**

**One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone...**

**I feel like only another person in EXACTLY the same situation..would truly understand me.Which is why I'm looking ""for a twin"" I literally don't have anyone and I want to desperately change my situation.I see people's happiness everywhere..On TV,In real,on the internet and newspapers &amp; I? I feel like my life is no longer worth living.I don't even take photos of myself because I don't have anyone to share them with.**

**I'm 26.. I would rather talk to someone from Europe.**

**18-35 age range.**

**Send me a private message If you want to talk.. only long messages.I never ignore them If they're interesting to me.**

**No abbreviations**

**Please don't criticize me &amp; don't give me unwanted advice.I'm already sad enough and all I want is to find a friend.**

**I want to talk on reddit first so don't ask me to talk on Discord or some other app.**

**If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet - something like that - instead of asking me ""what are your hobbies?"" or telling me what you're interested in. It doesn't matter to me If you like the same songs or movies as I do as long as you're honest,understanding,loyal and talkative - as long as you're a good person.I don't get along with people who are completely different than me which is why I would rather talk to someone with a very similar personality type.**

**If you want to talk to me - Please don't ignore everything I say in my private messages only to answer some questions - refer to each part of my messages**

**REMEMBER PEOPLE! ALWAYS FIGHT FOR YOURSELF AND NEVER LOWER YOUR STANDARDS FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOU!

For one they are like my best friend, and also if I'm being honest, I really do struggle with loneliness lately.

Part of me feels like I just need to toughen up and stop all contact in order to be completely alone. But sometimes I wonder if it's okay to want relationships with people and still be able to work on one self. 

And some may reply and say that's what friends are for, people that you have never been romantic with. But the friends in my life are not really the type of people I can call up when I'm having a breakdown type of thing. And it does feel less lonely to have someone in my life that I can talk to whether I'm happy or sad.

I guess my point is, if you are struggling with being alone, is it really the end of the world if you find comfort in people that maybe didn't work out as a romantic relationship?

It's not fair to project this idea on the women in my life. They are their own selves, and shouldn't be beholden to some fantasy idea I have of ""the perfect girl"". No matter what they do, they'll fall short of whatever twisted idea I have of them. I have to let go and learn to hold my own hand. 

And besides, there's also absolutely no way I can love someone, give someone any semblance of stability or in any way contribute to a relationship meaningfully. Anyone who loves me right now will just end up as an involuntary therapist. It's not right to try forcing anything like this to happen. 

God, it's so lonely though. Just getting up every day feels like I'm trying to push my way through a blizzard. Whenever it gets bad each day, I have nobody to cry with, or hold, or to tell me everything is going to be okay. I have so many tears to cry, but nobody to cry with.

The most fucked up part was that we took group photos but they all got rid of the ones where i was in, and i know it wasn't because of my appearance since i didn't look like some hobbo but probably because a rock has more personality than me.

So I recently met someone, and it seemed we was getting along, it was the first time we met, til the next day... 💔 

So I'd express myself, writing on my notepad on my phone, of each negative or positive encounter, and write it like this (BELOW), it may not be the best, but this is me, this is how I write whatever I may be feeling. whenever I could be able to find the words to each feeling, on the positive side, it helps me, to reflect who I am, as I'm struggling with that, and id like to be able to recognize my flaws, and improve, and grow into someone better , for me, not for others. And if possible, I'd like to help others recognize themselves, embrace it, tell others they're not alone, and that they're strong, unique, one of a kind, despite our differences, we are the same, is at least what I believe and trying to hold onto that bit of hope.

Everyday life has changed immensely, many old friends and acquaintances are gone, but I started finding new friends and building my whole life routine basically from scratch, and it all feels just right.

Among the new people I recently met is a 19 years old girl who I just clicked with very well. We're not dating and I'm not interested in getting intimate with her, really enjoy hanging out together as friends and texting and laughing. We briefly talked about this and quickly said prefer to stay friends, so I guess that's not an issue at all.

Weirdly still, I have a strange feeling that it's ""not right"". Already the fact that she's a freshman and I'm in my last year of study makes me fear being judged as ""superior"" and a potential ""exploiter"".

On the one hand, I know this feeling is nonsense and there's literally no way for any exploiting, but on the other hand, this feeling feels way too real to just ignore. 

Even if things were to go further as her best friend likes to gossip sometimes, the age of consent where I live is 18 years, and 1-5 years of age difference is way too common for couples here, so that shouldn't be something to worry about either.

I'm confused. I don't want some crap nonsense fear ruin my newly found and growing social life after having lived in near complete isolation and trauma for more than three semesters. I enjoy her company and hanging out with her and her friends and they like me being around. Some friends of mine from before Corona, me and her and her friends want to meet together for 11th of November Celebrations (11.11. is a massive holiday with huge drunk street festivals here, not black friday) and I just want to have a good time.

But seeing those moments, photographed to probably put those photos in frames to watch it and rememeber it when years has been passed made me realize that i'm not going to have a lot of good moments to remember.

(This post isn’t in chronological order, but I don’t think it’s hard to follow.)


    My friend group isn’t really a friend group, we’re just misfits. We don’t have anywhere else to sit at lunch so we sit together. Misfits fit well together. We have a group chat which is nice, but I wish I wasn’t in a friend group just because I don’t have anywhere else to be. I wish I actually felt like I belonged, not the guy who walks in the back of the group because there’s no more space on the sidewalk. Growing up I didn’t have many friends, the people in school were really just acquaintances that I sat with at lunch. No one on the block wanted to play with the brown boy from the immigrant family. I can’t help but just feel bad for myself because I missed out on so much because of my parents. They never let me go out ever and still don’t let me go out. From school, I come home and from home, I go to school. That’s it. During the summer I would get so depressed because I had nothing to do, I was literally kind of yearning for school just so I could get 45 minutes of socialization at lunch. When the pandemic started and everyone talked about their social lives being ruined I would feel bad about myself because I had no to ever socialize with outside of school, and now others were feeling what I’ve felt for my whole life. I really got to see what I was missing out on. 


I wish I got that high school experience, you know what I mean? Like late-night drives with friends, or going out to eat after school. I wish I came home at 4 or 5 in the morning after sneaking out of the house. I live in New York City, yet I never really explored my city. I wonder how it feels to be loved, I wish I knew it, that feeling. I wonder how it feels when someone really wants you to come to their party or hangout “event” for lack of a better word. I wish I was wanted more. 


One day, the pain of the abuse will outweigh the fear of any repercussions. My parents have been beating me for as long as I remember. My mother said to me a few weeks ago that she should’ve killed me. I didn’t get it then but now I realize she meant she should’ve aborted me. A few months ago, my family and I were in our car going somewhere and without provocation, my dad starts talking about how I’ll be nothing in life. Without any provocation at all just out of the blue, he starts to talk to himself and my mom while laughing saying I’ll never be anything. It took a lot for me to hold back my tears that day. Sometimes it hurts knowing no one will ever love me to the fullest. No one will ever love me at a hundred percent. The fullest anyone can ever love someone is how a mother loves her child. Knowing that my mother doesn't and has never loved me that much, it hurts. I wish someone would hold me.


    Have you ever been so lonely you refresh your email, hoping something new comes up? Yeah, that was me during the pandemic. I feel so pathetic writing out. Then I met someone. This was September of 2021, so a bit over a year ago. I met a girl on Instagram. I talked to her and I really did enjoy talking to her and she made me feel a way that no other girl has ever made me feel. We only talked for 8 weeks but I think I really fell for her. I spent my whole day looking forward to talking to her and since we lived in different time zones I would stay up till 1 am to catch her when it would be morning and her time zone. She was six hours ahead of me, across the Atlantic. I looked forward to waking up because I could talk to her. With all due respect to her, she wasn't really all that. She was a 6 at best and the only reason I talked to her was because I had no one else to talk to(was super lonely). However, from day one of us texting, I was lowkey smitten. We just talked about random stuff and jokingly flirted but sometimes the stuff she said went over my head. For example, this one time she asked if I wore boxers or briefs, I think she was trying to flirt, but it went over my head and I just said boxers and took it as a literal question.


Suddenly she went offline(or at least I think she did because she had no more activity) and I kind of bombarded her inbox with messages. I would wake up every day hoping that she came back. After a while I unsent all my messages as I was embarrassed and a bit angry that she wasn't responding. A few weeks later she came back online but she didn't text me back and I felt embarrassed. She view my Instagram stories and I viewed her stories(I think, I don't remember if I viewed her stories) but we didn't talk. Then following New Years, I accidentally locked myself out of my account and I couldn't go back in. I tried to look her up on Instagram again but I couldn't remember what her username was. I just spent the next 10 months just thinking about her and it sucks because I don't want to think about her. I couldn't look at my follower list because I had a private account and I was locked out of it. I know she doesn't think about me she doesn't think about me the way I think about her if she even thinks about me at all.


Then around December of 2020, I had my first real OCD episode, Pure-O. It’s been a lot better now, but for more than six months I was suffering. I started going to the gym though, around late May of 2021, and the gym become the highlight of my day because it was when I could get out of the house. I would be gone for like two to three hours a day. Often, I wouldn’t even go to the gym and would just walk around the city for two to three hours going places I’d never been before. It was fun, exploring the city with headphones on, it helped me forget what my life is like. I would walk through neighborhoods I’d never been to but I would never feel lost, there was this kind of wanderlust without the fear of being lost. I don’t know if that sounds corny. Going to the gym kind of gave me purpose, if I didn’t go to the gym or have a good walk, I would feel like the whole day was wasted. I had to stop going to the gym this September because I started college essays, but I’ll go back in December or January.


Thankfully, that experience with that one girl opened me up to talk to more girls, and I’ve been talking to more girls, with more success than I expected if I’m being honest. I met another girl, super cute, like out of my league by a GAP. We used to call almost every day for two weeks but that ended two. I remember her telling me that she felt like she’d known me for two months when we were just talking for two days. She would call me without asking and I would act like I didn’t like it but I looked forward to it. She actually wanted to talk to me and that made me feel special. When I’d teller we couldn’t call she would be upset, and my man, let me tell you she was finer than a motherf*cker and she had a personality so great. Unfortunately, we stopped talking. I’ve realized she was my type, just like the girl before. However, I think I’m not my type’s type if that makes sense, and it’s suck because I have no personality, I was never able to have one. I wish I had a girlfriend that made me feel even better than those girls did.


Not to sound pretentious but I know a lot about politics, geopolitics, and history, compared to the average person, but compared to any expert, I would be a novice, and that sucks. I don’t skate and I’m not one of those car guys. I’m not athletic, I was never allowed to be because I was never allowed to go out. Now it’s time to apply to universities, where my life might get better and my friends might come into existence.

4139,georgeclooneysitonme,1636413898,1,"I'm sorry this is so long, but I just need to get it off my chest and then maybe I'll feel better, even if nobody actually reads this.

I'm 21 and I recently moved out of my parents' house for the first time to attend a university. It's a 6-hour drive from my hometown and I haven't seen my family in 2 months.

A little backstory, if anyone cares: When I graduated high school I stayed in my HT and attended community college there in order to save money. All of my high school friends moved away for college and I found myself friendless. Nobody at college really talks to you, and even when they do it's usually just to ask you what the the last slide said because the professor was moving too fast. I eventually got a job at a coffee shop and LOVED every second of it. I made so many genuine friends and through the pandemic I was able to keep my sanity because my job allowed me to socialize with my friends and customers. I've always been really close with my family, but in the past few years I've grown especially close to them. Me, my mom, and my little sister (who is 11 years younger than me and sometimes feels like my own baby since I helped raise her) all call ourselves each others' built-in-best friends. I guess I knew I'd have to leave eventually so I just savored every second I got with them.

So September rolls around and it's time for me to transfer to a university to finish my degree. I quit my job of over two years, and for the first time since I was 17 found myself truly unemployed (which wasn't a huge deal, I had saved up a lot so I was going to be okay for a little bit at least financially). I had to tackle the absolutely devastating task of saying goodbye to my entire family and my beloved dogs, who I often refer to as My Babies, and for the first time in my life I am truly on my own.

I have two roommates. One of them (we'll call her Alex) is a girl I met at my community college who happened to also get accepted to the same college, and the other is her girlfriend of 5 years (we'll call her Shelby). Before we moved in together, we had each mentioned how hard it was going to be to leave our families, because we're both really close to them, but Alex said that she and Shelby would be my ""replacement family"" since they had each other and i had no one really. I really thought I was going to be okay, I mean I'm independent and responsible and I always have been, but I feel such a deep dark pit of pure loneliness inside me that just seems to deepen as the days go on. At this point I'm just going through the motions. It's so much worse than when I was 18 and all my friends moved away. At least then I could still hug my mom or take my dog for a drive and everything would be okay. I haven't been hugged in two months.

I see people hanging out with their roommates and grocery shopping together, like they're all such good friends, and it makes me sad. My roommates do literally everything together and will text me (from the next room over) if they need something or want to show me the occasional Tik Tok. We see each other occasionally in the kitchen and the most we've done together is play mario kart on some weekends (and even then it felt like they were doing it because they felt bad for me). They don't like to go out or leave the apartment unless it's to get food or go to the Dollar Tree so I can't even go to fun events like the school's football games (I probably could but I wouldn't feel safe going somewhere unfamiliar alone at night).

They got a cat last weekend and Alex told me she's planning to propose to Shelby next month. I'm happy for them but sometimes I really feel like it's their apartment, their life, and I'm just living in it. I'm just the girl whose rent money they need because they couldn't afford a place on their own. (Even when I put decorations out in the living room for Halloween it felt like I was invading their space and clashing with all the decorations they put out) They aren't terrible roommates, they just kind of live in their own little world that I happen to walk through sometimes.

{Side rant because my feelings are still hurt: My best friend from high school goes to college two hours away, and on Halloween weekend she and her boyfriend were going to come celebrate with me and the idea was that we would all have a little halloween party, with me, my bestie, her bf, and my two roommates. My roommates knew for **over a month** that she was coming to visit (because I asked them on the last day of September if it's okay with them if I invited them and they said yes of course), and said they were looking forward to it and made it clear to me that they had every intention to participate in the Halloween party I was investing lots of time and money into planning for all of us, and 3 days before she was supposed to come over they suddenly texted me (from their bedroom by the way, not even to my face) that they HAD to go home that weekend because it was apparently the only day Alex could skip her class on Monday and spend a 3-day weekend with her family. I was hurt because 1. obviously you've known you school schedule since the first week of school in September, so you could have told me BEFORE I planned and prepped for a 5-person party and 2. don't let me believe that you're going to be here and participate and act like you're so excited when you knew you weren't going to be here ??? When my bestie and her bf came I felt so pathetic because I had all this food and candy and drinks set up but it was too much for just the 3 of us and I had to tell her that 2/5 of the party cancelled on me last minute. I felt like the kid who invites the class to their birthday and nobody shows up. I understand you want to go home, but why does it have to be the *one* weekend I'm having guests over? And don't you think I want to go home too? If you told me even a week earlier I would have said oh I'll just go home too and see my family, because I am desperate to see them. But no, three days before is too late. I may sound selfish here but it just felt so rude and dismissive to me that the ONE time I want them to hang out with me and my dearest friend is coincidentally the ONLY weekend they can go home. And the kicker is, the next weekend they went back to visit home again and didn't tell me until the day before they left. I wasn't invited again btw.}

A few weeks ago I was feeling so down and in such a dark place, so I decided to look into local shelters to see if there were any adoptable dogs. I found one I absolutely fell in love with, but I can't afford my apartment complex's pet deposit right now, and the dog I liked was adopted a few days later, so that feels like it's off the table for now. I couldn't take the loneliness anymore so I found a job at a local grocery store, which is great because there's a lot of flexibility and I can go home without too much scheduling conflict, and it's also a way for me to get some basic human interaction, but there's so many people that work there and things are constantly shifting around that I don't know how to make friends there. I'm not the most extroverted person ever, so it's really hard for me to just put myself out there. My parents say that it'll get better and I just have to give it some time, but I haven't felt this depressed since I was 16. I've never felt so down. I can't sleep, I can't concentrate on my school work, I'm overeating and unmotivated to eat anything healthy, my room is a disaster, which is unusual for me because I have always had a notoriously clean room, I am constantly physically uncomfortable no matter where I am or what I'm wearing (even in the comfort of my own room), and I just feel like I'm in everyone's way all the time. I complain to my parents sometimes when I talk to them on the phone, but I keep it chipper so I don't worry them too much, so they don't know the extent of how miserable and devastated I feel all the time. My best friend and I facetime a lot but our schedules don't always line up so we usually only talk for 10-15 minutes at a time. I feel like i have nobody to talk to and no one that even cares. I can't talk to my roommates because they rarely even care enough to ask me how my day was. I considered seeing a therapist provided by my school, but I think they only let you go to like 3 or 4 sessions for free, which would probably help but I'm worried that I'll need it more later on but I can't go because I already used up all my sessions.

Anyway this was just to vent and complain a little. I don't feel like I have anyone I can actually vent these feelings to so I just wanted to be able to tell myself that it's out there and now at least someone knows and it's not just bottled up inside anymore. I doubt anyone actually read all of this but in case you did, I apologize for it being so long.

The spare room is small and gets no sunlight, and I wouldn’t see it anyway because depression and anxiety keeps me awake all night and I sleep half the day to compensate.

I wake up and sit at my desk and I’m there all day every day and have been for 6 months. I speak to nobody, I’ve drifted apart from all former friends over the years I spent with my ex and only wanting her as the centre of my world. I feel like the work in my portfolio is better than that of some people currently mid-level in the industry, but I just get rejection after rejection.

There’s this girl I used to be interested in but I hesitated for some reason and never got into a relationship even though we both wanted to. Now I caught feelings again and remembered why I fell for her. It’s so bad because whenever I’m in proximity my heart pumps fast and hard and I get nervous. It’s so bad to the point where I’m 100% normal and once I noticed her nails behind me so I was like “she’s right behind me” and it started pumping. I can’t think straight because she’s always on my damn mind. It sucks because we’re like acquaintances now and whenever I try to talk to her I end up going around her out of nerve. Don’t even get me started when she’s with her friends. That’s the situation and now where I need help, I had a dream where we were a lot closer and it genuinely made me happy.

4152,Amarylliscence,1636407635,1,"I get too close to people. I get too attached. It made me lose three of my best friends in a few weeks time. 

I get close with a guy (in a completely friendly way, I have no interest in pursuing a relationship with them), their girlfriend gets jealous that I am close with their boyfriend and forbids them to talk to me or hang out with me. This exact scenario happened twice this month. I feel so lonely. I just want to be close with someone and feel loved in a purely platonic way.

My mom attempted suicide 3 months ago and spent 2 months in the hospital. I just needed a hug some days. Someone to talk to. Some friendly affection. Just some platonic love. But people always leave me, mostly because of jealousy. I rarely make friends, but when I make them, I get so attached to them and so scared to lose them. And it happens every single time.

My birthday is next week and I will spend it all on my own like every year. I thought this year would be different since I finally had a nice group of friends. But nothing is different, everyone left me to save the relationships with their girlfriends. They had to choose, but no one chose for me and they all dropped me in a heartbeat. I don't blame them, their relationships are more important. I just wish they would tell me they are sorry. Sorry they are leaving me in such a hard period of my life. I hate that I am so pathetic to write this all out, I hate that I am lonely, but ultimately it's all my fault.

I turned off al my social media and messaging notifications. I know there are people out there who care, but I can't be bothered to contact them. I just want to be left alone and everyone to forget about me, even though I am lonely. I don't know why I'm writing this. I will probably delete this later because I regret it.

I was a bit jealous because we only really exchanged like 6 messages but maybe I am not putting as much of an effort as he is? Anyways hanging out went well and whatnot. But she said something that like suggested we were all going to hang out rather than just her and me at some point. Which is fine I guess I just don’t understand why?

Even solid friendships seem to be beyond my reach. 
  
The closest I've ever come to a good friend, let alone a romantic partner, has always been ""friends with a group."" Individuals seem to not want to hang out with me, so I only ever get to hang out/be invited to be with others in a group. Recently, I lost the last group friends I had left, so now the only people I see outside my family are friends of my siblings, and co-workers.  

Even without taking the current global situation into account, at my age (29m) it is basically impossible to make new friends without having a lot of hobbies, or be willing to start new ones. I've never had interest in hobbies outside of gaming, so my pool of potential IRL friends is essentially 0 to begin with.

I starved extremely, being anorectic for my whole life and eating only a one small meal every 3 days and I've lost a lot of hair, because of stress. I just can't handle, when someone tells me how life is easy and beautiful after all nightmares I've been through. How I can feel, when someone tells me ""nobody owes you anything"". So I do not deserve for love, compassion or attention? I have to politely accept my disorder and stay in darkness for rest of my life?! Just stop. I can't handle it and every phrase like this hurts me straight into the core and it encourages me to commit suicide, because I feel like I did not deserve to be loved and looked after, but I have to stay in my ""solitude"" and suffer.",lonely,People HAVE TO STOP sending buddha's quotes about benefits of solitude and loneliness to people with depression,2021-11-09 05:46:12

i'm v v grateful i have my mom, but when thanksgiving comes around &amp; everyone's making relatable thanksgiving posts/jokes/talk about how much food they need for their big families, i can't chime in. i've never had a thanksgiving dinner. like a real one. huge homemade meal w good people &amp; laughs to accompany it with that turns into everybody lounging around for a few hours sitting around shooting the shit/reminiscing together. whenever me &amp; my mom are on the outs i have no one to vent to about her who can say, 'oh yeah, that's your mom for you.' i didn't have a crowd of family for graduation to swarm me afterwards &amp; give me hugs &amp; be all emotional about how big i am now. i'm so grateful for my mom but it's just the 2 of us. who will i have to lean on when she's gone?? w no family or friends it'll just be me, &amp; ik i don't have the strength to live w/o her while also not having anybody else to keep me here/help me plug that hole she'll leave behind.",lonely,"sad lonely shit, u know the drill",2021-11-09 05:41:27
4186,Daminoso,1636396825,1,"So I met this girl at a friends  party and we hit it off extremely well, joked, laughed, got to know about eachother and planned a date together the next day, even got together before the date. Turned out there are some very valid reasons why we wouldn't work out as a couple, we're at different stages in our lives and have very different futures and priorities in mind, to keep it short. 

It's taking me some time to get over her, it was the first time I was with someone in 3 years and there was so much emotion involved, I never had as much of a connection with anyone in my life as I did with her in just one night. I am getting over it surprisingly well, mostly by staying rational about it, we talked it over and both agreed, regretfully so. But it made me aware of how incredibly alone and wanting for connection I feel and have felt for much longer than 3 years, I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with this flood of previously I suppose locked away emotion, I wasn't really aware until now. 

Having someone really connect with me in that area and fill up that ""emptiness"" and then getting it cut off the next day really hit me. Can't figure out what to do with it, it's really on the top of my mind all the time ever since, so much that it's hindering me in day to day stuff.

4198,QueerSkyBall,1636390959,1,"I guess I am finally ""writing"" again.  Here goes nothing...

I drink too much.  But I just quit and dumped the rest down the drain. I told one or two of you about this and explained the tipping point.  It scares me to death to think I have the face the full brunt of my sadness now.

I get so strongly attached to people because I have so few of them.  It can be a problem.  Then I ironically, or deservingly, completely lose them.  It hurts every time.  On the flipside, I do have confidence in the fact that I would likely be your most loving friend ever, or be an incredible life partner.

I think about suicide every day.  I fear once my parents pass away I will have no one to miss me if I go, and that I wouldn't be able to handle losing them to begin with.  I really doubt my brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, neighbors or coworkers, would care if I went.  Or would pretend we were close or pretend they made an effort, but quickly move on.  I lost several friends to suicide and ODs growing up.

I have an overactive sex drive.  I am fully aware why it happens.  I hate myself for it.  Mainly just a lack of real human connection and craving more when I do end up with a hint of it.  Probably also having so few romantic or sensual or sexual experiences during my ""prime"".  I am not sure how to fix that one.  It would break my heart to pieces if I made a partner or friend uncomfortable in any way because of it.  It has before.

I am very attracted to women younger than me.  Not necessarily an actual problem if you aren't breaking laws or breaking peoples hearts I guess.  It seems often girls prefer their man be older than them anyway.  But it does make me wonder if its because deep down I know I wasted my 20's.  Well, most of the years after graduation.

I constantly apologize.  Maybe I just want to be told I am not a problem.  I often apologize for my personality or who I am.  This is not healthy.

I secretly wish someone will read this entire post and connect with these confessions... or find interest in whats on my mind or on my heart and send a message.  But just please don't force advice down my throat or troll me.  Care and listen.  Or just fucking distract me.

My cars inspection is past due. Sometimes I think I am funny.  I am probably not.

I hope everyone has a lovely day. &lt;3

4226,akathewilyfox,1636378147,1,"I've been lonely for far too long. Its been nearly a year since my LDR ended and almost 2 years since we saw each other in person. I feel so starved of any genuine compassion or affection. I feel like I've exhausted all my options. I have tried/still trying online dating. I have tried engaging with people on sites and subreddits with people who have similar interests to me, to no avail.

My head is filled with all the nonsense from online about the current state of gender and dating politics, that starting to believe that maybe I am a low value person. It makes me despondent and angry to think that my worth as a human being is set by arbitrary standards. So I don't check all the boxes for the perceived ""standard"" that the opposite gender apparently upholds.

So I am to accept that my punishment now is to live my life with no prospect of ever being granted access to basic human needs? Sex is nice, but a hug and forehead kiss goes a lot further on the emotional wellbeing meter. 

I received so little human contact, I actually flinch when I'm touched physically. And actually, even then its not about my physical needs. It would be nice to receive a random sincere compliment every now and then. It would be nice for someone to ask me how I am for a change.

The overwhelming pressure to ""not be me"" just in order to have a slim chance someone will honour me with so much as handshake is literally destroying my soul. I'm not your private entertainer because you were bored this evening on reddit. I'm not your therapist or priest. But still invested my time and patience, just for you to ghost me, because you got bored or got a better offer.

I don't want to be the one sounding off with bitterness and cynicism, but its getting increasingly difficult to keep emotions at bay. Perhaps it is my lot in life to be the person that I am currently. Maybe I should just be quiet, be stoic and pretend like I'm not dying inside from a profound sadness and wretchedness.

4227,Crab_God2005,1636377758,1,"I'm a weird person. I've always been made fun of for the habits I've had. Unlike most people, I'm not creeped out by any animal. (spiders,snakes,etc) As you probably know, America has been in shit for the last 2 years, the entire country shut down and you couldn't see anyone for all of 2020. I was lonely, of course, and the few friends I had were separated by remote learning. For my birthday, I got a hermit Crab. His name was Herbert. He was in a small enclosure and then I did some research and got a 10 gallon tank. I found out the just like humans, hermit crabs need friends too. I was walking on a board walk, I saw hermit crabs for sale, I, of course bought one. His name was sapphire because his shell was blue. Sapphire and Herbert got along and were happy. I was happy.for once in my life I could come home to friends who were always there. I currently have 8 hermit crabs, yes you heard me right, 8. They're currently in a 40 gallon tank and have all the necessary requirements to live a long life. I'm not going to go through the story of all 8 of them because that would take to long. Unfortunately, Herbert passed away a couple of months ago and as strange as it sounds, sapphire seemed that he was sad too. I was especially sad because I had had him the longest. He had a failed molt and wasn't strong enough to survive. Sapphire, however, is extremely friendly, super colorful, and much healthier than when I got him. If you wish to get hermit crabs,   make sure you take care of them. You must at least have 2 of them and a ten gallon tank. These are not starter pets, they are exotic pets that require intermediate care. You can expect to pay anywhere between $50 and $100 caring for these guys. If you are lonely,and want a clean quiet and friendly pet and also have the time, than I recommend you get hermit crabs. Thank you for reading this, and if you wish to get hermit crabs, PM me and I will tell you how and what you need.",lonely,Is having this many pets strange,2021-11-09 00:22:38

The feeling of loneliness is getting worse and worse, i was just driving around and saw bunch of people going out with friends on halloween while I didn’t even had anyone to talk to and I think that was enough to break me. I used to go by just fine, but I think I have reached my limit. I don’t wanna be alone anymore. I want to have fun and enjoy. I have never had any good friends nor a partner. The thought of being alone scares me now. I feel like I will always be alone in life. My social skills aren’t that good either because of that. Im almost 20 and I got nothing. And the fact that time is flying by is scary, I wanted to have fun with friends and enjoy my life, but now i think about how 20 years of my life has passed and I never experienced true friendship/love. Like this age is where people enjoy most and Im missing out everything and this time will never come again. The only people I talk to are my family. All my contacts are either work related or family. My relatives aren’t caring either. I have lost all motivation, my day is just me going to work, sleeping and doing college homework, whats worse is my screen time is 14 hours!. Thats all. And its been like that for a while. I don’t know what to do… I have lost interest in everything. Talking to customer service sometimes just make my day lol, once someone told me that i was the kindest customer they ever talked to… and I still remember that, its the little compliments you get that makes you feel something.

4239,HopechoGD,1636370135,1," 

Hi, I feel very lonely lately, because I feel like nobody can relate to me anymore.

I am a person that has been pushed his whole life to become better and better. People want me to be perfect and only perfect. And if I didn’t, people would see me as a lesser person and bully me for my shortcomings. 

So I used all that negativity, and turned it into something positive. I took initiative to better myself in every way I can. I wanted to show that pointing fingers has no purpose if you can’t do it yourself.

Now I've become a great and capable person in many ways. I’m very proud of my accomplishments and the goals I achieved. I feel very happy about that. But now I’m at that point, where I seemed to have surpassed everybody I know. 

Now people still don’t care what I’m capable of. Instead they now see me more as an enemy, because I show them, they can do better as well. I want to show people that they can change for the better, without all the toxic behaviour around it.

A good amount of people see me as an example figure, but no one is willing to change. They can do wrong, because they are imperfect, and you should accept everybody like how they are. And that is fine but, people can be such hypocrites at times you know?

Perhaps I am as well... 

If I mention this to someone, I always get the predictable cookie cutter answers and everything I already know and learned a long time ago. So it feels like there are no new perspectives to learn from. Even though I think that is not true. I feel like I improved too much and can no longer fit in with the others.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well. I just wanted to vent a bit. Sad feelings make the good feelings feel better in the long run.  
So perhaps this is a victory of some sorts?

Sorry in advance for my spelling mistakes. I’m still learning English. Hope you have a nice day.",lonely,Alienation due to improvement.,2021-11-08 22:15:35

And I was just showing my friend group how I have a motorcycle and I was learning. But a dude gets mad at me cause I didn't buy a starter bike. I bought one with 700cc. And so he was upset (which usually a beginner bike is 250cc) so my friend let's call her Beth leaves the group. I ask her man what's wrong he reads my message and ignores them. So I ask him more publicly his stream.. I asked very politely cause I'm use to this and honestly I just wanted some light shed on the situation. He said cause I don't take advice and that I'm being reckless and him and his girl don't wanna see me die or something.    So they leave without a word cause they don't wanna see me die or something like what???? The other 2 said they have no idea in general. I don't get what I did wrong in this situation.

4281,Extaze9616,1636351801,1,"I have had this pug doggy called Missy for the past 14 years.  She was the most cuddly dog ever,  would sleep in our bed super close to me or my parents and would honestly just brighten my days. She was barking at us whenever we left home as if she was asking us why we left without her. 

About a year ago,  she got injured and we found out she had 2 hernias in her lower back.  We got her some pain medication and she came back home with us as if nothing happenned,  she just couldn't jump on the couch but we helped her anytime. 

This past Saturday,  I got up and had breakfast and she was fine,  she came to me to get some food which I gave her some with some hugs and kisses as I always do.  Later in the morning,  she started whining while being on my dad on the couch,  so he put her down to the floor and she fell on her back (which she never did,  she was a proud little girl and would not stay on her back)  and peed on herself.  We believe she had a mini stroke,  but after that she wasn't able to get back up on her legs so we had to take her to the vet,  tell her goodbye and put her to sleep.  I was with her until the end and I am since then haunted with the image of her small lifeless body on the vet table and can't stop crying. 

I am seriously so heart broken for that and honestly,  can't stop crying. I keep waking up cause I hear her whining as if she was in my bed,  to then literally sit in my bed and cry cause I know she isn't here anymore.  I also feel her when I am close to falling asleep as if she is close to me or with me in my bed where she used to lay with me to then remember she will never be with me anymore.

I’m 19 yrs old and have never been in a relationship. Yes, I know it’s not that big of deal but it’s a bit disheartening to see all my friends happy and in love while I’ve yet to experience an actual romance. I’m happy for them, but I just wonder when it’ll be my turn to be loved by someone. I’ve never gotten past the talking stage with anyone. It’s mostly my fault, I sometimes get avoidant or lose interest before things get too serious. I think I may have issues from my childhood that makes it hard for me to commit. I’ve witnessed so many hurtful things that made me feel so strongly about protecting my heart, but I really have been trying to open up more. It just never seems to be enough. I know a lot of people say, love will come when you least expect it, but I lose hope as time continues to pass. Will I be in my late 20s with no dating experience? God I hope not.

I just want to know how I can put myself out there more but not too recklessly. I’m so scared of being played with. I’ve seen what heartbreak can do to someone.

I've tried to keep as many friends as I can in my life and I can count all of them on one hand. Everyone's number of people they can count on is different and I get that. But in all my life it has always been me seeing how my friends are doing, how are you feeling, how can I help you. And yes that may not be bad to all but my soul hurt a bit more.

My timing has never been right for literally anyting in my life. Weather it's been making friends in hs, playing any sports in hs and making varsity when I should but I loved smoking weed. Being able to speak to my parents about anything because our family just holds shit in. Trying to find someone to spend the rest of my life with. Or even some one to just to be able to speak to about my true feelings and just never could because I'm to smart or just fucking dumb and I don't know what I'm talking about.

Being alone has bothered me at times yes and it has taken me to vary dark places. 

The fact that I. Me David. Have to put in all the effort and energy to keep the things and people I do actually have in my life a thing... I'm about tapped out and do what to do it anymore.

I'm so drained of all the energy I do have and I don't really know if what I do have is worst fighting or living for. I just want someone to be here with me to ride the fucked up ride we are on called earth. 

Yes I know for a long time that this ride was never going to be easy. I have never learned anything in my life the easy way and I can honestly say I'm just about tapped the fuck out and seriously thing with this ticket to this fuck show is even worth it.

I'm not religious at all and if I where... would have to question the ""higher power"" if they are actually  qualified to do this job in any way shape fourm because the shit I see on a daily basis... makes me think if there is a higher power the are either 12 years old or they are s Crackhead playing the SIM game but to busy looking out the window because that is what crack will make you do OR they are a thing in a coma and have no control anymore and Elon Musk is creating Nerolink to contact the host of this game to be like YO this shit is fucking wack and place hit rest fucker. PLEASE!!! 

My low is low right now and I'm seriously just like WTF. and really do see a reason to be here any more. The fact that HITLER!!! YES HITLER could find someone to love him for the ""New age"" tweeker, downs killing, Jew burning  FUCKING POND SCUM could find love. Honestly make we dought I'm ment for this world.

4299,heckheckheclvecl,1636347633,1,"i am a 14 year old guy who started high school ~3 months ago. (young, i know.) i‘ve had pretty crummy luck when it came to making true friends throughout my life. i met two of my best friends in the first grade, one of which, who i will call „Joe“ left the school a year after, leaving me with only my one friend, who I will call „Rick“.

from an outsider perspective, i had lots of friends. in my first 3 years of school, it seemed like i would have a new buddy every month. the thing is, these people would eventually lose interest in me after a while, and they would start
to ignore me or straight up pretend they didn‘t know me on one occasion. i think this did wonders to fuck me up as a kid, because it felt like any new person i would meet would eventually start to hate me. 

anyways, flash forward to the fourth grade, where i would meet two new good friends of mine. one of them, „Bob“, at my daycare, which i would go to for an hour or two after school, and the other, „Denice“, was just a kid in some of my classes. these people were two of my best friends for a long while, up until when i entered middle school. i don‘t recall what happened between us, but i remember me and denice started to HATE each other. in the sixth grade, he would antagonize me. i don‘t even want to go into detail in fear of bringing back terrible memories. around this time, too, bob would become more and more distant from me. nowadays me and bob talk maybe twice a year.

although losing denice, and shortly losing bob after, i did make a considerable amount of friends in middle school. i even managed to reignite my friendship with rick, mentioned earlier in this post, but, with kids that age being how they are, these relationships were toxic as hell. i still am in active contact with rick and two of my other middle school friends.

so, after all this, 2020 happened. literally no explanation is needed.

now, 2021! i finally start high school, hoping to break free from the shit friends and middle school torture. and... it happens! you cannot understand how happy i was for these few weeks. i managed to reconnect with joe, my first grade friend that left, and he introduced me to his group of friends, who i got along with fairly well! not only this, but i seemed to be getting along pretty well with someone in one of my classes as well. what could go wrong?!

everything. and nothing. at the same time. i do not believe that much changed between me and these people, i just believe i came back down to earth from my damn delusions. these new friends seem to have never actually liked me. i never talk to any of them 1 on 1, and i am probably the most replaceable member of the group. plus, i don‘t think the person in that other class ever even saw me as a potential friend. why? no fucking clue. we got along fine, i guess i liked them more than they liked me!

but that shit isn‘t what‘s really fucking with me. my friends are fucking assholes. rick likes to bully the fuck out of me from anything from my physical appearance, to my sense of humor, to the games i choose to play. one of my friends from this new group, which i thought was made of genuine nice people, called my „personality a defect“. i‘ve only ever been nice to this guy. what the fuck did i do to warrant that. this isn‘t me being a sensitive snowflake either. i cannot join a voice chat without being insulted to the point of wanting to just cut contact with everyone and blow my god damn head off. 

i seriously just wish i had never made any friends. i‘ve tried getting rid of the assholes in my life but they just crawl back, and when i find someone else to talk to instead of the asshole, they just turn out to be another asshole in disguise. fuck this shit, and fuck the situation i‘ve gotten myself into.",lonely,"i thought my social life was finally going uphill. i was wrong, haha.",2021-11-08 16:00:33

I feel the same way at home that I do at school, I just feel like I'm always talked over and excluded to the point where I give up on saying anything. At school I don't really have any friends, I sit with an acquaintance and her friends but none of them are interested in talking to me even when I try talking to them. Which I understand, they just prefer talking to the people they know better than me, a stranger. It just sucks feeling left out like that.

Both at home and school, I eat with my head down and I never look at people or talk. If I do try to talk I regret it and I just go back to putting my head down. I just want to have someone who I can eat with where I'm comfortable enough to not have my head down the whole time and I can enjoy my food with. Now, whenever I eat around people I'm uncomfortable and I can't enjoy the food as much

I'm never invited, never asked a favour, never been messeged on snap or Instagram, never asked my phone number never asked to come sit with us.  It's like they only talk to me because I'm there. Because I only sit on thier table, because they have no one else to talk to. You know in november of 2020 in lockdown, I played ps4 with a girl. We'd always talk online everyday and play minecraft. At the time I was enjoying it, a girl asking and inviting to play games, and it was fun. I enjoyed it alot. She'd always talk about what she was doing today or showing what she was wearing. I also liked her alot to. Then school was back on after the lockdown was over and I came back, but she didn't really talk to me, only time she did was when she gave me a birthday card I still have from this year. We're talking March by the way. Then after that nothing, no calls, no messages, no irl talking. ""did she really use me in lockdown just so she could have someone to talk to because she was bored"" I kept thinking over and over. I was angry, sad. For me a phone call or a message from a friend was so much, still is. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't. Few months later she came  to me after the 6 weeks holidays from July to August and she said  ""remember when we were good friends"" my heart honestly broke. I was stood there confused, uncomfortable, angry, sad. I then ask ""we should play sometime soon"" she says ""yeh"" I felt better. I finally asked if someone wanted to do something. Thst was another thing. ""Is the problem that I don't ask and not confident enough to?"" back to thst later though. ""I messged her later saying hey want to play now?"" she says ""I can't today I'm having family problems"" which I totally understand, I'm like ""yeh of course you take your time"" and she said ""ill let you know when we can"" it's been 3 months. I see her happy all time. I see her go out with friends, I see her go out on Halloween and bonfire night. You might think ""oh well people don't show emotions to things they don't like to talk about"" understandable. I agree. But then there's her posting tiktoks with her dad, I know she has a good relationship with him. With friends and family. 

You know Reading through this paragraph back, what if its me, what if I can't take in I'm unwanted or werid. What if I can't take hints. What if there like me but they don't have confidence to tell me something same as where I can't ask them something.

It's not just this girl either. Its with the boys to. I can't relate to anything. They talking about going out playing football. Ffs one of them were having sex with a girl whilst I was building lego.

4359,No_Benefit8783,1636328376,1,"Good evening,
It’s nighttime at my place and I wanted to share a story.

When I was a kid, I had a really really good friend. We used to do everything together, and could create games together, make up stories together, write songs together, create secret languages etc.

We didn’t have the best families, which probably made us not able to relate to the rest of the kids that much growing up. 

Then I moved countries, and had a huge culture shock. I managed to make friends in my new environment but never managed to have very close friends ever since.

I gave up on finding a friend that could understand me until in Highschool I met another great friend. Sadly I realised 3 years later that they were manipulating me and mirroring everything I said and did ( which was why I felt so close to the person).

Ever since that initial house move, I’ve been feeling profoundly lonely - like I had to explain myself twice to everyone so that they could understand what I’m saying, mostly dismissed as weird..

I seem to have this form of fixation towards this childhood friend for some reason, the lonliness could even make me cry because of how intense it is.
Anyone who had similar experiences or have an idea of what’s going on?

Warm wishes for a lovely night :).",lonely,Lonely ever since,2021-11-08 10:39:36

Its called ""Slowly"" and it's a pen pal app. 

Search for others in many countries based on age/gender/interests/topics. 
All sent letters simulate a delivery time based on the recipient's geographical location. No idea if the delays are accurate but it does force your messages to be a little more thought out and deliberate which I like.

It won't likely solve your loneliness but it might make it a little easier to handle sometimes. I wish you luck.

4367,HaphazardTaco,1636325609,1,"I moved to a new city a few years ago for an incredible job opportunity. I left my friends and family to take a big risk. Career wise, it paid off a lot. But my personal life is non existent. For years I’ve tried to make friends - with coworkers, with others I’ve met outside work (typically the most fulfilling relationships), but it feels like post covid it’s all gone to shit. Some friends quit the company and I realized, I guess we weren’t really friends after all? Others have stopped reaching out. I’ve asked this one person, that was my closest friend here, a few times to hang out in September and they were always busy or uninterested. So I stopped asking. And I stopped hearing from them. 

I’m high risk for Covid and I take some extra precautions - but nothing crazy or out of the way for people. Me and everyone I know is vaccinated anyways. 

But I can’t help but wonder if my covid anxiety contributed to people being over me. Or if I’m annoying. Or a pessimist. Or uninteresting. I keep blaming myself for why all these friends disappeared. Why I’m so lonely every single weekend. My friends and family back home say they miss me, would be so excited to have me home. I think about moving back weekly.

But yeah, I feel lonely, even though I am with someone for over a year. I have some theories as to why, but thinking to myself is one thing, I don't have anyone to talk to about this. My relationship means the world to me, but I just can't seem to get it right. I don't know if it's a wrong person for me, or is it something wrong with me, or what is going on.

I just need to talk to someone. I don't have any real friends, just some people I know.

How do I put it... I often feel overwhelmed with pressure because I'm trying to be someone my SO will be attracted to, and be proud of, but I feel like I am failing CONSTANTLY, I am on edge because I worry that she'll leave me, but sometimes it's me who wants to leave, and it's such a mess in my head that, when she asks ""what happened?"" I just can't give her a legitimate answer. I don't know how to.

I am a jealous person, I know that. I think. I don't know really - I don't know where normal jealousy transitions to some kind of sick, borderline-ish jealousy. **My SO absolutely HATES when I show that I am jealous, or talk about it.** But I can't help but be, I keep wondering ""why is she with me"", or 'why didn't she pick someone else"". It's like subconsciously I don't believe this whole relationship is legitimate. It's like I am constantly on edge, expecting her to tell me it's all been a lie. I don't know WHY. All the logic and reason I can muster tells me it's legitimate.

But. I feel jealous and lonely a lot. I have a theory as to why... but I'm not really willing to share it publicly.

I really wish someone would talk to me. My heart literally aches, after our fight a couple days ago. The pain is not stopping, even though we made up. I feel a lot of pressure on me. I can't talk it out with her, because **when I tell her about these issues I have, she can get very nasty.** I simply worry that she would leave me, if I kept brining these issues up so I pretend they don't exist.

4399,MissScubaButterfly,1636313659,1," 

I apologize for my bad english.

tbh  I feel like I only care for myself now. At 20 years I parties at least 2 times a week. Got  drunk, did so much together with my ""friends"", and by ""so much"" I mean  ""getting drunk at some ""wild parties"", meet girls and boys and have sex.

I allways thought this is upposed to be fun and its what life is supposed to be, but slowly a big doubt crawled in.

I mean: For lonely people who don't WANT to be lonely, this certainly sound like a lot of fun.

But experiencing all of this, made me realize how shallow all of this is and how in reality I've allways hated it.

In  the end, noone of these ""best friends and partie-buddies"" was  interested in my life. All they want is to numb the pain of their boring  lifes.

Before I bought into all  this hippie-bullshit, that these festivals bring you some kind of  ""enlightement"", but tbh its all a convoluted way to get into other  persons panties or get cheap drugs.

Sure,  you laugh and dance... but at some point the amount of money that goes  into these dirty pits, just so you can't shower and sleep in a smelly,  too hot tent, I know it all. Its not interesting to me at all.

Add the sometimes absolutely uninteresting music that gets played... imho it got even worse.

Or  when we did carpooling. Back then I thought its a good road-trip, we  can have fun on our way. Nowadays everyone scrapes by, looking at how  much fuel this shit costs.

And tbh  I'm a real music-asshole. But I'm fine with it. As long as I'm not  trapped in a car with people listening to shitty radio-podcasts or the  mainstream bullshit. My tolerance ends right there. Its worse than  Guantanamo-Bay for me, when I have to listen to another of these samey  autotune bullshitery, with ""artists"" who stole great tunes, ""remixed"" it  and put some whiny douchebag over it who cries in autotune again.

Speaking of music:

I just stopped going to concerts, depite it being my favorite place to go, to let off steam years before the pandemic hit.

I can liste to the same concert in high quality, on my super duper Hi-Fi-Equipment at home.

No need to listen to a badly configured live-set, where the sound-tech-guy fell asleep again.

I  just can't stand all these coversations anymore, thinking how any of  this might change any of that. Even people who think they are the new  best philosopher, don't say anything new tbh. But they think they do.

They  love playing with words, they love thinking ""big"", but in the end I  just don't get why they need to talk to me about this. I won't see them  again in a few months or years. My life is completely different to  theirs.

I'm so out of this whole dick-measuring-contest, I sometimes wonder how much time I wasted on people, I haven't seen in years.

And don't start me on the fact that you have to shout into others ears at times, because the music is so loud.

I'm lonely, but I'm okay with it.

Still  have one or two friends. But they come without all this artificial  bullshit-flavor so many pseudo-relationships come with nowadays.

I started to weed out all of the bullshit I don't like in my life and realized how much better I am without it.

The  ONE thing I am actually working out right now, is to move away from  party-addicts in my neighborhood. But I'm already in the process of  securing myself a nice, quiet place.",lonely,"I'm lonely, but its ok. I started to accept and embrace it.",2021-11-08 06:34:19

&amp;#x200B;

\----

you guys call me a low-maintenance friend, which i totally agree with. i can be AWOL for months but when you need someone to talk to, i'm all ears. it's because i like having space and privacy. i enjoy solitude so much. but not always. i still want to be part of your life. not only when you feel sad or depressed, not only when you need help or advice, not only as your fill-in friend. 

when you sent that discord server invite in our groupchat, i immediately joined, assuming i'm welcome since i got the invite. it turned out to be a study server for our friends back in senior high. i was so thankful for that since i literally made no friends since college started one and a half month ago. i thought that it would help me so much so i wouldnt feel like im going through uni alone. 

during the first video call, you guys were so happy to talk to me again. but i'd like to believe i was much happier. that was a very rough week. i was so stressed, but it was a friday, and i waited all day since you, the one who made the server, said that you guys would study by 10 pm. I joined, and it honestly made my day, my week even. the only bad thing about it is it only lasted for like 2 hours. i understand that the purpose was to study, and not actually hang out. but the small talks and some jokes that were thrown during that call, i felt left out. i didn;t actually relate. obviously it's something i missed during my awol.

the next video call, i didnt have a heads-up. it was also a friday night, another hell week. around 10:30 pm i saw all of you in the call, no mics muted. i got excited because one of them wasn't present last time. i joined so fast, without letting you know through the chat first. i joined even if i had an essay to be passed before 12 am. i joined even if i had to cram the essay. but i didnt regret that. because those calls are the only way for me to reconnect with real people. with my friends. you guys were happy again. we talked and joked a lot. but mostly inside jokes. your inside jokes. i realized what was happenning. i tried to just listen and observe on your conversations --- while doing my essay. i then confirmed that all of you, in the server, are in a groupchat. a groupchat i never knew about. a groupchat i was never invited in. but i thought, that's not too bad right? i still got the invite for the server. maybe theyre just doing that since i was awol. and maybe they thought i dont want to join anyway. 

i asked you guys how long you will stay in the channel, you said maybe for another hour. i said you guys stay and i'll come back since i have to focus on the essay which i have to pass in like 15 minutes. after i came submitted it, i came back and all of you were gone. no chats or something. am i still part of our friendship?

last friday, as expected, all of you are on the call again. you guys knew i was online. you guys knew that if you were to message me, i'd answer right away. but i didnt know about it again. convinced myself that wait, maybe that was a coincidence, one randomly joined in the voice channel to just study by themself then another one saw and then joined and so on. but come on. those calls were scheduled. they planned it and talked about it. in that groupchat. that's why i was never notified. it was a really sad week for me.

that morning i messaged you, inviting you once again to play with me, along with our other friends. you said you'd love to when you get less busy. which i totally understand. we're all in college now, i understand that. but it's just... idk. during that conversation, i joked about how i felt like i don't have friends. how i wanna play a multiplayer game for example, and that i already have the game, now i just need friends. i always tell you about my day, how i still have no friends. i always tell you how i wanted to hang out with you guys again. and you know theyre genuine.

i'm sure you can tell when im excited or not. i'm always excited to talk to you. to talk in our now dead groupchat. i send a lots of blocks of messages. i spam texts and pics. i sent voicemails when telling a story, a very unfiltered one because you guys know how i never finish one story, since i always jump to another. that's how happy i am to talk to you guys. that's how much i want to feel connected. 

was i supposed to be in the discord server? or you just sent the invite in the groupchat since everyone in there is in the new groupchat except me, and hence would be easier?

i feel really left out. i like being alone but i don't wanna be lonely. i tell you how my junior high friends don't talk to me anymore. literally none of them. maybe they're busy, since again, we're in college now. or maybe because i dont reach out. you know i do. i message you guys, and the replies are just... dry. i dont feel the chemistry in our friendship anymore. you guys tell me you miss me, but i approached you, and every reply you make feel forced. like you just want the conversation to end. not to mention during those times you guys had a videocall.

now in college, it's just so hard to make friends. i honestly dont know why. is it because i lack in social skills? i tried to make some, but it seem like theyre only interested in finishing the group task and nothing else. 

in movies and soap operas, i used to laugh at how they exaggerate in portraying lonely characters. now i understand that it is indeed the real life. i dont wanna be like this. i've done some bad stuff and im not perfect, but i dont think im a bad friend. i just dont understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i stayed online in discord last friday, waiting because maybe you guys would notice me and maybe ping me. but i got nothing. i was so sad and wanted to talk to someone so bad, partly horny. so i went online to meet people. i met a guy, agreed to be in a **voice**call to do.. stuff. i agreed. i needed that. i was craving for any other interaction. it was just a bonus that he had a really good voice and had a great way with words. apart from the intimate stuff, what made me so attached to him is that he's so caring and... maybe i felt a connection? my heart was so happy the whole time we were in a call. we didnt just do it. we stayed on the call and talked about life, like new classmates meeting and getting to know each other. it was bare minimum. but i've been craving for that so bad. 

he even said he wouldnt just stick for a month, there will be other times. and of course, i know that's not true. that's the case with doing that shit. going online to meet horny people. they'll only be good for one time. the first and last time. it was good, it was fun, it was lovely, he made me feel human again. he made me feel.. important and seen? it's just sad and concerning that i got attached so easily. it's scary how i depend my happiness on other people. and it's depressing that we wont be talking again. and maybe i might not find someone who would make me feel things like how he does.

1 of which we really don't talk to much, so i'm guessing he has better things to do, so I don't know if that counts.

And the other who is at heart a good person, but I for some reason just sometimes hate how he behaves operates/behaves. I of course don't tell him that because then i'd be an even bigger asshole, but this without telling him is maybe or maybe not worse, it's like i'm faking liking him at times, and that's straight up like lying to his face, granted he apparently has mental disabilitys, so I can't really judge him for it, but somehow it still just feels like a chore hanging out, with the person who apparently has no people other than me.

Maybe that's all just because i desperally want that close connection of a best friendship back, like back in the day, or maybe I really am just an Asshole.

So I talked to him for a week and everything was normal. After a week he said that he loved me and I was shocked. But I said no to him as I wasn't looking for any relationships. But he started blackmailing me and he told me that he would something wrong if I will not be with him. So I got scared and I said ok. So we met each other after a month and he touched me without my permission and also kissed me without my permission. After that we met a couple of times and all he did was makeout. He would ask me to give him a blowjob and if I didn't give him he would not let me go home. But soon the whole covid situation happened and we stopped meeting. But he was continuously being toxic to me. He would not let me study but then would not give me any time and I was feeling frustrated. I tried breaking up with him in August of 2020 and he again blackmailed me and manipulated me. (BACK THEN I DID NOT KNOW THAT A MINOR CANNOT DATE AN ADULT AND THAT IT IS NOT ALLOWED). So basically he groomed me. He would always ask me marry him. He would not support me in my studies. He would ask to not wear revealing clothes and the lists continues. I was not able to take it anymore and I confronted him. He shouted at me and abused me and broke up with me. I didn't not feel bad at all but the thing that still haunts me is how he sexually used me. I don't want my past to interfere in my future relationships.

Early this past September I found that. I met a girl named Amber through another friend who now hates me for a reason I don't even know. Anyways Amber and I have been really close since. She's talked to me and let me vent to her and was supportive of everything. She loved me. She cared about me. I loved and cared about her too. She was everything I ever wanted and more. Then today not even 3 hours ago I was texting her about me being clingy and that I wished I had someone to hug me. Then she took it as me complaining about her. I tried to tell her that I wasn't talking about her not giving enough affection but I was talking about my family and she didn't believe me. It was honestly so fucking soul crushing to read texts from the one person who you'd die for just telling you how awful you were for complaining about them when you were complaining about something else entirely.

I also don't have access to therapy. There's only one facility in town that handles mental health (that I can afford), and I've been told I abused the attendance policy and can't be given anymore treatments. That was an error made by the receptionist.

I've been alone for 8 years now. My parents are going to move out of state next year and that will leave me entirely alone. And that scares the shit out of me. More so because I know I don't have the skills to form decent relationships.

I just can't attach to people. Even if I like the person - I just can't gain feelings for them. My personality disorder also makes me incredibly unstable emotionally and it's something that for the last 8 years I've kept away from other people. I don't want to harm anyone.

And it's unfair to ask someone to love me if I can't return it back. I know everyone says that no one will end up alone. But I know I will. I don't foresee a future with another person.

I keep saying those words in my head but I’ll be real, it’s not making it any easier. Last night I got a text from my wife, who’s away with her friend for a few days while me and my 7 year old son stayed behind to let her have a girls trip, that it’s time we talked, and everyone knows what’s coming when you hear those words.

Things haven’t been perfect but no relationship ever is. We just celebrated our 2 year anniversary a month ago, have been together for almost 9, and had plans to be moving out of state in the coming months to start fresh. Doesn’t look like that’ll be included in our next chapter. 

There’s nothing that hits you as hard as the punch in the gut feeling you get when the love of your life that you vowed to hold and cherish for as long as you both shall live, that you’ve grown from teenagers, to young parents, to now almost in your 30’s and have been side by side every day for almost the past decade, tells you that the love she once had for you has slowly grown to none, that you aren’t the same person she fell in love with years ago and that it’s time for change. It’s time for her to move on without me. 

The anger, sadness, guilt, and confusion that’s been racing through my mind all night over this is unreal. When the person I thought I’d die with tells me she no longer wants to be around me, the love that she had for her husband is so far gone that the only choice for her to be happy is to separate and move onto to someone new, it’s a hurt I can’t describe. 

Life really sucks right now. I could have and should have been better, and it’s something that I know is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Today seems surreal. 

To all guys out there, hold your wife tight man, and don’t let her go. Let her know how much you love her, remind her every day. Be open to adventures and things you normally wouldn’t see yourself doing. Just do the little things and let her know how important she is and what she means to you. I can’t do that anymore and I can tell you, the helplessness you feel from that is the worst pain I’ve ever felt.",lonely,Life goes on,2021-11-08 03:01:29

Everything seems so unreal.
You just want to feel real. 
The real thing.

Those real moments you feel like you never had.
Or those moments you feel that didn’t last forever, but you wish they did.

Even when you feel like you don’t have a lot of time, it’ll always be around you.
It just takes some people longer to notice.

Ever since I've left high school, I've lost all my friends slowly one by one. I'd always see them all hang out together on social media and I always got so confused and frustrated on why they would always never invite me. We were all so close back then, but now it just seems like they all hate me, or forgot about me. Seeing all of them being happy together, it fuckin breaks me inside. Not gonna lie I feel really lonely and envy their friendship.

I also recently just broke up with my ex a year ago and I still can't move on. She was the only one who could understand me. We had the same kind of humor. We both had the same hobbies. We loved each other. We both had a real connection. And I've fucked it all up. I've tried everything to help distract myself from her. Gaming, exercising, drinking and now I just started to self harm again because it's the only thing that stops my mind from the pain. She's the only girl that would I ever think about the whole day and now I just feel so empty. 

Everyone's breaking all their connections with me and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't have anyone to depend on, no one is ever there for me. Whenever I get back to work, everyone's telling me how awesome their week was and what they did with other people and there I am trying to avoid the conversation because all I did that week was stay in my room all alone or go out alone. It kills me inside when I see friends post on social media being happy with other people or with their significant other.

I got bullied in school and it led to me being insecure and quiet, I used to have friends and be outgoing and if the bullying never happened I think I’d be the same outgoing person I was as a young person. 

I don’t have a boyfriend I don’t go out much at all so I guess there’s not many opportunities for that, plus I’m quiet and shy and I don’t know if I am the person guys find interesting enough to fall in love with anyway.

I don’t want to be an old person who’s alone forever so I’m trying my hardest to become less insecure and quiet and shy, I’m trying to become way prettier  (I’m putting in literally as much effort as I can to my looks as this could help my confidence plus it helps attract people) and trying to make social connections.

What was supposed to be a month long vacation has so far turned into a nightmare for me and I've never been in a worse headspace.

I was only supposed to be there for a month but covid got worse and worse and there were only rumors of when I could go back. I ended up going back to my home country after nearly half a year.

I fell in love in Higschool with someone who didn't love me back. I wasted most of days there and focus on non productive hobbies like playing video games (don't get me wrong, playing video games is great, but it isn't as productive as something like going to the gym or painting) or fawning over her like some obsessive person through facebook (everything went downhill eventually but that's not today's point).

After highschool, I met a huge dead end. Had to drop playing video games and focus on academics in 12th grade (education system is weird here) . Got new hobbies like teaching myself mathematics and electronics, and also started learning programming and watching anime. Also, resumed playing video games. But none of my peers, except a few share these hobbies. Those who did went to different colleges.

It's not just hobbies. Even my interests don't align with others. I despise Instagram and yet not having an account makes me a creep or triggers a red flag. Why? Politics is becoming a more prevalent topic of group discussions and I don't want to be a part of it. Yet, no one respects my wishes of not participating and judge me for my disinterest.

Since then, my friendships have just gone downhill. I went from that one good friend I had for a year to a friend group who hated me, then to another friend group where I was always ignored and never invited to anything and I wasn't really liked by anyone, and now to a group of people who I can't even call acquaintances. 

I know one girl in that group and we never talk, so I'm just sitting with her friend group full of people who aren't interested in talking to me even when I try. It hurts so much because I know I'll never be good enough for anyone. I went from a kid who was loud, happy, and could talk to strangers easily to someone who is quiet and dull. And no matter how hard I try I can't go back to how I used to be. And I don't think I ever will because back then I was happy because of how oblivious I was. I thought the friend group I was in liked me and we were great friends, only to later find out how much they hated me and wanted me gone from the group.

I think I'm just going to die lonely with no friends. I'm just one of those dull, boring, smart people. Except the only thing that makes me smart are my grades, I myself am not smart I just work hard to get good grades even though I barely understand anything.

It sucks looking around at all these people in their wonderful friend groups going places and having fun while I've never had that. I genuinely feel like I can never make a close friend. It's not just because I'm not that attractive, the main thing is I'm so dull in personality. I can't laugh or smile at stuff, it takes a lot for me to smile at something. So if someone makes a joke or tells me about something they're excited for, I try to smile and show I'm excited but it looks so fake. I just can't seem to express any happy emotion without it looking fake so people just see me as dull and overall I'm just not the person someone would want to be friends with

4510,DarkWulf54,1636264430,1,"This is something I think about pretty often.

Stuffer from Haphephobia and it's been in decline as each year rolls by.

Touching in general is pretty painful for me and I've been in a situation where I was sexually assaulted earlier this week by a female. Wasn't on a date, she came over to see my roommate drunk, and don't even know what her name was. Ended up giving her a ride home and she was really, really giving me a hard time. Reaching over, trying to crawl into the driver seat, literally had to fight this girl off of me.

Started crying and going at it again. As a guy, I can't defend myself in an aggressive manner or cause her pain because she'd be able to reverse uno card that stuff legally. Though I forced her back into the passenger seat while I was driving.

She tried and almost got to me, but she was too drunk to figure out my belt and etc. This was, hard to deal with. I almost just, gave up fighting.

Went on for awhile. Thought about pressing charges against her, but... I don't look the part of an innocent guy so I'm rarely treated that way.

Been through that before in the past, where LEOs will kind of look at me like... ""Really bro?"". I get it. Really. I get it. I'm not a petite little girl so there is no credibility in my accusations.

Anyway,

The whole thing was a nightmare experience for me. Really messing me up, the grabbing, the touching...

I've told a couple people about this, they don't understand at all. Saying I should take it as a compliment that a girl wanted me that way.

I've had conversations with my friends (they're actually my coworkers) about how difficult it is for me to be intimate with someone else. the burning sensations of being touched, and most of it is just laughed off.

I look and am a tough guy, deal with a lot of physical abuse through work and etc... So... Hard for them to imagine me complaining about something like this.

There is one girl that I liked, I believed that she liked me too and we did go out on a sushi date... I told her what happened, but, she hates me now and doesn't see me.

So...

Really, trying to keep it together, but... Really falling back into the whole ""nobody actually cares, and those who act like it are lying"" mindset.

I don't know.

With the Haphephobia thing it's as if nobody really cares to understand as it's something of a rarity that's hard to relate to for most.

So things like being assaulted like that, is really hard.

It's been going on for months and I am just tired of getting bullied and blamed for how people feel insecure around me. I always invited and organized groups, I included him and others.





The lying, gaslighting, and secret call and making fun of my room mate who personally gave him their number ( for when he needed someone, I gave him mine too) is just a whole level of cruelty I cant get past.




One of them removed me off everything and left all mutual servers we were in, and tried to reach out yesterday as if nothing happened. Well I found out 5 days ago about the secret group call. 





I was constantly asking if something was wrong and gave clear examples of why I felt excluded and bullied and was gaslighted and told i was overthinking things or taking things too personally. And this whole time they had a secret group call to talk shit about me!

If you want to send sympathy, please just do it mentally, as I appreciate it immensely. Anyways, I am in my first semester of college and I've never been lonelier. I graduated from high school a year early so I am set apart slightly from my peers, but I have plenty of emotional and social intelligence. Back home I had many close friends, made connections easily, and even had a few long-term girlfriends. When I went to college I made some slight connections at first, but nothing has stuck. I have no true friends and every girl I have tried to achieve something more with has either ignored me or quit talking to me. I have been putting myself out there, going to events, talking to strangers, and generally doing things that interest me. Regardless, I remain alone. I am also intensely into the study of philosophy, but no one seems to care about it or understand. The professors are not much help either. When I use any diction that is even slightly above diction used in regular discussion, both teachers and students find it weird. I have had an entire class laugh and a teacher say ""That's a big word!"" when I reference intermediate philosophical or economic concepts. I even have to help the professors define words being used in the lesson sometimes. Additionally, all of the professors at my school are analytic philosophers (except for one). Being that I consider myself someone who subscribes to the continental school, it is hard for me to engage with my professors about philosophy because we speak two different philosophical languages. The one continental professor differs with me politically to such a degree that it is also tough for us to communicate. Despite this, my philosophy professor invited me to coffee with herself and the continental professor. This made me very happy and I was excited to pick their minds. When I responded with when I was available, I never got an email back. I try to do my best to socialize. I have plenty of experience, I have read many books on social skills, and I have done lots of research into making connections with others (not because I needed to, but because it is interesting). No matter what I do it seems that I am socially, academically, and intellectually alienated. It really sucks. I have good hygiene, I dress well, I act with kindness and compassion, I'm fit, I work hard on my studies, I have many unique interests, and I love having great conversation. This obviously doesn't make me entitled to friendships and romantic relationships, but I simply don't know what I'm doing wrong. I told my dad about it and I am in the process of going back to therapy and the psychiatrist. I told my mom as well and it made her cry, so I can barely confide in her anymore because I don't want to make her sad. I told her that I feel sad to a degree when I hear other kids laughing in groups together, eating together, hanging out together, and creating great productions/events together. I told my cousin who is my best friend that their laughter is like poison. I don't want that to be the case. I love people and I have so much hope for humanity. I swear I just have so much love to give and no one to take it. Sometimes I feel tempted by depression or a desire to be ""the bad guy."" I don't let it get to me though, as I remember the teachings of the Buddha and meditate to let my feelings pass like clouds in the sky. I am just so tired and frustrated from getting ghosted, stood up, laughed at, gasped at, ignored, and probably gossiped about. My conclusion is that there must be something wrong with me. My mom says that there are probably many other kids feeling this way, but everyone I see seems to be having a good, or at least mediocre, time with a group of other people (and I know you can feel ""alone in a room full of people,"" as I have felt that many times. However, this is not the case here because I can hear the genuine joy in their laughter/conversation). It would be nice to be held by someone, but I don't even need that. I just need someone to eat a meal with once a day. That seems almost like a basic human need (Aristotle said we are social animals, of course). I feel a little bit better after letting it all out, but I really don't know what to do. I am going to keep trying though and I am not going to give up. In all honesty, though, it is tiring anons.

4546,CutawayChaser,1636254435,1,"So, I've never been the most popular person. In school I was picked on a lot for being a fat comic book nerdy kid. When the taunting got physical, I would fight back, but rarely win, so I was a favorite target. I had a very small circle of friends (my fellow nerds) that kept me laughing, and I developed a pretty good sense of humor, but I became very introverted and bitter, because most times anyone approached me, it was to set me up for mockery. I eventually grew to a pretty decent height, and some of that fat turned to muscle, so I got a bad attitude and got very aggressive when I detected a threat, trying to scare away any potential enemies before they actually engaged. (I turned into a bit of an arseh\*le, frankly.) I withdrew into my art work A LOT. This lasted through High School. 

When I went to college for art, I realized that NO ONE from my High School went to the same college I did, which was weird, because it was three towns over from the High School (I guess most people wanted to get far away from their home town, but I went there because it was a pretty decent art school). I used it as a reset; no one knew me, so I didn't have to be bitter and pretend I was someone I wasn't, I could just be myself! Added bonus, many of the people I was in school with now actually shared my passion for the arts. I LOVED college. I made a ton of friends, and I was actually considered pretty popular among my new circle of friends because I had a great sense of humor. I became the guy I am today. 

I met some of the most cherished friends at and immediately after college, and worked with some of them for a few years after. But one by one, they moved on to greener pastures, and moved away in pursuit of their grown up financially successful careers, while I've worked a series of jobs that always seem to end for various reasons beyond my control (seriously, the college I loved so much got SHUT DOWN, and I lost four jobs when that happened). But I love what I do now for a living.

I've never really left my hometown. I've always been close with my siblings, I considered them some of my best friends, and as a result, I've never been very outgoing at making new friends. I've had girlfriends, but no successful long term relationships (I dated the exchange student from my High School for a year FIFTEEN YEARS after she graduated, but long distance didn't work out for us, and neither of us were able to move to the other's country). I still live in the town I grew up in, renting the house I grew up in from my brother who now owns it. I am the primary caretaker for my mom, who is battling cancer, and she is very supportive of me and my art and job. I still keep up with my friends on Social Media, and through that I ended up becoming good friends with a girl I knew in High School (her brother was in my grade, she was two grades behind us). We used to go on hikes all the time, and we were pretty close, though never romantic.  (We had previously discussed if we wanted something more, she said she didn't, I would have been open to it and told her so, but we were seemingly okay.)

Up until five years ago, I feel like I've had a pretty good handle on my life. But over the past five years, one by one, people have been exiting my life in various ways. I have a great job in the summer but by it's nature, the friendships I form there are transitory (a lot of international instructors who move to other jobs, not everyone comes back every season, etc.). 

One of my best friends from college moved to another country with his wife, so he's kinda drifted off.

My brother and I, for many reasons, our relationship has become strained. It has reached a point where he has stated out loud to my face that he is starting to hate me (this guy was practically my best friend for the most meaningful 20 years of my life). My sister, normally a paragon of compassion and positivity, has shown me sides of her personality that make me very sad, and even though everyone who knows us has long considered my brother the crazy ""deviant"" of the family, they are in constant contact over their lives and I am now considered the ""black sheep outcast"" of the family. We used to be there all the time, having family gatherings, laughing, joking. I hardly ever see them any more, but I don't want to seem needy or impose myself in a situation where I'm viewed as an outcast.

My hiker friend sent me a text out of the blue saying she didn't see a way our friendship could get past where it was, whatever that means, and abruptly cut off our friendship with no further explanation.

My other friends are all busy with their careers, and their families, and their lives. I don't have much money or opportunity to make new friends. I find myself retreating more and more into my art, and growing more and more bitter, just like the old days.

I used to default to ""what did I do wrong"" when someone was mad at me, but I learned that sometimes it just isn't me, and chasing after them to get an explanation isn't my job. Yet I feel like everyone is walking away.

I can't just pack up and leave, I have no savings, and the years of just doing odd jobs have has left me on the outside of my original career path with little hope of getting back in. I've been trying to sell my art, photography and writing, but that's not the path to riches I was hoping for, and my debts are mounting. I feel like the show has ended, but I'm still on the set reading my lines despite the fact that everyone else is on their next project. I don't know how to start something new.

I don't see the way to happiness like I used to. I don't know how to find contentment. I can't even see the path I'm on anymore.

im alone. im completely alone for 6 months. i dont have any close friends or anyone at all that i could talk with about how i feel. i came to work in other country and all i have is shallow communication with colleagues. im in love with girl for years. at first she had feelings for me as well. we were messaging so much, but for whatever reason we didnt meet too much for some time untill we started to about little over year ago. i have never felt so at peace and more fulfilled than for those short months that we had together. even though our relationship was far for complete, thats all i ever had with her and it meant everything to me.
then she decided to go to other country for volunteering job for 10 months. at first it felt fine because i had to get my life together  and thats why i decided to go for work and save money and come back to have a better start. but distance and communication through phone was too hard for me and i started to notice that she grew distant and i started to get jealous. we argued and she decided to stop talking. we ended up not talking only after 3 werks after she went away. it was very sad and hard time. later after 2,5 months, out of the blue she texted me asking if i want to come and visit. my feelings were no strong anymore but we started to talk again little by little and they grew back. and jealousy wass still there, but i never expressed it openly to her. i tried to get her to say something that would make the jealosy feeling go away and it ruined our comunication.  worst part is that i didnt had a real reason for jealousy and i hated myself for having it but i just couldnt help it. we were talking and arguing on and off for about 3 months. now about 2 weeks ago she told me about how she liked one guy but he went away. i was asking why would she say that to me and she replied that she thought that my romantic feelings were not here anymore. and this changed her attitude. she said that she cant imagine me next to her when she is truly happy. she had feelings but they faded away. i was good for only when she felt down and needed support. before that we talked about how she could come visit me after her project ended, but now she denied this idea as well. so everything went bad and she ended up blocking me. today i accidentally saw that she started to follow a guy from country where i am and he follows her back. i wrote to her because of course in my head i think she will come here but to another guy. this made me feel sick in stomach, like that terrible anxiety feeling when you lose appetite. she said she will reply tomorrow. i feel so hurt and used, i really wanted her to visit me, i wanted to showe her around since i had the chance to do something nice for her and now i have to live with thought that other guy will do it. it drives me crazy snd i have cried for last hour. this is really really brief look into our situation. i dont have anyone to talk to about her. im dealing with all the these strong emotions alone and i feel like it willl never end. i really want to die but i know i will ruin my sisters life by doing that. im living in nightmare that i cant wake up from.

About three years back, I contracted a gastrointestinal virus. It was the most intense pain I had ever felt, but it only lasted for a day or so. What was worse is that it took me ages to recover. Even eight or nine months later, towards the end of that year, my whole body was aching and I was constantly fatigued. I had panic attacks almost every night, and my guts were just one fire. One day, after having an anxiety attack and going to the ER, they gave me some quetiapene to settle me down. When I got home, I managed to get to sleep, and I dreamed about the life I had fantasized about over preceeding few years: I'm sitting outside a little wooden cabin in the Carpathians with a big sleeping dog laying by my feet on the wooden porch as I rock in my chair. I can see the sun setting over the crest of the horizon in the distance while the autumn air nipped at whatever skin I had exposed. My wife opens the door and reaches out to give me a hug. She has the face of a kind and beautiful young woman I met a few years before who I knew was interested in me, but who I never worked up the courage to talk to.

When I woke up from the dream, sometime in the late afternoon the day after, I went on a walk. It was November, maybe early December. I took a walk down the snowy trail by the river in my town. When I got to an opening in the trees, I sat and looked at the thin ice in front of me and watched the sunset, but for real this time. I compared the life I had made for myself and the life I thought I had to look forward to to the one from my dream. When I looked towards the thin sheet of ice over the river in front of me, I knew there was no way it would hold. I thought long and hard about stepping out onto it. With a little luck, they might not find me until spring.

I haven't got any friends left, I haven't been on a date in almost a decade, I feel so isolated and like there is nobody else in the world who values the same things as I do. What's more is that I know it's really my own fault in the end. I don't feel like I have anyone or any place in the world as it exists today, and I think almost everyday about how I wish I had just gone through with it those years ago. I just don't have the willpower to do any better than I am right now.

Those in college were with me because I was good at school. Always ready to help them. Also, they don't say « hi » to me...

Girls... Well... Between 18 and 24, I was « lucky » with the ladies. By lucky I mean that I was able to get ladies to like me, but always the wrong lady. I always ended with a woman that, slowly but surely, was putting me down. At 24, I decided to stay away from women for a while. Building myself back up. Then  tried Tinder, Badoo, etc. Too much bad apples. Also, on a side note, I have a voice that is still in puberty. Like, sometimes, on the phone, people call me « madam ». I was asked several times by girls on those apps in real, or over the phone, if I was gay or mentally ill and if it was the reason that I have that voice . Of course, I was angry every time and it was a « no no » for me. 

Last summer, at my 30th birthday, nobody said to me « Happy Birthday ». Not in person. Not in social media. Being lonely is starting to damage me. It is starting to tickle me. Tried to do activites to meet others, but in the end, those were making me feel more lonely. Those days, all I want is to have a connection with someone. Someone to talk to when I come home. Someone to hug. Someone that is breathing beside me when I sleep. Be there for someone.",lonely,30M Tired to be lonely...,2021-11-07 10:21:07

I had a horrible childhood in an abusive, addiction riddled home.

People like me have *lives*; they associate with each other, they find meaning in small things, they connect on a superficial level. They use and they are used, they live and they die, they suffer and they enjoy.

They are happy to live in this world without being paralyzed by doubt. They accept things as they are, they hop from relationship to relationship; they apply the mechanistic, amoral nature of modernity to their own surroundings: after all, it is ""all meaningless"", we are supposed to be stupid pieces of meat floating in a meaningless universe and we are all going to die, that is what we have been told, it is what has been implanted in our minds since we were children. Nothing is sacred, reality is subjective; we need to *squeeze* pleasure out of life before it is too late, so you better start learning early; today is already too late. A life is just a number, a group of lives a statistic, every inch of nature is *a resource* waiting to be extracted, transformed, colonized. The other is *a thing*, something to be used and abused at will, and a personal relationship is a zero-sum game, an economic transaction waiting to be finished.

I know I have nothing to complain about. I know that other people have it much worse; thankfully, I have a family. But I cannot live in this world. What surrounds me is repulsive, and I refuse to engage with it. My mind is drunk on sentiment; it cannot stop thinking about *the way things should be*; it can't allow itself any compromise with *the way things are*. It rejects the life of a rootless, atomized individual. Sometimes I wish I had the power to reshape reality, to restore the soul that humanity once had and was stolen from all of us.

I really wish I could find someone that fits me. I cannot picture her in my head because she could be anywhere. She could be twenty or fifty. We could share opinions and lifestyles, or we could be the complete opposite of each other. But we would hug, looking at each other in the eyes, and *know* that we are soulmates, that everything else is accessory and what matters is what is inside of us, the kind of person we are, the way our spirits are alike, magnetically attached to each other, disregarding habits, money, external appearances. Knowing that we are not atomized individuals anymore, and that we will be there forever, to the end of times, happier and stronger together.

While in high school and college, I was always surrounded by many friends that I considered “close”. Being a part of a fraternity and living in one of the houses, there were people coming over all the time. And I actually had friends that I could rely on whenever I needed help. After graduation, I moved to a different country and stopped chatting with all of them except when I visit them once a year.

Working in a time demanding job in finance, I can’t make friends. Only place I go to is the gym other than my work, and the average age in my company is much older so I don’t have much in common to become good friends with my colleagues (I’m mid 20s and my colleagues are above 35/40s).

4643,MNSLightning,1636226043,1,"So... I don't know how to start this. I'm just so tired and need to get this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I am lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

That might be very obvious to everyone that reads this, but it feels nice to put it out in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, I had a bad bout mental health issues which landed me in a ward. At the time, I had my dream job, I lived with two very dear friends and even if the pressure felt immense, I still felt alone. I didn't feel like I had anyone to talk to about how I truly felt. I left my family at age 17 because it was the best thing to do at that time. I've had to manage somehow anyway. I've mostly scraped by with the support of the few friends I've had or a partner here or there. The ones that didn't abuse me, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt horrible living in the town I grew up in. Too many bad memories. Too much heartbreak and sorrow. I recently moved into the small village I live in now and I have never felt more alone than before.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been fighting my depression for as long as I can remember. Through out my life I've always been able to call someone. Not to dump all of my bad feelings onto them. Just... Talk... I've been feeling particularly bad lately. Life haven't gone the way I wanted, lately. I've tried to push through, but it's been wearing me down.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to end my life earlier this week and failed.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously, with my attempts, I've at least been able to regain some vigor. It's like it gave me a new view of how everything is. ""I'll get my life back together."" I'll tell myself. And I'll do it. I'll do everything in my power to get back on my feet. But this time, I just feel empty. I feel tired. This time, I don't have anyone to call or text.

&amp;#x200B;

No one.  


I went down to the lake close to my apartment and just sat there and cried. I'm worried I might fall even deeper into my dark hole and this time, I won't be able to crawl my way back up again. I've just been holed up in my apartment when I'm not at work. My new apartment. The only thing I've been looking forward to lately. Now that I have it, I'm lost. Nothing to look forward to. Nothing that keeps me going. Nothing. No project to keep me going. No work to immerse myself into like I usually do. No one that will text me and say ""Hey, just wanted to check in on you."" I am lonely. I am scared. But most of all...

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just going pretend tonight. Pretend I'm not this.

During quarantine however  I've been alone for a over a year and it's gone to the point where it's shifted from being alone,to just being lonely. I wanna go outside and have fun with my friends,but I deny myself that. I just stay inside,knowing that something as small as a text from anyone asking how I'm doing could make my day,so I sit,waiting,for no one to call me.

I started using social media more,watching people having fun with their friends,observing how they act around each other. Then I would try to copy how they acted and talk to myself in different slang and accents just to feel like I'm talking to someone else. it actually works too,I do feel like I'm talking to someone,but that someone is an exaggerated version of how I want to talk to. a perfect doll. I do talk with my actual friends,but it's clear we've become distant. I can't talk with them seriously. we know what the problem is, but none of us can speak up about it. I've planned spilling the beans on everything multiple times but I just couldn't go through with it. our friendship is doomed. I even changed how I act,like more of a hoodlum that spews out jokes and other shit and it gets people to laugh,but that's the only thing it is,a facade.

This story sounds silly but I don’t really care. We met on Reddit, our friendship literally lasted for like a month. She told me that she had a boyfriend so I limited myself to make a move. I never felt that way, she made me feel so special. She was like my best buddy. We used to play roblox. Well she abandoned me because she thought that she was bringing more negativity into our friendship and never had time to talk to me

That made me cry. She was the only person i actually trusted. Now I think about her everyday, like we are in a relationship. I hug my pillow thinking that it’s her despite never seeing how she looks

This might sound creepy but I can’t help myself. Maybe she was the person I’m looking for. I made up things for her and think she’s beside me. Maybe I love her but she’ll never know and it’d never come true because we’re from different countries. Even tho I have a chance to talk to her back I’d never do that because I’m an idiot and a desperate guy. I’d also come off as creepy and it’d be uneasy for her. 

I never said about this to her because it’d be annoying. She also told me that she suffers from mental health so I never really said something that irritates her. I did irritate her one time that was short before she abandoned me. Maybe I’m too boring or annoying. I hope she’s fine and hope nothing bad happens to her. The odds of finding someone like her is highly unlikely but do I know everything about her? No. Then why all of this? Because I’m an idiot.

You open your door and get greeted by more darkness and a cold home. You turn on the tv so you can watch the news in a few minutes. While the commercials are still going on you prepare some food for yourself, most likely something simple because you’re not feeling like cooking. While you wait for your food to be ready the tv plays a Christmas commercial.

It’s that time of the year again, you think to yourself. Happy families, friends, love, a very nice atmosphere you haven’t had in a while and you most likely will not have this year either and god knows how many years will follow, but at least you have some free days from work right? As you laugh to yourself, but not of happiness but of pure pain. 

Your meal is ready and the news is about to start. You sit alone at the table or in the couch and learn of all the bad news that have happened that day. Mostly covid, which has massively influenced your social life the past few months, but also other terrible things like housing crisis. You look around and realize, I live in a small home by myself, paying too much rent, but you had no choice other than taking this offer or live somewhere way worse. The news ends, your meal is over and you prepare for your shower. 

As you shower the warmth of the shower takes you over and dreams and thoughts enter your mind. The warmth you are mostly unfamiliar with and thoughts of good times, while also immediately following up with the realization it’s just a dream or a fantasy. But it does not matter, the warmth of the shower gives you comfort, a good feeling and eventually makes those thoughts disappear. 

You finish your shower and spend the rest of the night doing a hobby or just watch tv/Netflix on your own or play some video games with mostly randoms and if you’re lucky some online person you met the other night. But fully knowing tomorrow he might delete you from his friendslist and you will never see them again. 

The time passes by without too much issue as you suddenly realize it’s time for bed. You prepare yourself for bed time and enter the ice cold blanket that’s in your bed. You turn off the lights and twist and turn. Thoughts of loneliness cross your mind once again, memories of the past and your depressing future keep you awake. Then comes the realization, being alone isn’t bad right? Right? As you start thinking about the nicer things in life that you have right now. Then the thoughts hit again stuff could’ve been way better with friends, family or a partner, but right before emotions hit you, you fall asleep.

Anyways, I’m 31 and married now and the only “friends” I have are my husbands friends wives whom I don’t ever talk to outside of our parties/social gatherings.  So I would never call/text or hang out with any of them outside of a social gathering.  I guess my point is, it would be nice to have someone to call when I’m having a rough day, or go to lunch with, or a play date with my 2yr old, or whatever.  I just feel incredibly sad when I see ppl on social media with their close/tight friend circles or their ‘bestie of X amount of years’ wondering why I don’t have that.  What’s even more frustrating is that some of these ppl I speak of treat their friends like garbage (like lying, stealing money from them, yelling &amp; calling them names, etc), and I would NEVER do those things!
I really just wanna know 1) why do those type of awful ppl have tons of close friends and not me?  2) how did I get so unlucky to lose ALL my friends and 3) how do u get over the loneliness and not feel shit about yourself when no one around u has this problem?

For the some years that was an easy question. 'I don't know' and 'I'll see' were the answers. Those were the happy years. The ones after I quit my rent and walked out the door, burned all my bridges and started wandering, or in my case, cycling. With my sleeping bag strapped to the saddle I roamed, alone, and sometimes lonely, but also content and full of life.

Then I met a girl... And together we roamed some more. Then I lost the girl and tried to keep my chin up by holding onto whatever floats. I went back to a place of friends we met during our travels and got hopelessly stuck there. I'm treated as family, but I know I'm not.

The place I'm stuck is considered paradise by many; four kilometers from the sea, mountains on the horizon, Mediterranean climate. It has all the possibilities one could wish for. It feels strange to be unhappy here but I am. All I can think of is going back on the road, where life is hard, but full of options...

4679,Irohen,1636211792,1,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been really stressed out these days and could really use some advice. Brace yourself though: it's very long, but I needed to provide enough context to make sure it's possible to understand what I'm dealing with.

Here’s my situation: I’m a 24-year-old guy, and despite being quite attractive (My best photo is in the top 20% in all three categories (smart, trustworthy and attractive) on Photofeeler), never had a relationship, kissed or had sex. From what I can imagine, there are a couple of reasons for that. First, I’m a very introverted, and struggle to make friends. My social circle is very small, and mostly consist of childhood friends whose parents always have been friends with mine. They’re kind of like brothers and sisters to me and my siblings, and when we hang out together, it’s usually only us (they have other groups of friends, but I never met them). And they’re not the kind of friends that I go to bars and stuff like that (except maybe things like boardgame bars). When I don’t go out with them, I just don’t meet people. Since high school (so around the last 7 years or so), the only people I’ve been speaking with on a regular basis are my family (I still live with my parents). Well, except maybe for my summer job, where I have started to try to talk more with my colleagues to get out of my shell. Aside for that, I would never go to parties, to bars, to social activities or stuff like that. Nobody would really push me to go out and meet people: my parents would tell me it wasn’t a big deal and that I would eventually find people I would connect with naturally. I trusted them, and since I never talked about these worries with anybody else, they were my only source of advice on how these things worked, so I would follow their advice and stop trying. In recent years, I’ve been wanting to have a girlfriend, but had no clue how I was supposed to meet women, so I kept following my parents’ advice and just waited, hoping something would happen eventually. It’s only in recent years that I realised how abnormal my situation was. Apparently, virgins at my age are very rare, and most of them are by choice (because of religious or cultural reasons, for example) or because they’re very unattractive. It brings me a lot of shame: I feel as if there is something wrong with me. The problem is, I feel like it’s too late for me to get in the game and have the success I would like to have. When I was younger, I was awkward and never really fitted in, and living almost like a hermit since that time means I have only a very vague understanding of how people connect with each other. Its looks like I’m too late to catch up, and it gives me a huge handicap. No matter how much I think about it, I don’t see how I’m going to be able to get into a relationship, unless I’m lucky enough to find someone that I like and that is patient enough to want to date me despite my lack of experience.

Since around three years, I’ve been trying to get a relationship. I’ve been mostly using dating apps, without much success. I had a date once about two years ago, and the girl was very kind and understanding, but it was obvious I wasn’t mature enough for a relationship at that time.  Then, the pandemic hit, so opportunities to meet people became rare. So I worked on myself: I started working out regularly, dressing better and taking the initiative to talk to my colleagues at my summer job. I’m a lot better now and have gained self-respect. I know I’m a good person that deserves to be loved. But it doesn’t seem enough. There was a girl at work that I had a crush on for 3-4 years, and I never had the courage to tell her how I felt (I also didn’t want to make it awkward for her to go to work when I was there). But last summer, we usually worked on different days, except for one time where we were together. I took that opportunity to talk to her and try to get closer to her, and it seemed to go pretty well (except at the end of the day, when my social battery was almost empty, and I didn’t know what to talk about anymore). But I knew I probably wouldn’t have that opportunity again, so after work, I decided to confess to her. I had to get home early, but I still decided to do it by sending her a Facebook message. She told me it wasn’t a good time for her. I told her it was ok and to tell me if she changed her mind. However, inside I was very depressed. This girl was everything I was looking for: I loved her look as well as her personality, and she was one of the only people I knew that had a similar music taste as me. And look wise, I’m sure I was in her league. She seemed like a great match for me. So if it didn’t work out with her, how am I supposed to get a relationship? I started falling once again in the dating app rabbit hole, and despite getting a few matches, most of them ended up ghosting me for no apparent reason, even in cases where it felt like it was going well. So now finding someone feels impossible for me. Dating apps? Like I just said, they don’t work for me, except if I get extremely lucky (like with that girl I had a date with). Clubs and bars? Not my kind of place, and I don’t think girls that go there would be my type. Coffee shops? People go there to work or read a book: I don’t want to be the guy to bother them. Meetup? Only people in their thirties or forties go there in my local area. Cooking classes? There are none near where I live, and most people that attend to them are usually, again, people in older age groups (people my age usually don’t have the time or money to go there. College social clubs? There are no in person activities because of covid restrictions. Sport/dancing classes? Almost none that interest me near where I live, usually don’t fit with my schedule (I have college classes) and I usually have to pay for the season so even if no one there interests me I have to commit to it or I’ll feel like I wasted a lot of money (money which I don’t want to waste, since I plan to get my own place in the next months, when I’ve finished my studies). You’d probably also tell me I should start by making friends, but I no longer have the patience for that. Making meaningful relationship and building a social circle is something people make over years of their lives. I don’t want to spend 2-3 years trying to build one before I even get the chance to meet someone I like. I have read popular books on the topic, such has “How to make friends and influence people” by Dale Carnegie and “Models: Attract women through honesty” by Mark Manson, and while I learned some advice from them, I feel like a lot of it doesn’t apply well to my situation. 

Honestly, I don’t really know what to do anymore. This whole thing is very bad for my mental health, and I want to get out of it as soon as possible. I feel like I’m wasting my youth when I should have so many opportunities that I won’t have when I’m older. Yet it feels like there’s no way out, no matter how much I look, and no one in my family seems to know how to help me. I could really use some advice or support.

Alright, here it goes. My boyfriend of 1.5 years left me this week (I’m male, bisexual). I didn’t see it coming, he just dropped the bomb out of nowhere. For good reasons. I’m not mad at him, in the end, it was a pretty loving break up.

However, *I’m* going mad. I’ve never loved like this before. I’m 29, I’ve had a puppy love relationship, swore off relationships and just fucked around, and then…him. God, him.

4696,throwawayblue900ss,1636196750,1,"I will crosspost this with r/depression, as I believe it is relevant and may help someone.

I went to a Meetup group recently, a group with people who suffer depression and other disorders. I did this because I am lonely, and depressed due to the isolation from the pandemic.

This made me realize my life could be so much worse. I listened to each of them, all in pain. Here were people, broken, with no motivation, going through such pain. My heart wept for each of these strangers. We were all together, joined in the pain of not living a life to our full potential.

I have been suffering loneliness through most of my own making. Working excessively due to my avarice, not going out and socializing but once a month, passively hoping life will serve a life to me, as though my existing will suffice to earn it. This is not so.

There are two types of people, those with an internal (ILoC) , and those with an external locus of control (ELoC). Those with ILoC view they can change things because of their sense of agency. These people are self-possessed, and take control from life. Those with ELoC view the opposite. They view life happens to them, that they are at the mercy of circumstance outside of their control. They feel they are powerless over their life story.

Taken further to understand, we have three ""selves"". 

1) The Self that *we think we project to others.* *""Who we think they see.""*

2) The Self of how others see us. *""Who they see us as.""*

3) Finally, the unknown because we cannot truly be objective in self-assessment: This is the actual self. *""Who we actually are.""*

Between these three data points, which are admittedly mercurial, we discover who we truly are. I was able to, in this meeting, step outside my box, and understand their is more than one view of me, of them, each of us. I already knew this, in the back of my mind, but I never actively considered it.

Now that I have, things have changed. I have changed.

We all want to be loved and accepted, but this is not possible in every instance. I think back to a simpler time in my life for this illustration. I think back when I would play video games. If you have played video games, there is a concept which applies to my illustration of life. This is the concept of the boss battle.

How many times has one played, to be defeated, as they have not upgraded their stats, such as XP?

Such is a parallel to our finite lives.

Do you slam you controller into the floor and storm off, in defeat? Or, do you ""grind"" and improve your stats in the game, as in life, then return to the boss, until you have accomplished you goals, and defeated your former lesser, pre-upgraded self?

You are going to die. I am going to die.

I have decided to take the control, to take control of my life, like never before. I swim 3 days a week at the gym, until I am exhausted. I run in the same manner. I am building my net worth. I am engaged with by passions and hobbies. I want to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be before facing down my fears, how I was formerly viewed by my acquaintances in life.

As my eyes and mind hold these things, as I view them with my reasoning, I am outrunning a life I know is unworthy to earn my happiness. I outrun suicide through exertion. I outrun it through self-love.

I banish the negative now, because the choice is to live or to die. What's it going to be.

The time to act is now. Fight for the life and love you know you are worthy of. Show people who you are, and shine.

Be well and fight on, live on, love on.",lonely,"You live, or you die...",2021-11-06 22:05:50

4721,TheAlmightyMouth,1636180389,1,"There is nothing I hate more than hearing the words “you need to love yourself,” or “it’ll happen when you least expect it.”

I’m lonely, motherfucker! I crave human contact—both physical and emotional. I want to lie down in bed at night, with the person I love snuggled up next to me. I’m tired of waking up from an amazing dream—one where I’m either in an incredible romantic or sexual scenario—only to find myself spooning my pillow in the morning. I’m tired of hearing shitty, unsolicited advice from people who are happily married or in the relationships that I want for myself.

They think they’re helping. And I honestly can’t blame them. I’ve heard it all before though. I know I need to love myself. I know that, and I try. I love my job, I have friends who care about me, and I’m genuinely happy with my life, for the most part. It’s just that one glaring hole that prevents me from being happy sometimes. That extra key to the front door that never gets used. The occasional Saturday night where I’m sitting alone on the couch; not because I wanted a night in, but because I didn’t want to go out with friends this weekend and I feel like there’s no point in going out to dinner without someone on the other side of the table to enjoy the evening with.

There’s more than the emotional needs that I think of; some of my wants are purely physical, too. As a guy who’s been actively putting himself out there for years, yet never held a relationship beyond the second date, never been kissed by anyone but his mom, and never had sex with anything besides his own left hand, I am no stranger to the baser of emotions: lust. Call me a pervert if you want, but from what I’ve heard, sex is awesome, and I can’t help it if I go into a first date hoping it ends at my place or hers. Pornhub can only take a guy so far.

I realize all of this. Yet people seem to only want to regurgitate the same “advice” at me every time I mention the fact that, “hey, it sure would be nice to have someone special to help make life just a little sweeter.” One can only be told to love themselves so many times before they begin to think they’re unlovable. Hey asshole, I’ve been “least expecting it” for years, now, so why hasn’t it happened yet?

But the worst, by far, are these self-righteous fuckers who think they’re doing me a favor by telling me that I’m not ready for love. Apparently, on their planet, desiring deeper human connection and romance is a sign that you don’t need it, and, in fact, you’d only be hurting yourself if your want for love was met. So, you’re telling me that if I decided to shave my head, move to a monastery, and take a vow of celibacy, THAT is what means I’m “ready?”

Fuck off.

Anyway. This really is just a vent. I genuinely do like where I am in life, just wish I had someone to be happy alongside me. I guess it was seeing a friend I had a crush on in high school get married a week back that set me off. Seeing them so happy and being happy for them just got me thinking, “Will that ever be me?”",lonely,I’m Tired of Receiving “Advice.”,2021-11-06 17:33:09

My one and only 'friend' - and I use that term loosely is one of these people that only keeps people around him if/when they're useful. The last two years or so has taken to drinking almost every night. A week ago we had plans to go karting, then go and catch an organised fireworks display in a city about an hours drive away from here. I say 'plan' as much as it is possible to have plans with him, because again... Everything revolves around him and his schedule. Suffice to say, he went out last night and got wasted, totally eliminating the possibility of us doing anything today. So I slept. Pretty much the whole day, alone. I did manage to get out and go to the movies by myself...but still, by myself. I could have gone to an organised fireworks display or something by myself, but what's the point if you can't laugh joke and mess about with the people you're with? You'd just be a Billy no mates who stands around, doesn't interact and just goes home. Pointless. This one 'friend' is literally the only one I do outdoorsy things with and he can't even lay off the fucking alcohol for one night so he can stick to a plan he made a week ago. I can't make plans. The plans have to be his, and even then they're just flexible plans. 'at somepoint' 'probably' 'if we have time' 'if I don't have other plans'.

I have other friends sure, but honestly they have other issues that I don't have any patience for because they're problems of their own choosing, or character flaws that they either won't acknowledge, or won't correct. I have flaws, that much I'll admit but I won't make my problems other people's problems. I'll just keep them to myself and just live in the moment if I'm with friends, and i don't get why other people just can't swallow their bullshit for a while, and not tell me about it.

It honestly occurs to me that I am the problem, I play this hard done by person but maybe I attract this kind of thing because of the type of person I am? I honestly don't know what to do, other than do what I've been doing for way too long and just shut myself in, ignore other people's requests to hang out (especially this one 'friend' brcause it's always his idea to go out, and never mine) and just try and figure out my own thing to do. Which in all likelyhood is just going to be the same as always, more YouTube videos, TV and movies than the average person, sleep, rinse, repeat.

4740,earthboundmisfit91,1636175491,1,"I edited this to take out some very personal detail, but since it was really therapeutic for me to write I decided I still want it up on my reddit  so here… 



I found a guy on reddit. His previous posts painted a picture of a man who had ""never had a friend or girlfriend,"" describing how his family doesn't like him, how he's ""a lonely single loser with no life experiences."" I knew right away that he was someone I could relate to, someone I would get along with, someone who would understand me. I messaged him. I learned that we liked a lot of the same things and wanted the same things out of life. We started a relationship pretty quickly, getting lovey and affectionate and also sexual. We moved to Whatsapp and we moved to having actual phone calls, every single night for at least two hours, then moving to sleeping together on the phone every night and watching movies together during the day, sharing music, video calling, eventually spending all our time together. I went to Oklahoma twice to visit him. We spent every waking hour and every sleeping hour together during the times we were physically apart. Seven weeks ago, he came to Canada. Other than my mental illnesses fucking with me during that time, it was pure bliss. I was so goddamn happy. So secure in his love for me. So in love with him. More positive emotions than I've ever felt in my entire life. He comforted me, counselled me, was always there to talk and to listen. He said the most sweet, romantic, sentimental things I could ever hope to be said to me. For twelve months. We shared an anniversary together on October 13th. I was looking forward to spending Halloween night with him watching a Silent Hill 2 playthrough on YouTube as we had that same night last year. We had a place -- a special location that was ours. We had a song -- Neon Moon. We sang to eachother. We went so many places together and shared so so so many experiences, both on the phone and in real life. We were going to get married, he said. I had an account with my bank titled ""Immigration Application"" and I was saving money for that, despite struggling with rent and car insurance. We always told eachother how precious &amp; perfect we were to one another. We never did an unkind thing to the other, not once.  When I was doing poorly with my mental health or my trust issues, he'd shake me and look me in the eyes with the most sincere expression on his face and say ""I'd never lie to you. I love you. You are the one I want to spend my life with."" He told me he'd never abuse my trust or hurt me. There were some things I was mildly suspicious about for a moment -- how he'd hide his phone when I came near him, how some of the things he told me would contradict earlier things he'd said. Though I'd never accuse him of lying, I'd ask him a question and he'd hold me by the shoulders and look into my eyes and say those comforting words, and I'd feel better. I trusted him one hundred percent. How could I not? He was perfect. I knew he was my soulmate, my other half. He said the same about me. We had a unique relationship -- something very special, something that would be considered weird by all the normies out there. 


Then shit hit the fan. Basically, I found out about one thing he had lied about, and then more and more came out. Things he lied about from the beginning. Things he had made up even before we had started talking. See, he fished for someone like me. Everything on his reddit account? All fabricated bullshit designed to endear &amp; entrap a lonely girl like me. He feeds off sympathy and attention, I guess. Always has -- he ended up telling me he'd been doing it for most of his life. He lied about everything about himself. Everything, small and large. I never knew him. I don't even think he knows himself. I was DEVASTATED and still am. Guess I'm just another victim of the catfish scam. But he never wanted money. Sure, he wanted certain material goods and foods, but he never badgered me into it -- he was more about pathetic manipulation. Emotional gratification. Basically anything anyone could ever possibly say to make their life seem sad, he said it. This all feels so surreal to me.




I've come to the conclusion that he was never attracted to me (I'm not a physically attractive person, and there were issues with his ""performance"" that I'm now sure were due to the way I look, though he always told me that he viewed beauty differently than most people do.) I believe he was very attached to me and wanted to be the person he presented to be. I believe he would have actually married me. Why? To get to Canada. To be taken care of and loved. To have his future set up for him. Or maybe because he doesn't really care what happens to him or anybody else. He never intended on coming clean about the lies. He never intended to let me really get to know him. He would have been perfectly fine living a lie forever and taking those secrets to his grave. 




Now I'm left here on this godforsaken planet alone, to deal with the knowledge of this: I am not worthy of attraction or any kind of meaningful relationship. I'm not worthy to be loved or wanted. I wouldn't even be able to deal with the thought of that ever happening for me. I don't know how I'll ever trust another person again. 




I know he's sick. Pathological liar: It's just another facet to his mental illness. I can't really fault him, can I? But at the same time, I do fault him, because he's an intelligent person who was aware of what he was doing all along. Is it rational to mourn the loss of a person who never even really existed? He wasn't real. Why should I be so heartbroken? 




I'll never find a person like him again, because people like him don't exist. He'd always tell me ""I know I seem too good to be true, but I'm the real deal."" But of course, he was too good to be true.




I've been sitting in my car chainsmoking for three days. My throat hurts. My eyes hurt. I haven't eaten or slept much. I can't bring myself to go to the bathroom because that's one of the places where we bonded. Anywhere I could drive around here is somewhere we've been together. To say it hurts would be the understatement of a lifetime. 




God, I miss him. I miss his face. I miss the way he looked at me. I miss kissing him. I miss holding his dick. I miss touching his hair. I miss his smell. I miss him. 




Where am I to go from here? I have no clue.  I'm a lost puppie.

It’s almost 10pm and i’m sitting alone at my office. Still at work. By choice. Because I don’t want to go home. Because…what’s waiting for me there? I’m not even really doing any work or doing anything even remotely productive. Just mindlessly scrolling through the internet. 

Autopilot. 

That’s the word. 

A state of mind that’s become second nature to me at this point. What a way to live, right? How do I change modes? 

I spend so much time preoccupied with being lonely that I have no time left to…not be. I’m a mystery to myself. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so sad lmao 

Going through my list of contacts and with each passing name/number realizing that none of these people are people I can call for a casual chat about what I ate (or didn’t eat) for dinner or what random thing pissed me off today or how I was at the store minding my own business as per usual when I ran into Timothee Chalamet and he immediately asked for my number at first sight of me (spoiler: nothing of the sort happened).

4745,Wine49,1636174118,1,"Yep, that’s me. Probably wondering what I’m posting here on Friday night while many others are in parties or that stuff where humans can have socializa. Well, it’s simple

Every friday night I’m waiting to looking forward to play a game with my best friend, but as always he canceled me and when we play he can’t stay for long time though I understand his situation. I posted on subs to play with people but the people who text me just we don’t match. Just I can remember my ex while I’m drinking a soda in the dark, plus listening to ambient music and just thinking on fake scenarios.

Sometimes I’m done with life, I can’t hold a straight relationship and friendship, I have my girlfriend but I don’t know how to hold the conversations and she’s so cute with me and I don’t want to loose another person who really care about me and i appreciate that. Just I wanted to play with someone, my whole week I was doing homework and I got mad when bc I think I’m loosing my time there. I loose the passion in many stuff like drawing and make stories, just I have that feeling of freedom when you are in a dream. 

I have many struggles with myself and sometimes the therapist doesn’t work, I wanted to heal my scars but it’s hard to do it. Is it too much to request to be free? To have someone who care about you and close to you? To play games on Steam with someone? Is it worth to stay alive ?

I’m just a loser who is an stranger and just my scape from the reality is venting here bc at least I someone will read it. Just I’m waiting to feel secure with someone and have peace of mind.

4749,aok_rivv,1636172633,1,"I guess I've always known it, but I've never accepted it. 

Once I took my SA as a loss against life I just stopped trying. Every potential friendship, I turned down by pushing myself into a corner to allow others in, in place of myself. I just couldn't hold a candle to what others have been able to give in terms of interest and excitement in a relationship.

I mean, my lack of communication skills has cost me. Every time I become interested in a person I can't even strike up conversation, much less smile or give a kind gesture. Even when that rare moment comes, I can hardly keep the other person interested in what I have to say because I truly don't know what to say. Even if I have hundreds of thoughts I wanna get out, I just don't know how to form sentences in a way that properly expresses what I really want to say. I'm always tripping over words, being repetitive, staying quiet \*because\* I can't figure out how to add personality to myself instead of acting like a robot. 

Really, how do so many people have such wonderful and expressive personalities while people like me can't even respond while being addressed? It's so draining to live everyday to the bare minimum. 

In every supposed ""friendship"" I've had, I look back now and realize I only ever recognized those people as acquaintances. Even in the friendship I thought was most close-knit, I think back on it and...we just weren't close. She was close to me, she trusted me, she even romantically liked me at a point (whether those feeling were brought about by confusion in herself or not, I'm unsure). I found myself uncomfortable when she told me she loved me. It was only habit for her to let her friends know she cared by saying ""I love you."" But I was uncomfortable each and every time I forced myself to say it back..because, why wouldn't I? Why would I ignore it? Why should I be the one to make her uncomfortable with the words she used to express her fondness? 

And I say we weren't close because \*I\* wasn't close to her. I took in her daily issues and gave advice when needed. I shared my feelings only a handful of times and was barely given a response, at least not in a way I took in as supportive. So I gave up on trying to form a real bond and distanced myself from her when she became friends with someone who was what I'd like to call an ""upgrade"" of me. I know that is in no way true now that I think back on it, but I was desperate at the time, wanting to find a reason for why we grew distant (though it was due to me).. So I pinned the blame on the new friend while pulling back and confiding in a different girl...who I later learned was all kinds of messed up and liked me romantically as well. 

When I say ""messed up,"" I mean she was a mental handful. Another person to take on as a patient in my own personal therapy. Her home life sounded to be utter shit and she had issues involving self harm and a few other things. I supported her just as I did my previous friend, until eventually, school was moved online. We spoke over text for a couple months but I soon quit answering. That was the end of that. And I did like her and enjoy her company...It's my fault we don't speak anymore. 

Since the beginning of middle school I've convinced myself I have no need for friends, that I'm better off without having to deal with people. Because you never truly know a person; they lie, hurt you, stab you in the back even if you've known them for years. It's just not worth the risk. And I know this thought process is a portion of why my past attempts at friendships have failed so hard. 

My teen years started with me taking bits of what my mom and step-father have said and embedding them into my mind. ""You can't trust anyone."" That's the one saying I've taken to heart. Why? Because it feeds into my idea that I'm incapable of forming real bonds. Why form relationships if I can't trust a single soul? If I can't trust anyone, then why should I keep ripping my mind to shreds just to hold a conversation that won't lead to a friendship? 

Now, I'm () enrolled in an online academy after about two months of physically starting my freshman year of high school. Talking didn't come naturally, even with the reassurance from teachers and family that I would make friends. Even if I didn't seek them out. 

I started going to trauma therapy (though it's inconsistent due to money) because I was apparently abused both physically and (possibly) sexually by my aunt after being in a car accident with my father, my parents went through a divorce while battling custody of me, I went a year without seeing my mother, I didn't see my father at all from the age of 3-5 until I was 8 and found out he died (keep in mind I hardly realized I had a real father because it just wasn't on my mind), and other things I can't recall at the moment. All of which I have not a single memory of. 

And I won't even lie, I think my mom was in the wrong for not letting me see my dad when I was younger. Maybe if he was involved in my life he wouldn't have died from what I think was an overdose. Hell, I'm not even clear on the way my own father passed. 

I feel like I grew up without a dad because my step-father and I interacted as strangers until I was about thirteen or so. We hardly spoke. I don't have memories or stories I can share about any father figure because I really didn't have one. 

Crying as I finish writing this isn't something I'd like to be doing, but I don't have anyone to share my feelings with other than myself and reddit.

4754,InnominatamNomad,1636170826,1,"So! I posted on here once before about missing having friends. I have since... learned somethings. And I just need to air out my mind because of it. So I write this to no one in particular...

So my fiancée and I had plans this weekend. We made them last week and sure they were stupid plans but I've been looking forward to her actually being home and awake on one of her days off with me. Well I found out today that she made other plans to hang out with her friends. She apparently forgot we had made any. And we talked. We did.

And I have since learned that the person that I fell in love with six years ago when we hung out and did things together... isn't who she is. I don't drink alcohol or partake of any substances. And she only drank occasionally. And for years we just did stuff together - watched shows, played games, took walks and things like that. Well it turns out that her preference - the things she actually wants to do - is go out to bars, drink and get high with her friends. I DON'T have a problem with that.

What gets me... what hurts like a fist in my gut is that all the time we spent together wasn't because it was her first choice. Hanging out with me was her only choice at the time. See she moved here from out of state, and now that she's made new friends... well we don't do things together anymore. If I ask, even to watch a show she likes she tells me no. We watched one episode of a show we started a couple months ago last week (we have watched four episodes in like two/three months) and the only reason she did is because her mother told her she needed to actually spend time with me.

We watched one episode and then she left to go hang out with her friends. And its the same thing every weekend. She leaves the house around 7/8PM and comes home anywhere between 2AM and 4AM. But she can't even spare one day... or even just an hour... for me. Not without someone nudging her into it. 

I'll be alright in the end. Just... feeling lost at the moment. Like I don't belong anywhere. I have a house, but I can't say its home...",lonely,In a dark place and just need to decompress my thoughts.,2021-11-06 14:53:46

I am in college and work with many organizations/ and try to meet people but I still don't have many friends to message or meet up with. It's just the hardest at night when i sleep by myself wanting to have someone to be with, and or to just say goodnight to someone I love.

I just can’t stand being around her anymore. I don’t want to sound ungrateful to those who don’t have their mother/father with them today (my condolences) but I can’t pretend I don’t feel the way I do. My mother likes to talk and is really old-school. Sometimes I’ll see her making efforts for conversation but I’m just not wanting to speak to her anymore/at times. I have nothing to say. Everyday just repeats itself for me. My mother does more than me as she sure likes to tell me how I should be doing more. My mother likes to talk - is real affectionate and understanding a real ‘old school’ type of mum but something in me just can’t bare it anymore. She’s incredibly lonely too and sometimes I feel immense guilt if I don’t speak to her or spend time with her. I’m just not in the right mental space for that - it’s sometimes draining for me to even just keep up with simple conversation. I can’t tell her I’m not okay cause then she’ll try to talk to me about it. She always reminding me about - what we ‘used to do’ and how ‘we used to talk’. Even on the days I do have a longer than usual conversation with her - she’ll say ‘that was a nice talk, thank you’ or bring it up the following day, week after as if it’s so rare - the way she praises these feeble conversations makes me wonder if I’m just a terrible son - when I’m watching shows with her or have any sort of engagement with her - she’ll mention how when I was younger how often we would do stuff ‘like this’ or how ‘energetic’ or ‘bubbly’ I was - as if all those features have been sucked away from me. I live in an apartment so I can’t exactly avoid her - she’s often in the living/sitting room (which is before the kitchen) sometimes I’d avoid going to the kitchen for hours or until she sleeps (which is near impossible as she sleeps around 2-3am EVERYDAY) if I need water or food I would literally starve until I’ve heard her go into her room to sleep or leave briefly - it’s getting to the point I would skip breakfast in the mornings as I just want to skip the ‘good mornings’.  I know how wrong I sound. People have had horrible parents. Abusive parents etc and would deem someone like me ungrateful. I know if she suddenly passed I would wish I never felt this way but don’t want that to happen - just for me to realise that. Everyday I wake up and say ‘how am I going to act normal for mum’. I don’t want to wake up feeling guilty - that I’m not doing enough as a son. I don’t want to have to be there every-time i feel she’s alone just because I’m there - it’s a terrible feeling. I can’t have a day in without her thinking it’s a mental health issue and whether I want to ‘talk’ about it. Majority of my family are females I love them all but my mother is extremely emotional, sensitive - it’s starting to rub off on me. if she robbed a pen from a store she would come home telling me about it like it’s a heist. Don’t ask about my father. Sadly all the boys in my family are on his side and I have no connections to him and I haven’t seen that side of the family in so long it’s awkward.

Anyway, I joined the army, don't really know why it was just an option, anyway, I made some friends in basic but either I got annoyed with them as I got to know them or they just drifted *fast* and now I talk to people but there's only so many and they drift too.

Part of me is trying to embrace it, who needs them right? I can max test scores on my own, right? Another part of me is just endlessly, inexplicably craving some kind of connection, fratenizing is a serious offense here so these girls I knew and talked to the most I just let go bc I'm not risking my job.

I wish the numb could last, I hate feeling like that but when I'm numb I feel like I can focus on my strength and skills and get somewhere I can be proud of but it only lasts minutes before something triggers that longing.

4810,CDLPT,1636153884,1,"TL:Dr Don't have anyone to talk about how I still feel about my ex because she is hated by my close friends and they would just find it stupid that I miss her.

Basically, I had a girlfriend, started to fall for her around this time last year, started talking to her and two weeks later we had our first kiss. Throughout our relationship the red flags from her were countless and I, against my friends' opinions, decided to ignore them, countless days of crying and not a single effort from her side to be with me but still, I loved her like I had never loved anyone before.

Fast forward to the end(middle of this year), I finally saw what a terrible person she was and all her flaws that ranged from not much to downright heartbreaking. We haven't spoken since, and am sure we left it in a very toxic place.

From there me and my best friend, started getting the habit of talking bad about her (not the nicest thing I know and I've been trying to change that for a while now), my best friend would talk about her body, as flat as it gets tbh, and I would just agree but deep down I loved it, even though I was hurt like I had never been before and most likely hated her, I still loved every single inch of her imperfect body. There were also things that we talked about her that were completely true and I agreed, like the being a terrible person and we were not the only ones that thought that.

But even though I said these things about her, I still missed her and what we had, and it hurt, even more because we were in the same class in school, which means I see her everyday.


And now the thing that made me write this in the first place. 


Even though it's been 5 months, I think, from when we broke up, i still think about her everyday and it just seems to have got worse these past few weeks and now that we are in November, the month we got together, the memories are all coming back and it's hurting a lot, and the worse is that I can't tell this to anyone because they see her as trash, and would just tell me it doesn't make any sense that I miss what we had.

Deep down I just want to talk to her, I don't have a clue about what, and I would not want to get back together but this doesn't leave my mind.

The only person I have to talk about this is my best friend and I'm sure she would tell me it's just stupid.

I changed so much because of this, now I can't show affection for other people and I am scared that it'll be hard to find someone that I love as much as I loved her and if I do find that right person I'm afraid I might not be able to display my affection like I once did.

I wish I could just forget about her, just like she most certainly forgot about me.


Thanks for reading this and sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I just needed to vent, I know I'm not a good person for what I've done either and I'm trying to live with myself despite that and am trying to change.

Not a peep, not even on my birthday today. No texts, calls, or posts saying happy birthday.

Used the timer on my phone to see how long it took for someone to ask me “how are you?”. Made it to around 3 1/2 hours before I packed up and went home from my friend group’s hang out.

Am I just over-sensitive or too needy?

Having/making friends was always difficult growing up so I don’t want to lose the small amount that I do have, but I just don’t want to keep feeling like this anymore.

I feel like a whiny kid saying all this and it just makes everything seem heavier.",lonely,What about me?,2021-11-06 08:45:36

so last year, my cousin passed away very unexpectedly on Nov. 4th. a few years before that, my dad was hospitalized and then passed away after basically being comatose for 2 weeks on the 23rd. about five days before my dad passed, my great-aunt passed away as well. so this month isn’t really great for my family.

my birthday is today, and it kind of feels like it’s been overshadowed by everyone in my family saying this is a ‘cursed’ month. I called my mom yesterday to see how she was doing and she immediately responded with “I fucking hate this month, nothing good has happened in it.”

I know she’s just upset and that it’s hard, but it still really sucked hearing that. all I got from my sisters were some birthday texts and an Instagram thing, and I haven’t heard anything from any of my cousins. but yesterday, everyone posted big things about my cousin.

I think I had a thing with meeting up with strange men, it didn't scare me. I literally wanted to be raped and tortured at 13 but the sickos didn't even want me. After my terrible 3 year relationship since sophomore year I was committed to actually learning how to love myself and I wanted to be me because I couldn't for that 3 years. The first thing I do is go find a sugar daddy like wtf I met up with 3 strange men. 1 was hot, 1 was rich and 1 was fat and old. I sucked them all even if I can 100% leave. I allow myself traumatize myself, idk dude. In 2020 I realized I had social anxiety when I tried making friends that's ok I never had a friend anyway.
 I been wanting to KMS since 12, I have over 50 scars on my body, I punch myself so my husband doesn't see cuts, I tell myself that I hate myself that I wanna die like every minute, my grandfathers house is trashed and has cat shit everywhere (me and my husband lives with him, mom and lil sis), I completely stopped talking to my older sis and her 3 kids, I also stopped hanging out with grandma, I don't cook anymore, I don't shower, I can't even save the money I worked so hard for. I just buy weed cigarettes and fast food. I let my husband f*ck me whenever he wants even if it hurts like hell totally on me for consent. I don't know myself, I don't listen to music because I don't enjoy it anymore, I don't express myself at all I keep everything inside and when I do try to express it to my husband we start fighting and I walk out for 3-5 hours torturing myself until I calm down and realize it was my fault for getting defensive. Orr I completely forget everything that's wrong with me and I'm ""fine' now. My best talent is daydreaming and  dissociation. The only reason why I'm alive is because I can't let my family go through two suicides, my older brother who wasn't in my life anyway. Oh yeah I also have deep hatred for myself about wanting my family to die. I just think if they weren't there I can finally just die in peace without a funeral. 

The problem is that I have no time for myself I'm with my husband 24/7. I think that's it but how can I say that when our manager gives me a night off without him, that was the solution but it ain't working or i just can't get my life together.  My dream was to afford therapy because I've had a imaginary therapist for years but how can someone do that that's so expensive. Nobody sees through my mask not even my husband.

I've never really had friends. Or, I've had them, but always lost them in the end. Some people have told me I might have autism and that's the reason. But there's so much more to it. My mom keeps hanging out with my aunt instead of me, always leaving me withe mpty promises. My dad isn't much of a talker, at least not to me. I either end up with fake friends, or no friends at all. I feel the world is slowly crumbling around me as I write this. I have dreams and hopes and a bunch of nice things. I wanna travel the world, become a writer and adopt a bunch of cute cats to take care of. But most of all, I want someone. Not just a friend who you can small talk with, I've had those. They're nice while they last, but they never last for long. I want something deep. I want to find someone who will make me promises and who will understand me. Sometimes I feel like there is no such person. And if there is, they'll leave to. All I want is to have the guarantee that I'll always have someone. I'm so tired of being left out, abandoned, alone and absolutely terrified of going through everything on my own. I'm 17. I don't wanna die, but... I don't really wanna live either. ""But think of your hopes and dreams!"" I do, but they're so far away. ""There is someone out there for you!"" How many times haven't I heard that before?

4903,ChillHouseArktek,1636102053,1," Hey guys. I'm sorry but I really need to get this off my chest. I don't really care if you read this, But I just need to get it out somehow.

A little backstory:

Me and all of my friends have been friends since middle school. (Now all of us in college ≈ 18). We've always been super close with each other. ""Bros before ----"" that type of thing. They had all actually started dating and getting pretty serious with girls. So per usual, One of my friends gets into a relationship, then the next, and so forth. Here's where the story starts. 

As you can guess. Do you know who didn't start dating? You guessed it. Me.

You see, I wasn't really into relationships at the time. 100% of my time was dedicated to learning how to market and code to put extra money in my pockets and just work that kept me busy, so I wouldn't be able to keep up with a relationship. 

One night, While I was doing some work alone. I thought: ""This is kind of sad. It's a Friday night, everybody is out partying or hanging out, And I'm in my room listening to jazz, working"" I shrugged it off with a laugh but it bugged me. Regardless I went to bed as this thought just kept pestering me, Not allowing myself to work.

For the record, I'm not introverted. I do go to parties, I do drink with friends, And I do speak to some females on occasion and I really like making friends.

Anyways though, Come Sunday morning. And I get a DM, From my best friend saying ""we're all going to go get dinner at ------ you down?"". I had nothing planned so I agreed.

The thought of having a girlfriend has been on my mind the whole day prior. I realized that when I went to bed on that Friday, I just wanted somebody to speak to. All and I mean ALL of my friends stay all day texting someone, Their partners texting them if they're okay, them responding with *""I love you""* or when we would get hammered the night before and crash at a friend's house. Them waking up to ""*good morning!*"" And when I would check my phone, My notifications would be blank. 0 texts from anybody.

At this point, It's getting to me. It's not frustration anymore, It just made me sad. Something which I hadn't felt in a while. It felt like being in a hole. The more I thought about it, the deeper I dag myself in said hole. But I couldn't get it off my mind if I tried. But oh boy did I have it coming.  


Come Sunday evening, and I'm just not feeling anything. I don't want to do any work, I don't want to do anything. I just want to lay in bed and just think to myself how much better my life would be with somebody there. But I manage to get ready, and head over to dinner. Because surely my friends would take my mind off things. Right? No. When I show up, I see all of my friends sitting there. there are a total of 6 of my friends. I should've known something was off the way they kept looking at their phones excitedly. When I get there, My best friend asks for a table. To my surprise, he doesn't say ""Can we get a table for *6*?"". Instead, he says ""Can we get a table for **13**."" It all clicked.  


The waitress takes around 5 minutes but gets our table ready. And when our table is ready, all of my friend's girlfriends show up. I'm friends with all of them and they treat me very nicely and respectfully.  
(This is important) My friends are jokesters but nothing harmful ever.  


So we all sit down, and they start talking, each of them sat next to their partner. I guess the waitress thought it was awkward to have 13 chairs, so there were 14 chairs, I was at the head of the table. They're all speaking to each other in private, giggling and playfully laughing with each other, and I'm there just thinking to myself looking at my phone to not seem like a buzzkill or pass off as awkward. My heart is literally in pieces as I have no one to talk to. Just me, and the empty seat next to me, surrounded by couples. I just want to go home. But that's not the worst part of this story.  


The waitress comes over to take our drinks. I didn't think much of it. They say they'll get the checks separately, but the waitress was very nice and although it was a lot of work to handle 7 checks., was an extremely nice lady. She takes everyone's orders, and it's time to get mine. I ask for water. And what she says next absolutely breaks me. I was already lonely and honestly, just plain sad. She looks at the chair next to me, the empty seat, and says ""Oh! I'm sorry are we still waiting for one more?"" with a smile on her face. My friends start laughing. the girls start giggling, which is something they don't do to me, specifically when it comes to this topic. But everyone's laughing at me. One of them yells ""He doesn't have one!"".  


I'm... well absolutely shattered. I give her the saddest glance ever. Puppy eyes almost, and just break down. I never cry, ever. It's the one thing I'm known for, I'm known as the one person who never is upset at anything. But this. This hurt. I look at the waiter. And look down.  I feel the tears well up in my eyes, but I won't ruin my friend's night. I simply excuse myself, leave a 10$ tip, and walk out of the restaurant. I heard one of my friends tell me to come back, but I can't. I just go to my car and drive home.  


It hurt. Being laughed at, for not having anybody by my side.",lonely,A long story.,2021-11-05 19:47:33

Im not meant to be loved because my mother didnt love me. The only reason she didnt get an abortion was because she couldnt afford it until she was too far along so then once she had me she spent 16 years abusing me until i ran away. A few other family members knew but did nothing. My brother ran away and left me, a few years later when i tried reconnecting with him he just said that "" i dont need to talk to you to know that you're alive"" basically as long as im not dead he doesnt care about me. 

When i was 12 my mom finally told me who my dad was. I had asked him if i could live with him because of the abuse and he said yes but soon as the phone call ended he blocked my number and i didnt hear from him again until i was 16 but at that point i didnt need him. 

In school i thought i had friends but it wasnt until the last year that i realized that none of them were friends. Everyone knew about how mean my mom was but i didn't tell everyone how bad things were. But that didnt matter anyway because only 2 people interfered, my ""best friend"" and the boy who tried assaulting me. Everyone else ignored it.  At the beginning of this year i stopped talking to all my ""friends"" except 2 people who i tried to keep a relationship with. I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt and they weren't concerned in the slightest. So thats when i officially had 0 friends. 

During the whole abuse court trial no one even believed me. No social workers, police, staff at school. Literally no one.

I've recently resumed talking to my ex who I first met online nine years ago, and our romantic relationship was on/off for the following three years. She's 23 and lives on the west coast of Canada, and I'm 25 and live in the upper midwest here in the US. You might be wondering if we've ever met in person, and the answer is no. Most things are cool right now, however, she does have a live-in boyfriend, and we have radically different political views. I really enjoy talking with her, even as a friend, as we've known each other so long that we really click quite well. Unfortunately I'm a very lonely guy. I've been celibate for over two years, and the last sorta meaningful relationship I had was five years ago. I'm worried that things will just blow up again as a result of our mutual struggles with depression, our differing political views, and my own curse of being lonely and somewhat desperate while also being rather bitter towards relationships.

I was in the darkest of times. With the help of my friends, I started a new job, paid off my debts, and gradually built up my money. I made it all the way to where I am now.

But lately I've been doing very poorly. I spend my days in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness. It's been more than five years since my marriage ended. My failed marriage is a short story, but it has caused me great pain and unimaginable processes

Pandemics make life difficult for everyone. It was hard to meet the right person in life, but the good news was that I was still hoping to meet some mature and stable men, preferably from Canada and the United States. When the pandemic is healed, plan to do something meaningful together! Hiking together, camping together, grilling and fishing together, snuggling on the couch together, none of this will be a fantasy\~!

America is a very beautiful country with many beautiful buildings and landscapes. It is charmingly free, beautiful, romantic, open and respectful. I like it very much.

As time goes on, we make new friends, but I believe few people are lucky enough to meet some kind, positive and sincere people. So I will take the time to seek them out. Maybe not just as friends, but we all need to wait and see.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling extremely lonely for a long time now, especially when it comes to deeper relationships. It's a funny thing. I get along with people casually, you know? During college I would go out with my classmates to a cafe, during the internship we would go to a bar after work and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that when the daily physical contact ends, people completely forget about me. During summer break when we're not seeing each other on a daily basis none of my friends invite me to do anything, no one sends me a message asking how I'm doing. I have to catch up with them, but it's always one sided and it's always made me feel like I'm bothering them. I finished my internship in 07/2020 on great terms with all my coworkers, but since then none of them have ever texted me to chat, or do something together like we used to do during the time I was there.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend for the last 5 years moved city and state this year, told me about that two days before he moved and since then (about 4 months) he has never messaged me to tell me things are there, ask how things are on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Even my siblings do that. They almost always accept when I call them to do something, but the initiative never comes from them.

I used to have tons of friends, an i had alot going for me but people only like you when you're doing something. Is what i always say. No one cares when you're sad or struggling an people dont care of notice the loneliness, depression an anxiety growing inside you as you drown inside it. 

As the years passed, ive lost friends, loved ones, an my ex of 9yrs broke up with me as my grandma had just passed away. She was heartless about it when i really needed someone. Friends didn't care either. It dawned on me that these people who i did so much for and gave my best friendships an love too didn't care about me at all. They where like some paid performers to suck me dry slowly like leeches infesting me an waiting until i was weak to deliver the final back stab. 

No one cared. Ive been a lonely recuse for 2 years now. Those people broke me. They took a beautiful soul and ripped off what wings i had. So i couldn't fly again. I seriously was a good friend and a good boyfriend. I was their for my ex when her baby sister died. Lived with her for 2yrs out in a place i was miserable an put my life an education on hold. 
I cared deeply for all my friends. Remembered birthdays an holidays with them always on my gift lists an would help them out all the time. 

When i needed something back. They hurt me. Abandoned me. Avoided me. An even back stabbed me. 
Was it all a sick game? Who knows. I stoped asking why a long time ago. 

I don't know how to talk to people anymore. I get anxiety they will also betray me or change on me at some point so i don't even want to try anymore. I know that they are different people an not everyone is Horrible, but i am barely holding on an i cant afford another let down. 

I wish i had genuine good people in my life. Ones who care an do as much for me as i do for others. But humanity isn't like that. People Change an people most often times dont care for others especially if it doesn't benefit them. 

I haven't even worked a job in like 2years due to physical illness an living on my savings. I know i cant continue. Im scared to be around people now. 

Honestly im lonely. Im scared and i know i probably seem stupid for all of this. But when you where delt a bad hand in life but kept trying anyway it just doesn't get any better. 

My mother abandoned me when i was a kid. My grandma raised me until she passed a few years ago. An it just broke me to lose her. 
Its hard i grew up watching others with a mom an i always felt sad because i didn't have one who wanted me. Its hard feeling that for a child. You wonder what did i do wrong? Whats wrong with me? Why am i not enough to be loved? You know its not your fault as you get older, but i feel i was missing a big part of me growing up. I wished when i feel in love it would heal an id finally have someone who would love me, but that didn't happen. 

Instead all i got was hurt repeatedly an abandoned just like when my mom left me. An honestly i know ots not my grandmas fault she passed she did all she could. She knew i was sad about my mom an tried so hard to love me an fill that empty feeling inside with her love. I was Greatful to have her, but when she died i could not help but feel left behind again. 

Its been a few years of crying over that an i feel bad i cant cry anymore for her. I feel the same choking inside tho, an the depression an anxiety. Yet here i am i wake up everyday an try, but still feel sad. Someday's are ok, but alot i feel alone. 

Ive hurd that life gets better, but somehow I don't think it does. How can it without the people you once loved gone an you being alone an left behind. An then the people you trusted just ditch you an hurt you to deliver the final kill to your soul.

This year we moved into a new place (not so new as my parents stay in the same area/ apartment complex) and while I may not have been the closest neighbour but I believe I’m friendly, visited their homes once before, always wish them. Sure I’m not sitting and gossiping with them because I’m swamped with my own job which takes up a ton of time. Anyway I wanted to wrap and gift some sweets this time as it was my first Diwali here so I did. And funny thing is I didn’t expect anyone to come over when I did this. However none of them visited back, for those aren’t aware we visit neighbouring houses of those we know and present one another gifts that can be sweets or anything tbh.
Anyway, this just kind of shattered me because my self esteem is already frail and I’m doing my best fighting the people pleasing self of mine at the same time trying my best to connect with people (yea it’s a bit complicated how I got in this situation)
But you see what I’m trying to say is that I spend the whole night convincing myself I’m not a horrible person or not evil (I don’t think I didn’t anything evil to upset them considering I don’t have time in the first place).
But I feel hurt and devastated 

And I feel me being socially incompetent is really messing up my life.
I like being around people and celebrating… or just having fun.
I find it really hard to make friends too.

Now I don’t have any of that and I get really sad and I normally just cry myself till exhaustion then I pass out. 

I haven’t been sleeping well as a result obviously when I do sleep it’s in small increments cuz I dream about her nightly some good some bad and I wake up either really depressed cuz I woke up from a good dream to realize it was just a dream or I wake up just as sad as I went to bed. Sometimes I don’t sleep I just lay there all night thinking about her and I get sad.

I write, he writes back, I write a response, and then he disappears. Occasionally, he'll blast me with three messages in a row and again not respond to any messages I send in response. 

So yesterday, rather than texting a silly shallow good to hear from you kind of message, I wrote back how I was actually feeling. I wrote that I was having a hard day and I felt lonely and lost and that I wanted to wake up in a different life in which someone was hugging me and telling me everything was going to be alright.

No surprise -- he didn't write back. 

I worry that he will never write to me again after hearing me say ""I feel lonely."" 

I have a hard time telling people I'm lonely, in case they think of me as a pariah.  But I am lonely. And it isn't something that is remedied by anyone. I interact with people all the time. This is a loneliness in my soul, the loneliness for not having a partner or a life purpose.

Don't really have many friends or family left either. I went to college, but at that time I wasn't really interested in dating (my only regret) and chiefly focused on grades. Well.....all I did was worry about grades throughout college and now that I've been out of it for about 4 years, I've come to realize it is absolutely impossible to meet new people. Not a fucking chance. I've tried dating apps for years - no luck. Tried meetups - no luck (all older couples and older people in general), feels like I've tried everything. And this whole mantra of ""Work on yourself and love will find you"", your typical horseshit, has gotten me nowhere. I have been trying to look for a better paying job now for months and I can't find fucking shit. I've also been trying to relocate myself for better job opportunity, but every fucking employer prefers local candidates so I've had absolutely no luck in that regard. 

All of my friends (the ones I have left) have found someone and are rapidly settling down. Just feels like for most people relationships come naturally, or so it seems. Growing up I was quite sheltered, my parents divorced when I was 4 and because I had no siblings I pretty much had to do my own thing. 

But then again, my standards are probably high, I would want something really casual, don't want marriage, don't want kids - so I'm assuming that narrows the dating pool quite heavily. I know that most people my age now are looking to settle down and start a family, but I don't want that. I just want attention, intimacy, affection.

We're all suffering from some kind of loneliness and from what I've been seeing it seems a lot of people here are suffering from suicidal thoughts too. 
With that in mind, maybe it's just me but, I've always wondered how nice it would be to just have someone there at the end. Holding my hand or just sitting there with a smile, helping me to move on to yhe next life. Not having to be lonely yet again at the very end. To have the final moments be calming and supportive even if you never had that in life. To pass on eith some sort of peace in your heart, similar to what u see on movies whrn someone dies and they heartwarmingly make up for a betrayel or past mistake? It would be Someone who would not judge. Would not try to stop you and would do everything they could to make you feel comfortable and happy before you passed on.

This is just to let all of this out and also for some who might feel the same way as me…

I debated telling my whole life story, but that would just be exhausting to write all of that out, so I’ll just summarize my experiences. I’ve been lonely with undiagnosed depression and anxiety since 12 years of age. My family doesn’t know how to deal with mental health very well, so I’ve just been toughing it out up until now. This is the first time I’ve decided to at least talk to someone (or someones) about it. I also come from a family with a very weak familial bond with zero love, affection or care shown to anyone of us. My mother was going through a drug addiction problem since I was 5 and my dad was emotionally and mentally not present. He was a good provider being a doctor and all, but he wasn’t a father. My sisters all left around the ages of 16-18 to escape our hellhole of a family which in turn caused me to be left all alone due to not having a means of escape of my own. I had to deal with all the shit they were able to leave behind. As you can tell that is most likely what attributed to my now terrible mental state. It’s also been hard for me to make relationships with people growing up due to my severe social anxiety I had. I just didn’t know how to even though I really wanted companionship. I felt myself shrinking more and more as the years go by. Now I don’t even know who I am and my outlook on life, love, and relationships has completely changed from what I used to believe. In my childhood up until I was 20 years old, i strongly believed in love and just knew there would be someone out there for me. To love me like I’ve never been loved before. I just expected that because I felt like I deserved and was owed that. I’ve come into a huge and sudden realization that no one is going to do that for you and you’re not owed anything. It’s up to you to take care of and love yourself because you can’t expect anyone to do that for you nor feel like it’s supposed to be given to you. I don’t believe in love anymore, so I’ve accepted the fact that I’ll spend this lifetime alone. I’m not upset about that anymore, but this realization has caused a lot of mental and emotional turmoil for me. My father once told me that I looked at the world with rose colored glasses on. Now is the first time I’ve taken them off and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same again. I’m numb, but I like it this way.",lonely,Hope you guys don’t mind me treating you like a therapist because I can’t afford one,2021-11-05 07:47:35

I never really received any romantic interest in my life. Or, if I did, it was from people being subtle and I was just too oblivious to notice it.

Since I’ve never really had any success with dating when most people were at least somewhat regularly dating throughout high school and college has really kind of messed me up, for a lack of better words.

5052,sofssss,1636043338,1,"This will be quite a long story, and I also apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, I’m Brazilian and English is not my first language.

In 2017 (I was 18) I met an American through an app called Yellow (it doesn’t exist anymore). He was 20. We talked for over two years before we got to meet in person. Our love grew and even though we didn’t consider ourselves a couple (because it would be crazy to start a relationship with someone that lives almost 10 thousand kilometers from you that you’ve never even met in person), we didn’t have anything with anyone else in the meantime. To be honest though, he wanted us to assume ourselves as a couple back then, but I refused. We were always messaging, video calling and sending each other cards for special dates, so we could have something palpable. 

In 2019 I got my very first job (was an internship actually), I didn’t make much, but I saved all the money to buy a plane ticket to go there and see him. Important to mention that his parents didn’t trust me enough to let him come here first, because there’s this stereotype of people from “third world countries” wanting to marry people from rich countries just to get citizenship, so in order to prove I wasn’t that type of person I had to go there first. I spent a long time trying to convince my parents to do so and also raising money for the ticket. Our mothers actually started messaging each other throughout the process, and that helped build some trust. Finally the day came, I got enough money for the ticket and bought it. That was one of the happiest days of my life. That was June 2019. We met on January 2020. The rest of 2019 I was just dreaming about the special day and I was so motivated I got the best grades ever at university. My life was perfect, I had nothing to complain about. 

So the day came. After almost 24 hours of flying and airport layovers, I was there. It was a feeling I’ll never forget: a mix of the good type of anxiety and victory for finally being able to meet the guy I loved. I stayed there with him from January to March 2020. He was extremely nice and romantic, I never felt so happy, he really was my soulmate. He was also a very emotional guy, wasn’t ashamed of crying and showing his emotions towards me. He asked me to be his girlfriend the day after I got there and he cried when I said yes. I never expected what I’ll tell next to happen though. On my last day there, his parents drove with us to drop me off at the airport, and he cried the whole way there. We spent some time by ourselves at the airport, and when the time came for me to go through security to go to the gates, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I never expected that and I was just filled with happiness. Then I said yes but had to walk away, so yeah, even though it was a beautiful moment it was also very sad. 

I came back to Brazil and we just went back to our online relationship. He eventually came here on December 2020 and stayed until February 2021. We had an awesome time here, I took him to the beach, it was his first time seeing the ocean. I’ll never forget his smile when we went in the water. So towards the end of his stay we sat down with my family and told them our plans. His parents would give us, as their wedding gift, one of the best immigration lawyers in the United States, so I could get a K1 Visa and get married there. We started the process, sent them a bunch of documents and were just waiting on the government to give us a feedback. This process is a bit slow now because of the pandemic, so we spent this whole year waiting.

Now there comes the bad part of the story, that I never thought would happen. October 2021, the worst month of my life.
Actually, I need to go back a little bit, to August 2021. There was this Brazilian girl that did a high school exchange at his city a few years back, 2017/2018. They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, that’s what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. They’ve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. I’ll confess that I didn’t really want to give her because I barely knew her and I don’t like giving my number to random people. But I didn’t want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her (us 3). I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept (I’m at GMT-3 and he’s at GMT-5), and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldn’t see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch (I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch). He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking.

I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. That’s the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasn’t replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. I’ve been so bad lately that I can’t remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. I’ve seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 7:30am and I slept until 8:30am.  He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, I’m stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. 

The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didn’t seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didn’t feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didn’t even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasn’t right between us. That he didn’t feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldn’t end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone. I was stabbed in the back multiple times by the person that always said that I was his soulmate and by a girl that came into my life pretending to be my friend, and I actually believed that. This same day he unblocked her in all social medias and changed his profile picture everywhere (it was a picture of us).

So yeah, my world just fell apart in a matter of days. He became what he criticized the most and I became what I feared the most. I’m already a skinny person and I lost around 4kg in a week. I never had trouble sleeping, now I simply can’t have at least a decent night of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night many  times with my heart racing, I have multiple nightmares about the situation. I even had a few panic attacks. I don’t have energy to do anything. I’m on my last semester of college and I can’t do anything. I can’t eat, I’ve thrown up multiple times and just seeing food makes me nauseous. I honestly rather be dead than have all these feelings. Less than a month ago I was the happiest person ever, I had something to look forward to, I had someone in my life that I thought that loved me. Turned out it was just a huge lie. 

No matter how much I write about this, how much detail I put into everything, I won’t be able to describe my sadness and emptiness. I would wish no one this feeling, not even them.",lonely,We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months,2021-11-05 03:28:58

5067,HairRevolutionary520,1636028389,1,"Around August/September I've started noticing that the only reason a conversation exist between my friends and I is if I reach out. I often give them funny videos that reminds me of them (individually), or I send them memes, or tell them interesting things about their hobbies. I don't have a good support system at home, my parents still believe that mental health exists because I don't pray enough. I try to compensate for a support system from my friends.

When I started realizing that I have severely overestimated my importance in other people's life, it made me severely depressed. I stopped reaching out to people and I just stayed there online, I didn't deactivate or delete my social media accounts, they can still contact me. A week passed and from the average of talking to 40 people a week, it shrunk to only 3 people. My usage of messaging apps shrunk from 25 hours a week to 7 hours. The 7 hours is usually alloted to me talking about schoolwork or just work. My birthday passed and none of the people I considered as best friends or close friends greeted me. A month passed and literally the people that talked to me didn't come close to at least 40 people, maybe 8 if I'm being generous.

I know people have their own lives, but for people to not talk to me or even see how I'm doing in 6 weeks? That fucking sucks. Like, wtf am I supposed to do now that I've realized this? None of my friendships would have existed if I wasn't giving any effort. That's a hard pill to swallow. None of the people I thought that cared about me, gave a flying fuck. And I know I'm not exaggerating, I can still see them doing calls or video calls to their other friends in their  IG stories.

I have severe trauma when it comes to friendships, back in high school a group of whom I considered my ""closest friends"" created a group called ""Anti (my name) Group"". It really pushed me to the edge of suicide and self-harm (currently still an addiction) and although 5-6 years have passed since then, I can't seem to recuperate from the issues it created. No amount of coping mechanisms or therapy can fix it. I am so scared to get hurt again, and I cannot fucking believe that it's happening again. And do you know what those people said when they created that group? I was just annoying. That's it. I didn't bully them, or like personally invade their boundaries, or even betrayed them in some way, they just hated me for existing. They would sabotage my involvement in group works that my grades actually suffered. I wasn't a freeloader either, they use my house to do our projects, they just don't let me participate.

What do I do now? Lol. All my college friend groups seem to have created friend groups of their own excluding me, which is triggering a lot of the same emotions back in high school. I want to pick up a knife and start slitting my wrists again, and I have been so good for a month. It's so unfair, I'm always the one who gives the most when it comes to friendships but I always seem to be the one who suffers and gets the short end of the stick.",lonely,I lost all my friends,2021-11-04 23:19:49

My biggest issue is (at least right now) my personality. I'm not toxic, violent, or manipulative or anything actually harmful like that. No. My sin is something that is far worse in the modern world. **I'm very, very boring.** That's why no one ever ""falls for me"", and that's why people far worse than me are still able to have much more success. I'm also very scared of people, and women in particular. These two flaws combined means that being on a date with me is like being on a date with a brick wall.

What have I tried to do to improve my situation?

* First of all, I've tried to go on dates. This summer I went out with three  different women. One ended up being very selfish and manipulative, and  didn't actually care about me. The other two got bored of me (rightfully  so) after seeing me once and realizing that I don't have a personality.  I've been trying to date people for three years in total. Guess how  many times I have succeeded in that time? ZERO. That puts me to the  bottom 1% of the unluckiest people in any particular dating app.
* I've also been to therapy for over a year, but that has had zero positive effect on me.
* Complementing the therapy, I was also taking antidepressants for a year, but those  didn't work either, and me and my doctor decided that there's no point  in continuing.
* I've of course tried to follow all the cliche's that are commonly given as advice.
   * ""Just be yourself"" = Impossible when you're too anxious and your heart is beating at 160bpm.
   * ""Just  talk to women like you would talk to other men"" = Even if I manage to  do this, it doesn't help because men are bored of me too.
   * ""Don't try so hard"" = That's exactly what I did until three years ago. ...and it got me absolutely nowhere.

So, as you might see, I've really tried my hardest, and I'm still lonely  and unlovable. I am miserable being alone, but trying (and failing) to  find a relationship is also ruining my happiness, and my confidence. I really don't see any way to improve my situation that I haven't already  tried.

I'd like to continue from here to talk about the only potential options I have going forward, but I feel like that would be better suited for [r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/) or [r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/).

 When i grew up, i started to feel sad about not having a girlfriend, i haven't even got my first kiss, i don't care about that, and about the jokes about it, what makes me sad is being alone, i miss someone to hug me and pet my head, and someone who wants this from me, so i fell extremely alone. 

Due to being lonely one of these friends told me to use tinder, and i did it until i met this girl, we went so quickly and i we started a virtual relationship, (we live in nerby towns), but we never met irl, i felt in love with her but about one month later, she broke this ""relationship"", and we became just friends. All these months until now, i made everything i could trying to be or met with her, i helped her with school, with personal problems, taught her play league of legends, brought her a skin (i hate myself for this) and paid amazon prime for her (just a bit for this).

Everytime i called her to do something (watch a movie, play, or called her out) she said yes and just dalayed it and in the end we didn't do anything, it was making me sad and we discussed about this a couple of times, nothing ever changed, she always said i was being unfair for being upset with her, and yeah i'm emotional and maybe a bit dramatic, but she... I don't know, she always said she was my friend but i felt like she don't care about me, everytime she comes up to me is asking somethingis about league of legends (this makes me very very upset), so i was a bit away from her for now (talked a little from time to time)

Yesterday i was on call with her and her new boyfriend joined the call, i didn't even know about him (yeah if i was her i would not tell me, since she know about feelings about her), and i can't stand being on call with then so i almost said nothing and quit the call after 1 league game, i hate myself, i'm the worst friend ever, i don't know if i'm dramatic but...

I did my best and in the end i'm just someone who answer your league doubts? And the pain gets bigger due to that relationship, i felt loved for the first time (loved from someone thats not my parents), tried to be with many girls without success but this time i really was deep in love.

I'm pretty outgoing when i'm with the people i know, but shy with people i don't know. Usually i'll try to fake it till i make it till I feel comfortable around new people. 

Ever since the start of covid i have been struggling to make new friends and i'm very bad at keeping old friends. I talk to 0 people from my high school days, and am close to talking to 0 people from my college days. 

I am a firm believer that you can change your life situation for the better if you want to/if you put one foot in front of the other and take things day by day. 

Building up new and old friendships is definitely an area that I have neglected since the start of the pandemic. I think I neglected this area, because most the time I don't mind the loneliness/actually enjoy the tranquility of it. I value being able to get comfortable being alone, spending time in my thoughts/thinking about how i can better myself, actively learning new material and reading 📖. I know this isn't the case for everyone, so for those who are struggling with loneliness, I just want to send support and tell you that there are better days ahead! 


My main questions are: 

In your experience,

How do you meet new people as you get older? 

How do you maintain previous relationships with people when you don't live close to one another anymore?

5116,throwaway63729199363,1635998507,1,"I [19M] have been abused by this girl [27F] since I was a toddler. The physical abuse mostly stopped because I kept calling the cops and started working out (I’m a really small dude). 

Came home from a 13 hour shift to see her screaming at my mom at the top of her lungs. I yelled “go downstairs” and she broke 2 nails in my chest. She grows them out on purpose and uses a nail file to cut them down to blades, just to hurt me. I tried getting her off of me, but she kept going. She threw me into a couch a kicked my stomach and crotch. I didn’t do anything to her except try to get her off. Eventually my dad pried her off. 

The paramedics said I need stitches but I refused since I can’t pay the ambulance or hospital bill, so I just held a towel against my chest (and ear too) for 30 min until the bleeding stopped. The cops only wanted to know if I hit her, good thing I didn’t. She even lied and said I spit on her, and they were gonna arrest me for assault for that but my mom told them it was a lie. They didn’t say a word to my sister about how she hurt me. 

For context, my sister is a pretty girl and I’m a tiny guy with a history of depression. I told them about when she was arrested for abusing me as a kid, but they believed her. Fuck those cops man.

Realistically, this is a hard age to be lonely- everyone is out meeting new people seemingly with ease, partying and enjoying life like they should, and I can’t help but witness all this and feel horrible about myself and deprived of the joy I should be experiencing- after all, these are the best years if ones life.
I get it’s probably my fault largely- I should be getting out there meeting new people and in general putting myself out there more. However, I don’t even know how to do so. And even when i try, i feel I can’t even connect with anyone. Im sure isolation doesn’t help this, as your interests develop in a different direction than people who are more “present” in the world. I have one person I regularly talk to, and even then i dont feel a true authentic connection. Things just feel flat between us, and if not flat than things are just tense between the two of us. 
I find it perplexing how people can just pick up and go out there with ease and just make new friends like it’s nothing but collecting badges. For me, i dont even know where to start or begin. The worst part is that i dont even have much social anxiety- mostly, it’s simply that I don’t know how to begin meeting new people. I used to have many friends, but things in my life went downhill over the years and now i find myself deprived and alone. I’ve always had asocial tendencies, and have dealt with pretty severe depressive episodes over the past years- and such things have caused me lots of trouble within my life (namely socially).

I have never one. Not even a female friend.  


Not only am I neither dashing nor charismatic, but also I have no idea of how a heterosexual relationship can begin.    


I am alone, but not lonely. I don't know if freedom from solitude is  better than shackles from relationship. I want to have my Mrs. right,  though the odds seem to diminish without limit as time goes by.   


I am also a research student at a highly ranked British university. Vast majority of my hall block's residents are either taught  postgraduates in arts or computer. Only a few of us are research  students. Research students in natural sciences requiring laboratory  work are the minority of the minority.   


They can stay in their rooms all day long, travel to wherever they like,  party with whoever as frequently as they like...with occasional  assignments that do not interrupt their fun. They enjoy the most out of  where I belong to. I don't know how to describe for them. Though I am  not fond of their disciplines, I envy them.   


For me? Daily laboratory work basically saps whatever I have...endless,  tasteless, restless...not even enough time to revise at all despite the  requirement to take a handful of courses per term.   


Discussion with supervisor or PhD peer mentors don't yield. The former  is kind but dismissive of request for clear “working schedule”.  The  latter are quite coercive and basically push you to make setup whenever  you are in the lab. Feeling disoriented at the research's start is not  the biggest problem, not knowing exactly how they perceive you is. I am  plagued by a layer of cloud.   


For God's sake I must be where I am, yet I start having lots of  self-doubt: Where is my life? Where is myself? Why am I selling them  free labour? How ideal I really am as a candidate?

5145,Super_Bright,1635986319,1,"Hello everyone. 

I feel like I've written a million posts like this before. I've struggled with my mental health for years now and that's lead me into situation after situation where I feel so utterly hopeless that the way out of this hole feels like it will never be within reach. 

My mental health first became an issue when I was at School. I won't go too far into details but I had anxiety. I felt like all the coursework and exams were too much and I was skipping classes to avoid it. Eventually I ended up crying in a public place about it all. People would mock me quite regularly about this, it made me develop a deep feeling of inadequacy and I've had a low self image ever since. This lead me to dropping out of that school and moving elsewhere.

Since then I've been to University and met a lot of new people, it was great and things legitimately did start improving for me, but corona hit during the last few months of my final year and I had to finish my course remotely. I got a good overall grade but being apart from my friends from uni hurt a lot. My university is quite far from my home and my relationships with my friends suffered as a result, I was no longer seeing them everyday and that made it a lot tougher, most of my friendships from home had either ended when I left school or had suffered from me being away at university. I found myself with a very small friend group. Despite graduating well I had no motivation to look for full time work however. I was and still am feeling incredibly depressed and it feels paralyzing, I think about the idea of competing for a job and it's nauseating not to mention there is no reason they'd pick me over someone else. 

I did have one really good friend though, He was one the one person from school after what had happened I truly trusted. I'd often confide in him, I told him about my mental health and he'd listen and I'd do the same for him. He knew all about my depression and anxiety and unlike anyone around me he really cared. Eventually he hit a really difficult life situation where his life changed forever and it hit him hard, his mood greatly suffered and I was really worried about him. He was working all the time, I think it kept his mind of it, and I was worried he told me he'd work 7 days weeks sometimes and would only every take at most 1 day off a week. I tried to help but he was reluctant to change and we fought. I ended up asking if we'd met now instead of at school would he have wanted to be my friend and he wouldn't answer, we argued but later agreed to cool down before talking again a few days later. The time came and he wouldn't respond to me. It's been 5 months and he still hasn't. 

with that, I became completely isolated, i have no friends where I live and only 1 or 2 at university who are too far to visit regularly. I have no full time job and I live with my parents still. I'm 23 and never had a romantic relationship. I'm asexual so I don't really care about being a virgin but I feel like I've missed out on that close romantic connection. I have no motivation to do anything and spend 100% of my free time alone. I really don't know where to go.",lonely,I feel like things have never been worse for me.

I'm currently still desperate for having better friendships and more of them. I still consider getting into a dorm when I go back to a bigger college because I know that's a really great way to make some life long friends. Although, I will be 21 or 22 at that time which might be a little weird to make friends with mostly youngsters. I just can't think of a better way to make some quality life long friends than being stuck in a dorm full of people in a similar situation.

5179,MandyZeek,1635973407,1,"Some people can be so off putting with their attitudes and demeanors

People are so quick to refer you to an institution for help, when in fact, they’re really communicating that they don’t really care. People don’t care and don’t want to be bothered with your problems unless if there’s a valuable benefit for them (like money). Maybe, people don’t have the capacity to love.

I don’t understand the idea of not being able to vent to someone (typically a friend) because you’re afraid that you will burden them with your problems. What is really the meaning of the friendship then? Everyone needs someone to listen to but to brush them off and suggest that they go see a psychologist isn’t the kind of “support” they’re looking for, to begin with. 

I’m pretty sure if they wanted to go to a psychologist, they would have done so without you telling them to.

Where’s the humanity?


I do understand that it can be a load of information to process, compounded with the pressure of providing the best support you know how. You may find it a burden. But to outright say that you don’t want to be bothered by a person’s problems because you have your own life to deal with, is BS. It’s like you didn’t even try to care. 

Hello? We all have our problems. Welcome to earth. But life isn’t all about you. Not asking for you to be Superman but at least care enough to know that someone confides in you. A benevolent act can help with your mental health and will remind you that love is all humanity needs. A simple, kind gesture does go a long way, in case if you don’t have anything to say.

I think people who “doesn’t want to be bothered” are, rather, shallow and self centered. Not to mention, this really could make a person feel lonely.

Not saying we should be codependent but at least show some humanity.

Well…maybe this is “too demanding and unreasonable”

Till 18 - went to a boys school never had any female interaction, began to realise I have difficulties interacting.

18-22 -: joined college, got some hopes of making girlfriend but no luck maybe because all my friends (around 10-12) were like me too lol.
No one had any girl friends or gf.
So joined the gym (pic attached) with some of my like minded friends for,you already know what .
But still no luck but glad that I found weightlifting (I love it ).


A usual day for me (post-lockdown) is - attending online classes, work on projects/internship, go to the gym, go out with my friends in the evening and get stoned af or drink somedays or both but something is necessary.

I had for a long time convinced myself that dating is not for me and I should rather focus on myself and I’ll get married at the right age(arranged obviously).
 
It really hits me hard when I come back to my apartment (I live alone), buzzed out of my senses that it would be nice to have someone. I am thinking of moving back with my parents now. I have a lot of friends and relatives but still feel lonely.

5195,Daniel_0101,1635966170,1,"Recently my girlfriend who i love very much broke up with me. The reason being my depression and issues. She loved me, she really did, like you wouldn't believe. What she all did for me. I moved in with her, and things were good, they really were. I never felt what i felt when i was with her ever in my life. She wasn't just my love, but also my best friend - my only friend. She did know about my depression which is due to my history of self isolation for 3 years. It did leave me scared probably for the rest of my life. Being alone and talking to absolutely noone for that amount of time and living some time on the street will change you. 

I didn't treat her good, not always. I did very bad mistakes. I didn't go to a therapist to talk about my issues, all i had was her. It was my mistake. She just couldn't deal with it anymore.  How many times i said, i change, i didn't. I wanted to, there was nothing more i wanted in my life, you can believe me that, but i just couldn't. After some time i fell back to old ways. Things got rough in the end and i even told her i'd kill myself after she said i have to leave now. Can you imagine that? A person loves me with all her heart, gives me everything she has, gives me second chances, in the end she just had to end things for her own wellbeing, because she is just as a sensitive person like i am - and i tell her i want to kill myself. What a disgusting human being i am, to do that to her. 

Now i am back in Vienna, after having to leave her in germany. I am back and i am trying my very best to become something like the man she deserved from the beginning. Believe when i say that i was at fault in all of this. She isn't like any other girl you know or may know. She is very special and there just is noone like her. I fucked up, big time. 

Months have passed now, we have no contact. We used to have contact every day, now just nothing. As i said she wasn't just my big love but also my only friend. I talk to noone now, i have noone. I am all alone. I miss her every day and i just don't know who i am anymore. I thought i am this loving person, but it seems i am not. I don't know myself anymore after what happened. 

I tried to hang myself two days ago, but i couldn't go through with it in the end. I couldn't breave and i started to see black in front of me, so i pulled myself up with my hands. I just can't do it. I am not afraid of dying, i know i'll just stop to exist. No world, no observer, no one there to regret killing himself, but i just can't. I don't know what i fear, it's probably just my biological programming.

You know, back then when i lived isolated, hopeless, alone for years, having not talked for so long i got problems with speaking and pronouncing words, being nihilistic about the human condition and nature - this all was just a joke compared to what i feel now. I just can't quite put my finger on it - she isn't perfect, i am not perfect, but we were perfect for each other. But my depression and my issues ruined it completely. I should've visited a therapist sooner, way sooner. I deserve this. I just can't forget her. Few years from now, i'll still love her. I just do, i can't any other way, it happens by itself.

5207,Consistent_Candle_74,1635962311,1,"I've been going though a lot the last 4 years, but the last 2 Months have been completely unbearable.

I have a few great friends, that are supporting me as best as they can and that i can be emotionally open towards, but they all live really far away. And while talking is nice. i'm really just craving platonic physical affection and intimacy right now, even if it's just a hug.

I've been in a long relationship that was going on, on and off for 3 years. I have been dealing with a lot of toxicity in form of anger and verbal abuse from my partner, even when we were not together and even after they broke up with me 2 Months ago, i still had to deal with their toxicity, while i was trying to get emotional support from them, because i really didn't know what else to do.

Very soon after breaking up with me, they became interested in someone else from the same friendgroup that we're both in and all the heartbreak, jealousy and uncertainty pushed me into behavior that is just generally very unhealthy for myself. From not eating to stalking their profile.

This has gotten better recently, because i made some promises to friends for my own sake and like i said, i have a few very nice and supportive friends. But in the end i'm still suffering because of all of this. Not only have i lost a partner that i deeply cared about, but about a week ago I've also lost them as a friend.

I know that the distance is going to be good for me in the long run, but I have to go out of my way to avoid mutual friendgroups, just to have that. And they way they ended the friendship was very mean towards me. I tried to make it a at least somewhat positive or clean end and they agreed, but they got upset at me, because i made a certain promise to other friends as well, and not only to them. 

The promise was about not hurting myself, because i was genuinely scared that i was going to do it. I was opening up to them and told them that i promised multiple people and that i value those promises, but they just called me attention-seeking and said that i just wanted to involve them and that it wasn't a personal promise.   
Just after that they gave me a simple ""bye"" and blocked me.

I haven't messaged them nor tried to reach out to them since.  I just feel extremely hurt about how someone who says that they care about me a lot could do and say such things to me. I feel like i wasted so much of my time. I took them back twice after breaking up with them, just for them to toss me away like this in the end. And despite all of this. I just can't bring myself to get over them, to not care about them or to hate them.

I want them to give me closure, to make me feel okay again, but i'm aware that i probably won't ever get that. 

This ended up way longer than i intended it to be. If you're reading this, thank you a lot for listening. I'm actively trying my best to get back on track and I won't give up this easily.

But that's not all.

I love my wife but feel unfulfilled in our marriage. After 17 years of marriage and two children we have drifted apart.  We share very few common interests any longer.  When we talk it's always centered on the kids and their lives and I don't even know how to have a meaningful conversation with her about anything else any more.  We rarely have sex any more and when we do it lacks passion.  

I miss the passion and the desire for each other that was part of our relationship in the beginning.   I miss how it felt when we had to part company and neither of us wanted to leave the other.  When our goodbye kisses lasted forever but weren't long enough.  I miss when we couldn't wait to be back in each others arms.  When even a short time apart felt an eternity.

I miss when I felt weak in the knees from a simple touch of her hand.  When a kiss drove me wild with wanting her. 

So here I am.  I'm on Reddit seeking interactions with with women with the hope that might feel at least a little of what I used to feel.  I didn't realize that before now and I know it's a hopeless pursuit with faceless, nameless people.

i know that having more people in my life and eliminating the loneliness might not magically fix this, but i feel like this change is being caused by isolation and alienation.

5253,AITA_Account882005,1635928201,1,"It's been a very, very long time since I have had genuine romantic feelings for someone, and I miss it all so very much.

I'm almost 25 years old and have not had any sort of relationship in the past 10 years. I used to have many crushes in high school, but somewhere when college began I started to lose interest in everyone around me.

Like most people I will be attracted to people who are attractive-looking, but the feeling fades so quickly once I hear them speak. It's not from a place of hate, but from  knowing I would never get along with that person. The light around them dims slowly and I lose interest quickly.

I don't like many people's personalities, either. My preference for dating or a relationship is someone I can be good friends with, but even my small pool of friends is filled with people I don't always like being around. I'm a strong introvert, and so my social energy is very valuable, and out of my 30 or so friends I only really enjoy spending time with 4 or 5. Everyone else I'm just incompatible with; they have fun hanging out but I never get any real satisfaction. I just follow the social structure and coast along until I can escape to solitude.

It's miserable, because I really do wish I could feel love for someone again. Countless daydreams of someone and the uplifting joy when speaking to them is something I haven't felt in such a long time, and it makes me so miserable. I want so badly to want to give myself to someone again, but it's an emotional state that can't be coaxed forcefully. Both my parents are divorced twice, and are in much worse financial states for it - as I've learned through observation, a poor selection in a partner is the fastest way to poverty, and I refuse to follow those mistakes.

Still... I get so sad. I wonder often if I'll ever find someone to care about ever again. I want the excitement of giving someone my heart again, even if they don't necessarily feel the same. I would like some crumb of evidence that, yes, it is possible I can crawl out of here.",lonely,"I want to feel genuine romantic love for another person again, even if it's unrequited.",2021-11-03 19:30:01

Last week I woke up in the hospital despite what I had planned. my partner of 5 years unexpectedly left me after sleeping with me; my mother had a heart attack and I am a survivor of multiple major car accidents and major childhood trauma. I have lost my whole being in the last few weeks and I don't know where to go. None of the people in my support circle have seen me since I have left the hospital. The person who I was convinced I was going to marry, after being intimate looked over and told me she loved me less than I loved her and left. I have lost trust in everything I thought I knew to be true. I commit to people and love with my whole heart. But all it has ever brought me is so much deep suffering and pain. I take care of other people before I take care of myself. I cannot be alone with myself for longer than 15 minutes without growing a hole in my heart. I miss her with all of my being, and I don't have anyone.  I have lost motivation in Uni and with the things I am passionate about. I just need somebody to care, just until I can close my eyes and feel okay. I cannot seem to get past the fact that she used to beat me black and blue and I taught her how to love. She got better. for 2 years she hasn't hit me. Then she tells me that she doesn't love me anymore.  I carved Alone into my thigh with a razor blade last week too deep. I woke up dazed in a pool of my own blood. I have been really close to death before, and there's this feeling of relief that I have felt both times I have had to be revived. Living with the understanding that I will look forwards to dying as it has been the happiest I had been for a long time, is really hard. I have seen the afterlife, and I didn't see any sort of god. It's dark and cold, there is nothing. I was hoping that the second time around I might see ""the light"" but I was only confronted with hell for a second time. I cannot see past this. I constantly think about the relief I felt. I haven't hurt myself in over a week, it is the longest I haven't self-harmed in over 2 years. I hurt so bad.

5298,South-Education7470,1635909624,1,"Many years ago when I was around 16 my life was a bit different than average. I would get home from school and expect the worst. My father was constantly making my sister’s life impossible. Looking back I realize since I’ve been witnessing this since as long as I can remember,I was always too afraid to stand up for her. Eventually I became desensitized by violence in our household and would do my best to ignore it. Most friends I would meet would eventually witness the chaos that was my home. So I stopped bringing them there. I would go out to far away places with no car or phone and get really drunk and high. Then one day at a party I tried lsd for the first time and I became the image of a drug addict purposely to catch my family’s attention. After a while of tripping balls, I came home one night and my father was gone. Even tho he constantly attacked my sister and if I ever got in the way I would get beaten and even tho that was my reality, I missed him….so I got really depressed and I know that term can be thrown around loosely but I wouldn’t shower, I’d sleep all day and night and would only wake up to eat, then I was encouraged to get a job that was really far away. At this job I got hurt. My back still hurts after 9 years. I tried suing but it never went through. I couldn’t work physically because my back was trashed and I couldn’t get a job that required social interactions because acid fried me. I didn’t hear from my lawyer for 4 years after I tried suing so my family stopped believing me one by one about my back eventually no one visited me anymore and eventually no one would speak to me it’s just hi and bye. Maybe a “drive home safe”. One night wallowing in my tears of loneliness I decided to take 23 pills with the intention of losing my life ( I do not promote this and if your having bad thoughts please seek help) and when I woke up and realized that I was still breathing, the phone rang. My mom was really old so I answered it before she could and it was my aunt she told me that since my mom is really comfortable with me I should be the one to tell her that her brother had passed away. The moment I saw her heart break destroyed me I couldn’t imagine what it would be like if I had passed away that night on New Year’s Eve. So I tried living for her sake and slowly remembered the effort needed to be normal not for me but for her sake. I even went to therapy to help with my social anxieties. Eventually I got a job as a picker at amazon I got a girlfriend and started to live a little. My mom got sick again it was her diabetes. The doctor gave her six months to live. The next 3 months we’re very bizarre seeing my mom up and about doing her business and then one day she couldn’t walk then she needed help to use the restroom then she couldn’t eat. One day she couldn’t tell us what year it was, then one day she couldn’t tell me my name. One day when I went to work my sister made my mom sign me out of the will I didn’t know till she had passed. My girlfriend took me in to her home. Eventually I stopped hearing from my family. I live in my girlfriend’s garage I’m trying my best to stay above water. There’s many moments where I feel like I’m belittled in front of her family and I’m used to my family excluding me from birthdays bbqs or any event so when it happens here it doesn’t even phase me but when it’s my own girlfriend making me look bad on purpose I realize my ultimate reality….I’m stuck here with no way out and I wish god would save me because I don’t know what to do anymore",lonely,My story,2021-11-03 14:20:24

5305,ForsakenThrowawayy,1635906097,1,"Hey there people. Before I start, I want to mention that this post will say a story of how I feel and what happened. I want to let you know that there are possibly some abusive and suicidal references so if that's something that makes you sad, please do not read this. Also, I'm not a native English speaker so the post is most likely full of mistakes.

It's the second time I'm writing that post because my previous attempt got deleted by an accident. As the title says, I miss someone or started to miss someone a few days ago. But so you can understand me better I will share my story with you, I want to get this out of my head. I feel like there's a gigantic storm there and I just can't be like this anymore. Maybe writing it down help, maybe some of the advice from you helps. This community is full of amazing, lovely and emphatic people and I do hope that you will understand my misery.

I met this person a few years ago. We met online, we never actually met in real life because of the distance between the two of us. It started normally, with some jokes and casually playing some video games. With time it got deeper and he was the one that shared problems with me. I was there to help him and I think it was the thing that made us bond more. We started to spend days together, sometimes even half of the nights, talking, gaming, even singing a little bit. He even claimed that he's my little brother and it was around for quite a time, and at some point when he was own, thinking about bad things, I told him that I love him and that he matters to me. He said the same and we just started to assure each other that we just love ourselves and we're there to support each other. There were gifts, I often resigned from unnecessary things, even sometimes pulled my few friends off because I was only spending time with him. And our relationship was growing. It wasn't just supporting each other, it was real love. For most of the time, we didn't admit it, probably both of us were too afraid to say that but it happened and one night we were officially together. I felt really happy and I know he felt that way too. But something happened, he went on a trip and he wasn't around too much so I could talk with him but expected me to talk with him more. Our relationship started to be toxic, we broke up because he needed space. And it was just getting worse and worse between us. Argues and some not too nice behaviour. We said goodbye in an angry atmosphere.

After a few weeks, he messaged me with a proper goodbye, not the angry one. He didn't want me to be angry at him, I wasn't angry. I was sad and a message from him was something that made me happy. I missed him. He said some really bad things like I'd read a suicidal letter and that was awful. I wanted to be there, after all, we promised each other to always be around even if the relationship won't work out. And we started to talk again. It was difficult, he was like a different person, a lot of toxicity came out of this. And I wasn't in the best mental condition either, I had a lot of problems. Once he offered help and I shared my problems with him. It ended up him giving advice that sounded like it was my fault, and besides his problems are much bigger than mine. It ended up him disappearing for a week. It was even worse for me because my mind was completely a mess. I wondered if he's just mad or something happened and even tried to stalk all the sources I could to check if he's alright. It ended up with me having to apologize after a week. I did because I wanted someone to be there for me, I was completely alone. With time it only got worse and worse, there also were a few of our mates there around in this story. I often protected him from their, I don't know how to call it, light ""insults"" (that were completely understandable). It was near my bday, which a day ago he knew and just one day later he ""forgot"" to even wish me anything. I was mad because that hurt me. I spent more time with one of these mates (let's call him B). We said our goodbye again, now definitely... (quick edit, I reminded myself something important. He said that he was there with me out of love and it was me who acted toxically. Of course, in situation like this both sides are at some point toxic but later I had in mind that he still loved me and that's why my next actions were how they were)

I was spending more of the time with B. B wasn't talking with him, mostly with me and I think they even deleted each other from the friend's list. We got closer with B and after I think a month, I got a message from HIM again. He was apologizing to me, said some excuses of why he forgot even if a day ago he said he would sing and wish me a happy bday. Because of B, I told him to go away even if that hurt me. I regretted it because I first said it was okay, but after a day or two, I just said goodbye, ""I'm not ready for this"" and other lies like that because of how B acted like. I started thinking about him again after two or three months, especially that it was a few years since we met. B started to be pretty toxic towards me too but in a different way. B claimed that he needed me and always was angry when I spent time with others, but B could spend time with others whenever he wanted. B had a lot of problems and didn't see that I also had some.

After 2 months I got the courage to message my ex-boyfriend, friend and brother. I apologize to him for how I acted when he said about what happened to him. I wasn't expecting forgiveness but we started to talk again. With time spending more time. B was very jealous and made a lot of problems. We all ended contact for a week or two. It was my ex's bday so I sent one message and wished him happy bday and that started our friendship again. We both got rid of B because he was really toxic, threatening both of us to stay with him because if not, then he's going to suicide.

Our friendship now was much different. I had much less time to spend on PC, also spent a lot of it with my friends that I abandoned for a long time. And with him, we didn't even have too much to do. He was on vacation, saying some stuff that distant me even more from him. Made me even a little jealous about some stuff because I realized that there still is some love for him out there. But we got behind it and just casually played some games or chat together sometimes. I've changed, I wasn't falling for his nice words anymore. He had an attitude of wanting things which I could grand him but I just didn't. And I wasn't always agreeing with him like before because that wasn't making me happy at all. I wanted him to also do something for me. He also started to insult something that was personally important to me and failed attempts at that thing only made me sad, because it wasn't something I could save or do better. He just did it better and he knows better. We're getting close to an end. The last few weeks were very distant. I had almost no time, I had a lot of stress before one important exam and I had other problems at home too. Wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone. At some point, after a few days of both of us being quiet, he just removed me from his friend's list and disappeared. Didn't say goodbye or anything. Just gone. It was four or five months ago.

A few weeks ago I changed the last message to proper goodbye and I don't know why I keep checking if he said anything. He was toxic, maybe even abusive. He told me that he's manipulative and he was manipulating me. I have trust issues because of him, because I'm afraid to trust someone so they won't just say that my problems are my faults, not important and others have it worse. I know I can't trust him. I know that we probably won't vibe anymore even if he would appear in my life again. I question the fact if I was ever important to him?

So WHY DO I MISS HIM?! Is it because my life's full of problems and my mental health is not too good. And I just want the old, supportive him because there's nobody else that can replace him? I have no idea, I hope it passes and I can forget about him but my mind is just making me still think about him, check if he has seen my goodbye message or even listen to music he has sent me.

This post took me more than an hour. Thank you for letting this go out of my head. I just hope this storm in my head ends soon.",lonely,Why am I still missing this one person?,2021-11-03 13:21:37

People mature with age. With age comes experience and in certain cases experience gives you maturity. Every new lesson learnt adds to our maturity meter, constantly changing every second on this planet. Yet, we don't want to accept that people can change. Their foibles might remain the same but certainly their approach and thought process changes.

Keeping aside the differences I would certainly like to think that if people took love more seriously and added a little bit of flavour to it by tweaking the rubrics, livin' each day on its merits and treating your lover with the same eccentric attitude and compassion. Do you think we could live a happy life? 

I certainly want to feel love. It's as equivalent as breathing air and every day gives us a opportunity to find ways to breathe better. Loving on its merits on that particular day gives us a opportunity to find better ways to love. Routine amd regime is for living and not for loving.

I even tried downloading dating apps because my friends said it's an ego booster, but it was the opposite on my part. No one really swipes right on my profile, and when they do, i alwags message first and don't get a reply back!

It’s fine to not want to talk to me, but then I see the same accounts posting how they have no one to talk to. I sincerely apologies for being no one and not good enough.

5364,hurricaneeeee,1635880398,1,"Two months ago I actually had friends, even if they were virtual. I had friends who I at least thought liked me, who I could talk and tell things to. In the early days of quarantine (around August of 2020), I acquired a new friend. She was a fellow classmate of mine who I'd known for a few years, but it was only then that we started talking and getting to know each other. For the next few months, we would become best friends. We developed an intense bond and were inseparable. Soon we found two more friends via an online game and all four of us were kind of a group. We soon became very close. During this period in my life, I felt so many diverse emotions I had never felt before. I felt as if I was on top of the world. As if we were the only four people that existed. It was a euphoric feeling. But as we got closer, things got as bad as they got good, if that makes sense. Being a group of 4 people, there were quite a lot of controversies that had begun to come up. I was getting jealous of my IRL friend getting close to one of the other girls, she kept saying she was not replacing me but it was blatantly obvious. I would request her again and again not to replace me, but the behaviour continued. I was beginning to experience frequent anxiety attacks when I found out my IRL friend was moving away. By this point, it had been a few months of our friendship and I had unknowingly pushed away everyone else in my life, leaving me with no one when she moved. She wasn't just moving to a different city, she was moving to an entirely different country on a completely different continent! I was fearful of what would happen when I had to rejoin physical school after the pandemic ended. We would have frequent fights every day which was about everything from her gradual disinterest in our friendship to her homophobic and racist boyfriend who she continuously forgave for his actions. I told her that forgiving him without consequences was wrong but she would just play the victim and it would end up going the same way every time. Being a lesbian and also incredibly passionate about human rights, I obviously wanted her to do the right thing and only wanted the best for her. I think my over-protectiveness of her ruined our friendship. As I later found out after the end of our friendship, she had been lying to me about almost everything and was emotionally manipulating the three of us. In August, after a fight, we ended our friendship. She got our other two best friends on her side by playing the victim as always, and that was the end of it. I begged her to reconsider being friends with me since I had no one and she had a lot of people since she was quite popular and I wasn't (God knows why she became my friend in the first place). The first couple of days were hard since I had pushed everyone away. I was crying daily and had absolutely no friends. I would try to reach out to people but it felt as if everyone suddenly hated me. I knew no one cared about me or reaching out to me. I was just reaching out to people like a fool and receiving dry and forced responses.   I have always been kind of an outcast with way too strong opinions about everything and an unapproachable exterior due to my social awkwardness. Being in quarantine worsened my social anxiety to the point where I cannot communicate with people. I am so self-conscious that I feared going to school and am in tears when I see a video or photograph of myself. I started physical school a week ago and it wasn't that bad. But I have no friends.

We were on a break or whatever she wanted to call it and I had paid for a train ticket(much less everything else) for her to come up from West Palm to Jax for Halloween a few days before and after. We had a really nice fire going on Halloween/night and once everyone had left I was pretty drunk and packed everything up for the night to wake up to being accused of cheating on her because she found some dating apps I was on weeks prior. No msgs were sent I did not seek anyone out but I also understand how it looked but I had the feeling something was off that night. She was waiting for me to do exactly what I did. So that she would have no problem going through my phone while I was passed out. I've given her my passcode because I was hopeful that would build trust. Well it only seemed to make matters worse. I've never cheated on her because I didn't want anyone other than my person. I still love her and I just wish she handled things differently. More so I wish I had too.

5380,Nilbebe,1635873755,1,"okay this might be a long post so... just a heads up. also, lotta venting and im kind of emotional so, that too. 

last month i moved cross country for college, and honestly everything is going well. my living situation is good, i have a fun job, i enjoy my classes etc. everything is perfect except for my dating life. i turned 18 the week i moved here, and keep in mind i have never been on a date or had any feelings reciprocated (usually when i confess its rejection or i just get ghosted/ignored. on one occasion i was ghosted by a guy who asked me out first.) so, after my birthday i decided to download tinder and see if i would have any luck. the first girl ended up ghosting me. i went out with a second girl but we didnt contact each other after, it felt kind of like just awkward, or hanging out with a friend instead of a date. 

The third, a guy, set up a date but then his roommate tested positive for covid so he had to quarantine. this was about three weeks ago now, and he hasnt contacted me to say hes clear or anything. it kind of hurts but more than anything i hope him and his roomie recovered safely and fully. 

the fourth was another guy. he was so cute and fun and easy to talk to, and we had a common hobby that we bonded over. i was so excited to see him and i had fun on our date; but afterwards he told me he didnt want to go out again when i brought it up. again, the rejection hurt but i hope he finds someone who makes him really happy. 

then the fifth. i dont even know how to process my feelings about this. when we matched it was super early saturday morning, like 3am. he immediately messaged me saying he was drunk from hanging out with friends. he asked if he could come over to be with me, that he would take an uber. (i know that this next part was a naive and dumb move, no need to remind me) but i told him he could, but i didnt want to hook up. he said that was fine, but when we got back to my room he started kissing me then im sure i dont need to elaborate on the rest. honestly, i enjoyed it and had fun, and i dont regret hooking up with him if we're talking about strictly my enjoyment. but i think because he was drunk i should have done more to stop him. 

in the morning when he sobered up he said he didnt remember much but that he had fun. i asked him if he hooked up with people a lot and he said no, and he didnt wan to talk much about it. we went out and got some food, and he left at around 5:30 in the evening. i honestly never even dreamed of being a hookup person so i wasnt really sure if or how to go forward from this, so yesterday i just asked if he wanted to catch a movie or something sometime. day later and no response. think ive been ghosted... again. 

i said all of this to say, i know that no matter what you do with someone they dont owe you their time or affection. but this feeling... its like, people only like me until they see me irl or talk to me, or they stop liking me when they arent drunk anymore. i cant shake this feeling and its so awful. i feel unloveable. it completely destroys my sense of self, because i think im a good and kind person until i realize that if that were true, people wouldnt run away from the thought of me. but i dont know what to fix or how to fix it... my mental health has improved a ton lately, i see a therapist, try to check in with my friends a lot, etc. i just feel like there mist be something glaringly wrong with me for this to happen so much",lonely,i feel like im just cursed to never be loved,2021-11-03 04:22:35

Let me just caveat this post by saying that social media is of course:

1) A highlight reel that by all means does not show the mundane tasks that make up the majority of people's lives 

2) Doesn't show the bad side of people's lives 

3) Doesn't show the people who \*aren't\* doing interesting fun things with a big group of friends. 

Fine. Fine fine fine.

However. It isn't totally unreal. Those people on Saturday night showing off their stories and posts from Halloween parties weren't faking the whole thing. They were indeed socialising and having fun (barring the odd exception). They will of course come home to do the washing up and the laundry like everyone else but they did at least \*have\* a highlight to put in the highlight reel of their lives.  


I was talking to a friend of mine (one of the one's who seems totally and utterly content to let his social life now fade into essential nothingness barring spending time with his girlfriend) and confiding in him with some of my frustrations about how we never get the old group together and suchlike. 

Sure enough he was smugly coming out with the platitudes I've just mentioned. He mentioned the point that ""On any given day, what do you think most people are doing after work? They're cooking, washing up, going to bed. What are most people doing tonight right now? The answer is of course fuck all lol""

Now first of all - absolutely - do what makes you happy. And hey, if you can successfully rationalise pissing away any banked life experiences of your twenties/early thirties out of sheer laziness the more power to you. 

But does anyone else find this infuriating and actually slightly arrogant? The idea that no-one out there could possibly be doing **tangibly better shit** than you are?

Our group works good, solid upper middle-class jobs and we can barely muster a holiday for a couple of nights to Europe - or a night out in a town somewhere else in the UK - or go camping and hiking etc. We do none of that. The best we can come up with seems to be a drinking gathering about once a quarter maybe with a spot of weed.

Its just the lack of ambition that annoys me, and the smugness of acting as if (whilst yes, yes, I accept social media is a highlight reel), no-one can come up with better stuff to do than you. That \*no-one out there has made more of their youth than you\* when you've literally never left the country once in the past decade or had a weekend away with mates having a half-decent sesh in a City or gone on a camping trip or just anything, something.

I want to meet someone who wants to talk on a daily basis - why?

**Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.**

5409,Jay19845,1635857650,1,"I’m feeling pretty down and have found myself considering suicide. My wife and I separated six months ago. We have two children together aged five and two. I see them regularly, but adapting to the silence and a much less energetic environment is difficult after returning to my parents house around two months ago.

I’m feeling incredibly lonely at the moment. I’ve reconnected with some old friends and have tried to make new ones but struggle to ‘connect’ with people and maintain relationships. I don’t like myself very much and even the slightest sense of rejection leaves me feeling deeply hurt and withdrawn. This can be as simple as not receiving a reply to a text message – it makes it difficult for me to ‘put myself out there’ and creates a detrimental cyclical process: I’m lonely so I consider trying to meet new people, I feel rejected and I withdraw ceasing any attempt to make new friends.

This leaves me frustrated and, as I say, isolated. This isolation is really getting me down and I can't see it improving. I’m concerned that my sense of self is too closely linked to my relationships with other people. It feels almost narcissistic, particularly as I love receiving compliments from others even though I struggled to believe anyone that says anything nice to me is being genuine.

I also feel trapped. Having young children makes the very idea of taking my own life very difficult. I don’t really want to live any more as life is very painful, but I also don’t want to hurt my children.
I’ve dealt with these feelings for so long. I’ve been receiving various forms of treatment – including medication, counselling, CBT, etc. - for depression and anxiety for twenty years now. I’ve been happy at times, but these moments have been fleeting and, more often than not, I feel very unhappy and hopeless.

5415,ajw596596,1635849682,1,"Hi all. Not really sure why I resorted to this sub, I guess I just needed a place to express my feelings safely.

I've been feeling very, very lonely the past several months. I live with my parents (not in the US) which sucks in itself because I'm in my mid-20s and would obviously like to move out at some point. I'm in one of the most expensive cities to live in, though, so I don't really see that happening anytime soon.

I pretty much only interact with them, and my coworkers. However, because I grew up not speaking the language of the country I currently live in (despite ethnically being from here and having citizenship), it's difficult to connect with my coworkers on a deeper level. People here love hanging out in groups, and I see couples constantly - it's like I'm being forced to remember just how lonely I am everywhere I go. I don't understand how so many people my age and older seem to have these established friend groups and relationships. Even the guy I work with most closely the other day was talking about how he ""only"" has one big group of solid friends from elementary school, and complaining about how he has three weddings to go to this month. Meanwhile, I have literally no one to hang out with and the only wedding I've ever been to in my life was my aunt's when I was a kid.

The only type of people I could see myself making friends with here are foreigners; I know there are ""expat"" groups and whatnot, and I'm sure there are many other people here looking for foreigners to hang out and meet up with. Even then, though, there's always that lingering feeling of sadness and guilt because I don't feel like I belong anywhere. Ethnically, I look like most people here, but I can't fluently speak the language, so I never understand the inside jokes my coworkers crack, for example. To foreigners, since I look like people here, I'm not one of them either.

It doesn't help that my parents are still very involved in my life; because I live with them, I can't freely meet up with people without getting subjected to their nosiness and questions. I used to really enjoy hanging out with just my mom, but she's busy now with other things and has distanced herself from my dad and I. I hardly ever go anywhere with her anymore, so I'm just stuck at home or work.

I'm not really sure what I hope to gain from posting this. I'm sure there are many people out there, and in this sub, who will understand how I feel. I had a good number of ""friends"" in college, and being independent there while being able to freely hang out with them whenever made me really happy. But I have very little contact still with those ""friends,"" especially since most of them are halfway across the world from me in the US. I'm also worried because I've noticed that I've been turning to food for comfort more often these days. I've always been extremely insecure about my weight and appearance; though I'm not at all fat by US standards, I'm considered ""big"" here and that only further adds to my unhappiness.",lonely,Getting sadder by the day,2021-11-02 21:41:22

I don't know if I am still dealing with the breakup, if I am still recovering, maybe I am not ready at all, who knows, 6 months is a short amount of time for someone like me.

There has to be another way to be. I don’t know what to think. I don’t know what’s going on, but there has to be another way to be.

I want to not care what people think, but if I try to not care what they think then I’m caring what they think, because by not caring I’m defending myself from what they think because if I care it will hurt. I don’t think people like me. I want people to like me. I want to act in a way that people will like me, but if I act in a way that people will like me then I’m trying to get people to like me, because I need them to like me. I need to be liked.

I’m going to add these thoughts to a story I want to write. It will be about my struggles. And by writing this story it will help me gain empathy for myself, and see myself from another perspective.

5458,blackflagdepression,1635829668,1,"I know ""love"" is a strong word with certain hangups/connotations, but it get my point across well enough.

I've been falling for her since we first met.  She is currently my only friend. She is one of the most beautiful people I have ever met, physcially and more importantly in who she is.  She is incredibly kind.  She knows I am severely depressed and anxious, yet she always makes time to talk to me, about serious issues or just to talk in general. She is very funny and just cool in general (she offered to make me some buttons for my vest).  Plus she is kind of a badass.  She has this aura of quiet strength, hard to define but if you met her you would recognize it.  We have similar mental/emotional struggles,so she understands me on that level when many do not. We have very similar policital/philosophical ideologies.  She has helped me to feel less profoundly alone in the world. All that said, telling her how I feel would risk me losing my only friend.  

Then there's me. I'm not hideous, but especially with the meds I'm on, I have powerful food cravings and a very hard time controlling my weight, so I am kind of chubby. My job and workouts keep me in fairly good shape, I just don't look it.   I am not as intelligent as her, not putting myself down here, its just a reality.  I work a ""blue collar"" trade job currently which I enjoy but it doesn't pay too much. She is planning on grad school. She has a lot of friends, I do not. She is much more social than I, my anxiety can be crippling in those situations. I've also only been in a couple longer term relationships, so I am not as familiar as she is with how to properly carry myself in a relationship.  Again, not trying to put myself down completely, I do have my own strengths, she just seems to be on another level than me, if that makes sense, but with my severe depression, I cannot tell if that is just my mind warping my perception of reality

Part of me wants to tell her how I feel, and gamble on the slim hope she feels the same. But that could result in me losing her friendship, which would leave me alone again, and more importantly I'd lose someone I care about.  And relationships eventually end, meaning that after times of hypothetical happiness, I will eventually feel that pain.  Everytime I message/talk to her/ see her, I feel so happy, and I don't want to lose her. But I am so torn here.

I'm not a terribly online person, and I don't think correctly sometimes, so I apologize if this post is abnormal somehow. I've just got no one else to talk to except her, and obviously I can't talk to her about it.",lonely,Falling in Love with my Only Friend,2021-11-02 16:07:48

Talk to who you want to.  Love who you want to.  Be attracted to who you want to.  Learn from who you want to.  Connect deeply with who you want to.  If your parents hate black people, go make a black friend and see what their truth is.  If your uncle wants you to stay away from gay people, make a gay friend and see what he, she, or they have to offer in their hearts.  If someone has a differing opinion on any particular topic or belief, talk about it instead of pushing them away.  Differences are what make life interesting, and makes connecting with others interesting.

After being unable to talk to my closest friend for a while now and having daily thoughts of asking for approval from them since having to go I have realized that it might be why I was so overbearing at times.

It sounded like fun. It made me wish that I was a part of their friend group.

Just for some background, the last friend group I had was from high school, but they're so busy that we don't have time to hang out. I also have online friends who I usually talk to every day. It's...okay, for the most part. I love them, but there's just something different about being in real life with friends.

I see people around campus with their friends, talking and just having a good time, while I'm eating all alone pretty much every day. I don't completely mind being by myself. But there's a part of me that desires to have people. Just scrolling on Instagram, I see people that I knew back then and now having fun with other people. Meanwhile I'm sitting here by myself, wishing that I could join them.

I don't know what I did wrong. How does it seem like everybody else can make friends in the first week, yet most people won't even talk to me? I feel so hopeless. I literally wish to myself and imagine what it would be like to be a part of that one friend group. I'm so lonely that I immerse myself into TV shows and wish even more that I had friends like they do.

I don't even know anymore. Maybe I'm just destined to be alone. I've never made friends easily. Elementary and middle school, pretty much nobody liked me. High school, things actually improved, but I wasn't exactly the most popular kid there. And now university. It already feels like a damn popularity contest and I'm at the bottom of the barrel. Trust me, I've tried to make friends. I've tried saying hi to people, tried being friendly, I tried joining clubs (which failed because the ones I joined happen to occur at the exact same time on the exact same days, and that time happens to be when I'm in a class). I'm trying my hardest, but nothing ever works. At this point it feels like I'm just destined to be alone.

5484,nomanslandishome,1635821411,6,"I'm in the same boat as all of you. I completely emphasise with everyone's posts and comments. It's saddening to see that we're struggling like this.

I just wanted to share my experiences lately, because I suppose I may have hit an ultimatum which I'm not sure I can now come back from.

I've always been isolated. Only child, single parent family. Never really minded it up until my mid teens. That's when I noticed the video games and stuff stopped filling in the void that had been sufficiently filled by them for the years prior.

When it comes to social situations and connections with people, I feel like I've been very unfortunate. I've had maybe two or three best friends in the last 10 years. I don't have any now however. They all ended in really fucked up ways, and basically left me with some scaring each time.

My one and only relationship that I've been in ended not too badly, but boy did the months following it really end up going south further beyond anyone's expectations with malice and plain horrible behaviour being demonstrated. Again it left me fucked up.

Then last year I tried really hard to get out there, meet people or someone in all forms of context. I actually managed to meet people or someone new on over 20 occasions. Most people just gave excuses or didn't put the effort in. I don't know why, but that's how it went.

On the other hand, a few people did actually put the effort in. Sure, two of them faded away, even after I tried keeping up the conversations and so on.

But one person in particular stuck out from all these people. She was hands down the first person in a very long time who explicitly said they wanted to be around me and be my friend. Considering I was sort of on my last efforts, this was like a godsend for me. 

I felt ecstatic. I actually felt happy. Like I could stop worrying about my troubles and loneliness and start to make a life for myself. 

But no. After just a few months, of course it had to end. And abruptly at that. It's amazing how you can go from being supposedly someone's best friend, to having them utter the words ""sorry I can't"" when asked if they'd be willing to make up. I won't get into detail about why it ended, but essentially I tried to do a wholeheartedly decent thing for her, and unfortunately she misunderstood the intention and ended up taking it the wrong way completely.

But anyway, my point is... Its still tragic. It seems like these really unfortunate and tragic things keep happening to me when it comes to my relationships with people.

And when I ask ""when is enough, enough?"", I mean when do you stop the effort that you try to put into people. Whether that be resolving issues with those who have been and gone, or meeting new people.

It's amazing. Because I'm sick of having to keep packing my emotions up and moving on. I'm sure many of you understand how debilitating it is to do that when something ends.

I want to do something about it. Not because I'm mad or obsessed, but because I'm fed up of just accepting defeat and letting others essentially decide what happens from thereon. It makes me feel like I'm completely out of control, at the mercy of the other party.

It annoys me even more because you know when you finally meet someone after so long and after this horrendous loneliness, and you're skeptical brain finally decides to sign off that this person is actually someone you ought to keep in your life... You're told to just move on?

What if I don't want to move on anymore?? What if I'm fed up of doing it?? What if its literally causing me to develop a stigma and an assumption of how life is/ends? What if I just want to fight for something that's bloody worth it? Clearly I must be wrong in thinking like this, as I assume society would try to convince me I can't do that. 


So why bother anymore? Surely enough is enough, having to put up with this nonsensical game that everyone seems to play with people like myself.

Today, I heard my parents talk shit about me saying that im “not a good worker like my dad/don’t do anything”. This isnt the first time. My mom talks shit about me on the phone. My dad talks shit about me to his friends and even lets his friends stick and poke me about shit.

My parents even told me that if I was gay, they’d disown me. Im not gay if you’re wondering. But its the fact that my own parents would disown me if I wasn’t what they want me to be. Im already not what they want me to be btw. Im not fuckin cold hearted racist, a ignorant homophobe and a selfish dickhead.

I literally do fucking everything for them. Clean the house, take out trash, get the mail, work for my dad and bail him out of every bad situation and never ask for a paycheck or anything for that matter.

When leaves fall, im out there raking. When snow falls, im out there shoveling. When they have parties im the one who watches the dog (he would run away if the door was left open)

I stay up until 3am every single night to let the dog out. Every. Single. Night. Then I do every single thing I just listed above. Sometimes get a thank you. Most of the time I get made fun of.

I have dealt with depression and loneliness as long as I can remember (probably since I was 5) 

Now im here. Early 20s. No friends, no family who really cares about me, no relationships, no money and no job and extremely depressed and alone with nobody.

My mom asks after me but as long as I say ""I'm fine"" that's all she asks, and then goes on about everything going wrong in her life, unprompted. Other than watching TV and movies together from time to time, and as long as I'm home, she doesn't care.

I let her track me on her phone to stop this from happening but she still guilts me whenever I leave the house unannounced. I'm 29.  

I have 2 siblings. One just moved across the country. We've never been close. The other lives close but has their own life, friends, SOs (yes, polyamorous and NB) and doesn't ask about my life. I ask about theirs when they come around.  

I've made about a dozen ""friends"" on reddit in 2021. All but 4 of them have stopped talking to me. 2 of them I met on Saturday so, give them time, they'll stop too. They talk when they know I'm in a bad place, they share their stories, and then they never message me again.

5578,Council_Of_Minds,1635786007,1,"I had a relationship Eleven years ago and it made me realiza that I needed time to understand myself.

I have friendships but my country went to hell so I had to leave it, thus leaving my family and my friends are scattered around the Earth.

Though I'm a pretty sociable person, I am accustomed to my freedom of movement, personal space, inner thoughts and loner way of living, which comes from the acceptance of my character... However, being so adamant in knowing the realities of existence and finding my own purpose, along with the realization of deep inner truths and perhaps my nihilistic self, I have come to a bottom that I cannot seem to come out of:

A feeling of burden towards mankind somehow has taken over my mind where I want to help the world as much as is possible to utterly ridiculous extents and am not really able to do so... (fighting corruption and awakening minds takes a toll and being successful at it usually leads to an early death)

Which I find sometimes absurd that I would be almost obsessed with this idea. But such is the way of the soul.

On the other hand, I would just like to be ""a normal"" individual with a woman next to him that can bring a small family together, picture the ""dream"" (house in the outskirts, two or three children, dogs, cats, the whole nine yards) and just be content with fulfilling my biological and social human purpose (be born, grow, reproduce, die).

And perhaps we ought to find the simplest way to happiness and healthy complacency in order to live a healthy long life with cherished ones around you.

The difficulties of any loner or lonely individual apply to me: I have flaws and insecurities as the best of them.

But I feel I can overcome the ""common"" barriers of social courting with certain 'ease'. The problem lies within this idea deeply embedded within my brain that I should exhaust every possible thought avenue possible and commence a never-ending campaign towards improving humanity with all my energy, thus rendering my ""normal"" side behind and becoming the other thing.

Why not be balanced and do both?

Why not start doing this or the other?

Here come the issues I can perceive:

I am not within my own culture (Hispanic) thus the chances of a real long term relationship is lower than 10% (there is data backing this up, don't remember where) 
And those who have left their original countries and/or alike cultures will understand what barriers this brings. 

I believe that my dichotomy underlies a probable mental condition (delusions of grandeur or alike) and might not be the only psychological difficulty I face (Adhd is a main suspect). This leaves me with the feeling of burden that the 'other half' might face in dealing with me. As I stated before I am very sociable but the more a person grows closer to me, the more aware I become of my shortcomings as a human and as partner. I might become colder, added than I'm somewhat already stern and silent. 

For the more common but not less difficult issues:

It poses as a somewhat difficult task to find that right person on this side of the world (Europe) since not only there are a myriad stereotypical misconceptions and just perceptions about my ethnicity and culture (some with basis, others mere speculation) that already make me self conscious when just thinking about approaching someone else around here. There also lies the fact that in all probability the chance I find that someone more or less aligned to my moral compass or that we may share at least the level of thoughts with solid enough compromise on keeping respect and understanding as a core of our possible union seems fairly low. Therefore the ratio of effort made:favorable result seems overwhelmingly imbalanced. 

I am not without vanity, although I'm definitely not what women nowadays demand for in the appearance of males, I have a fair share of features and racial qualities that have been appreciated and praised in consistently in the past. My confidence does not dwindle due to these facts, I simply am superficially out of the scope of what women look for. Namely, I'm not a tall person. 
Doesn't sound like big deal, but it would surprise the unaware (or the tall) how much is this overestimated as a physical feature over many others. 

And since I am not without vanity I also have a scope of what I want as my partner as well, which any sane person should have, naturally, the pickier the narrower the chances of finding that person becomes. In my defense, I do not search for supermodels but I am attracted to the female body and standard of feminin beauty. Other than that of course what was stated above regarding our moral compasses aligning and her psychological/social qualities interest me as long as it is a person tilted towards good and justice, knowledge and progress. 

So... To sum up. I find that this recurrent discourse of vague calculations that I have almost unconsciously developed and keep running in the background has become a main detriment towards my impulse of approaching women. The instinct and want is definitely there, but the mind staves them off quickly after with 'it's not worth it' or 'don't waste her time' thought. 

I believe this is a very specific pitfall, and am doubtful of what approaches to use to surpass it. This, writing about on Reddit, is one ""outside of the box"" action I'm taking towards it. Although I'm not truly expecting anything out of it, maybe just reading it myself would help. But if I am honest, I would appreciate the human interaction. 

Other than that, I hope to anyone that reads this and is subscribed to this sub is able to find that significant other when the time is right, and if you haven't given yourself the time to learn about your inner mind I would recommend that you do, so as being a more complete individual when finding that cherished partner. 

Many thanks to you that read this,

I decide I will try to better, improve myself in every aspect of my life. I am going out to Jog, Exercising, Eating healthy, Working hard on my Career, Meditating. I accept that you cannot wait for depression to magically end, or the motivation to appear. I have been really putting effort into it. Yet more often than not I find myself failing to keep up with the habit more than a week. 

Action -&gt; Reward -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; and so on..   


And example of action might be going out for a jog. Reward is the sense of achievement and compliment you shower yourself with, and now you feel motivated to do this again tomorrow. I fail at the reward stage.  


However much ever I compliment myself, It is never enough. I lack the self-worth to value my own compliments. And I don't have friends or a girlfriend who would feel proud of my humble achievements, who I can tell about my work, or my improvements in mediation. I have nobody, other than myself, who I barely value. In a week or so I find myself going back to habit.   


I don not have friends or loved ones, who would take part in my achievements and I have no reason to pursue the goals. If I am not going to go out on dates, or trips with friends I have no reason keep up with my health and body. If I am going to be alone, does it really matter If I am at a healthy mental state or not.   


The immediate dopamine rush of junk food and sugary drink. Spending hours sitting in a bad posture, watching random youtube videos.  The distraction from movies, video games, and anything which occupies my ever shortening attention span. All of this are more satisfying than long term healthy goals.   


I am stuck in downward spiral, of not having enough self-worth to bring forth change. I slowly stop trying and as times goes more distant the ""friends"" become. More lonely I find myself, worsening habits, less self-worth. I want to escape this cycle.

I have been too busy to do anything other than work. I don't even enjoy life anymore, it's just one foot in front of the other. For some more context, I'm a butch lesbian and deep into vintage fashion and lifestyle. I don't listen to current music and I don't own a TV. I am completely obsessed with the 1920's and 30's and I dress in vintage mens suits daily, even to my boring ass lecture halls. I collect and repair vintage radios, but that has taken a back burner to my studies lately. The problem is that with my vintage lifestyle and being an Workaholic, I'm absolutely no fun. I don't have time to party with people, and I'm overall kind of stiff and stuck up. I haven't been in a relationship in a long time, but I have a literal fanclub of crazy girls on my campus due to the way I dress. One of them has even found my phone number and shared it around. They spam called me till I had to change my number. I'm afraid to go out with anyone because I'm worried that she would turn out to be a creep.

There's also this thing that I find most people around me to be very different than me. It's as if I don't belong.

5612,Kind_City2950,1635774575,1,"I'll go look over my own feelings and hurt and forget about what i've been feeling when i see any of my loved ones hurt, idk maybe i'm just selfish or something to think that ""i look over my feelings for my loved ones"" but just hear me out, idk if everything i feel is truly this intense or this is just normal and i'm just exaggerating. since i was a child whenever i'd get in arguements with my parents they'd beat me and say some hurtful stuff (which would really stick with me for a long time) beating is natural that i know, but i never had any of my parents come to me ever when i would cry alone either from the physical pain or the emotional pain. i just hate crying alone all the time. Whenever my i would argue with my mother (she was the one with whom i had any sort of emotional connection if i had any with anyone of my family) she would say somethings which would really hurt my child self, this was from 8 - 15 yo, after every arguements i was always left crying alone for hours and no one would check up on me or even comfort me a bit. After i was done crying i would myself go to her and comfort her. During every arguments she'd compare me with my father who was a little bit abusive long time ago when they were married. After every argument with her i'd go and comfort her with whatever i could, i'd apologise constantly, now when i look back i remember no hurtful words or anything that a 11 or 12 year old can say that would hurt a grown ass woman, but yet i would always be the one to apologise to this grown woman who'd said uncountable hurtful stuff to me and left me crying for hours. Idk if a child crying because of a grown person's actions is important or a grown ass person's ego is more valuable that the child had to constantly apologise for literally nothing. I had to literally apologise for talking back, or pointing a finger at them or something, these are some of the reasons i had to apologise for. But the point is throughout my childhood no one ever provided me with any sort of comfort, i'd have day where i cry for hours thinking overthinking on the sofa then go and eat dinner with them with all of us acting as if nothing happened. Forgive me my thoughts are very scattered and it's really hard to point out at one thing without referring to another, but what i wanna say is when i was a child i would cry a lot at everything and no one would bat an eye, they'd just leave me as i was and go their ways, and after i was done crying i'd go to them and apologise for literally nothing so that they'd talk to me (my parents would stop talking to me after every argument) a 13 year old would always apologise after crying for hours alone to his parents so that his parents stop ignoring him. One thing led to another and i started feeling sad at very minor things for no reason at all. I was also compared a lot with other kids in the family and how i was a disgrace (a 13 year old was a disgrace) to the family all the time and everyone was better than me, this led me to believe that everyone around me was always better than me and i would always question my worth and undervalue myself, but since i've grown a bit distant from my parents i have gathered a bit confidence and i kinda value what i do and what i love to do still that's a very tiny amount of time compared to all the time i spend doubting myself. I always listen to my parents talking bad about me to some other relatives and how i've hurt them, but i don't understand how could a child of merely 13 or 14 hurt some grown adults so much, they don't even think about the times i used to cry alone, i dunno what they were expecting from a 14 yo, was i supposed to somehow magically take all their pain away? What do they blame me for? What was i supposed to do? i was just merely a child who was just learning about the world from everything around him. Again i had so much to say since i started writing this but eveything is so scattered i cannot recall much now. This has led me to overthink tremendously, i dont know if thats actually overthinking or just normal  idk. I had a girl have a crush one me a couple of years back and i promised myself i'd never let her feel lonely or unloved or undervalued or any such stuff, all this and somewhere deep i had also expected some emotional comfort from her since i never had experienced any. But my vulnerability and me opening up so easily due to my past scared her and made her go away. She's by no means any bad, she's the most wonderful woman ever but i wish i wasn't so scarred to scare her away. I would always tell her i loved her whenever i felt like she was upset, i'd never make her feel jealous, i'd always reassure her and be there for her just how i wish someone would do for me, but this is where the classic story begins, she falls out of love and leaves, this makes me even more lonely and miserable makes me feel like i have to deal with all these thoughts and sadness and tears all alone and not one of my loved one would be there for me when i'm crying my eyes out.  I try not to think a lot because whenever i do i start crying out of nowhere. There was one time where i held her and had cried while hugging her, it felt unreal, but she wasn't ready for it and i pushed her away. I will never open up to anyone or cry in front of someone ever again, i will carry on like this as long as i can and i will do my best to make my loved ones feel loved and cared for.   


Also sometimes i feel like all these things that i think have nothing to do with my lonliness and my lonliness is somewhat fake maybe. 

I could have written a lot more, but i cannot gather my thoughts.

Talking about stuff like this might be the hardest thing a person can ever think about doing, especially when it makes you feel like less. But It's gotten so bad for me now personally that I feel forced to talk about it. Just because it might give me a little shred of relief, a small ramble of my issues.

I've felt stuck and hopless before but not as bad as I do right now, when I was younger I was unfortunate during my childhood having to go through a lot of death and grief. I didn't know it right away but as the years went on it constantly effected me In new ways. First it was lack of sleep from the nightmares then it was wanting to be alone, self blame, guilt, anger. I avoided everyone bit by bit hated and even feared the idea of making a single friend even now all these years onward. 

I tried my best to keep most of it to myself, I'd slip up sometimes but for the most part didn't say much and gradually I'd say less and less until most days it was just sounds I'd make im response. Obviously family noticed and hated it they did alot thinking it was helping me but it just made me alot worse. I understand later that I wasn't okay but rejected the idea of being anxious and sad/depressed. I hated the idea of accepting that my heart beating fast I crowed areas or my chest feeling so tight that I couldn't stay on my feet was all because of the fact that I have might have ptsd.

Eventually that rejection got so much worse for me. I dropped out of college on my second year, hid myself away for a long time. And then tried to work to be useful somehow. That ended horribly for me, i got a nightshift job and my local petrol station literally up the road from me. And one night I was all alone barely more than 2 or 3 people came that night but I felt light In my head, couldn't breath and panicked myself into calling my parents and they called an ambulance. I'd apparently had what they thought was a panic attack since the ecg machine didn't show an issue. 

After that It just me more affarid to even try anything like that again. Until I tried working with my dad, that ended the same way roughly. Breaking down under any kind of pressure or even the thought of someone relying on me for any single thing. 

Now I barely even go outside, I don't eat and if I do I feel sick pretty soon after trying. My sleep is worse than ever before. I recently built up the courage to get a blood test after feeling weak in my left side and learned it was deficient in folic acid. Considering I don't let anyone touch me, I cut my own hair sometimes. I don't look after myself at all now truth be told. I've missed out on alot of parts that add to everything but i feel like a prisoner in the life that I'm barely living in, not in control of anything. I'm trying to get some kind of help for the first time since it all started but its so hard and I am very weak.",lonely,A small ramble,2021-11-01 23:37:25

5626,Gasian_FEH,1635768801,1,"In high school I never had many friends, but there’s this one girl on my swim team that we just vibed. We both were social outcasts, we loved to talk with people we grew close to, and just related with one another. Eventually we decided to date, and I remember when she leaned against me in that movie theater I thought I nailed it. 

But back then I had a terrible bad horny addiction and I wasn’t sure if I was ready for her. I didn’t tell her this. I was conflicted with my sexual awakening and I was terrified of making the wrong decision. That and school made it difficult for us to meet. I liked our wholesome best friend relationship, and we ended it on good terms. I thought it was the right choice. 

But then the years started to pass and I realized how much I truly loved her. I wanted to do good for her. I wanted her to be happy. So when she left for college leaving me, a year younger behind, I realized how much I missed her. I didn’t think I’d feel this way but I did. I kept texting with her on small talk but she eventually cut it short. One day she told me she didn’t have the capacity or the energy to uphold this relationship. She explained that she still wishes the best for me but didn’t want to explain any longer. I thought I respected her the best I can, so I don’t think I did something wrong. As much as I wanted not to, I respected her wishes to break. But then she blocked me, and I couldn’t help but feel like wanting to say everything I loved about her. But now she was gone, and I never said goodbye :(. 

In college I made so many new friends and am happy beyond belief, having the freedom I always wanted. But then I fell in love within a trio of my friend group. I liked her as a friend but knew she spent a lot of time with the other guy friend in our group. So I waited, observing what she was like, to confirm my own feelings while at the same time observing their dynamic with each other. One time I treated her to dinner. I realized how much I was thinking of her and wanting to be with her that it distracted me from classes. I also gave her tons of hints to see how she responded, whether she liked me back. I made her laugh so much. I was almost sure of myself to ask.

This evening, they told me they decided to date.

I was happy for them, naturally. I loved them both and I saw it a mile away (I jokingly shipped them at times). I saw how she stroked his hair and shared lap pillows (this was more recent). I laughed and congratulated them, teasing them. I left their room with a smile, knowing how happy they were together.

A few yards from my dorm room, I lean on the wall and sigh.

It felt devastating. 

The other night at a party I saw a couple on a roof kiss. I cringed, but couldn’t help but feel jealous. I wanted that. And where people were dating left and right in my freshman class, I thought I had a shot only to have someone else beat me by a hair.

We were doing this play where my character has a romantic-ish scene with a girl in the play. So we go to act it out and on Friday after school, I start feeling like I’m missing something. Like there is a hole in my life but I wasn’t sure what could fill it. I at first thought it was my enjoyment for my drama class and the fact that post-secondary won’t ever be about having fun with classmates. That it would be about lectures, 3 hours of homework daily, bs like that. But then I really started thinking about it. And then I kept looping the thought of the romance scene in the play. And I thought I felt feelings for the girl playing the character who my character loves. But I know that’s wrong because she has a girlfriend and I have enough emotional control to respect others relationships. Then, I got it. The reason I feel this hole isn’t because of the girl, but because of the romantic scene I act in. The connection between the characters is something I want but don’t have. Like make pretend of something so close and real yet not even relevant in my life. That feeling of loving someone and being loved back is what I feel is missing. And now every time I see her it’s like a constant reminder of what I’m missing. Both from the play, and seeing how happy she is everyday being in a good relationship. It’s like playing a harmless game of pretend is pulling the strings that control the fate of my emotions.

The other day she asked me for help with a subject at the university (we studies the same career but she is a year behind) and I went because between being alone without doing anything and doing something, the latter was better.

The point, she had invited her classmates so I also explained them. Obviously, once we finished studying she and her friends told me ""They were going to write to me to chat and catch up"". I did not answer. I didn't know what to say, ""no you won't""?. 

This trivial situation is repeated with almost all the people I met. ""I really liked you! We are going to talk to organize something"". Nope, you know you're not going to do it and so do I.

I didn't met anyone who keep that promise, no one writes back, no one ever talk to you unless they need something. Everyone forgets about you.

5662,Subject_Brother_1396,1635747553,1,"I feel like I'm okay with being lonely until im not. 

I was always the kind of guy that enjoyed his time playing games and being competitive. I always chose games with my friends over going out. I never really was a party goer.

Fast foward to my first time seeking independence by enlisting in the military. I have made great friends and experiences so far. I enjoy hanging out with genuine people and just vibing. 

And here we are in the present.. all my friends have started families and are busy. I stopped going out because of anxiety and my insecurity of my body. I had gained about 30 lbs since I moved into my apartment where I know see it as my safehaven and prison.  I was always the guy that would cancel out on any type of event a friend would invite me to. I just never really felt comfortable in large groups where people tend to change their persona to impress others. My communication with my friends have waned and had gotten tired of me declining requests. I would always leave in the middle of it and stay home where I would feel comfortable, in which i do not blame them at all. 

Its strange typing all this and not seeing any problems with how I could be lonley. All i have done is go to work early and play games after. My social life is now non existant, I only really go out for work, gym, and groceries.

My life this past year has just been me dealing with my problems alone. I lost my close friendships and i am now just acquainted with people. Social media is a drag because of how everyone is doing all these fun things that I wish i could go to but not give the enerygy to make the effort to go. 

One of the main reasons I would go out, would be to only talk to woman and potentially find love (corny and pathetic af). I am not a player by any means, all I do is get ghosted because I don't bother to impress them and be myself. I honestly just want to settle down and just keep my circle small.. even tho it is small enough already. I just want to connect with someone who has the same hobbies as me. 

I am currently 23/M and hate the current dating culture. It is probably because it does not benefit me at all. I want love but can't find it because everyone is fucking everyone. I am not a six foot tall monster man. I dont like the same things that most people in my area like. Now that i think about it I have been in this area for four years and I have not met anyone that watches anime or plays video games as much as me. How tf am I supposed to connect with people when I have nothing to relate to? Its way to difficult without having to fake my whole personality, in which  i could never do.

I want to connect but I am picky with who I want to connect with? I am just tired of being alone every night. I am scared that I will never have anyone that will love me for me. I hate people attract other peoples attention even though I am not even doing anything to gain it. I want to immerse in deep conversation. I want to be able to love again (not telling this story). There has just been an emptiness in my chest for a long time.  I have dealt with it by convincing myself I am not in a bad spot in life. I am just anxious with the way my life is moving. Its been the same as it was two years ago, an introverted extrovert experience.

5673,Dirty_Mike97,1635743715,1,"Well it's going to be hard to explain in words but I'm 24, a virgin, and isolated from the world. By isolated I mean I'm on an island with not too many people my age to hang out with. I don't have many friends aside from my coworkers who are roughly in their 40's here while my real friends are now out in the world and across wherever they ended up. 

I'm a bit scared to be honest, I'm hardcore into my career and not really having fun, and by fun I mean to go out and enjoy life. In college I studied my ass off to make sure I graduated on time and with a degree. I honestly don't remember the last time I actuallt had fun. I became the man of the house (before I came onto the island) around 13 and nonstop worked since. I'm on my own now and the loneliness does hit hard sometimes and other times it hits harder to where sometimes I cry myself to sleep. I didn't have a father and a tough mother growing up so I had to learn everything on my own and it's hard sometimes to allow someone else to teach me, I've been better at it but it still is a struggle. The fact that I haven't learned at all to talk to women, handle a relationship of any sort or intimacy's aside from watching pornography makes me feel ashamed. 

I truly wonder sometimes if I'm going to die alone. I know someone my age shouldn't think like that because love might be around the corner but it's getting to the point where I'm starting not to believe it exists. I have gone to bars and meet people, I love socializing but it stings me so hard to talk to anyone when I'm alone that I just have a drink and walk out. It's a teethpulling feeling to walk up to someone and to talk to them. Every conversation starter I tried on online dating has never worked. That's another thing which brings me down a lot more too is that I barely get any matches online, even with my distance really increased. Most of my matches are just bots and the ones I have matched never responded sadly. (I'm on bumble, hinge, okcupid, tinder, hot or not, badoo). That further adds to me thinking that there will truly be no one there for me.

I feel like I'm suffering, I can't compare to someone who has some kind of life-threatening illness or someone who is fighting in a war but I don't know how else to put it. I'm hard on myself for it and I built up a shell of just avoidance at this point because of the amount of years I've been through this. I look back to the movie the 40 year old virgin and think ""that's going to be me"" except until the end. My brain and heart right now feel weird as I type this so I think that's my feelings speaking haha. I might be reaching a breaking point but I don't know. I put on a fake persona when I'm at work to make sure people don't think anything is wrong with me. 

I'm just afraid of how I might be in a year or more if this keeps up cause it's getting more painful for sure. Sometimes I'll just lay in bed and laugh at how pathetic I am.

Love is easy to get along with difficult, only constant change and adaptation, to love for a lifetime!Some people do not see each other for a while, they feel hopeless, do not want to contact, it is not a desirable way, if this is really the case, it is not called love, can only be called passion or impulse, love needs time to operate, distance knows horsepower, time shows people.

I have no friends, relationship, I don't talk to family for personal reasons. I work from home, no school, no socialization at all. 

It's really getting hard right now, I don't want to talk to anyone, I can't look at myself in the mirror, I just exist but the me I know is gone.  it's like I'm on auto pilot, and have been for years now. Everyone kept leaving so I eventually made it a priority to leave first or to disconnect. But now it's just so much worse, I woulda rather had the fake empty lies they gave me then nothing at all. 

Therapy never works for me, they just kinda diagnosed me with clinical depression, insomnia, and ADHD. I stopped going after seeing no result and just running in circles for months. It really just made my mental state really bad, and since I stopped going I think I may have developed an eating disorder (I literally just don't eat cuz In my head it's not worth it). 

Ive tried to talk, open up, reconnect with people and reality, I've tried working on myself, in the end I'm just completely lost and empty. But at the same time I get super emotional out of nowhere hearing certain phrases or watching a video about a kid and their dad, my father was never really there, he just lived there and pushed me away. Never made sense to me, I look around and see all these people without time still making time for their families. My entire situation with him was just bad, he had a ton of free time and just chose to use it on one of my sister's. (I'm the oldest of 5 biological kids.) And he only made time for the 2nd born. I had a pretty bad upbringing, alot of abuse and other stuff but I made it out.

Beyond that, I just never ""fit in"". I was a bit of a nerdy, carefree, old-school alt kid. I never got into a serious relationship, most of my friends disconnected a few years back, only 4 stuck around, unfortunately one died in a skateboard accident out of nowhere a few weeks ago, 2 committed suicide last year, and my closest friend just moved to the opposite side of the US and we barely talk now cuz she's a college student. 

I ended up getting overwhelmed and dropping out of highschool for alot of personal reasons I'm not ready to share. But I never stopped learning, I still study all the stuff I was previously interested in and some of it even took off like crazy, allowing me to build a living off of it. 

Im just at this place now where I can't socialize, it just feels like a chore. But I can't do this alone anymore either. I have no way to connect with people, and honestly I don't think I'm mentally prepared to.  I don't know what I'm looking for, I just know somewhere something got lost.

One says she wants to hang out with me but never bothered to set up plans or ask if I could get a ride arranged for us. They're liars.

So I did actually get together for the 1st time in at least two years with a group of people who I've known since high school. One actually mentioned that my birthday was the next weekend. Told them yeah and I was wondering if they wanted to meet up at a bar that does karaoke that night. Got all the answers of Sure! That'll be fun! I'll be there! That evening and through a group message. 

So I get some bad news the day prior, my folks have to go out of state to help my grandmother get into hospice care, since she has alzheimers, pretty bad. So I don't tell aby of them that, don't want the fake sympathy and make someone feel like they have to pity me.

So my birthday comes, don't hear anything from these 5 people, I post in the group message what time I was planning on going, like 8 pm, not super late but not really early. I get two responses, one is they are studying for class and will try while the other I get at 9 pm is that they are going out to dinner...

Fine, fuck em, maybe the others will come out... nope complete ghost. Bartender and a couple of other people ask me what's going on and I tell them I'm waiting on some friends to join me for a birthday drink at least. So I start drinking more than beer, stronger drinks. 10 pm, 11 pm, midnight, just sitting there feeling more and more upset but too damn embarrassed to say anything so I pay my tab, get up and leave. Fuck it, maybe something happened.

Next day comes round, that evening the group messages pop up.. Hey guys let's get together and go do blank and blank.. lots of replies yeah I didn't do anything this weekend let's do it.. 

So I went dark, didn't say shit, I'm mad and really hurt. This group of people have always come to me to vent or for advice about their failed relationships, even though I've been divorced for 8 years and only have had maybe two decent failed relationships since. So I'm the sounding board, but that's it.. really fucking burned.

And I've had some bad birthdays, my 21st was the day my unit landed in Kuwait for the Iraq War, and others I was in the field for training, or deployed so it's not the worst, but damn it sure felt like it.

I've received maybe 3 texts for the following group meet up, I haven't said a damn word to any of them, now they ask what's wrong and hope you're OK, I'm angry and deeply hurt but I don't want to say a damn thing, I just want to be left alone, but I hate the loneliness that has crept in so bad.

But nobody ever warns you of the consequences that comes with being nice. I'm the shoulder to cry on, the ear that never turns away, the gift that never stops giving. I always thought it to be decent and polite to be there for people, even the ones that I hardly knew. And maybe it stems from the deep want to understand people. But anyways, my whole life I've been taken advantage of. Not in the sense that I'm easily fooled into doing actions like favors for others, but easily fooled into giving people my heart. Not until recently have I understood why most people enter and flee from my life so often. Most people notice the amount of love and emotion I have to spare, and once they have used me as a place to empty out their emotional baggage, they pack up and leave. And I noticed this when very manipulative and sociopathic people would spill their whole life stories and emotional traumas to me the first few times we hung out. One person got mad at me when I wouldn't want to talk about deep and personal topics. This person also admitted to seeing me as an opportunity to start over and feel good about themselves.

5713,ScrawnyButt,1635732651,1,"I am 28 years old. I only had one relationship in my entire life. It lasted 5 years and it’s been almost 4 since it ended. I used this time to put my shit together, focused on my career and myself. I would talk to guys too, but I was never interested in them romantically. Unlike them.

I would often think about this. Those were not bad guys, why didn’t I reciprocate? Is there something wrong with me?

Later, recently really, I’m finding out about asexuality. And I think this is me, I’ve always been that way.

But that’s a problem. First, I met guys who expected me to have sex with them almost immediately. Second, sex aside, I am not easily interested even romantically. I never feel anything. I feel… nothing.

I tried Tinder alright. I was avoiding this app for a long time. I always regarded it as an app for quickies or for desperate people. Look at me now.

So far, met two people. One of them was interesting to talk to, but, again, no feels, no emotions. Fucking how do I understand if I like someone? I have no clue!

It is especially difficult to me because I don’t like going out. I am very socially anxious. And even thinking about the number of people I have to go through to find that special one if they exist even makes me tired already.

I think it might have been easier to find someone if I went to office. But I don’t because pandemic and other inconvenient circumstances.

Now look at me: I am approaching my 30’s, I am introverted, asexual, and anxious. I will never find anyone. I am sure of it. And it sucks, because I kinda want to. I want to love. I want to feel. Maybe I want to have a kid even.

I want what other people have. And it seems like everyone has someone. How do they do that? I don’t understand. Genuinely.

And when my friends try to comfort me saying: oh you’ll find someone, you’re beautiful, keep searching, don’t give up, - it’s… I don’t know, it doesn’t help. Beautiful? So what? Beauty doesn’t guarantee you a relationship. That, or I’m simply not beautiful (which I’m not lol).
And I don’t want to look for anyone. I don’t. I always thought love should happen naturally. But I see that’s not the case for me.

Maybe I am just too lazy to try and look for someone? I am. Because it’s painful, tiring, and stressful.

Maybe I can’t get over my ex? Maybe. I still see him in my dreams. But I want to move on. He did. Fucking easily. Why can’t I?

Maybe there’s really something wrong with me? Well then I am really fucked. I don’t want to go to therapy. It sucks, I tried, and fucking never again.

So, yeah, it sucks to be single when you don’t want to. If you have it worse, I am very sorry.

I decided this past year to leave my comfort zone and just vibe. I decided to be my own best friend and take ME out and go to the events I want, alone. And it’s been epic. I’ve done it...

But, today it really hurt when I tried to message a couple people to see what they were up too for Halloween and was told they are busy...I felt this deep pang in my heart...and an overwhelming feeling of sadness washed over me...being lonely. So lonely.

Part of me wants to stay home and cry...and the other half wants to get dressed and find a random event to go to alone. 

I don’t want to miss out on living life because I lack the friends...but right now it really hurts because I’ve been  alone Wolf for awhile..

And since my school has a dorm and everyone lives there I hung out with them every day and I thought I\`d finally made friends. But now around 10 days into quarantine none of them have even messaged me... I haven\`t talked to anyone since I came home (except my mom and sister but they\`re never home).  I messaged them but no reply..

***(If you don\`t want to read this lil story it\`s just about one of the many of my experiences)***

The only text I\`ve gotten this whole time was from my roommate. It was a message asking me if I accidentally took one of her flip-flops since we have the same ones. Followed by a passive-aggressive ""Don\`t ruin it."" And after that- nothing. I think she\`s pushing me away again. 

She and her friends (who I thought were my friends too) pushed me away and full-on ignored me once before already. Even if we were in the same room. And I think that\`s happening again. 

She\`s the only person who I thought would actually stay my friend since we were so close. But well I guess she got bored with me too and is just casting me away like everyone else.

I remember making a roleplay server that I worked on by myself for 8 months. Rules, lore, managing timezones, 0 mods because I had no one I was close enough to trust them with the role. When the server was completed and open, I advertised it online and invited some rp associates from past rp groups. I wanted the server to be active as possible so the rules were to make a character with 7 days or it's a boot unless they ask for an extension. Out of the 21 people in only 8 people made their characters so I had to kick the rest. After two weeks the server died out despite constant ads of it posted. People stopped caring and I just removed the server. 8 months of hard work down the drain.

Then I made a guild on a game and invited in 15 people and it wasn't active so I had to remove it. When I see these groups and guilds with the owner/admins interacting with the community, doing events, and there's so much activity. All of these groups and guilds we're formed by a group of friends and they tell me how their friends invited there friends which caused a chain reaction of the growth of their community. These communities have been friends and family for 6 or even a whole decade. Everyone seems to like and gravitate towards them.

Meanwhile, I can barely keep one friend. With no connections on my own, it's hard to invite many people. Even if I do try to appear chill, welcoming, and active, I get ignored and treated poorly. Almost everyone knows I don't have many friends and a miserable life with or without telling them. And I can't help to feel it lowers my charm and how people are attracted to me (personality-wise). It's like they only bother associating with me out of pity.

Anyway rant over, happy Halloween, cheers being lonely in.",lonely,Having no connections makes it difficult to start you own groups which lowers your overall charm to people.,2021-11-01 10:16:24
5756,Fabulous-Advantage,1635721285,1,"22m.

I was watching some high school shows and it was reminding me of how most everyone I knew had their friends or did fun stuff or dated and I never had any of that. Even now, all the work I put in meeting people, how I even just tried to meet people outside and how they would all find an excuse to stop meeting me. It's like the world is telling me to stop. Stop, stop trying! I don't know what the next step is is it to go outside have my phone and be like 'yo I can't make friends here see I met this guy and now he doesn't want to meet, what's going on' And they'll be like 'bro, you got to love yourself, you can't go looking for people'. Love myself I have no clue what this means. Love myself, ok I won't go out then, then I won't meet people. I won't try then. I have no clue. 

Then I convinced myself that it was a preference, that I can't 'have it all'. Like man, you work out, run, volunteer, tutor, work, give to people you can't have everything. You're smart, friendly, disciplined, hardworking, you just drew the short card with having friends. But then I thought of the people that did everything I did and still had their friends and I couldn't handle it anymore. 

I had my finger on childhood trauma for a while. Those books describe how I felt, about being alone of not feeling worthy because of emotional trauma. It made sense, I had no idea of the world of relationships because I never knew what is ""right"" in feeling worthy. I've been through enough therapy that didn't help (with the core feelings, the surface level it did help) and now I'm waiting to start again and I feel hopeless when I think of working on it, feeling like no one can help me. 

I can easily survive but I didn't know I was supposed to live with these painful feelings watching other people in groups wondering why I couldn't have that. Of never having friends to do things with. Of sometimes being overwhelmed by sadness/anger/frustration when I'm alone and thinking of how everyone isn't. Wondering why I can't meet anyone or want to, when they keep on saying they can't meet.",lonely,Can't describe how lonely I feel,2021-11-01 10:01:25

So I know.....or I SHOULD know that I'm not that ugly, that repulsive, that shoddy, that annoying, that stinky, that fat.....I do know I'm no prince charming and I'm far from what most girls probably think of as handsome or a stud. I'm pretty inteligent and I know I can be a good conversation partner. In fact, it's one of the few things I still see as my strong point. I know I'm good at talking. If there's anything I'm good at, it's that.  


On some level, I do know all that. But lately...or rather, for the last couple of years.......for the last 3-4 years, let's say...I get these intense bouts of depression, anxiety sometimes bordering with panic that I'm simply a failure as a man. And I can't for the love of god imagine a woman would fall for me or find me attractive or would even want to hug me or be physically close to me. It's a very lonely feeling. It never remains this intense for more then a few hours, maybe up to 5-8 hours when it's really bad or 1-3 hours on better days. But even on the best days when I'm functioning just fine, it's curled up inside of me like a snake or a worm just waiting for me to come closer so that it can devour me.  


And when it does hit me, I pull away from everybody keeping the communication on the bare minimum needed to work and function and fulfill my daily duties. And lately I think it's been getting worse. You see, it's not nearly enough to say I feel unattractive. I feel like a heap of slime, something like Jabba from Star Wars or worse. And it usually gets worse when I actively try to work on my looks. So there are times I just don't look at myself in the mirror because I'm just too afraid of what I'm going to see.  


I know that positive affirmations, hugs and other actions by women that directly contradict this image of myself may help a lot depending on how believable or authentic I find them at the moment. But here's the thing. I can't ask for that from anyone, I can't expect anyone to do that for me even if I...ESPECIALLY if I ask for it. It doesn't feel right, it feels like whining and I don't want to do that, I don't even have much good experience when I try to do that, I usually meet with apathy or outright rejection, if nothing else, then simply by the virtue of the fact that most of my friends are introverts like me. And those who aren't I'm not close enough with to ask for something like that.  


So I usually make do with audio recordings, ASMR, roleplays, stuff like that. So I do have some solution. So why the heck did I write this in the first place?  


Well, I guess I just needed to vent. Because I have nobody to talk to about this, really. And lately, probably because of the pandemic, the feeling of isolation and the sheer impossibility of a woman ever looking at me as a potential partner....has been getting to me much more than ever before, I think. So I don't want to be dramatic, but....yeah. God I already feel like I'm whining again. That's not good, so I'll just stop right there. If anyone has read this far, thank you for your time and patience and if you have anything to say, leave me a comment or a PM. It would be much appreciated.",lonely,I don't think I deserve to be seen as attractive or loved by any member of the opposite sex,2021-11-01 09:54:18
5758,BrutallyHonestLoner,1635720592,1,"Earlier this year I met a girl on here and we really clicked. We would talk for hours every night in voice chat, we would watch stupid video together, sometimes she would watch me play a video game while I made stupid jokes about stuff. I loved the way she smiled/laughed. 

As time went on we flirted more and got a little sexual.Ive always had a lot of guilt about sexual stuff but with her it wasn't nearly as bad. i loved how she wanted me to look at her and how she wanted to do that stuff with me. She was pretty and I loved the way we could simply lay there talking to each other on discord while doing stuff. she made me feel comfortable and safe. 

However then things went bad. I started having some health problems and one of her pets died. The result was I wasn't able to chat very often and she was mourning and just kinda receeded into herself. By the time I had gotten better enough to talk again she didn't want to be whatever it was we had been anymore. We tried to remain friends but we both faded away.

5763,kevbo_25,1635719723,1,"TW: sex and possible sex abuse (trying not to delve into it too much but I also like to give fair warning. Also, sex in general has been fairly triggering to me lately, at least given what I bring up in here.)

I left a relationship almost a year ago now. I was doing well living on my own but it's starting to get to me. The relationship was very sexual and towards the end I just felt like that's all my partner cared about. I'm 30 and looking for something more meaningful.

I love sex as much as the next person but like when there's nothing else with it, it doesn't do it for me. And even worse, in the past month, I've had 3 separate friends either physically come onto me or in one instance, a long distance friend tell me that she ""would fuck me"" and is trying to have a fwb thing with me. So like that's fine and all... Except that's all these 3 have wanted from me in an intimate way and it's irritating because at least 2 of them knew that sex was an issue in my last relationship beforehand...

During a drunken night with one of my longtime friends, she kissed me and like... It was a really sensual night. It felt like more, and we didn't even actually have sex that time but like, when we talked about it later they did not want to pursue anything, even though it was an incredibly intimate encounter. And now that they know I would like to pursue something more... Anytime I try to be nice, even in a purely friendly way they read into it as me trying to date them. None of these 3 want anything more than a FWB situation or some don't even want that and that's fine but now I just feel I'm pushing away people. And it was like 3 friends in a row close together and now I'm almost afraid to spend time with any of my other friends because I'm afraid it's just gonna keep happening...

Idk why they're just coming out of the woodwork now and trying to fuck me but it honestly hurts that that's the extent of what they want. My ex from the last relationship was all about sex and I kinda just started to feel like a human dildo and not like in a good way and I'm over it. I don't need my friends to make me feel that way too. 

I have like 3 people that I enjoy hanging out with that I feel like I can trust not to do that and only one of them lives anywhere near me right now and it sucks. We both work all the time so it's hard to even get together with that one. I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm tired of meaningless sex. 

On top of it all, I'm going through a bit of some gender identity issues, that not everyone knows about so I don't blame them for that, but the whole sex thing just makes it that much worse. And along with that, the last thing I need is to push people away but it's just starting to freak me out a little.

I suppose I shouldn't complain too much about where I am and I must start this post by admitting that I'm sure plenty on here have it worse than me. I have a good job in London, own my own flat in a nice area (albeit I must add with the help of parents so don't take that as any sort of a brag rather than an admission of good fortune) and even have a solid sex life (albeit owed entirely to online dating apps) having been with eight different women this calendar year. I go to the gym and I'm in good shape, I play football regularly and can enjoy a beer after the game with teammates, but my social life in terms of real, true friendships is really very poor at the moment.  


I mean what can I say, its dreadful and its like I barely have real friends.   


I essentially have (or should I say 'had') a primary group of friends mainly from university. Our Whatsapp group comprises eight of us including myself. One of us has gone off to New Zealand. Another has drifted away from the group as a result of being in a high-powered career and now has a fiance, three more have wives/gfs and that leaves me and one other single guy who's a very shy and humble chap and quite introverted at the best of times (but a good loyal friend). No-one lives locally to me either (although all are in the London area barring the guy in NZ).   


I have independent friends. Here and there. Men and women I can text and talk to and who'll often very sweetly take the time to respond and reply. I went with one friend of mine to see some stand-up comedy last night for instance and he's always very pleasant company and a lovely kind man.   


Trouble is I just don't have a 'group', a 'crew' a 'squad' or whatever you want to call it. I mean they still exist but we meet up probably about 3 or 4 times a year these days. Everyone's on good terms we just seem to drift further and further apart.   


My birthday in August was extremely painful as only one of my 'independent' friends came along as well as the shy introverted (but very nice) chap I mentioned. They have nothing to do with each other whatsoever and it just felt forced and embarrassing. We went to the Casino for the evening.  


At work on work socials and nights out I can chat and talk with the best of them. I'm an extroverted person and can hold court in a group decently well. I don't think anyone who met me would necessarily 'nail' me as the kind of guy facing social bankruptcy that I am, but that's honestly the situation. ""Making friends"" is nigh-on impossible these days as people have their groups of friends well-established and whilst I very rarely get invited to places by some independent friends I'm very much a tag-along even if a reasonably welcome one.   


I don't know. I guess I just didn't put in the required effort earlier in life to make friends and it's really come back to haunt me.   


Its just torture. Seeing all those people out and about in their Halloween costumes having the time of their lives and going to bars and pubs in the area of South London in which I live. In Summer seeing groups of 10-20 people on Clapham Common having picnics and drinks and so on whilst my friends are totally scattered.  


I mean I have friends. None of these people are people I've fallen out with. They've just drifted away. Everyone else seems to effortlessly link up at weekends for drinks and hangouts and urgh - it just sucks.",lonely,"Goodness me this is tough - 31yo M London, UK",2021-11-01 09:11:13

I was with my ex-boyfriend of 5 years. We broke up at the start of August. It was sort of mutual, but also sort of he broke up with me, but also I wanted us to at least live separately.

And everyone is posting on social media about all the great times they're having. and it's just reinforcing how absolutely alone I've felt since we broke up.

And I know technically I'm not alone - I have friends, I have family. But none of those friends I feel like I can talk to the way my ex and I used to talk. And my family... Are borderline emotionally neglectful.

I have nothing to do and no one to talk to for a week. I know that I'll never be as important to her as she is for me since she has tons of friends and a family that cares for her, while I have no other friends and an abusive family. and I'm scared of becoming to clingy and toxic, so i don't want to bother her in the meantime.

5798,ForsakenVioAll,1635710955,1,"It's been a hard life and I'm at a point where I've tried everything and it snot working.  I used to try and live for my 18th birthday where I could move out of the depression hole legally called a home, but not actually one for me. In that point I've ever had a home. Never had a family. Always people abandoning me and leaving me to deal eith the shit I deal with on a daily. I act normal and fine like everybody else in public because I don't want to stand out. I can hardly look in a pretty girls direction and I recoil anf retreat if one even looms my way. Some things are prettier at a distance and I've accepted the fact I'll never find love. This is going to be a rant so I won't bother with grammar or anything.  
I'm an Asian male, depressed, stressed, and done with every in life. I've been raised in America since I was a toddler and my mother basically raised me and my 5 siblings alone. 3 a year younger and 1 is 3 years older, biological. Growing up life was terrible and I got in trouble for pretty much anything and everything.  Sometimes I deserved it because I did steal and lie but ultimately I wad a kid who was born into a life with worms, malnutrition, and poor conditions. Fast forward through my life and I've been detained in Juvie, arrested and hated by cops, assaulted, bullied, and hurt by strangers. I've been put down, hurt, wrestled, and made to feel like I'm nothing but absolute shit on yhe ground, sadly by my own mother. I never had friends as I could never hold them down or communicate,  chat, or relate to anyone due to my circumstances, something that threw me into deeper and deeper waters for depression and mental illness. Doctors  psychiatrists, psychologist, pastors and anyone in between have all just found ways to pin the blame and issues in my life on my back alone something that tears apart the tiniest bit of self love and confidence I may have for myself.  I have questioned all the time the meaning of life and my purpose, have thought and tried a few times to off myself without having to endure anymore pain. I've lost people I've gotten attached to way too easily anf had my heart broken over and over that at this point I'm so dman sick and tired of people. All girls are the same is what juice wrld said right? ""We ain't making it past 21."" Well I'm nearing my 21st and I'm honestly sick and tired of everything.  Everyday I wake from nightmares from my past alone, depressed, tired, unmotivated, lovesick still, heartbroken, and suicidal that I can't hold myself up anymore as the bulls start to rise.

So I guess that leads me to this. I just need someone, anyone to know my story and carry it with them in spirit.  So that I can still be a part of someone somewhere, somehow, and help to be a purpose. To help be a lesson to someone.",lonely,Need someone,2021-11-01 07:09:15

The friends I have locally aren’t close friends - more like acquaintances more than anything. Even the friends I have seem to have other people in their life…they always seem to have someone else to text, someone else to hang out with.

I don’t get texts from anyone than my significant other and my mom. I don’t feel close to my siblings. My father lives far away so I hardly see him. I feel as though most of my interaction comes from my partner and although I’m grateful for that…I still feel so alone. I feel like a loser. 

I keep coming to the conclusion something is wrong with me. i wish i someone thought of me randomly and would text me about it. I wish people tagged me in memes. I wish I had a friend that understood me in the ways that I’ve always wanted.

The friends I do have and care about I’ve tried to reach out, keep up a consistent relationship and it’s literally always one sided. When no one puts in the effort, you stop putting it in too and those relationships fade away. Basically, if I’m not the one to initiate convo or check in, I don’t hear anything. Sometimes I don’t even get a response. 

I don’t know what to do. Idk if it’s bc I’m introverted or what. I just feel empty every day. I hate seeing an empty notification screen. I hate finding out about things second hand through social media rather than being told about it personally. I’m nobodies go to friend. It hurts me so much.

I was living with him after I had gotten out of the most toxic relationship I’d ever been in, and I had lost a lot of myself a long the way and a lot of friendships.
We got into an argument while I was trying to defend an acquaintance of ours from him (verbally) and he told me it wasn’t my place to say anything and that he wanted me out. Later I found out via text that meant out of his life.
So a month passes while I’m trapped in my room medicating. I barely ate, barely went outside or to the disc golf course (where I had spent most of my time along side C) and I reluctantly try communicating with other disc golf friends (basically my only other friend group) and come to find out C had basically “gotten there first” so to speak, which meant for me that I wasn’t going to be spending time with them anymore.
Fast forward 1 year and I’m a depressed zombie living in my moms basement. Every day I scroll social media and see my old friends posting together about Halloween or going discing… and here I am in the dark just watching it all through a screen.
I haven’t been disc golfing in almost 2 months… something I once considered a serious hobby if not potentially a career choice has lost all of its color, it’s flavor. 
And every day I wake up is the same lonely day as the day before.

Do I need to go missing in order for you to care? Would my death make you fucking care? Why don’t you even look at me during conversations? Why did you make a separate chat without me?

5856,Araknhak,1635691514,1,"I am diagnosed with ADHD combined type. This year my gf introduced me to The Beatles and I have been completely hooked ever since. I knew the band before her, of course, but I hadn’t really delved into their music too much. Now I listen to them pretty much every day and I’ve gone through many albums like mad. A month ago or something, I got an idea, it started as a joke which quickly grew into reality. Realizing my favourite Beatle Ringo Starr didn’t have a proper sub, and with a little help from my friend Vyvanse 30mg, I decided to create one in his honour: r/RingoStarr.

Ever since, I have poured hours and days into the community to develop it and make it grow. I have developed proper rules, advertised a lot, worked on the aesthetics, created lots of content and I am currently working on a ranking system. I have even spent hours programming the automoderator to do several different things, many of them hidden from the members as a surprise to be triggered. Needless to say, I have become COMPLETELY OBSESSED with the sub. For me personally, I would say that the goal of it all is simply to make it grow to match the size of the other Beatle member’s subs, as well as keeping the members engaged and active.

Thanks for reading this stupid obsession of mine, and if you’re also a fan of Ringo or The Beatles, make sure to join us on r/RingoStarr. Anyone is welcome, no matter your background!

I have never been like this before, I have always been a pretty happy person tell about a year ago exactly. 

for some clarification, I asked this girl out that I had had a crush on for probably more than a year, I started to hang out with her probably around august then school started. I had really started liking her when me and my family went to Italy and we saw them there(her parents and my parents wear friends at that time) and I saw her and I felt like I was going to spend the rest of my life with her I know that is cringe but I guess that's what I felt like. then I started to hang out with her all the time like we probably didn't go one day without talking to each other, and to be honest, that was probably one of my favorite times that I have ever had. she become my best friend so then probably around the first of October she asked me if I had a crush on her then I said yes and I asked her out, she said that she also liked me, so I tried to come up with something we could do together and everything I suggested she said no to so then I say how about we just hang out at yours or my house and she agreed to that and I was happy but then I asked her what day she wanted to hang out and she then said to me that she just wasn't ready for a boyfriend and that she thought she liked me so I just kinda broke down for like a week because she was the first person that I had ever really liked. then a couple of weeks later I found out from her friend that she never liked me and she just didn't want me to feel bad. then I got pissed at her about it and I completely stopped talking to her. after I found that out like a week later we went into our second lockdown for covid so I basically didn't have any contact with anyone for probably 4 or 5 months then when I come back to school everyone hates me because she told everyone that I touched her improperly and I can't even do anything about it because what am I going to say she is a female and a am a male no one believes me and the people that I tried to defend myself they just said: ""yeah sure"" or ""definitely believe you"" and I tried to move schools but my parents won't let me because I have a good support system at the school I am at now ( i am dyslexic so I need shit I guess) so now I talk to almost no one and I am just lonely.

I live on Social Security only, own a house (not sure for how much longer) and don't have a car. So out of loneliness I started looking at the dating apps, big mistake. They were all about money, money, money. I couldn't get off fast enough. After looking some more I thought I found one with a woman that was legit. Long story short, after months of back and forth chat and phone calls I did her a ""favor"", that favor ended up costing me over $7,500. Which I don't have but are making monthly payments on.
So now, can I even trust a woman that says she wants to be my friend? But being alone day after day takes its toll on you. I find myself going to bed earlier just to fall asleep and remove the loneliness. Netflix and Reddit are two of my only distractions.
I want a woman in my age group and we share some common interests. I miss being next to a woman, the hand squeeze when holding hands. Making each other laugh, having a meal together. Just someone that wants to spend time with me and I look forward to spending time with also.
