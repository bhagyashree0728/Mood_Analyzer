12,truethrowaway42,1635674617,1,"I hate my sexuality.

Im asexual and heteromantic. Basically, I want a romantic relationship with a man. But I do not want to have sex. I don’t want to exchange nudes or look at each other naked. But I want to get married, have kids (that’s the only time we’d have sex). I want to have a best friend whom I live with and we watch movies and cuddle on the couch and sometimes kiss. I want a child’s idea of a marriage. And it doesn’t exist. 

Im in college. Every time I talk to my mom she asks me when I’m getting a boyfriend. After all, she met my dad at college. I should too, since it’s the best place to meet someone with good prospects and all. I don’t know how to tell her I’ve tried. And I do get them. But it always goes wrong and always because I don’t want to have sex. 

It goes one of a few ways. Sometimes they just go “hey that’s not for me, nice knowing you though.”. Sometimes they say, “Cool, I’m waiting until marriage too!” But then they still want to dirty talk and I’m not just waiting until marriage. Plus, this type tends to be super religious and I’m not. The worst part though, is the ones who pretend. The ones who say “That’s fine! I still want to be with you”. And you date them for a little while and you’re happy. They put up with it because the appearance of a girlfriend is worth it to them. Then they leave you when they find someone who will put out eventually. 

You may think I’m just bitter after a breakup with one of the last type. I’m not. It’s been months since the last one. It’s happened so many times, over and over. I’m tired of waiting. Every other girl doesn’t deal with this. I hate it so much it’s beginning to make me hate myself. 

I feel selfish. I realize most people have needs— I actually do too, I just want to take care of it myself. But I don’t want polyamory or an open relationship, either. So really it’s my own fault. I can’t expect someone to give up their prospects for me. But I shouldn’t have to choose between getting cheated on and depriving my partner, right? 

I know asexual men exist. But apparently they don’t exist around me! I wish I was aromantic and didn’t want a relationship so badly. Or a lesbian or bi, cause in my experience queer women tend to be more accepting. But no, my options are straight men. 

I could try therapy, I guess. But I’ve tried so many different therapists, and all of them just tell me that asexuality isn’t a thing and that I should get my hormones checked. I have. They’re fine. It’s a valid sexuality. 

Whether true or not, I feel like I’m unlovable and I will be alone forever. I need to stop feeling this way. I have to. Im going insane.",lonely,I feel like I’m going to be alone forever,2021-10-31 21:03:37
13,Han0714,1635674246,1,So I’m honestly starting wonder- are people on here truly lonely ? I see a lot of complaints about it but no actions taking to understand the reason your lonely or claim to be. I have tried many times to befriend people and be there free ear to listen. I’m lonely. I rarely have time make friends due to my age and my career. I had to cut a lot people off to change and now I have nothing. Now I understand why so many people go back to their old habits or lifestyles. It what they know and feel comfortable in. Change is hard because what comes with change is loneliness and trying to understand who you are ? Your purpose to society ? I have lost many and sometimes I take a walk alone in woods and cried because I don’t know who I am anymore. It gets so lonely all I want is a friend.

18,ExperiencedJatt,1635672724,1,"I don’t know what to say… In high school, I had lots of friends but I wouldn’t say they were all good friends. I was basically cool with a bunch of groups including the ‘popular’ people but I guess I never fit in with anyone. Now when they all are still together and partying etc, they all seem to forgot I had ever existed. No invite, no messages just silence. They all seem to be moving forward and I am stuck in one place. The group I chose to hangout with after high school completely backfired on me and well don’t really wanna talk to me unless they need something. And I can't even go find new people to talk to, since all my classes are online, and I spend most my days studying my room. 

On the romance side, it have never had any luck. I completely flunked on the chances I had to finally ask my crush out from high school, and then completely lost touch with her. I don't know if she is the one, but there was 100% a connection. We would always talk, laugh and have a good time in our classes. I was pretty sure she liked me back, as I would catch staring at me sometimes or being worried about me. Just as we graduated, I cowarded out. For  2 years I spent just thinking about how things could be if I had the courage. I thought about how I would ask here out the next time I ever saw here even if just as a friend to go out for a coffee or something. Then when she appears out of no where, 2 years later on the same exact date I saw her last, I chickened out yet again. To be fair tho, her what seemed to be her mother was there with her and I didn't want to put her in a uncomfortable situation after ( Indian Parents can be strict lol). Now, almost everyday I think of what could have been. I can't even send her a simple DM or message cause she isn't on any social media. I've spent time looking but no luck. It's just hard to keep wanting her, waiting and waiting. Heck, I am probably gonna have a visit from her in my dreams after I am done writing this. 

And its not just that tho. I haven't had a real good crush like her in a long time ( I think she was the last time). First of all I used to be very shy around women. Like to a point where I couldn't even talk properly and would stutter. This was the same for any women who wasn't related to me. However, I think I am doing better on that part now. For me, I would generally getting better talking to a woman when I got more close to her. That's what happened with my crush I mentioned before. I think I have gotten better now talking casual talk with women now tho. I can keep a conversation up.  The problem is, there is no place or option for  me to meet women. My college classes are still online, and I don't know how to DM someone without embarrassing my self. 

I am thankful however. I am thankful for where I am. I finally starting liking my college choice. I am thankful for my family who show support all the time. I do have some good friends (&lt;10) but we don't hangout as much as we should. I am sort of religious, or at least involved in my community, but still liberal.  I don't drink myself, but I am not gonna stop anyone else from drinking as its their choice. I guess people just assume I am super religious when I am not. I can't even talk to my friends about girls because they start making fun of how I am ""super religious"" when I really am not.    

So that was my rant or me just venting. If you made it this far, Thank you! I don't do this often and don't know how if I am being honest. I don't want to change who I am, I want change people perspective of me. I want people to see that I am a closed off guy, I was just shy who made a wrong decision while choosing a group of ""close"" friends. Mistakes were made while writing as I didn't proofread.

47,OUOni,1635663644,1,"I’ve posted before about being the background friend, and my current situation has really just confirmed it. My roommate is breaking her lease and moving out, leaving me responsible for her half of the rent and other living expenses. I prepaid everything upfront with my federal grants as a grad student. With her moving out, and me being a full time student with little to no income, I’m facing eviction and homelessness. 

I’ve tried reaching out to talk to people to I go to for support, and it’s clear the subject has made them uncomfortable because all I get in return is “oh that sucks I’m sorry.” And then they just stop responding. I’ve spent the last two weeks trying to apply to everything I can find, finding food pantries, trying to negotiate bills, asking people I trust to take care of my pets when I get evicted. But it’s become so very painfully clear that help is just not coming. I am alone and I’ll very shortly be alone and homeless during December in the Midwest. 

I’m exhausted. I haven’t slept in days, I haven’t really eaten either. I’m trying to make anything my cats/dog could eat lasts as long as possible so at the very least they aren’t going hungry. I’m so fucking tired of keeping it all inside and putting on a fake ass smile when I really feel like I’m going to collapse at any moment.

My grades are dropping, I have lost the motivation to go to class anymore, and have been spending most of my days laying in bed, sometimes reading, sometimes just watching videos.

I am single, haven’t had a relationship for a few years. I don’t think I can go through another relationship, as I don’t think I’m emotionally available. Thinking about situations like being cheated on or going through something like that deters me from actively seeking someone. I have no idea what I would do if something like that were no happen.

I do have friends who I play games with on discord, and sometimes dnd, but I never really talk to them about what’s going on in life, it kinda feels like a burden I don’t really want to unload on them.

We rode various rides and ended it with the ferris wheel. Everything just felt right and at that moment I felt the happiest in a while. Well we go to the haunted house and seeing her around my arm just gave me a feeling like I'm finally needed in someone's life. After the haunted house we went to a bar and had some drinks and shots. We danced, laughed, and on the way home we sang all the way. In my book this is like perfect fall date. I tried to text her the next morning and I found out I was blocked on all her social platforms.

I honestly don’t know when was the last time I was truly happy and not just temporarily plus never had a gf. Not too long ago I was depressed to the point were I was just jobless, couldn’t do basic tasks like shower everyday or other day, brush my teeth in the morning and would neglect until later in the day, stopped working out and just over ate plus gained some pounds so quickly and now just feel insecure &amp; bloated. Been numb for some time, as the oldest sibling in the family I feel like a let down to my family especially since I lost my father back in 2007 and literally never had a father or male figure in my life to help me push through or just give me advice. Everything I’ve learned comes from searching it up on the internet or asking good people on Reddit which is sad. 

I may have a supportive mother whom I love to death and appreciate everything she’s done for me and my other 3 siblings. I may also have a close group of friends whom I always hang out for the past two years now, I love em to death too although I never tell em because I’m afraid to open up to people and never use that word outside of my close family. When hanging out with them I’m very comfortable but usually never have those deep conversations about our life with each other. Plus we never really talk unless we hang out, so I literally go days without talking to other people which can get lonely which is what I get for not putting myself out there. 

I’m slowly getting out of that depressive state, getting a job might’ve helped but afterwards it’s the same bs again. I just end up numb and go into depression, it’s like a cycle. Some nights are so lonely I end up crying like a pussy for some reason and I hate it. I also end up shutting down and going ghost on everyone for some time and that’s not a good thing to do to people. The only reason I push myself in life is because of the people I grew up whom I looked up to with ended up in jail, drug addicts, gang bangers and homeless/drug addicts. I know I gotta do better than them and cannot disappoint my mother and father who’s watching over me.

Anyway I have found over the last year and even over the last 3 years I get emotionally obsessed with female video game characters. While it seems innocent it’s not and it’s gotten to a point where I feel I’ve had enough of it.

It’s to the point where I feel like I’m I love with them which is very very stupid, but I have no real connections to substitute. 

I get infatuated with them, pictures saved, nightly routine of looking at videos the whole depressing 9 yards.
But I feel it’s going too far when I physically feel heartbroken when I realise I can’t be in a relationship. It effects my mood and I am in a really bad mental state and more worryingly it’s starting to affect my school life.

92,Brilliant_Ancient,1635648572,1,"My favorite cat I've ever known is now a hospice cat. His heart failed, and he's being kept alive with medicine. But I can tell that the medicine isn't working the way its supposed to. The medicine is supposed to prevent his lungs filling with fluid, so I know that this is what is happening when he starts breathing heavily. On Halloween, he'll be 6 years old. He has a vet appointment in 5 days, but I don't know if I can even wait that long to take him in. I'm terrified that I'll need to make an extremely difficult decision very soon. After having a mental health crisis around 2017, I ended up neglecting all of my friendships and relationships until they dissolved into nothing. The few friends I have left are all busy and nonresponsive. Steve has been all that I have for so long. I can't begin to describe this profound loneliness, sitting here in this eerily silent house, knowing that my best friend might be dying. I have no support system. Nobody to share the pain of greif. 

Please, take it from me. If you ever have an animal that has a terminal illness that requires extraordinary measures to treat, don't make a hasty decision to keep them alive in a moment of desperation. Know that the long, drawn out situation you'll end up with is far more agonizing than the quick heartbreak of a sudden loss. The vets have all promised me time and quality of life, every step of the way, like a carrot dangling on a stick. But their definition of quality of life is basically the bare minimum--the absence of pain/suffering. In reality, keeping your pet alive might actually be the most excruciating emotional rollercoaster imaginable. You will watch your pet cycle through periods of suffering and improvement. You will develop a sense of hope only to watch their condition suddenly and sharply decline. You will become overtaken by greif over and over again, everytime you get some bad news or complications. And worst of all, there may be things that your beloved pet used to love but will never be able to experience again. Their life will be reduced to mere survival. And your relationship with them might never be the same. 

I feel foolish for having spent years worth of savings in hopes that I could keep my Stevie here with me a bit longer. Thanks for reading.",lonely,Sad pet post. :(,2021-10-31 13:49:32

I haven’t said anything about it because she has BPD and communicating with her can be difficult and it isn’t her fault she always has people texting her.

It wasn't always this way. After university I moved to another country. I had friends there and coworkers who I got along with well. I met someone there and we had a great relationship. It lasted for years. We got engaged and she wanted to move with me back to my home country. Then she disappeared....ghosted. Never told me she didn't want to move anymore or that she didn't want to be with me anymore. Just dropped me and threw away our several-year relationship with no answer. 

I think I took it alright at the time but it was all downhill from there. I moved back and found myself unemployed and struggling. Everyone I knew had just kind of moved on. Then the pandemic hit. I just got more and more isolated. 

I actually met someone recently. She told me that she really, really liked me but in the end she ghosted me too. It's a lot different a few dates in vs. a few years in but it still hurts. I feel like it'll always end this way no matter what. No matter how far in.

103,OmniFobia,1635645718,1,"Hey, 

Posting this because I have had this experience multiple times now. 

I often work as a bartender at big events/parties. I interact with a lot of people, including women. I´m being professional most of the time,  but sometimes I get multiple orders over the duration of the event from the same person. So I start relaxing more than usual and have some small talk or joke around with them. Women sometimes seem to be into me in this context and they often ask my name. I am never present or socially capable enough to ask more than their name in the moment.

I dread the feeling of losing out on an opportunity to ask their number or socials. I don´t get a lot of chances with women to begin with, so it hurts even more than usual to loose these chanches with them.

In the end I feel even more of a failure and my lonliness intesifies even more to a point that makes me feel useless. The idea of missing chances makes me goed crazy.

Pretty much adds to the social anxiety I already have. Or maybe its purely the autism. Could never figure that out. Anyways I've been bullied to no end in highschool until a best friend let's call him L convinced them that I had no control and they should stop. I made a group of anime friends and It was the best days of my life until they cut contact with me after graduation. That was understandable sense we all have life paths. 

After that only L and another friend let's call him A, we're my friends. I could never make any more friends than just them. Then a girl walked into my life named M. She went through ALOT and I comforted her every chance I got because for the first time someone understood my pain. Long story short they all severed contact with me. Every attempt at making friends that I made, it was in vein. They abandon me one way or another whether in the matter of days, weeks, months, even fucking YEARS. 

I feel like I'm just destined to be alone and I hate that. It's hell. But what can I do? Just keep failing? That combined with voices of people talking behind my back about whatever I do and feeling like I'm walking through no man's land Everytime I go out to socialize and even trying to atleast talk to people who either ignores me, keeps the contact short, or pretend to be nice only to not give a shit about me made me deeply depressed.

I just feel terribly alone all the time. To be clear, I'm not truly alone; I have a decent circle of friends and a loving family. However, despite all of that, my struggles in my love life (or lack thereof honestly) just eat me up for some stupid reason. I've never been on a date, never held hands, nothing. My friends often will talk about relationships and stuff and honestly it feels so terrible when you can't relate. At this point I've honestly taken to somewhat living vicariously through their relationships, since I've basically come to terms with my perpetual loneliness. 

Now, I'm not going to say it's because I'm ugly or anything. Nobody's guaranteed a relationship and frankly whining about that (in my opinion) is just counterproductive. People have a right to their choice in partners. I just feel terrible since I know I'll never be able to experience what it's like to be loved in that way. I'll never understand what it's like to wake up holding someone else and feeling happy that they picked you of all people. Yes it's sad, yes it's stupid, no it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but it still hurts me, much more than I'm willing to admit out loud. 

Maybe this is just fueled by anxiety about classes and stuff, but honestly after 6 years of trying to at least go on one bloody date, I'm just so tired of it. Wish I could just cut that part of my life out so that I never have to feel this sadness again. But, as it stands, I needed to vent, so here I am.

Ive got the job, i am free, i can do whatever i want. But I feel more and more unhappy everyday. My dream have always been the same.. To start hiking, travel to some country during the summer, buy a bow and do archery... With the person i love.

So as you can imagine i did nothing. 
I stopped going outside..i work with ppl everyday but I have anxiety from ppl, so that didnt help it aswell.
I stopped cooking. I stopped caring at all. I play games whole day after work or cry at romantic anime. I cant anymore. I refuse to live like that.

I quit the job. I am moving back to my country. Closer to my friends. Closer to my parents and siblings. Near the Mountains so I can try some hiking. Ill start to go to gym again. Sure, i wont have my dream job... Whatever... Its just a job.. And i was feeling pretty insecure at it aswell. So maybe its not a job for me... Sure i wont meet anyone for me.. I simply cant trust a woman anymore.... When ever i try to go to tinder all i see are half naked photo of women living nearby. Their biggest interest being drinking and whatever... And i know lot of ppl wont have problem with that and ill be seen as weird. But its just not for me. I dont like drinking, i dont like smoking, i dont like women whose all photo album is just her cleavage and butt. Its nice to look at, yes, but, thats it. And when ever a girl was interested in me she was in a relationship and was basically thinking about cheating. Like wtf?  So whenever i even see a woman that Id be ibterested in i find myself more and more scared. What if she is like my ex? Or what if she is in relationship? Or we will be in relationship and she cheats? What if? What if? So im not even doing anything anymore. Im not trying. I dont know if ill start trying. I am terrified. So ill be doing everything alone. I knowsomewhere out there is a woman that wr would be perfect for each other, but its like looking for a needle in a pile of hay.

But today, I decided not to wallow too much in those feelings, and to make a fun and relaxing day for myself. In the evening, I plan to make some hot chocolate/cookies and watch some Netflix.

- You are LGBT+ friendly (I am Bi)
- The older you are the better, like 24+ please
- You aren't rich
- You can talk about difficult or sensitive topics without getting offended or aggressive, using arguments and feelings.

175,euphoricenergy55,1635621496,1,"High school without friends sucks. Growing up, I was a selective mute. I didn’t talk to anyone at school- and everyone made me feel weird. But, every day, I’d see my grandma and my dad and everyone. I had 0 friends. I was just quiet and would cry every day at school. In 4th grade, I got my puppy, Lucy. She was a Pomeranian. We got her before Christmas of 2013. I remember it. I get to fifth grade, and graduated elementary and didn’t celebrate with anyone. I was still alone. Middle school sucked. 6th grade was fun, I had a group of friends for once. It was so nice. My grandma had passed before , and it was starting to get to me. Seventh grade, it went downhill. Depression, anxiety, social anxiety worsened, attempts and excessive s3lf h@rm. my ankles are ugly and scarred years later. No friends again. Eight grade, same deal. Got in an emotionally abuse r relationship with a guy. I’m a girl. Questioned my sexuality. Stayed with cishet. Ninth grade, one or two good good friends. High school too, it was really nice. Met some new people, too. Met my boyfriend, J. J cared for awhile but midway through tenth grade he didn’t. I could tell. Drinking (he did.) tenth grade really hurt me. Good grades, a job, but no friends. I stopped texting people. I fell into severe depression again.  Thoughts of attempts rewinded me. Summer going into 10th, was horrible. I had none. Halloween 2020 I was alone. Stayed home. Attempted midway through 10th. Didn’t work. I watched everyone have fun. Cried about how I have nobody. My dog Lucy died, and it destroyed me. I still miss her. 11th grade, I have 0 friends. Spent the summer with not a single friend not any day. Now, I’m almost a senior and just want to end it all. I’m so miserable. I’m so alone. I’m the loner. I try to make friends but I just embarrass myself. Everyone else has them. I’m gonna be alone forever. I just want a friend. A group. A small one. Only people in school I speak to is teachers. Crying for help.",lonely,high school without friends.,2021-10-31 06:18:16

After words I just was so angry but felt bad, because I remembered that I loved all these people around me before I got hit. So I chocked the anger down and cried. Crying not from sadness, but not feeling love anymore after being hit. Not that I lost love for them, but it just stopped being something I could feel.
I just don’t feel a connection with people. But I don’t know if I’m making it up, but I just remember when I came to from blacking out it was like I didn’t understand my old self. Like I was a different person from before. Love was and is now a foreign felling. It’s not like I hate people. I’m not opposed to them, I just don’t feel anything when around anyone. 
I am trying to do better now, but the emptiness is there. And makes me avoid anything with people, because I don’t like faking myself just to look normal. 
Just stepped up twice on a ladder today, and hit my head. Same spot I had 4 wood blocks hit me a month prior, because ladders are being used as tables here. I should have looked up, but I discussed about not leaving things on them. My dad said it was not a big deal when he worked with ladders. Then my uncle I over hear talking to my cousin tells my cousin the most important rule is don’t leave things on your ladder. Just flabbergasted.

Or when people complain about their own birthdays, like this one chick talking about how she only invited 20 people like it's an exceptionally small number.

The worst one was a year ago. I had to cancel my birthday party due to the lockdown. So i decided to make a small rpg session for 5 of my closest friends. Everyone agreed. Nobody showed up. I ended up drinking to a mirror all night. And to add insult to injury when i complained to my sister about people not showing up she was like ""no big deal. My daughter invited 30 people for her birthday and a few didn't show up. It happens and nobody holds a grudge"".

I really thought things would be different in college maybe that's the reason I feel this way.

The worst part is FaceTiming my high school friends and listening to them live their best lives. Academically I'm doing great and I'm not really sure who to talk to this about.

To set the stage me and my friend are both high school seniors, so this could just be high school drama or adolescent overthinking, but I find comfort in talking about these things with other people and hearing advice. 

So essentially my friend is on the verge of a full on relationship with this girl and I’m trying to get ahead while I can. We’ve been great friends for the past year and, in all honesty, has really helped me with meeting new people, going to parties, etc. I spent the first 3 years of my high school in a weird friend group where I felt out of place in, so when I met him and the rest of our friend group, it really broadened my horizons. Now I’m just scared that with him getting a girlfriend he’s going to completely forget about me and the rest of the friend group, considering I’ve heard it a million times before. I understand that I may just have to go “head down and push through” for the next 3-6 months until the honeymoon period wears off, but I rather not and still wanna hang out seeing how many memories we’ve made recently and how close we’ve been.

I can always play video games to pass the time. I can always sleep, eat, dress myself, anything to pass the time.

There's no point in loving someone who discarded me so long ago. There's no intense feelings anymore. All good memories I once remembered has finally died. All there is, isn't even lust. Just resentment and disgust.

And I won't repeat with the new person. I already sensed the relationship is mostly transactional. He doesn't care about my hobbies. Or at least be excited for me. Every time I talk about what I've done or my passion for things it's always. ""Okay."" Or ""Okay?"" And I get so fucking hurt that I just stop talking about these things to him altogether. These romantic interactions was to mainly fill the need for love but to not actually put in the work into it. In the end it's all filler though. There's no satisfaction from doing it.

My work schedule doesn’t permit it but it would still be nice to have the invitation extended.

The pic is just a small sample of my collection. It’s not even picturing the video games. I have Mario kart and I would love to play that with a group of people. No group. I have my old Wii and we party games. I have fighting games. I don’t even have a player 2 since I’m single let alone player 4.

227,throwaway12321au,1635600470,1,"May not be the right sub but here goes...About 2 months ago, I (22F) was broken up with by my ex (25M) of 9 months.

He was kind, loving, supportive, funny and would always prioritize my feelings over his own, the fucked up thing was that I allowed him to do this. I let him shower me with gifts, affection and care and he expected nothing in return - only that we hung out together often. He would surprise me with hot breakfast delivered to our door consistently and from different Cafe's every time. He would make little puzzles and treasure hunts for me to do if he couldn't sleep at night, I'd wake up to a loving, romantic or whacky sticky-note treasure hunt often. He would listen intently to my stories of how my day went, ask questions and become equally invested, despite the topic not being of interest to him. He was loyal, would actively tell other girls to take a hike if they were showing interest in him (even when he didn't know I was aware of it!)

He really was such an amazing person to me and I messed it all up because I failed to return the kindness and love he would show me, in nearly every way, example being I wouldn't really properly listen to him when he would tell me about his day, I wouldn't get off my fucking phone for 5 MINUTES to ask him if he wanted to talk or hang out or do something together, ever (and a mammoth amount other stuff that would reveal how much of an ass I am. It wasn't until he was truly gone did I realize what I had lost.

It's been 3 months now and I'm more lonely than I've ever been in my life, without him. I suppose this post is just me ranting about how much of an idiot I was and that I plan on being a better person for my future boyfriend, regret is a good motivator.",lonely,Don't realize what you have till' it's gone,2021-10-31 00:27:50
228,No_Solid_8826,1635599857,1,"No matter what anyone tells me, I just cannot change my mindset or thoughts about this. I am 20, never been in a real relationship, never kissed, never held hands or had sex. And before anyone suggests a prostitute, I'm not paying 200 dollars just for 1 hours experience when teenagers in high school and friends (well they aren't anymore) and even my ex who was a LDR, got to have sex for free, and in some cases multiple times and they were almost all HOOKUPS.


I just cannot get over it, and the thought of me being a virgin at 21 traumatises me. I have been judged. Made fun of because of all of this in the past, and I can't just ""not let it get to me"" I am on the spectrum and I haven't really had anyone really close to me in my life. No best friends. Never been to friends houses. Never trick or treated. Never been to a party. My parents didn't give me the best childhood. I envy almost everyone my age and younger because they not only had/have more things than me, but had a better social life and sex life than I ever did and do.


I have been told by psychologists to get out more. Sure but how am I supposed to build up confidence if every single night and day I think about the sex and dating thing? I can't function concentrate. I feel it has done enough damage not only to get suicidal thoughts but also enough damage to severely impair my concentration, eating and sleeping habits. Basically making it almost impossible for me to live a good life. And I struggle to talk to people when I feel this way.


I cut out contact of some friends because they have all these things that I don't have but it isn't just that. They previously either attacked me for it or boasted about their better life. My ex even went as far and said I got bad grades and I'm not ""outgoing"" so she thinks I don't deserve any of these things.


I can't cope. I've tried dating apps from a psychologists recommendation to no luck due to the lack of photos but also I struggle with top bios.


I don't feel like being here anymore, and I really struggle to take care of my health to the point I don't care about it, I am not overweight but I likely don't get the right nutrients. Sooner rather than later I am going to get a serious illness because of my habits. But I have no clue how to solve any of these problems.


Changing my mindset is almost impossible, been there loads of times. I just want to experience the things most teens and young adults experience that's all. I understand it won't cure all of my problems. But if I could somehow know how I could get a free hookup tommorow. Whether I get HIV or a STD or not I don't really care anymore. I do want a long term relationship as a long term goal but I've been reading allot of posts on reddit saying girls hate inexperienced guys etc,  and that they assume they are bad at attracting women.


I just don't know how to fix any of these problems. But I feel I just can't go on because of the way past peers treated me over it. And while 90% of the I'm talking about are American (and I'm not) it still affects me greatly.

236,Revolutionary_Bag358,1635589166,1,"I’m no stranger to loneliness, I’ve known it my entire life.
There have been brakes to my loneliness, I used to have a small friend group, those times made me feel really good and I thought I would never go back to my old self isolating ways. But the friends I loved so much decided that I was no fun to hang around with anymore, because I don’t like to drink and to go to huge parties, so they left me alone again. After that I was mortified and completely isolated, earlier this year I went months without talking to anyone but my boss and the cashiers at my local store. I was miserable and wanted out of the hell I created for myself. 

One day, I was at work, I saw a post on a mental health sub I follow. Someone was asking if anyone wanted to talk about their issues and plenty of people showed interest. A small discord was created and I decided to join. Immediately I was amazed at the atmosphere the users of this server created and I wanted to be a part of it. I put so much effort into talking to everyone offering advice and helping people out wherever I could. And for the first time in my life, these efforts were not only recognized but also appreciated, people started to value and respect me. One day the creator of the server dm’d me out of the blue to tell me he appreciated my commitment to the server and how much I cared about the people on it. He had made me an admin and I have never felt so valued in my entire life.

By that time the server was buzzing with positivity and we shared nice things like pet pictures and sunsets. I wrote almost 4000 messages to people and spent literally hundreds of hours in voice chat and it was absolute bliss for me, I could help people out and it made me feel great. And when I felt bad those same people were there for me and offered their best advice. I had finally found what I had been searching for my entire life: people I cared for and can take care of and who do the same for me.

I remember one day a guy from the US wrote a message at an unusual time, he said it was three in the morning for him and he was having a terrible panic attack. I talked to him for a bit, tried to calm him down and recommended some anxiety relief exercises to him. He said he was feeling better and was going to get some sleep now. The next day he texted me and thanked me for what I did and it felt amazing, I was able to be there for someone on the other side of the earth in the middle of the night and it actually helped them.
Another time I was feeling really bad, I had something bad happen in my personal life, and my thoughts were racing, I was freaking out. I put a small message on the server and said I wasn’t doing well. Within minutes people replied to me offering to help me out and others even dm’d me asking if I needed to talk. I was so touched I could’ve cried for hours.
I have so many stories like that from the server and it truly was a magic place for me and for the others. 

But then reality struck us, people became less active and one by one they started to disappear. The server slowed down and I couldn’t take seeing it so I too stopped checking in all the time. Before I knew it the server was dead and the beautiful space we created was forever lost. I miss the server, I miss the atmosphere on there and I miss the people on it so god damn much that it hurts me every day.

There is another part to this story I haven’t gotten into yet and I don’t know if I’m able to do that right now. Let’s just say, I met someone on the server who I cared for in a special way and they cared for me the same. It was another feeling of bliss and I enjoyed it a lot. However much like the server, everything changed and now I barely recognize that person anymore… it hurts me to see them hurting but all they do is shut me out.

Now I feel so alone again, I have no one to talk to and no one to take care of. I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I have no direction in life, nothing to look forward to and I once again spent my days wasting away all alone again.

I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them. Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse.

I asked out one girl in middle school, got rejected hard, and never worked up the courage to do it again. I felt alright for a while, but recently I’ve been feeling this need to actually connect with someone and talk to them, build a relationship, do something, but I’ve had no opportunities to do so because COVID restrictions are still in place. I feel this crushing loneliness and have no way to resolve it. 


I was leaving a Starbucks the other day and an employee by the door told me to “get home safely,” and for whatever fucking reason it made my day. I’m still thinking about it now, and it’s honestly pathetic. Just a polite, surface level nicety and I’m already catching feelings. I need some serious help.

I tried to explain that to my parents and instead of them being understanding I was met with yelling and slandering how I’m a bad aunt, that I’ve ruined their lives not having my own place (that I hate myself over everyday but anxious and depression won’t let me). This made me have a panic attack and they just yelled at me saying to grow up and stop acting like a child. That my mom was crying and it’s my fault and that I should stop crying because she is. All my life I feel like my feeling have been invalid. I either get screamed at or laughed at never taken serious. And this also happens at my work place. I’m just so tired of it all.

I know having friends in high school isn't the biggest deal in the long run, but sometimes I just feel kinda pathetic for going through so many years of school without making any lasting relationships.

The thing is that I know there's at least one person I can text right now to rant about my loneliness, but they'd never confide in me that way.

I've realized that I cope with the loneliness by getting really invested in things (tv shows, movies, books, etc.) and it just seems plain sad to think about. I mean like, I have no one in real life, so I turn to fictional stories for comfort and belonging. Like I said, sad.

302,whatagreatusername17,1635560710,1,"Ain’t no one going to read this long ass shit but it might help getting it off my chest.

I used to be the ‘comic relief’ of my friend group and had plenty of acquaintances through sports but that is all long gone since high school and college ended. I say acquaintances because no matter how fun we had or how much I was included, none of those relationships seemed to really stick after those years. I have probably 3 contacts in my phone at the moment besides family that I could reach out to but the problem is they are either in long term relationships or married with kids and have their own new friend groups. 

I legitimately feel like a parasite and I’m afraid to even reach out because after years of depression slowly eroding any sense of self I have, I’m not sure I’d even have that much to say or I’d be even worth having as company.

On top of that I barely make enough money to afford rent and basic living expenses let alone lead any kind of worthwhile social life.

I feel like my past is catching up with me. I’m an only child who comes from a divorced household where dad left when I was only 11. I had a history of being bullied when I was younger which led to switching schools a few times. Since high school I’ve always been a sort of chameleon and managed to blend in and make some people laugh along the way but I think I’ve never really learned how to ‘make friends’ due to my insecurities and doubts that are fueled by my life long depression. The true definition of the sad clown.

I probably need to talk to a therapist but I feel like at this point I am stuck with a pessimistic and bitter world view that makes me ask why. Why don’t I deserve friends? Why can’t I make good money? Why can’t I look forward to the weekend like everyone else? And lastly, why the fuck should I keep going? I guess that’s where my true power lies, I can end this whenever I want.

305,Draynior,1635559777,1,"I always feel kinda lonely because I never had a girlfriend and don't have friends, but this feeling was worse today because I saw people I know posting on social media about the Halloween parties they were going to and those who stayed home posting how they decided to binge a scary movie with their boyfriend/girlfriend.

I got a few drinks to try and make the sadness go away but no luck, so I decided to say fuck it and spend some money to make myself feel better. I hired a sex worker.

At first, as soon as she arrived I kind of regretted it, she asked for money upfront and didn't seem to be in the best of moods but I don't blame her, then I told her I didn't really want sex and just wanted to cuddle and watch something. I think she felt pity for me because we planned for a 1-hour session and when the time was up I was ready for her to leave but she stayed and told me ""I'm having a good time"". She ended up staying almost 3 hours cuddling with me.

After we watched a few episodes of a tv show she stayed a bit longer and when she was leaving I offered to pay for the extra time she stayed but she didn't take it, just told me I was sweet and that she liked cuddling and watching Netflix. I know she only did this either because she felt pity or because it was easy money just watching Netflix with some dude but this is the first time in a while I've felt human.

I think something a lot of people who have friends and a partner don't really realize that sex isn't really the main point lonely people are making, we just want to feel like we belong and that someone cares for us even if it is just for a moment.",lonely,"I don't really crave sex, I crave intimacy and feeling human so I hired a sex worker to cuddle and watch Netflix with me.",2021-10-30 13:09:37

I'm pretty lost in my emotions. I don't even feel like a person sometimes, instead I'm more like the embodiment of my emotions. It makes me feel insane. I feel like a lot of people who see this will see someone who's lost it. But really, I'm fine. Not insane, I think. Well, I'm likely gonna have a mental breakdown when college starts and I can't make friends, but that's besides the point. Anyways.

It feels so hard to be anything but stuck in my emotions. I see people posting on subreddits like r/MakeNewFriendsHere (fuck if ik how to format that on mobile), and they all seem so fake. Everyone is so painfully... social. I'm here pleading in my mind that someone will connect with me and with what I go through, but all of these people are like, ""hey everyone! i'm really bored rn and my friends are busy, so hit me up haha xD"" That type of stuff... They feel so far away from me. They feel so normal.

I say all of this, but I'm a hypocrite. When I do talk to people, I have such a hard time forming the type of close connection that I want. It's so easy to lapse into being safe and formal, hiding behind boundaries, afraid to be open about anything because it might hurt. And a lot of the time, I quickly dismiss people with thoughts like, ""this person can't be who I'm looking for, i can't see this happening with them."" But honestly, I don't think this person I'm looking for even exists. I've fabricated them. It's an unrealistic dream, created from reading too many sappy romance novels and empowering fantasy stories.

326,Haimish1224,1635553462,1,"Hi, this is gonna be bit long so I appreciate whoever takes the time to read and respond. This is a real emotional roller coaster of a story, involves heartbreak, disease, fighting, back-to-back betrayal, and just about everything that could go wrong for an attempted relationship. I know this is super long, but it would mean the world to me if someone reads and relates and of course I could use some words of hope or encouragement. I don't really post much on reddit, nor do I seek getting help even though I probably should, so I have quite a bit to unpack here. I'm grateful towards whoever reads.

To give some background: I'm M-23. Last girl I dated I was 19 and it was nothing too real when I look back on it, just a fuck fest between two teenagers that had abandonment issues, I am grateful to have learned some things from it in the end. Over the course of the next year after that breakup when I turned 20 I tried the ""talking"" even early dating stages with 4 girls during that time period , most of which never amounted to any real connection or talks about being fully together and committed. I had been disappointed with a couple of them after things ended prematurely, but a couple of them I also decided to break off, and I never really felt a super strong connection or deep sense of longing/regret after any of them. It seemed like I was healthily dating and I was ok with things not working out. But this did not last long, since I met 2 girls after this that I fell toxicly in love with. 

Fast-forward to Summer of 2019. Girl #1 appears here. This is where you might wanna buckle up cause I am really about to vent here. I reconnected with a girl who I actually ""dated"", if you can even call it that, in 5th grade. We were each other's first gf/bf and we somehow reconnected through a few random mutual friends, sounds a bit corny but yeah it was a hell of a coincidence. She was 1000% my type, all of my friends and their girlfriends loved her and for the first time in my life I was hearing people say things like ""yall just really go together"" or ""she is so you man"". Deep down I really agreed with them and I was super sprung on the idea of having something special with this girl. We just really clicked, hung out a lot, had great sex. Then one night we kinda got pretty intimate and had a deep talk and hooked up and she told me how she wanted to keep seeing me, and that she didn't want this to be a little fling. Fast-forward a few days later she got really spaced out, I didn't text her much and just gave her space since I figured she was having mixed feelings. Anyways, she got on Tinder and was matching with people I knew, and I even found out she had sucked one of my old friends dick the night before she told me all of that. So yeah that ended really ugly.

After about half a year of processing wtf happened with me and girl #1, I met another girl (Girl #2) who I had met through her older sister. We hit it off really well and things were good, given what happened with me and the girl #1 who I really did love, I was trying to be cautious with this girl #2 to avoid a heartbreak. Of course, she was kinda playing the field a bit for the first couple of weeks and she hung out with this notoriously creepy guy that I went to high school with, so I told her straight up I just wasn't into that and we probably shouldn't talk if that's they type of guy/lifestyle she wants. She of course begged and pleaded and made us out be some type of soulmates, so I obliged and kept talking to her even though deep down I knew she was still gonna be all over snapchat getting attention from these weirdos. I think probably in the back of my head I was compensating and allowing this in order to feel the love I missed so much from girl #1, even though she betrayed the shit out of me. Anyways, as time goes on we got pretty close and things were messy, the creepy guy wouldn't stop popping up on her phone (come to find out she was using him for free shit) even though it wasn't sexual, its a respect thing and the dude wants her and talks shit about me, therefore if we are hooking up she should probably not talk to that man, but ya know whatever no one this day in age knows what true respect is. Another guy she had texted who was a friend was this dude who barely speaks English and plays soccer at the University we go to, he was in Greece for the summer. Given the extreme language/social barrier I assumed they had probably hooked up maybe but there was nothing serious there. Boy was I wrong about that and everything else. 

So she kept texting creepy guy for stuff behind my back and even going and hanging out with all these people at his house, one night he was on drugs and started texting my phone saying he wanted to fight me because he saw me posted on her snapchat story with her out at the bar. I am about 6'4 200lbs, and this dude is about 5'8 165 and not an athlete by any means, so I basically didnt take it seriously at all and I went home from the bar with her and we hung out at the house. He blows my shit up constantly, and finally out of nowhere this kid showed up to my house with a gun in his wasteband talking all kinds of crazy. So I whooped his ass immediately, but in the process I broke my hand completely with a full boxer's fracture. I tried cutting her off again here but she insisted on being here for me, and after such neglect from my previous girl (girl #1), i just allowed it in order to feel some type of support. Anyways, I got surgery and then unluckily contracted MRSA staph in my hand, had to spend a week in the hospital and underwent 3 months of treatment after via PICC line in my arm. I couldn't workout, go to work, do school, or even really use a computer efficiently. During this time at the hospital, where I laid completely alone, embarrassed, and helpless, the boy from Greece came back in town, and she immediately started sleeping with him. They were dating less than a month later, she completely abandoned me. To date they have been together for over a year now. 

Fastforward a bit more, a couple of months into treatment around Oct. 2020, girl #1 magically appears in my instagram inbox telling me she moved away for a while but was now back in Memphis. I briefly explained my situation to her with my hand being broken or whatever, but of course left out the fact that I though I was in love with girl #2 and that's why it happened, I made it seem more like I did it because they guy showed up at my house and I deserved it instead of saying it was really because I loved girl#2. Anyways, we started hanging out again, she apologized for last time said she really missed me and we agreed to keep things Platonic for a while. Of course we would get drunk and hook up a little bit and slip up before eventually stopping ourselves, but she had expressed to me if we were as intimate as last time she was going to have feelings and she was set to move back out of town in about 5-6 months (not enough time to commit to anything), which of course I respected. I was at such a low point I was more than willing to be able to hang out with this girl I used to love and have a nice ass to grab on while we smoked and watched our favorite shows, even if I had to use some level of self-control and avoid actual sex. She had also expressed to me she talked to a guy when she was out of town and has been on a complete break from hooking up/looking for relationships since. Of course, you guessed it, all turned out to be a complete lie.

After a while me and girl #1 had a couple of moments where we were about to get it on, where it just felt way too right and I thought to myself, if she REALLY wanted to it would be happening, even though since she's moving away it would probably be awful for both of us after she was gone, when you're drunk and horny there is usually not much stopping it. She was also basically inviting herself over 4 times a week which made me think she really did like me and that she was just holding back. This being said, one of her friends was over at my house hanging with some people and I was back in my room and she comes back there and asked where's ""my girl"" (girl #1), I told her that I didn't know and that she was being kind of weird and not really wanting to hookup anymore and stuff. Of course her friends spills the beans and tells me that she has been hooking up with people in town, and she was also holding out for some other guy that lives in the town that she was moving back to. So yeah, the one that I really loved the most betrayed me twice. The first time was bad, but you can move on from that, but coming around when you see me in an awful spot in life where I am recovering from an awful situation that essentially was holding my life on pause is really really really really fucked up. It's completely unforgivable and I don't know how she could've done that to me, especially after already fucking me over once, now she comes back and does it again when I'm no longer in a good spot in life? It's just awful. 

Fast-forward to this year. Yes we are finally almost there (I really appreciate if you made it this far). I got done with MRSA treatment got back in school for the spring semester. Girl #1 had moved back out of town after betraying me for the 2nd time. Girl #2 had been texting me periodically acting like she wanted to check on me or apologize, but it started becoming regular in January. Girl #2 texting me apologizing saying that she cant stop thinking about me, calling me crying telling me she made the wrong decision, that she still loves me. It was just all so much, I was genuinely living in a permanent state of anxiety/confusion/depression from what these women did to me and yet they couldn't leave me alone in the end. Over the course of this past 9-10 months I cheated with her, multiple times went over there when she has called saying she misses me and fucked. The foreign bf of hers moved away and they are still doing long distance apparently, and she insisted on trying to tell me that I was the only other guy she was sleeping with and that she wanted to be with me and needed time to break up with her bf. This started in January......the story is still the same with her....9 months later. She still hits me up periodically to come over, wants to sleep with me, and yet I hear stories of her sleeping with other people, some of which who are closer to me than I would like and all she does is deny it. Keep in mind I would never take this girl back, I just need to cut her off completely, but i literally block her and she will make a fake account and follow me and message me or make a new phone number with some stupid app to text me off of.

Finally, I gave in to her after about 3-4 months of removing myself and went to hangout with her last month (girl#2). Since then she has had some issues and made a couple of doctors appointments, literally called me on the phone asking me if I gave her and STD since she was bleeding (I definitely did not), and claims that if its not that she might be having some type of pregnancy, and she is sure that the kid is mine. Even more added stress to my current stressful and lonely life, exactly what I needed huh?

I just feel so low and awful to have reached this point. Instead of bouncing back from the betrayal, I was completely consumed by love and the need for affection and allowed myself to be vulnerable with women that I shouldn't have. I even gave them multiple chances after being done dirty. On top of all of this, it has wrecked my confidence and mental health so bad I find every excuse to not talk to a new girl and I have no drive to really meet someone even though I want to be loved so bad. Its like being in a weird limbo-state between wanting something but being too afraid of betrayal/lacking the energy and determination to go after something and make it work, especially since it has never worked in the past. I was ultimately consumed by all of this, past year has been bad, days kind of just fuse together, don't really remember much of anything anymore, and I get daily spells of feeling extreme loneliness and despair along with an actual pain in my heart. I was actually emotionally beaten down by these two girls, a 23 year old tall athletic guy with absolutely zero drive, mental stability, or confidence. I hardly feel anything when I receive a complement anymore, which I used to feel great about because its a rare thing as a man to be randomly complemented. I cant imagine trying to love someone again.",lonely,(BIG VENT) - Story Time - 6-7 min read.,2021-10-30 11:24:22

I'm seen as the weirdo in my class, Wich isn't surprising i guess but it makes me feel even worse tbh 

People when they talk to me sometimes laugh. Many times they say hi, i say hi back and it's funny i guess. When i talk to my parents or family i speak normally but with classmates and strangers my voice comes off in funny way i guess. I talk completely different. 

One time 2 Girls came and one said ""my friend has crush on you"" . I said ""really?"" And her friend started laughing and sad ""hell no wtf "" and then the other girl said ""we where joking"". Then they walked away laughing.

Like why ? Why ? Why come to me out of nowhere just to make this stupid joke?

And last year , one girl (who i thought we where Friends before) told others she invited me to the Halloween party.

So some classmates asked me if I'm coming to it.

Well.. i wasn't invited. I told them ""i haven't received a invite"".

And they Told me to check Snapchat and see if there's some invite.

I sit infornt of this girl in Spanish class, days pass by and she doesn't Even mention this to me and Halloween is over.

She told others she invited me for some reason but didn't invite me ? 

Is it like trey think I'm the weirdo and inviting me makes them look good or what ?? This happend last Halloween.

Well people back in 5-6th grade also loved making fun of my pen eraser collection. They thought it was funny i had almost 100 hundred of pen erasers. 

And then one guy who usually bullies me just opened my Locker / box (we didn't have keys) and just clipped all my erasers.

He ruined them all and of course it was seen funny.

There was a specific pen Sharpner i loved also  ,and 2 people who used to bully me also just destroyed it. And they laughed. I hit the guy who destroyed it tho and his face got red that day... This happened in 5th grade tho .

People always laughed at me but i never realized it was at me i thought i was funny back in 5-6 the grade. 

But i have stopped doing this. I no longer really interact with other classmates that much. Then why do people still see me as joke ?

I used to be really annoying looking back and obnoxious. But i no longer am since I don't interact that much with others. But I'm still seen years later as a joke .Even tho i literally do nothing. 

For some reason many classmates like to tell me ""remember when X used to bully you"" or ""remember when you and X fighted?""

I don't get why the fuck they would say something like this. Like to they think it's funny when people fight or get bullied? 

It's not just one classmate who does this a lot of them do this .

I'm just seen as a complete joke , and i don't know what to really do.",lonely,Anyone else seen as a joke by others ?,2021-10-30 11:20:54
328,JCStilley,1635552864,1,"Well, y’all… Monday will be the one year anniversary of me moving out and separating from my soon to be ex wife. 
Over the last year I’ve come to realize a few things. I’m starting to understand that she was right. I’m not good enough. Every day when I wake up is a reminder of that fact. I‘ve been on multiple dating sites with almost no success. This has made me realize that I’m definitely not boyfriend material; much less husband material. The only ones that show any interest in me whatsoever are scammers. A lot of women say that they want a guy with a sense of humor. But I have yet to meet one who is for real. Those two factors show me that nobody is going to love me for me. And they sure wouldn’t want anything to do with a fifty something who is on his second divorce, doesn’t make a lot of money and isn’t attractive. Or someone who is too weird, or too annoying.
For me, it all boils down to this. I’m starting to realize that I’m destined to be alone for the rest of my life. Two of my four kids hate me; and my two youngest don’t know enough to hate me yet. So there’s a better than good chance that I’ll die alone. And I’ve already told God that if it is His will for me to be alone for the rest of my life, then I will accept that as my fate.",lonely,I’m finally accepting my fate…,2021-10-30 11:14:24

I have a group of friends I talk to but find it’s becoming harder to just be around them because they all seem very content with their lives, I’m happy for them though. I’ve started writing some romance stories just for my own enjoyment and while it’s nice to put my thoughts into physical text it leaves me feeling empty most times. I’m one of those goofy people that believes in soulmates so I find myself wondering if I’ll ever find mine, which makes me just want to crawl in bed and weep haha.

I wanted to die at that moment because I saw everyone's eyes on me due to how much we stood out

This sucks, it's a small town so us young people tend to at least know a little bit about each other so this feels even more personal, hell I actually saw a lot of people I used to be friends with and I could FEEL the silent judgment.

378,TheAuthenticGerman,1635535077,1,"I'm a medical student, training to be a doctor in the US. Being a first generation doctor in my family (unlike many of my classmates), I know I should be grateful for being in the position I'm in, to be learning an incredibly amazing trade in medicine. We're told fairly frequently by our professors that 'just by nature of studying medicine, you're now in the company of some of the most talented and brilliant people in the world.'

But god damn do I feel so fucking stupid, every single day.

It's not even a once in a while ""oh, got that question wrong"". ""Oops, didn't know that"". Every day I come home from school feeling dumber than the last. Not that I'm not learning anything, but I feel so incredibly behind every single one of my peers. It feels like they have the brains to be here and I don't. I leave lab every day feeling like I know nothing, like my classmates are going through the dissections actually learning and understanding and getting practice for their surgeon careers and I am just there, zoned out, feeling like I'm wearing a big stupid dunce cap on. Coming in to this I know that I wouldn't be top of my class, but it sure feels like I'm at the bottom. Coming into school I wanted to do surgery, or radiology or any other interesting specialty. But every single specialty that I've really wanted to do has been slowly getting killed as I continue through school. Anatomy has made me hate wanting to be a surgeon. Beyond that, nobody really tells you that it doesn't matter if you get into med school and want to be an orthopedic surgeon, if you don't have top 10-20%ile scores on your boards then you simply. Cannot. Be. An. Orthopedic. Surgeon. Even if it was your dream. Been wanting your whole life to be a neurosurgeon, got into med school, studied your butt off, and applied to be a neurosurgeon? Nope, sorry, don't have enough training spots to take someone with \*your kind of scores\*. Have fun in family medicine, or peds, or whatever else you can get into :) \[this is not to say that there aren't brilliant family med docs or pediatricians out there, it's to say that every single person that is a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon or ENT or whatever is an absolute savant, a real cream of the cream, top of the top\]. Doesn't help either that I'll be $400,000 in debt by the time I'm done with school.

I know this is going to come off as a whiny post of ""He's finally figured out that you can't have everything"", I know. But it's so fucking exhausting, and lonely, and depressing knowing that what I've wanted to do pretty much my whole life is just not turning out like it meant to be. Have I thought about suicide? Yes. Tried it three times before starting school, told myself I'd never do it again. And I probably will never try again, I couldn't do that to myself. I just simply wish I could cease existing.

Years later i realize i always want to feel superior to him, i get angry, this guy that is dumb ass hell, spoiled, pampered, literally had a job at his dads place that was ""counting dollar bills"". This mf has mad pussy. Legit, this guys only saving grace is that he uses all of his parents money shamelessly to get pussy. He had around 3 girlfriends at once 1 time. And i get jelous i cant even have 1 girl, let alone 2.

He has lots of friends and goes out very often. In contrast to me, that work and try my best to do well in college, along with doing workout routines.

My problem is that i dont wanna go to the party because i dont wanna see him. He reminds me of my shortcomings and honestly that makes me be very angry at myself.

I can count several people as my acquaintances but I don't see myself being really close to them. In general, gaining that connection with others is something I struggle with. Hanging out with some people is so draining because I feel like I'm being someone I'm not - someone that is just nice and nothing else. 

To be frank, I find it hard to be myself around others. I don't think I'm a super interesting person because I don't relate to others much. I grew up in a strict household so experiencing things has been difficult and thus, I don't really have much to talk about. 

I just feel super lonely having realised this. I only really have 1 or 2 people in my life I'm comfortable with. (which, I acknowledge isn't a bad thing at all) Other than that, I feel so drained hanging around everyone else. They're all lovely people don't get me wrong. I feel so lucky to know them. I just really value having a better connection with others rather than all this small talk I engage in most of the time. Am I doing this whole making friends thing wrong?

I went to a charter school full of aspirational kids who wanted to go off and conquer the world like me, and we got along amazingly. I could not have been happier. Every single day was something fun and special, and we were all there for one another to keep ourselves motivated. But then, we did go off to conquer the world at the universities all around the nation we got accepted to, and we've never been able to get back together since. Exams, work, internships, the pandemic, cost of flights, lack of a place to stay, etc. Eventually, digital communication no longer scratched the social itch for us, and we pulled the plug on life support. 

Ever since, I've had trouble making friends, because anyone who is remotely like me wants to go off and do stuff with their life, which normally entails them leaving forever at the end of whatever thing we're doing together. I gave up on making friends in university once I realized it'd all just happen again when we all leave for our grad schools in separate states. Then, when I'm in grad school, everyone will be chomping at the bit to leave across the country for lucrative jobs once they graduate, leaving me alone again. What's the point of friends if you're always ripped away from them by your or their need to go to a different location for school or work? Is my 20s just supposed to be a blur of transient faces and names I can barely remember, constantly being torn up by my roots and tossed someplace else by economic or academic forces? I want actual, long-lasting IRL connections, but I feel like that'll never happen until I'm finally settled into my career at like 27, and that thought just drives me up the walls.

It feels weird.

It's like , look at them all! Look how they interact with each other and how they all are happy and socialize.

Look how they are friends!

It feels like watching a movie. It's like I'm a ghost. I'm just here observing how others interact and are happy.

I used to be jealous when i heard people laughing and being happy. Now i just feel pathetic... I'm pathetic beyond belief.

Everytime I go there I'm reminded of my loneliness.

I just go to school, go to the lessons, then in the break i go to the toilet, sit there and sometimes i cut myself and sometimes not. I've been trying not to but it makes me feel alive and happy 

I just do that. 

Literally all year. Just go sit in my own specific places isolated from the world. 

I just sometimes go there, wait for the lamp to turn off and sit in the dark.

It's not always sad. I'm sometimes happy too. 

But it's just same cycle. 

No human contact. No friends nothing. I'm tired of this shit. I just want to die already.

It's not even like i can do that Much 

It's not I'm socially anxious, i literally don't know how to socialize it's not I'm worried just, I'm stupid at socializing.

When i tried i was so fucking loud and obnoxious. I used to be sk fucking annoying back in 5-6th grade. 

I tried exercising, i tried eating healthy, i tried good sleep it doesn't work. Exercise makes me feel good Wich is nice, eating healthy maximizes my brain power Wich is also nice. 

But they don't do anything about my ability to socialize. It doesn't affect it at all.

I tried already to die but i was drunk and i  blacked out and just got injured and didn't die. 

It's a joke. It's matter of time before i try again.

405,novasunrise,1635527207,1,"TLDR fiancé and I (both mid 20s) moved away for jobs and I’ve found it really difficult to make new friendships or to connect with the friends I had before the move. Have often been feeling lonely and envious of fiance who regularly connects with his friends and family. 

Lost touch with many high school friends while in university and also didn’t cultivate any new friendships during. Left home town three years ago for a job, shortly after finishing school, with long term partner to a city where neither of us knew anyone. 

Partner connects regularly (at least 2x a week) with his friends, work friends, and family for game nights. This routine has been in place since we’ve moved away. Been having lots of resentful and envious feelings towards partner and his connections - I really wish I had the same for myself. Maybe 70% of the time, I’m able to entertain myself during his game nights but usually do something independently from him. The other 30%, I feel very lonely which then leads me to distance myself from him. I feel like the only people in my support network (discounting therapist) is my partner and my two close friends since high school; however, I don’t communicate with them anywhere near the amount that my partner does with his network. I’m lucky to FaceTime them once a month and exchange text messages on a monthly basis too. Partner sees otherwise and says that I do have other people but am refusing to connect with them. My partner says he invites me to game nights with his family and friends and that I am more than welcome to join them, that they ask about me. I won’t deny that he invites me, but I feel more like a distractor/outsider the occasions I do listen in - I don’t really join. Also, am just not interested in playing games as they are. Also, even if I wanted to join, I don’t have a computer of my own (I could be using this reason as an excuse but there is honesty to it too). 

At my last job, I’ve come across a handful of people who I could have developed a friendship with but nothing really became concrete. Was friendly with them, even met outside of work a handful of times, but things have since stopped. At current workplace, coworkers are more or less around my age and again, friendly with them, but I can’t call them “friends” and I don’t feel like they could be. 

Have my own issues and struggles that I feel play a factor in all this: anxiety, depression, low self confidence and feelings of low self worth.

441,ScrumptiousCookie123,1635496961,1,"I don’t have faith in humanity. For the past decade or so, majority of the people I’ve dealt with have either sabotaged, betrayed, defamed/ran a smear campaign against, used/took advantage of, ostracized/excluded/isolated me. 

On one hand I want to have relationships with others (family, friends, acquaintances, romantic partners, etc), but at the same time I don’t. I’m at the point in my life where I now believe everyone is just awful (evil), that the average person is an awful human being. I now believe the only time people are “good” to me and others is for self serving purposes, and not from a genuine place. 

I didn’t think like this before, but the longer I live my life and see people for who they really are, the more I just don’t like people :( I feel really disappointed and hurt. I haven’t done anything wrong to these people, but I think because they see that I am obviously alone and lonely, they can continue doing this without any repercussions/consequences. 

Being alone and lonely places a target on you, because when people know this, they can weaponize it and get away with absolutely anything they do to you. No one cares, and if they do, no one cares enough to punish perpetrators with consequences/repercussions or hold them accountable/responsible. People are more likely to engage and/or be complicit in this, even when they know they’re in the wrong - simply because they would rather be part of the “pack”. People are more likely to gang up on a loner and side with perpetrators in the wrong than to do right to that loner. People are more likely to befriend and be buddies with the perpetrator.

To me, people are like a pack of predatory wolves…and I find it disgusting. The more I see it, the more I dislike people, and the more I give up on the thought of having any sort of relationship. 

I wish I wasn’t lonely and alone - and it’s especially more painful that this was something imposed on me via circumstance. If I knew what was wrong about myself and what I could fix it so I could have any relationship, I would gladly do it. But I can’t even do that - abusive people (who are “normal”, “average” even “good” in the eyes of others) in my life just wanted me to be the designated scapegoat/black sheep. 

Anyone else feel like everyone in their life absolutely failed them. I mean, I’m not just “feeling” lonely - I am alone. I’m actively, deliberately ostracized, excluded, and isolated by others. So this “loneliness” isn’t a feeling, some illusion, etc. It’s intentional. And I don’t think this is something that can easily be fixed or resolved. 

I think/feel like the only way back “in” is accepting my designated role as the scapegoat/black sheep and going on apologizing tours when I haven’t done any wrong - but I don’t want to be mistreated anymore. I don’t want to apologize anymore because those people just weaponize it as admission that I have done something wrong and therefore deserve to be mistreated.",lonely,(TW: Abuse) Struggling with being alone and loneliness.,2021-10-29 19:42:41

i don’t feel like i can connect with anybody, and the thoughts of loneliness permeate my mind every hour of the day. all i could possibly wish for to be happy in life would be a friend that i feel a connection with; one that actually wants to be with me, too.

456,needhelppls2122,1635488114,1,"Primeramente quería escribir esto para descargarme emocionalmente ya que nunca me ha pasado algo parecido.
La historia comienza en que conocí a alguien en un momento muy random en mi vida, a esa persona la conocí por Facebook y extrañamente me enamore y intenté mucho (alrededor de 6 meses)por qué pasara y gracias a Dios se dió, la historia de noviazgo dura 6 meses hasta el suceso.
En el mes 5 pasa unos de los acontecimientos que más me cuestionó, y claramente me arrepiento, y es hablar con otra persona, esta relación yo en este momento claramente tenía novia, la cuál teníamos una relación envidiable, y con muchísimo futuro, pero no sé el porque esto paso.

Esta persona y yo comenzamos a hablar por un mes en Instagram, al comienzo era de chorra que hablábamos, pero luego el asunto se fue poniendo bastante intenso.
Cuestión en que intercambiamos nuds, y salgo aclamando su cuerpo 

A finales de este mes a mi me da el COVID y permanezco en aislamiento.

En este momento recapacitó y me doy atras con esto y lo dejamos en nada.

En todo el momento del aislamiento en lo único que pensaba era en estar con mi novia, y la extrema falta que me hacía, y hablábamos de cuando nos volviéramos a ver, paso todo y gracias a Dios me encuentro bien, nos llegamos a ver a los pocos días. En estos momento quise hablarle de lo sucedido, pero egoístamente quise mejor reservarmelo, y seguir con mi vida, cuando más bien estaba por comenzar los últimos días de lo que era mi estabilidad emocional.

A los 15 días de mi recuperación, una persona X contacta a mi novia, y la cita a verse en un centro comercial, con el mensaje de tu novio te estuvo engañando.
Sin yo saber nada de esto ella accede y claramente esa persona confesó todo.

A los pocos momentos yo la voy a traer al centro comercial, pero yo muy en el fondo sabía que algo estaba raro, ya que la veía muy inquieta y hablándome con que quería traer sus cosas de mi casa (ella en momentos se quedaba a dormir en mi casa).
Con lo que me resulta raro, ese mismo día yo me iba de viaje a otro país, con lo hablo con ella por teléfono antes de irme y claramente con todo el cariño del mundo le decía lo que sentía por ella.

Pero antes de yo irme, ella me dice que quiere hablar conmigo un momento, a lo que respondo ""no me lo puede decir luego amor"", con lo que ella insistió.
Con que lo que proclamó ""Terminamos, se que me estás engañando, no tengo por qué tener a alguien en mi vida que me ve la cara de babosa, con solo decirte amor me da asco"" recalco que mi novia, es una persona de las cuales, las oportunidades se aprovechan y no se presentan de nuevo del buen sentido. 
Me voy a mi viaje por chequeos personales, y en todo el viaje me sentí muy pero muy mal, (algo que yo nunca había sentido, y he tenido relaciones anteriores, pero está me ha marcado tanto que es la fecha y no dejo de tener un vacío.) El viaje fue arduo y claramente trate de no pensar en eso.

Aclaro que en su momento no me dió explicaciones y únicamente tomo la decisión.

El día en que regreso a mi país, solo tomo una ducha y me voy directamente a su casa, a hablar que había pasado, de forma ruda, decepcionada y triste me dice "" terminamos por el simple hecho en que se que me estas engañando con otra persona por mensajes, me enseñaron las cosas asquerosas que hablabas con esa persona y creeme que ahorita con solo verte me da decepción"" (el trato mío con ella a como muchos hombres en esta vida, fue única y siempre poniéndola de razón número uno, pero en este caso falle por completo y tropecé en la piedra más pequeña que había, y no saben que ardor en el corazón me hace sentir cada que hablo de esto) con lo que le respondo con la verdad y le digo ""antes que terminemos quisiera que habláramos un poco más"" a lo que me responde ""Ya te termine, te queda claro eso"", con lo que esa frase me destruye por completo y me destroza por completo el corazón.

Más adelante trate de todas las formas posibles disculparme y tratar de solucionar las cosas con lo que eso implique dar tiempo a la relación, ya que personalmente, mi felicidad , sentimientos de seguridad y tranquilidad era completamente todo esta persona. 
Pero claramente nada de eso funcionó, posteriormente como buen hombre lo digo, me suelto a llorar por la gran cantidad de sentimientos reunidos, (y eso que no soy mucho de llorar y por lo general solo sigo adelante) en mi sentimiento sollozante le decía ""tenes toda la razón"" ""discúlpame"", repetidas veces, una vez calmo le confieso todo el sentimiento verdadero hacia a ella.

Con lo que ella responde ""te agradezco absolutamente todo, y reglamente yo también te amo, pero vos mejor que nadie sabias cómo soy, y aún así buscaste la forma de decepciónarme"".
Con lo que lo único que me quedo fue ir a buscar al coche la bolsa con sus cosas (antes de partir a su casa guarde sus cosas, por qué realmente sabía que ella no era así, y sabía que era una decision tomada) y se las entregó a ella.

Con lo que ella me entrega mis cosas, posteriormente paso a guardar las cosas y tratar de hacer el mayor esfuerzo por tratar de reparar el daño y tan siquiera hayar una forma para solucionarlo. Pero todo quedó en un beso de despedida 
Actualmente ella hará un viaje a EEUU, y me da tanto dolor saber que se vaya con las cosas en este estado. 

Es el momento y cuando estoy en la uni con costo me concentro, me siento muy mal, me duele el pecho, las ganas de llorar nacen de la nada, cada que entró al coche sollozo. 

Cómo pregunta personal digo ¿Habrá gente que apesar de estos problemas siguen adelante? Y si es así ¿Cómo sigue funcionando la relación? Por que personalmente se lo que es la desconfianza y es una enfermedad terrible 

De igual manera no hay momento que no desee de forma egoísta, querer que esté aquí conmigo y hablarle de todo y decirle completamente todo lo que siento hasta aburrirla desearía que se quedara conmigo apesar de todo 

Pero claramente se que a ella le dolería no solo en lo personal, si no también el dolor social al tratar de reparar esta situación

Esta es mi historia un muchacho con lo que andaba en la vida vagando y saliendo de fiesta que un día se enamoro de verdad, y talvez pecados anteriores pasaron factura. 

Y ahora siento realmente todo los que la gente con problemas como estos, amigos míos, gente de Facebook hasta mis propios padres, sienten o sintieron 

Mi madre días después me llama y entre tanto sentimiento encontrado ella me pregunta por mi novia con lo que no me pude contener y de forma sollozante le conté lo sucedido, y ella aparte de un reprendimiento, me da una lección de vida ""Si alguien ama de verdad y desea el seguimiento de la relación, busca siempre una forma de solucionarlo, por qué las heridas sanan, aunque dejen cicatrices, pero son lecciones de vida, de uno depende si ser feliz y aprender más con ese alguien o retirarse y aprender algo nuevo con alguien más"" 

Lastimosamente la vida actúa de forma dura y dolorosa, pero apesar de todo me ayudó a aprender, me alegra saber que la persona que más amo, le hayan dicho la verdad para ahorrarse una vida con una persona tan basura como yo, que con el dolor del alma, le desea un grandioso futuro, con amor propio, externo y si ella lo decide, encontrarse con alguien que además que la ame más que yo, que la respete en todos los sentidos, ya que verla sonreír, seguro es lo que hace que el sol brille y haga tanto calor acá donde vivo haha.

Si a ti te ha pasado, ¿aprendiste de la anécdota?, De que forma restablecerias tu estabilidad emocional?, ¿Sería buena idea hablar de esto con alguien más o autofunarme en mis redes sociales?, ¿Sería de mucha ayuda escuchar a más gente que han pasado por el engaño para así entender más a mi ""ex-novia"" y hacerme ver más profundo el sentimiento?

Si has leído todo esto te lo agradezco de corazón, y si no, igual necesitaba desahogarme de alguna manera, por qué realmente no aguanto más, se que hay problemas más importantes, pero es muy dificil esto, solo espero salir pronto y dar el paso....",lonely,El fin de una vida,2021-10-29 17:15:14

465,ToffeeTorres,1635484288,1,"
This is an update in regards to my post in r/relationships about the GIANT shopping center cashier who happened to be a huge crush of mine dating back to the 9th grade. This is NOT about the girl in my AITA post, that girl is completely different. Background is on my profile for those who care. So basically I went to the GIANT, saw her working the cash register like she did last time, and decided to make my move. I entered into her lane (giggity) without anything in my hand, a stupid fucking mistake I made cause I was so nervous and just wanted to get a closer look at her. Anyways, there was a guy in front of me with a bunch of bullshit. As she was ringing up his items, she said to me “do you have anything to buy sir?” And I fucking froze. I knew it, I goddamn fucking knew that walking up there empty handed was fucking stupid. I just grabbed a bunch of gum, candy, drinks and shit until she didn’t look so pissed. I was up, she was ringing my shit up, and all the rolls of gum  had a hard time rolling up the conveyor belt because they’re cylindrical. She said to me “next time just use the self checkout please” and that’s when I snapped.  

 I took the rolls of gum that weren’t rolling up, and I furiously ran them over the barcode scanner for her since doing her job as a fucking GIANT shopping center cashier was akin to being the President of a third world country. Once I had all my items in a bag, I threw her several dollar bills (trust me it covered it) and grabbed my stuff. I ran outside, against the protest of many onlookers and staff members who were concerned by my behavior or some bullshit. I went outside, and threw all my shit at the wall, which made a huge glassy mess. I got in my car and peeled off, got some cans of dip at 7/11, and tried to lay low in my house. I haven’t been back since, and I don’t plan on fucking returning. Somehow and someway, this always happens; the very notion of me engaging in conversation with a woman is enough to make them vitriolically angry at me, while simultaneously pulling the victim card when I try to defend myself and fight back against their injustices. I guess that’s just another brick in the wall, eh? Another girl that I invested my entire heart into, another girl who said Hi to me a few times which led to me imaging our entire lives together, happily married and living in a huge house with multiple beautiful children. Crushed, because I cannot seem to relate to anyone in any meaningful way.

But he has dealt with depression in the past and still struggles to this day with a lot of insecurities and relational wounds.

I myself had gone through a lot, i understand where hes coming from. I was there exactly where he is right now and i feel like self-esteem wise, i got myself to a healthier relationship with myself. Which is not really the case for him yet.

I want to help him. I want to be there for him, support him when he feels his worse. And it was easy at the begining.

But now, its getting more and more difficult for me to do as well as i used to. And to be honest, i'm starting to feel emotionally exhausted. I know that because i get annoyed and irritated easily whenever i sense that he needs my attention, i can hear in my tone when i talk to him that im annoyed and he notices. 

I feel bad for feeling that way. But i dont think that i can handle this for much longer, its getting really tough. He is in therapy now because i recommended him to go, not only for him but for me too, for us as a couple.

Idk, right now i need to hear from people who are in a similair situation than, how do you feel?

I’m too far away to see friends I had in high school, and I’m starting to realize now I don’t think many of them were true friends to begin with. I have trouble doing small amounts of work and find myself in bed most of the day for the past two months or so. I’ve never been lonely before but I think that might be what’s wrong. 

My roommate is almost never here, always at a party or sleeping over with his girlfriend, so I usually speak to another person once or twice per week, aside from trying my best to make casual conversation with people in the cafeteria when I can. 

It’s hard because almost every time I talk to someone they always ask “what frat are you in?” Or something like that and as soon as I say I’m not in one they literally stop talking to me. Or like a girl from one of my classes had a bunch of people over to study one day (highlight of my week) and at the end they broke out alc and as soon as I said I didn’t want any they basically stopped talking to me.

I don’t know how I can get people to like me if I don’t like hedonistic pleasures. I’m not like mean about it I want people to have fun and drink and fuck if they want to, I just don’t because of what I’ve recently been through with a few personal things. And that makes me weird and they don’t like me because of that. 

I really try but everyone seems to just write me off. I’m not ugly at all, I’m pretty attractive and I was popular in highschool so my personality can’t be that awful, I just don’t understand why I can’t connect with anyone, they’re all like already locked in to their groups and all only think partying is fun. 

My grandfather is the only person who tries at all to keep contact with me, and I shared a little with him and he told me I sounded suicidal and needed to see a doctor. I’m not suicidal and I don’t think I’m depressed I just can’t get out of bed because it just feels silly to try to talk to people. It’s like I could say one or two of the right things and instantly have friends, like everyone is just pre programmed to only like specific things in a person. Does anyone have any advice?

495,dryskinprincess,1635475334,1,"24F. I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve had sex one time in my life snd it was really embarrassing and I don’t even really remember it. That was 7 years ago. I went to a high achieving high school where everyone went to top tier colleges. I went to an expensive liberal arts school for 2 years and then dropped out because I was depressed and moved back home with my parents. I got a boring office job but I was only making $40 in a HCOL area and I grew up upper middle class so I have to go back to school to maintain my lifestyle. I’m back in school now. It’s a good school but everyone is either much older or younger than me. I’m not unattractive by the way. 5 foot four 113lbs 30G boobs 36-25-36 measurements. Average face, can be above average with makeup. I had a few boys interested in me in middle and high school. I had one high school “boyfriend” for like 2 months. We kissed maybe 3 times? Yeah, I’ll never kiss anyone else in my life. Its depressing but I need to come to terms with it. I’m coming off really stupid in this rant. I’m actually very intelligent but I’m high which is the only reason I’m typing this. I forgot to mention ai have many mental health disprders (lik, dug I’m typing a screed no one will read on a depression forum for fellow losers on reddit.com, of corse i have mental issues. Typical depression, anxiety, ocd, adhd. But also have a tic disorder which is my number one issue why no one will love me. It is pretty mild and I can cover it up for hours in public. But once someone sees me get anxious at home and clearing my throat and grunting repeatedly they could never love me. Its really sad too bevause I want to be a mother so bad i would be a great mother. I have a one year old dog and she is the only reason im still on this earth. so this is probably how my life is going to go: i’ll finish my degree and get a half devent job but not one that will pay enough to maintain my upper middle class upbringing. i will eventually move out of my parentshouse and into a sudio apartment once i can afford to. maybe age 28 or 30. by then nonone can come back from basically being a virgin and having never been in a relationship. Once my dad dies I will be able to sell his house and put a down payment on my own. i also have several wealthy relatives who are old and might leave me money but indint know if it will be like $100000 or $1 mil or $10mil. I know im very lucky. but who knows maybe they will give it all to chartiy. ill be an aunt to my brothers kids. he is normal and will settle down and have kids. yeah i dont know what will happen other than that. but i know i will never hold someones hand, bever  kiss someone, no one will ever fuck me or make love to me or make me come. i’ll never have that person i can rely on and tell everything to . ill never experience raising children with someone or growing old together. i dont know if ill ever have a friend agaij either. my best friend of 11 years ghosted me 4 months ago. we grew up together and went to college together and were roomates and she just decided to stop talking to me one day. i tried texting her back and she replied hut then never again. i have no idea what i did. we share a lot of the same mental heslthb issues but she has alwya managed to find love and a biyfriend. i was going to say at keast ill walasy shave my sogs love but dogs die and my seeet baby wewill not be here one day. i guess ill just keepi getting new ones and hopefully they will love me as unconditionally as my current babay. wow i look like a fucking idiot typing buttyoes for so long that my phone is flitching and im weiting like 4 sentences abreadZ ne way peace and live to everyone.",lonely,I will be alone forever,2021-10-29 13:42:14

It’s not jealousy, it’s more like I just don’t see value in supporting people who flaunt their lives and monetize off of it by promoting random products. All these people are starting to morph into the same thing, they all look and act the same way and even promote the same brands. I feel more isolated than ever for not participating in this follower/influencer culture. Can anyone share their thoughts? I would love to learn something new or hear someone else’s opinion on it, even if you disagree. If you feel the same way as me, it would also be nice to know I’m not alone in this.",lonely,What are your thoughts on social media/influencer culture?,2021-10-29 10:39:34
527,thrway4dayz,1635463715,1,"So I’ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety codependency add/adhd and ocd. I don’t have a diagnosed personality disorder but the symptoms of what I do have basically look similar. I’m on psych meds, I take them but mostly I use street drugs to cope. Uppers are my jam. Because of my addiction I’ve been in nothing but dysfunctional abusive relationships. I don’t blame my ex’s even though a majority of them weren’t very nice to me. I blame myself for my shitty choices. 

I had 2 years sober 6 months ago and then I cut off my family and left home to move closer to some of the less volatile addicts I know. Push came to shove and I started getting high again. Why? Because I’m lonely. I don’t have a partner. Drama with my ex-fiancé and lies his friends told about me ruined my  relieved me of damn near all my friends. I don’t have social life. I don’t have any hobbies. I don’t have any desire to do anything but get high and disassociate from my world right now. There’s nothing keeping me alive but God. 

I attempted suicide at the beginning of this month and almost succeeded. I came so close! I had it all planned but I can’t even do that right. For some reason not dying made me just accept that I’m alive. So I won’t try again for a while. But I’ll probably try again. I wish I wasn’t so codependent. Then maybe o could find my own reasons for living but that’s hasn’t happened. 

I’m seeking therapy but connecting with a therapist has been difficult. I don’t wanna get committed so I’m not honest with them with nullifies the potential for therapy to be helpful. Annoyingly true. But, I don’t expect anyone to care or want them to help me. If they try I’ll just end up pushing them away or doing something selfish to disappoint them. People online tell me that I’m nothing but a piece of shit. They buy into whatever crazy shit has been said about me because of my crazy hacker stalker ex. I honestly don’t care anymore. I’m too tired. I just wanted to get that out.  Please don’t reply.",lonely,Tired of missing him. Losing myself…,2021-10-29 10:28:35

547,codecrunchie,1635453260,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

548,TerriblePabz,1635452552,1,"Hello, I haven't really done anything like this before so I will apologize now for bad formatting.

I would like to hear from people who have worn a mask for so long that they truthfully can't tell which version of themselves is the real one.

I (24M) have been doing the back and forth dance with the depression monster for the majority of my life. I have a loving mother, a wise father, and a little brother who looks at me like I am Iron Man. I have 2 dogs and a cat, but not really anyone that I would say can be classified as a ""friend"" and I haven't in a few years. 

I have been incredibly fortunate in my lifetime in more ways than just a few. I love my family and my pets, I have a car, a house, and a good job. However, I recently realized that as much as I try to care and as much as I am able to fake it around loved ones, I truly don't give a damn. But I am completely lost as to which emotion is the real me and which emotion is the depression monster... I can't remember if I am a happy bubbly person that fights with depression 24/7 or if I am a hollow shell of depression that pretends to be happy and bubbly for the sake of the people that hurt when they see me hurt.

My question is for anyone that has asked themselves this question (winning or losing the fight). How do you know which of your faces is the real one? Especially if you forgot one was a mask all together.

My whole body is starting to hurt from loneliness I think. It started in my chest and was only there when I was feeling anxious or depressed, but now it’s there all the time and it just feels like a hollowness from my throat down through my gut. I haven’t had friends in years. My family isn’t really close and everyone can be pretty self-centered. 

My partner of almost a decade and I just broke up after a year apart. They barely reacted to the breakup, which really feels like I’m dispensable and wasted years on someone who didn’t ever actually care, but also I guess validates that breaking up is the right thing to do. Still I would do anything for one of their hugs right now. I feel like they never really loved me and when I really think about it, maybe no one ever has. The more I try to connect with people, the more I feel like people only like me when they’re using me for something. Whenever I need something, nobody cares.

I don’t even want another partner right now. I want a community. I want to go on adventures and sit around a campfire every night laughing with people I feel safe around. Instead, I’m home alone all day every day working or scrolling on my phone. I just feel so stuck.

I don’t think I’ve ever posted here but I feel really worthless and alone rn and thought maybe someone out there would get it. I am seeing a therapist and I’ve been both medicated and self-medicated but no matter what I do, it just feels like nothing’s working and I’m stuck in this groundhog day type hell loop of work/eat/sleep with no end in sight and no love of any kind to make it bearable. Even my cat prefers my ex. I’m turning 30 soon and it just feels like I have nothing to look forward to anymore and like I’m getting old before I even got to enjoy being young.

My life started falling apart 2 years ago. I was madly in love with someone who just needed me to love and support unconditionally until they found someone better. I was left without a word and that shattered my heart. So, I drowned in depression and alcohol.

I quit my job and moved to another country for a fresh start. Sadly the pandemic did not help to find a good job, expand my social network or make new friends. I dated a couple of amazing people in the meantime but I realized my heart was not healed.

Two months ago, my mother fell severely ill. So I returned home, used up my savings for her treatment and she is now out of danger. I am very happy to be with my family again but having the other aspects of my life stand still make me sad. I am 34 and everyone I know are celebrating a new job or a wedding or a newborn child while I barely have control over any simple task.

What scares me the most is that I do not have the urge to achieve any personal milestones. I am neither suicidal nor depressed. I do not get stressed or even angry and I lost interest in everything.

I am (19M) when I was in school , I was kinda funny guy like but in reality  
Ha no one's going take him seriously not even teachers.

So it all started when I feel like.. I am outcast in different groups then I  feel like left out always because I used to be friends with all guys but am probably the last priority.

Same thing happened in high school too , In fact I only hangout with two friends so same thing don't repeat.

And now I have 0 people in my contact list. I know I can make few friends easily but I don't want to go though the same pain like it's really hard to lose a friend . This shit is really awkward like now I don't like them neither hate them and am confused.
I am always confused , what to do ,what to not do ,so I decided to stay alone.

I have been in my room since COVID . I spend almost a year alone but I still don't feel lonely because I have alot of fun hobbies .

The lonely part is not someone wishing me happy birthday in three years(today is not my BHD)

The lonely time,every time I open Instagram then all the loneliness hits me .
Like I became super jealous with my friends because there whole page is filled with memories and friendship.

So to come at the point : I feel lonely because I really want a friend in my life so you thinking this kid  just want friends to post on Instagram (not really I just friends to make memories , that..I want to cheers my whole life).",lonely,"I enjoy myself, but deep inside am lonely af",2021-10-29 03:50:53

586,Tweiss-55,1635438064,1,"Let's start with the reason why I feel depressed. I feel depressed because I don't feel connected to anyone. I feel lonely all the time. I'll be laughing at something then I'll immediately be hit by sadness since I have no one to share my happiness/laughter with. I started talking to this person because we play the same game. As months go by I realized we have similar interests. Our friendship made me feel connected. I can vent, share my happiness, and talk about other stuff. I didn't feel insecure in that friendship. We were both happy with it. We both talk to each other about problems. We both genuinely cared abd supported each other. I finally felt connected. I finally have something I've always wanted. That friendship made me feel less depressed. Just knowing I have someone helps a lot. That friendship allowed me to help myself do better since I'm mentally ill.

Now I feel this crushing loneliness because that person cut me off. We're both mentally ill. She cut me off because it was the best for her mental health and I understand it. She cut me off because I was toxic. I was doing something toxic without even realizing it. I didn't know I was being toxic because I didn't know anything about trauma dumping. I wasn't aware that I was trauma dumping. I was under the impression that it was okay, but it wasn't. I know is venting is good, but it wasn't venting that I was doing. It was trauma dumping and I was hurting the person I really cared for. If I knew about trauma dumping, I would have stopped doing it. I never knew I was doing something wrong all this time. Now I have nobody. I lost the feeling of comfort, closeness, and connectedness I've always wanted. I lost the friendship I wanted to cherish because I didn't know that I was doing something toxic.

I hope we could be friends again. Now I know my mistake and made myself better. I miss our friendship. I'm alone and so lonely again. Drowning in my thoughts.

wish i could say that i only had this problem back then with girls, but it's funny how it also happened with male friends.  
Pretty much the structure is the next one:  
Friend A texts and hangouts with me --&gt; we have fun for some weeks or a couple of months--&gt; Friend A disappears out of the blue for like a whole semester or a little bit more --&gt; friend A comes back and when we hangout or we talk i find out that basically they came back to me because their gf or boyfriend broke with them or because they are having personal problems--&gt; i pay attention and show them empathy,give them support --&gt; friend A feels better in the next couple of weeks or months and we talk regularly--&gt; Friend A disappears completely again out of the blue for other 6-16 months --&gt; friend A reappears again in my life--&gt;repeat the whole cycle.  
last semester my ex texted me basically because she was having issues with his current boyfriend, last month a male friend of mine texted me because his girlfriend was being apathetic and ignoring him, and now my best female-friend texts me again out of the blue after like 8 months.  
A whole year ago i would've pissed myself out of excitement about these situations of them coming back in my life, nowadays it just makes me feel apathetic and it costs me showing them empathy and interest, specially when they start with that bullshit of ""i am busy/don't have time"" only to then brag about how they did 1000 things with other friends or with their s.o in that week,LOL.  
i just texted them basically 1 day again only to delete them completely the day after.  
in 2020 i got tired of crying, being heartbroken and loving other people.  
i shutted/closed my own heart off for most people i used to love madly...and i don't regret it.  
call me resentful or ""edgy"", but it was the best decision i made, i don't feel much love for others anymore, and i like to spend my time with things i truly enjoy instead of letting my heart become black and cold due to carrying their problems,negativities and issues.

For a while I was talking to an acquaintance from college and we eventually grew closer, someone I could definitely call a friend as we talked every day and about even personal issues, and often she would ask me about what something meant when a guy was talking to her or tell me about how excited she was for a date. However recently she's decided to be single due to her coursework getting in the way and several bad relationships one after another, and basically just doesn't talk to me anymore, even getting angry with me when I make a light joke about something she says. Now pretty much every time I contact her via Snap hat, where we always talk, she usually just sends a reply of her face and says nothing. To me this says ""fuck off, leave me alone"" in the rudest way possible and I'm worried I was just being used as an ego boost or some such this whole time.

After talking to her both on the internet and in person. I feel like we will just be a normal friend, but part of me wants more than that. 

I tried to suppress my feelings. First, we are not knowing each other for a long time. Secondly, I am not sure about my feelings. Is it love? or like? or simply enjoy her companion? Lastly, is that feeling derived from my fear of loneliness or something else?

I'm slightly hating myself for easily ' fall in love ' with someone and cannot identify my feelings. And for her, I just want to be her friend. Not necessarily bestie, but at least a nice one.

637,Nazislayer69,1635400584,1,"Okay so Ive been on here once Im gonna be here again haha, tryin to stay positive. Now please don't get mad at me when I say this but Im not what some would define as a loser from first glance. Some kids are lonely and you can tell why. but you can see that they are still good people though. im 16 btw male and my grandma says im handsome so that should sum it up for you, Im also kinda awkward around new people but not socially impaired, just more quiet that's all

anyways Im not a kid that hunches over and looks all depressed or sits in his basement and plays video games, I really try to meet people I know im ""cute"" that's what I've been told by my female friends and i have a small hand full of them about 4 or 5  and by all means im not trying to sound cocky. im quiet low on friends i hang out with the same 5 people 

Anyways just everywhere i go i get hit with shit. I mess up once and people give me crap for it for months, now this sounds like a normal teenage thing but i assure you when teachers and adults walk up to you and ask ""why do they treat you like that"" you know somethings up. Im told im insecure and that's why people  pick on me, Its like getting out of hand its too much

&amp;#x200B;

one of my big insecurity's by the way is i just get really nervous around new people girls i don't really know. And so it make it hard for me to ""pull"" like the rest of my friends that always have girls crushing on them. 

im piety secure about everything else im insane at wakeboarding and one of the top competitive swimmers in my state utah 

&amp;#x200B;

anyyyways

&amp;#x200B;

 Now im just gonna back up for a sec to explain what happens

 one example i was painting my friends basement with other friend. And i painted a penis on the wall and took a picture sent it to my friends and then painted over it. However my friend drew the N word and took a pic and sent it. Now fast forward a month and im talking with them and all of them just thrash me to peices about how i was so dirty and terrible to draw that word.

Another example i was sitting at work after i went on a lunch date with one of my close friends im not gay btw this was a chick i when with not that it matters but yeah. anyways. Someone asked how my day was and i said it was good i went on a date and yk like 3 or 4 girls were like eww who would take you out on a date your a total idiot, and they weren't kidding either i promise you

so for anything i do wrong i get crap i hear people trash talking me in conversations ( people i barley know) I promise im not immature i know the time and place and in fact I OVERFILTER myself a lot but whenever i say something people act irritated. and i don't say awkward thing that would make someone irritated I just say regular normal things. Its like in every situation i am the scape goat, in my old friend group everything was blamed on me in fact I had some people come back and apologie to me about what I was accused of, things that i never did and i was pushed under and gossiped about for months. somethings the people you think love you will literally rip out your heart and stomp on it

&amp;#x200B;

and to be honest when people aren't being jerks people say Im funny and i make them enjoy times. some of my friends took a trip ( many of which trash talk me at times) and they came back and said something was missing it just wasn't fun, there wasn't a person to say random stuff to make people laugh and that they needed someone to mess with people and to get people to do things. They actual said it was me that the missed WHICH FELT GREAT 

&amp;#x200B;

But most of the time people step on my and trash talk me and call me anoying and awkward and push me out, they want me at their convince . My own dad treats me like a problem that need to be solved I've heard him say it to my mom many times. From childhood I've always been alone. I love being with the people but I just can live as people doormat scape goat and anyother words to describe it.\\

The result of lacking any sort of love or physical affection, i’m sure. So touch starved. I don’t know how long you can go without any kind of meaningful connection with another person without losing touch with reality. 

I’m sure it’s not healthy. You can’t focus on the present or even the future when you’re stuck in the past and all that used to be. But I find myself constantly replaying scenes from an old chapter in my life like a movie stuck on loop. All the kisses. All the “I love you’s.” Every single embrace. Desperately trying to feel what I felt back then. As if it’ll do anything for me today. I find it absolutely pathetic.

683,Jesus_H_Christ_real,1635384710,1,"***It's not your fault.***  


Not that long ago, before industrialization destroyed family group, you would have been born into a large extended family - parents, grand parents, nieces, aunts, counsins, etc etc.  


These people would have supported you. They would have watched you grow from a child into adult. They would have supported you with all of your flaws. Warts and all. If you would have cried, they would have held you. If you were lonely, they would have found you a mate. Yes, if you were mateless, they would have found you someone because they care about you and your well being and they don't want you to be alone.   


So it's not your fault. It's not because you have flaws. It's not because you're short, skinny, fat, ugly, mentally ill, whatever it is you may think is causing you to be alone. Not that long ago, even with these flaws, you would have had a shot at friends and mates. Your family would have provided it for you. Warts and all, **you would have been taken care of**. Because you don't just throw out a family member because they have a flaw. Family is family. You take care of your family. That's just the law. Basic human law.  


But this family group was destroyed, and that's not your fault. Because it is destroyed, you are alone. And that's ***not*** normal. This is ***not*** how human beings operate. It is ***not your fault*** you can't cope with it.   


**This is entirely not on you. This is not your fault. It's not because you have flaws. Humanity bears a mental scar that you had nothing to do with - you didn't cause industrialization.**   


If you're looking in the mirror and are blaming yourself for being lonely, please know now that it's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong and it's not because you are imperfect. Were you born a bit earlier, you would have been born into a family that would have supported you. Family that would have held you, hugged you, kissed you, tickled you, gave you gifts, cherished you, found you mates, and basically took care of you.  


**It's not your fault** that you got born into a century where that has been destroyed. It is not your fault that your parents were likely overworked, exhausted, bitter, angry and as a consequence unloving. None of this is on you. You can relax. You didn't cause this, it's not because you are unworthy of love or companionship, the human society itself is fundamentally broken and your solitude and isolation are just symptoms of this.   


**Not. Your. Fault.**   


**You. Are. Good.**  


There is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with you. It's the society that's fucked. And if anyone dares to say otherwise, just show them the homeless. Show them mentally ill people who can't take care of themselves and don't know where they are or who they are, freezing to death, while we spend billions on rockets that we won't even use anyway. These insanity examples don't stop, but the point is:  


There is nothing wrong with you. It's the society that's ill. **What kind of healthy society wouldn't embrace someone as lovely as you? You have value. Any society worth it's salt would have cherished you and loved you and cared for you and made sure you had everything that you need that they could provide. You are a human being and you are worth this. Remember that always.**",lonely,Read if you're lonely,2021-10-28 12:31:50

I'm struggling to make friends in uni, my old friends from school have their own lives and are super busy so other than occasionally checking in (nothing deep just a ohhh hey how you doing its been a while) we don't really talk - like if I have anything I wanna talk about I don't feel comfortable because I know its a forced convo. I just feel like the person who's never invited and I do often message people to say we should do something like get coffee and its always a response along the lines of ""oh yeah 100%"" but then they'll say they'll let me know when they're free and after several times of asking I kinda feel embarrassed.

My 21st bday is coming up and a couple people have asked what my big plans are and I don't have any. Some of the people I was debating asking told me they were going on a night out that night and I'd mentioned it was my bday and they asked if I had plans and I said not yet I'm always last min I suppose (not true but I felt awkward haha) and they were like well I hope you have fun with whatever you do!!

Idk I just feel like when I did have friends I'd always invite the lonely person or whoever wasn't properly invited cuz I hate the idea of someone being alone and I just assumed id always have said friends, or that people would be like me and invite me if they saw I was lonely, but now I'm older it seems like people just assume you have friends so don't bother, and it see,s to be embarrassing to message people to hang out? I've tried real hard to hit up people with common interests but they just always come across weirded out that I'm randomly talking to them whereas I'd be over the moon if someone went out of their way to include me/talk to me about something I said I'm interested in.

For the most part of my life I was never too bothered about dating, having a relationship. I mean I always thought it would be nice to have someone, but I never searched for it. 

I have never had a romantic relationship, or anything close to it (virgin, never even had my first kiss). But I'm at a point in my life now where I just really want a companion, someone I can have fun with, be romantic with, the sex side of things would be great too I'm sure aha, but I really just would love to have a partner right now :( 

That said, I have no idea how to relationship.. I have very little experience talking to girls (or anyone), I'm a very quiet/awkward guy, and don't have a lot of confidence. And am also afraid of the physical side of things because of the whole 25 year old virgin thing.

707,sorenspacedust,1635376240,1,"My past shortcomings, how shitty of a person i was before, my lack of humor, my inability to stop people from walking over me, my inability to speak up for myself, my past decisions that i have to live with to this day. All combined are the reasons why i don’t like what i see in the mirror. I’ve become a shell of my former self. 

I force myself to choose the hardest paths in my educational career just so I get the validation that I’m doing something difficult therefore I’m worth something. But i just end up falling apart and not being able to keep up , failing classes. I try to surround myself with people that are better than me just so I can feel like I’m on their level. I’m a female who seeks to give mother behavior to people around her and i do it way too much it becomes annoying, just to get the validation that i’m a good person. I never feel worthy unless i have to prove it to myself through my deeds, which...aren’t that many lately. 

With only a few people around me, my regrets keep piling up, my self esteem is non existent, it’s so intense to the point where i can’t like a meme online because i don’t feel deserving of a good laughter. I can’t double tap on a post i like because i don’t feel deserving enough to relate to a positive post. I can’t post a picture on my socials because i don’t want people to be reminded of me or think that I’m delusional to think i’m pretty enough to post my picture.

Living off of two hours of sleep a day,energy drinks and dry shampoo. Looking like a skeleton covered in hyperpigmented pale skin and dark under eyes .  No mother around to tell me to do better because cancer took her last breath. My father is a depressed single man who lost the woman of his life, and has to care for three girls and deal with life on his own.

I hadn't seen the receptionist, let's car her B for short, in a very long time.  When I took the truck in B made a point to say how she missed me and was glad to see me.  B looked much more glad than an old customer coming to visit.  I could see she was a little nervous and then she followed me outside as I was leaving, which was unusual.  B then came toward me wrapping her arms around me the first non-familial touch I've had in a very long time.  Oddly something went wrong with a car I have and well I was back to the repair shop.  This time again, B followed me outside and I could see this little smirk on her face and she timidly said I should have her number, she still has mine and I should call her so we can get together for coffee.  I guess we exchanged numbers from a service appointment thing in the past.  Anyway, I thought back to the earlier appointment and remembered B told me that her husband who had a bad accident doesn't touch her anymore and he doesn't want to be touched.  B really doesn't seem like a person who would cheat and I don't want to be the home wrecker.  Honestly, I couldn't stop thinking about her on the way home from the car shop.  I am so lonely I would actually consider calling B?  Is this where I am at in my life?  I know very well that would be a mistake, but damn I am so lonely.

Who am I?

I’m a 24 years old guy from Europe and I’m not gonna lie I feel kinda lonely these days &gt;.&lt; It doesn’t help being introverted at all. I also have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) so don’t expect me to call you soon xD. 


What do I hate?

Okay so people who will talk for some time and after that they completely vanish. They don’t “ghost” but it’s more like that they don’t write on their own. Most of the time I’m the one who has to send messages or else they just don’t message. I really hate that. It shouldn’t be one sided. I really lose interest when that happens. I get it if you can’t message me all the time. I can’t either. But please communicate with me so I know the reason why you’re not responding to my message(s). Or else I’m just gonna think of the worst case scenarios in my head and that’s EXHAUSTING honestly. But this only happens when I get attached to someone. It can happen when I get good vibes from someone and when I like that person.


What kind of person am I looking for?


So I’m actually looking for someone like me. Literally. Someone who is kinda lonely too, someone who has anxiety, someone who likes games or anime so we at least have like a mutual interest. We can also play games or watch anime/movies together on discord. I’m not that active on discord nowadays but I know most people like to communicate through discord so its fine, I can be active on there. :D

What games do I play?

Currently I play rocket league but I played a lot of games in the past. Like: overwatch, dead by daylight, csgo, some valorant, some league of legends and a lot more. So I’m sure we can pick a game we both like. Also roblox is a great game to play together in my honest opinion. I’d love to play that together. ＼(＾▽＾)／

What are my other interests?

I like conspiracy theories, history, psychology, music, stuff about the universe (planets, stars, more life and stuff) those are the things I can think of right away.

Oh and I type a lot with keyboard emojis so if you don’t like that then don’t message me.. (like these: :) :D c: etc.)


So if you’re like me then please send me a chat message. Don’t reply to this post. See you &gt;.&lt;",lonely,Introverted 24M looking for a long term friendship with a girl who likes anime and or gaming,2021-10-28 05:36:02

756,QuantumCheezpuff,1635351362,1," Hi, I am not sure if anyone here might be able to relate or help, but here is my issue. Whenever I (22M) think about being in a relationship with someone, I get this sort of anxious feeling in my stomach. It's not like I don't want to be in a relationship... quite the opposite, I often feel lonely, especially when I see two people that are great together, and I long for a feeling of connection like that with someone.

I can only think of one time when I can explain this feeling in my gut: leading up to breaking up with my ex (21F). In hindsight, I know it was a toxic relationship for me, and my ex made the break up process atrocious, so I guess it's only natural that I felt this way. However, I am not sure how to explain the anxiousness I am feeling right now just thinking about being in a relationship with someone.

As a bit of background information, I am mostly an introvert, and I haven't dated much in my life (I've only had one relationship that lasted 7-8 months). My parents divorced when I was in fourth grade, and while my relationship with them is for the most part better now, there have been rocky times with them, especially surrounding them dating new people. Anyways, I am not sure if this information helps at all.

I hope someone can enlighten me on the possibilities of why I might feel this way. Thanks everyone.",lonely,Stress/Anxiety when thinking about the possibility of a relationship,2021-10-28 03:16:02

Apologies in advance for the long post. Maybe I need someone to hear me. Maybe I just need to get this off my chest. But in any respect, thank you for reading.

When I was 18, I was homeless because I got kicked when I admitted that my stepfather was sexually abusing me. When he got put into jail, I lost contact with the rest of my family--adoptive mother (adopted at 5) and siblings. My biological mother passed when I was 12 and my bio father struggles with addiction though I never met him. Because of this family dynamic, I have 2 grandparents whom I love dearly as they protected me throughout the trial but (even if it is accidental and subconscious) who do favor their blood grandchildren. And I understand, I don't have resentment for them. They were social workers and are just generally good people, and it's never been their responsibility to house, feed, and clothe me so they do what they can. But their daughter--aka my aunt--and I have always had a volatile relationship. I am biracial, Black and Jewish, and my adoptive grandparents and aunt are white. Once, my aunt and I got into a fight because she made a racist joke using the n-word with the hard ""-er,"" and we didn't talk for years. We made up, and time went on. 

I don't know what happened, but she recently started just drifting away from me. \*Disclaimer,\* I work a lot. I usually work 2 jobs to support myself and bring in extra income. Well during the pandemic, I lost both jobs. On top of that, my car got totaled the day I got fired from my full time job. I had to use a lot of savings to buy a new car/pay bills/miscellaneous expenses and so on. I also lost my health insurance which means I lost my therapist and psychologist. So, it was a big loss for me to suffer. And I never, ever asked my aunt for money or food or rides or ANYTHING, all I maybe did was need some more emotional support because of stress, but she started hanging out with her friends more and her other nieces and nephews. When we used to hang, we'd go out for food n drinks, or go shopping, or do something else. Point is, it usually required spending money, and she hasn't held a job consistently because she lives at home and doesn't have big bills like rent. So, I would often pay for the majority of expenses and never ever minded because giving is my love language. We eventually got to the point where we just didn't speak, and when I went to go to her IG to look for something, I noticed she had deleted any pictures of me, and it kind of made me feel like she was choosing a side of the family's and it wasn't mine. 

I would never ask my family to choose me over anyone else--it's why I would stay away from my grandparents, because their grandchildren's mother wouldn't let them around if I was there. But for some reason, this felt different...my aunt cried with me when I was homeless, drove me to the job interview that allowed me to secure housing, wanted to be there when I graduated with my associates...and suddenly I was just deleted from her life. So whatever, I blocked her on everything. She reached out to try to get back into the Amazon Prime account, and I just didn't respond.

I was also dating this guy for about two years. It was also a very volatile and toxic relationship. We both have a lot of trauma to unpack and heal from, so I don't want to place blame on anyone and won't. All I'll say is, he's the first person I fell in love wit. I have loved before, in HS and early college, but never like this. At this point, we haven't been together for some weeks, but still seeing each other and hooking up and saying ""I love you."" I found out he has a girlfriend/is dating someone else. He's Caribbean/Black-American, brown skin, and I'm a little lighter than him. Well, I'm the first black girl he's ever dated, and he cheated on me with a white girl earlier in the relationship and is now dating a white girl. Which maybe wouldn't even bother me as much if the same thing didn't happen in my last relationship (being the first back girl a black-American guy has dated and cheated on with a white girl). Lol. Anyway, I know I shouldn't be upset because we are not together, though based on the dates I know they started dating while we were together, but c'est la vie. 

All this to say, I am sad. I have a best friend but she's not very sensitive and emotional like I am. She gives me space to be sad but she's not someone you can easily vent to. She's an amazing problem solver and a good listener at times but she's not someone that will pull up with snacks and tissues while I cry. And that's okay, that's who she is, but I am deeply missing something more. 

So Sunday is my 23rd birthday. I am not doing anything and I don't want to. I just want the day to pass by unnoticed. I feel very alone and unloved. I know I am loved, but I want to be...a priority, I guess.

I just want to scream and cry and stop living. I’ve lost my motivation to get any better tbh right now. Today at work I observed everybody else. I watched them wondering “How are they simply going on with their lives?” “How can I be like them?” “How aren’t they completely hating existence?”. I wondered this because i am so hurt to where the first thing before and after my shift is cry my brains out, why am I so pathetic? I want to be happy again. I remember that feeling.

Sorry in advance for the long post. I just need to vent somewhere to get the burden off. I moved to this city years ago and I think it was the worst best decision my parents have ever taken because  I haven't travelled much out of my province or even my city really, but I hope to on day. I moved here in the beginning of grade 9 leaving all my middle school friends which i know usually don't last and my family, But ever since I moved here from grades 9-12, my life has been absolute garbage. My life pretty much consisted of going to school, coming home and staying in my room. I made some friends but they were only friends in school. I'm going to be 18 in a few months and graduated high school a few months ago and I've never been to a party, hung out with friends, am still a virgin while everyone my age is out partying every weekend, doing drugs, going to prom, having sex, going on adventures and travelling with friends and it just makes me sad. I know that people are going to say that these things are overrated, but I don't really care because I want to do those things as well instead I'm in my room, no friends and alone for the past 5 years watching netflix and playing video games to escape reality. Also, making friends in this city is really hard because they usually have had their friends since they were in the first grade and have always lived here while I've been moving constantly and have been to 3 high schools in four years. I'm taking a gap year right now and working full-time to make some money and I will be living at home to save money which means life in university will also be the same. I guess I just need to accept my life for the way it is and that I will die a loser. I think if I don't wake up tomorrow I will be okay with it because then I won't have any of these worries and life will be done with and I don't plan on doing anything, but I will be absolutely fine with dying because my life is pretty much the same.",lonely,It’s a sad life.,2021-10-27 20:17:51

And all the adults tell me it’s just gonna get worse after school because you have no opportunities to make friends once you get into the workforce and have no time or place to even socialize. So I guess I’m just gonna be lonely and a failure for the rest of my life (if I don’t end it all soon, which I probably will). Humans were meant to be social animals, yet here I am talking to myself just to keep myself company and from going insane due to lack of social interaction. I’m so desperate and I’ve tried THOUSANDS of times to make friends and always FAIL. They always leave me on read, never text back, never make plans with me, never speak to me again, talk shit to me or about me, etc. My friend on the other hand just has friendship applications falling in her lap. Doesn’t even really have to try. She claims you have to “bother” them, but you shouldn’t have to keep texting someone to make plans or get together with them. It should be mutual. But I guess coming from someone who has friends fall in their laps, it sounds easy. It honestly pisses me off because I’m just worthless/expendable to all my “friends”. If I’m busy with work or something, they can easily find one of their 20 friends to hang out with instead. Me? I only have maybe 1-3 options AT MOST. So if someone is busy? Or can’t help me with something? I’m FUCKING doomed and DONE for cause I have NO ONE and NOTHING.

I hate that I can even get like this with someone so easily, but the little I do know about her I like. She seems really cool and has a lot of interests that I am into. For example, cartoons and stuff. 

Well, I used to be into cartoons more, before I got really depressed once and all of my interests and hobbies were taken away from me.

She's also very cute and pretty. We only interacted a couple times though, and one of said times she actually went out of her way to approach me. She sarcastically said something to me to tease me, and I guess I was just having a bad day, was sad, didn't know how to respond, whatever. In the moment I took it as her making fun of me /bullying me.

Anyway, I replied with some ""you're annoying me"" type tone like I was really bothered by her :(. I felt bad and stupid for that because I don't even want to be that way. It makes me wonder if that made her think less of me.

I've already wasted so much time, just with my life in general. I always just do this and the truth is I'm never going to take any initiative or dare approach her. 

I'm incredibly insecure and anxious. I already assume she dislikes me at worst, or at least doesn't really have any thoughts about me at all. Even if I did, I'm out of her league and she probably is interested in someone else. In fact, I know that she was/is into my brother which kinda hurts.

But one day we randomly started playing Call of Duty together and kind of bonded over that. We would play almost every night and I would feel sad if we could play. We would play other games with other friends in group situations but it was always nice if it was just the two of us. We would be on call and talk about all kodms of things. We didn't actually have a lot in common and wouldn't agree on most things so we'd end up debating stuff but even that was nice. But maybe over time I noticed how sour his personality was and maybe he was always like that. Or maybe I got tired debating with him since I felt like the debates wouldn't go anywhere. And maybe as he felt more comfortable he would say more and more agregious stuff, stuff that I wouldn't be able to ignore in good consciousness. Then these debates would turn into arguments. And then one day it got pretty bad and I knew that that would've been the last time I'd have spoken to him or gamed with him. At the time I felt nonchalant about it. I mean this wouldn't be the first time he'd lash out and then isolate himself, but he'd always come back. And I told myself that even if he didn't come back, if he never comes back then it'd be whatever. Then he never came back. It's been a year. Either he stopped coming online or I stopped checking. And I can't stand to play that game with anyone else. Who would I even play with? It wouldn't be the same. I miss him very very much. But I know that I would never reach out.

I can feel the emotional pain in my chest, burning every time too. I have any anger, or sadness building up, yet I always cry. I don’t have a clue what it is, but I’ve always felt it since I was a child. I feel like I was built so different from everyone else, whether it’s mentally or what. Like I’m on a different level, not smarter or anything. Everyone says I have a gift, how my thought process is. Not being smarter than people, but how I understand things, people, or etc. to myself.

I know obviously it’s not, but I believe it anyways. It’s so much easier than believing the life I have now. I feel like it helps my mental health, both good and bad. It helps me feel attached to some kind of world, since I feel so out of my own. It’s so hard to enjoy this world, I see the best in everyone, and the potential they have including myself.

849,Council_Of_Minds,1635293190,1,"I had a relationship Eleven years ago and it made me realiza that I needed time to understand myself.

I have friendships but my country went to hell so I had to leave it, thus leaving my family and my friends are scattered around the Earth.

Tho I'm a pretty sociable person, I am accustomed to my freedom of movement, personal space, inner thoughts and loner way of living, which comes from the acceptance of my character... However, being so adamant in knowing the realities of existence and finding my own purpose, along with the realization of deep inner truths and perhaps my nihilistic self, I have come to a bottom that I cannot seem to come out of:

A feeling of burden towards mankind somehow has taken over my mind where I want to help the world as much as is possible to utterly ridiculous extents and am not really able to do so... (fighting corruption and awakening minds takes a toll and being successful at it usually leads to an early death)

Which I find sometimes absurd that I would be almost obsessed with this idea. But such is the way of the soul.

On the other hand, I would just like to be ""a normal"" individual with a woman next to him that can bring a small family together, picture the ""dream"" (house in the outskirts, two or three children, dogs, cats, the whole nine yards) and just be content with fulfilling my biological and social human purpose (be born, grow, reproduce, die).

And perhaps we ought to find the simplest way to happiness and healthy complacency in order to live a healthy long life with cherished ones around you.

The difficulties of any loner or lonely individual apply to me: I have flaws and insecurities as the best of them.

But I feel I can overcome the ""common"" barriers of social courting with certain 'ease'. The problem lies within this idea deeply embedded within my brain that I should exhaust every possible thought avenue possible and commence a never-ending campaign towards improving humanity with all my energy, thus rendering my ""normal"" side behind and becoming the other thing.

Why not be balanced and do both?

Why not start doing this or the other?

Here come the issues I can perceive:

I am not within my own culture (Hispanic) thus the chances of a real long term relationship is lower than 10% (there data backing this up, don't remember where) 
And those who have left their original countries and/or alike cultures will understand what barriers this brings. 

I believe that my dichotomy underlies a probable mental condition (delusions of grandeur or alike) and might not be the only psychological difficulty I face (Adhd is a main suspect). This leaves me with the feeling of burden that the 'other half' might face in dealing with me. As I stated before I am very sociable but the more a person grows closer to me, the more aware I become of my shortcomings as a human and as partner. I might become colder, added than I'm somewhat already stern and silent. 

For the more common but not less difficult issues:

It poses as a somewhat difficult task to find that right person on this side of the world (Europe) since not only there are a myriad stereotypical misconceptions and just perceptions about my ethnicity and culture (some with basis, others mere speculation) that already make me self conscious when just thinking about approaching someone else around here. There also lies the fact that in all probability the chance I find that someone more or less aligned to my moral compass or that we may share at least the level of thoughts with solid enough compromise on keeping respect and understanding as a core of our possible union seems fairly low. Therefore the ratio of effort made:favorable result seems overwhelmingly imbalanced. 

I am not without vanity, although I'm definitely not what women nowadays demand for in the appearance of males, I have a fair share of features and racial qualities that have been appreciated and praised in consistently in the past. My confidence does not dwindle due to these facts, I simply am superficially out of the scope of what women look for. Namely, I'm not a tall person. 
Doesn't sound like big deal, but it would surprise the unaware (or the tall) how much is this overestimated as a physical feature over many others. 

And since I am not without vanity I also have a scope of what I want as my partner as well, which any sane person should have, naturally, the picker the narrower the chances of finding that person becomes. In my defense, I do not search for supermodels but I am attracted to the female body and standard of feminin beauty. Other than that of course what was stated above regarding our moral compasses aligning and her psychological/social qualities interest me as long as it is a person tilted towards good and justice, knowledge and progress. 

So... To sum up. I find that this recurrent discourse of vague calculations that I have almost unconsciously developed and keep running in the background has become a main detriment towards my impulse of approaching women. The instinct and want is definitely there, but the mind staves them off quickly after with 'it's not worth it' or 'don't waste her time' thought. 

I believe this is a very specific pitfall, and am doubtful of what approaches to use to surpass it. This, writing about on Reddit, is one ""outside of the box"" action I'm taking towards it. Although I'm not truly expecting anything out of it, maybe just reading it myself would help. But if I am honest, I would appreciate the human interaction. 

Other than that, I hope to anyone that reads this and is subscribed to this sub is able to find that significant other when the time is right, and if you haven't given yourself the time to learn about your inner mind I would recommend that you do, so as being a more complete individual when finding that cherished partner.

868,Kind_Abalone284,1635285324,1,"Not once in my life up, up till 2 years ago, did I ever have a friend. I spent my elementary and middle school years bullied by my classmates and teachers alike. Even then, other than school, I spent my life in my room playing Sims or doing homework. 

High school was the same except I was homeschooled — even more isolated and stressed do to high expectations. The few years I went to college (online) went the same too. 

Years of social interaction other than family, a few social workers, and my dog.

And I was fine with that for the most part. I think fear, and not really experiencing anything else clouded my judgment.

Then two years ago I asked in some writing circles if anyone wanted to be my beta reader. One person answers and by pure chance I connected with her like I’ve never experienced with anyone else. 

It was during the beginning of the pandemic so she wasn’t working that summer (and i’m jobless) and we talked every single day. For hours on end. Always making sure to say good morning, goodnight — Never missing a day for almost a year. I think that summer  was the happiest I’ve ever been.

This is where things started going off the rails for me and her, I think. And probably where things get more unrelatable. 

We both joined twitter for a fanbase we shared. And she also started working more. Not talking to her didn’t effect me as much at the time because I got the small daily interactions I now had become used to with other people, and we’d still talk later at night. 

Slowly I realized how toxic the fanbase I was in, and a lot of the bigger accounts would bully others — especially if you didn’t conform to their particular tastes (which I didn’t have). It was very much a situation where if you didn’t try to make nice with them you’d be hated by the community (I promise this all is related to my vent).

tdlr after about 9 months i got harassed off the site and i slowly lost some friends after they made it clear they didn’t care about the bullying that their friends were doing to them, me, and many others. 

i could handle all this until my second closet friend on the site just chose my harassers over me bc she wanted to stay popular on the site. 

then on top of that my dog of 15+ years died. i still haven’t recovered.

so i took a break. and just like that i lost almost every single social interaction and friendship. not being on twt meant it was hard for ppl to keep in contact with me.

and after a month of being off there, it hit me that my best friend and me sometimes didn’t even msg good morning anymore, let alone good night. well, i would msg good morning — it usually went ignored until late. so i stopped. 

and it also hit me I’d been using twitter more and more to cope with me and her not being as close anymore.

i get she was busy. but it still hurt. especially when i saw she would go on twt in the mornings, and she made time to hang out with other ppl on there, but not me.

i spent a lot of time trying to rebuild our relationship. did my best to be understanding, recognizing i was just being jealous, and it’s my isolation that’s making me feel more intensely abt not talking as much. 

nothing was working. and i had felt more lonely than I’ve ever felt in my entire life. before the isolation and no human contact was easy to ignore. i hadn’t experienced what it was like to not be completely friendless and to communicate with others so often. 

and my best friend and me went about a week of not talking for the hundredth time, despite my effort. and i couldn’t do it anymore. i couldn’t repeat me messaging then her hours or days later responding, me responding soon after. and repeat.

i couldn’t keep being this clingy waiting for that notification that would tell my brain that she cared. because that’s what i was being. clingy and dependent. don’t forget being jealous and scared of being replaced. it was unhealthy. and making me complacent to keep living my life in my room. 

she deserves better, and so do i.

i “broke up” with her the other day. basically doing the whole “it’s me not you” bit, and finally saying the worries i had that i had been keeping inside, and that i need to branch out. stay away from online circles. delete all my apps. not talk to her anymore — at least until im in a better place and have other irl friends, maybe go back to school and actually go inside it instead of online. have a life.

this probably could’ve been handled better if i communicated my worries earlier among other things. but what’s done is done. 

i really do miss her. i’ve been crying nonstop. i feel just as lonely. and now i’ve realized how big of a hole i’ve dug myself in. I don’t have the 21 years of experience of making friends or existing in the world that other people my age do. 

It’s so overwhelming to know where to start. I can’t drive so maybe i’ll do that. Not even sure how people make friends outside of college so i guess i’ll just work on my application or something.

but this is all stuff that’s just to a point where i can make friends. ngl i just wanna speedrun this so i can stop feeling so alone. and honesty, so i can go back to being friends with her.

it all feels so bleak rn…but the first step is recognizing that there is a problem, right? so i guess i’ll leave this here with my first step taken.

They reminisce about the past and make up fake social scenarios in their heads much more than others do.

Found a girl on Tinder three months ago that I had a real connection with. Things went fast. We were on the phone 24/7 with constant attention. We live two hours apart and met for the first time after a week. Spent every weekend together from then on with falling asleep over FaceTime every night we were apart. We were up each other’s asses hard.

We had a falling out this last weekend, I pushed her away, which led to us splitting and I’ve been really struggling without the attention. Making me sick. Can’t eat. Can’t sleep.

I had to completely wipe her from my phone and social media to cease all contact in an effort to get her off my mind. 

Normally would just fall back on a side piece but I don’t have any right now since I went exclusive with her. I’ve been waking up at 4:30am to workout and been diving into studying for an exam I have coming up.

881,tillymint24,1635275294,1,"I met sunshine at university during our master's degree. We  both chose to study one of the hardest and longest routes to qualification in the UK. Sunshine was born in another country and grew up initially in a single parent household relatively hand to mouth. She moved to the UK when she was 6, her parent worked very hard and is now extremely well off, remarried and has another child. Sunshines step parent is lovely and they have a good relationship. However her family moved to America when sunshine started her first degree, she has a strange relationship with her mother who seems to compensate for this with money. My background is the picture perfect childhood, very supportive and loving parents, financially I have never wanted for anything although I wouldn't class our family as rich. 

Although sunshine grew up without much she is now very wealthy. We got on very very well at uni, we clicked and she was so much fun. Particularly important as our course was so intense and hard with extremely long hours. She's a little older than me and took some more time out working instead of studying so that she could follow her husband for his career. It was really important to me to qualify as fast as possible in order to get a better salary- I've always been upfront about this. Sunshine got engaged during our final year of our master's degree. She knew my plan was to do my diploma required to qualify fully asap after masters. She was planning her wedding and chose it on a date where I was booked into a residential weekend as part of the course. I couldn't qualify without attending this weekend of lectures. Her wedding venue was a 2.5 hour drive away and my lectures were 8-8 for 3 days. I was supposed to be her bridesmaid but I had to respectfully decline as I had already paid for the course when she announced the date. She was very upset and distant with me and asked if I would consider deferring my exams. 
I said no, this was something I had been working towards for 6.5 years and I was 1 year from finishing. I'd also already paid for the course and our salaries are crap until we qualify. I have a lot of student debt and wanted to progress. 


Sunshines entire wedding was extremely affluent, she had chosen bridesmaid dresses in excess of £300 each (which we were expected to pay for) a venue with a minimum 3 night stay at £280 per night. Plus hair make up hen do etc. I simply couldn't afford this as a student! This was the first issue in our relationship as I felt like she was slightly out of touch with reality and had turned a little bridezilla. Prior to this she had always been a little snobby but never to this extent. A few months after her wedding we did fall back into our normal routine and things seemed much better. 
However, over the last couple of years I feel like she has changed a lot whereas I'm still exactly the same person (personality wise). 

I had a rubbish time during covid 2020 with my employer and had to switch jobs as it had become untenable. A guy that sunshine used to work with was hired as my replacement. Sunshine has done nothing but bitch and complain about this guy for several years - I soon saw why when he joined my place of work as he was awful and I was scared for my clients as I didn't want to leave them in his hands but there was nothing I could do. Sunshine called me to chat and asked me how he was getting on. I then told her and ranted a little about how rubbish he was in terms of his attitude and she just completely 180d. she was saying I don't want any negativity I am close friends with this guy this makes me feel uncomfortable I don't know where you're coming from etc. I was so taken aback as she had brought this up and asked me. It turned into a bit of an argument over video call and I was very upset as I don't like confrontation or rowing. For me I felt like I didn't recognise the person she had become, we had always been supportive and compassionate to each other and she was so cold and detached. I distanced myself. Sunshine has recently turned to veganism, yoga etc which is absolutely fine, but she's become very very judgemental about anyone who doesn't subscribe to this. She has restricted herself from so many things even sugar and refusing to eat anything pre packaged! I do not subscribe to this lifestyle but I was very mindful to arrange lunch dates at places which would accommodate her etc. I felt like this was becoming a one way street and I was being judged and critised for just being myself- the person I have always been around her for years. My partner is a big meat eater, we love to entertain and go out for drinks, party etc when we can due to our stressful jobs but it became really difficult to include her in this.

I really pulled back further during 2021 as I have been having bad health issues and was waiting for an operation this year. She only wanted to schedule calls on a Thursday after work and it was extremely awkward I felt such anxiety on Thursdays trying to come up with safe topics of conversation that it was so draining. Due to work commitments it became virtually impossible to stick to such a rigid call routine and since July we haven't spoken at all. I stopped replying as I felt like I had nothing 'safe' to say. I didn't feel like I could share my health worries with her as my best friend because she was so judgemental and cold when I tried to broach the subject.

I feel awful. My parents regularly bump into her as we live relatively close by and she never asks after me so perhaps she doesn't care anymore? I feel such a loss for the friendship that we once had. My other friends have said that the relationship was toxic and said that I was trying to change myself around her to fit her needs. I agree with this to an extent as I felt so drained, but perhaps toxic is a very big word and not appropriate? I can't bear the thought of us ghosting, but I'm also so nervous to contact her to try and patch things up as there hasn't been a specific incident recently. I just stopped replying as I felt like I was being hurt and I didn't have the emotional capacity to deal with things due to my health worries.

Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks. Should I send her flowers and perhaps write her a letter explaining my feelings? She is very, very extreme about covid so I doubt that she would want to meet me for coffee unless it was outdoors (we live in England it's too cold for me to do this at the moment while I'm healing from surgery) 
 
Any advice would be so much appreciated and I'm sorry for how long this is!! There's a million more things I could say.

If this should be posted in a better suited forum please let me know!

I wander alone, scavenging, travelling off the beaten path
This life is lonely, dangerous, nothing but me 
If I am not enough, I’m sure to die 
But I’m not dead yet

A town I see, I do approach, it’s full of people happy 
I sit and watch, as people run and stroll and scurry
Laughter, talking, debating, bonding, what would I know about it
I’m just a lonely soul watching in envy as people shuffle proudly 

I take my stuff and journey on, the road is tough and hard
All that keeps me company is sadness and old scars
I think about the ways I’m hurt, how sad it is to be me
There’s no one here, nobody cares, just me, my scars and lonely

But I will not give up just yet, no matter how rough the road
No matter how hot it it gets, how windy, how painful, how cold
Cause one thing I have learned from this is living is not easy
The strong endure, we carry on no matter the odds against us

To all my brothers and sisters, I shine a light
Do not give up, not yet, we must continue to fight
Because for us it’s not yet done, you have so much to give

Growing up I've always had struggles with making friends, I HAVE friends currently, but most of them treat me like shit. As in, me asking if they wanna hang out, and they make some bullshit up how they're busy or they already have plans, and I see otherwise on their social media stories. Or only hit me up if they need something. Not all of them, other friends either just never text me, or leave me on read when I invite them to things. I have friends that invite me over to things, very rarely, but when they do it means the world to me because it's so rare that it happens, and I have friends that we talk sometimes or hang out like once a week or so. 
My big thing is I don't know why people don't like me. Ik one guy that everyone thinks is annoying and talks bad about, yet he is always hanging out with a group of people and always doing things. So I don't understand why I have like 2 friends I barely talk or do anything with. I see everyone has a friend that they're always hanging out with, like they're a brother to them. I don't. I want that relationship with a friend. I want that type of friendship, I try with new people I meet, and then will just never talk to me even after I try starting conversations multiple times.

I'm an alchoholic, I might be narcissistic, I sabotage myself all the time. I always dig myself into a hole and try to put it out of my mind content and ignorant. I'm literally the ""This is fine."" Dog in the fire meme. 

I dont have anyone to tell them about this. I have some people to say sorry to, for always saying sorry and never actually putting an effort in to mean it. For the people I always let down in my life. These are empty words to those people because I've done this song and dance so many times. I cant keep doing it. I need to change I need to act like an adult, take responsibility for myself and actually do something for a change. 

I hate myself so much but I need to stop hating myself and start loving myself so that I can change. I'm a delusional idiot and I'm yelling into a void. I dont want pity, I've had too much of that and all it's ever done is encourage me to fail more.",lonely,I'm a failure,2021-10-27 04:27:00

I loved this girl, we had this undeniable chemistry, she was the most beautiful soul I've ever met. We met through my older sister. Spent a lot of time together after that. It was love at first sight and I professed myself and she felt the same.. but wasn't meant to be when my sister found out. I told her it didn't matter what my sis thought of us but she told me it mattered to he cause she was her best friend. She then started calling me 'kiddo' as I tried persistently to convince her it didn't matter. Eventually gave into her wishes and we departed. She remained friends with my sister but we grew apart. As time went on, I've tried to find love in others but it wasn't the chemistry I found with her. A few years later, by chance we met again. We hung out and that spark reignited for me and she told me how she wished we had just stayed together. We would be married, maybe with kids.. and my feelings after hearing that began to feel that love for her again. But turns out she was already in a relationship of 4 years and she told me about him and how she loved him but it was falling apart. Her pure love of him kept them together, I gotta tell you I was jealous of the guy. He also had the same first name as me too. I thought wow, coincidence? Anyway, he cheated, abused and lied to her but she loved him unconditionally. Honestly, I would've given her the world. Anyway, I hate admitting this but I was a shoulder for her to cry on when he cheated and/or disappeared on her. Any excuse to be by her side. I was lonely. We would flirt but I couldn't bring myself to let her cheat with me the way she talked about him. But I continued to be there for her. I started feeling confused, I loved her and she knew this. One night, I realised this wasn't healthy for me or her so I gave her a reason to stop talking to me. We drank and I let it all out, I told her adamantly I was just a distraction for her and she was lonely, as was I but I never told her that. She got back with him eventually. I left the city and went back home to the sticks and stopped talking to her. I was destroyed but knew I did the right thing for the both of us. A year goes by, I finally get over her and move on. I think to myself, well Im ready to get back out there and have fun. So I did.. then she tracks me down out of nowhere with my sister to visit. She professes that she has always loved me and she finally broke her toxic cycle with her ex-boyfriend. She wanted to give me a chance after all these years and my sister told me she's speaking from the heart. I just thought it was weird that she would vouch for her after what she thought of us first time around. Again.. I was confused! I thought about it so I sat her down and kissed her. I look her in the eyes and said she once had me wrapped around her finger and told her it took a lot out of me to get her out of my head. I knew her heart belongs with someone else and my name would only bring her pain. That I would always be known as the other guy. It made her cry and made me feel a deep sadness. She'll never know how much I truly loved her and in a way, it was the closure I've been seeking. She was just lonely and had commitment issues as I know I did. I thought of her when I heard this and expresses how I felt at the time. I guess its better to have loved and loss than not at all.

22M, never been in a relationship. Farthest I've gotten with someone is about 3 dates in. Once they begin moving things forward into intimate territory (not just talking about sex), I never contact them again because for some reason everything about them gives me maximum anxiety. 

I'd say I have major depression, anxiety, chronic loneliness, etc. However I believe all these issues have the same root: Negative self worth. I have zero confidence, none. It effects my ability to socialize, how I work at my job, how I react to failures, basically everything I think and do. I'm not sure if my inability to develop a relationship past a platonic one is related, but hopefully it is. Has anyone realized something similar and made any progress whatsoever in improving their self esteem?

Now about the touch starvation. I cry myself to sleep about 80% of the time, and spend at least an hour or two each day ruminating on the fact that I've never been in a relationship. I'm not a virgin, but I am not focused on sex. I've told a few of my closest friends about this touch starvation, hoping that if we began hugging each other occassionally it would be enough to stave off the touch starvation well enough that I could focus energy on my other issues.

I did have a girlfriend and I dated her for on and off for about 4 years however this was long distance as I never met her in person so I never got to experience anything intimate, unlike her who did in between our breakups.

I know people will just say ''oh losing your v-card isn't important, oh having a girl in your life isn't a big deal'' well it is to me when allot of peers make it seem like a big deal while at 20 that I still HAVEN'T experienced these things. I don't see women as pedestals or objects. I do value them as human beings but I still haven't experienced what 80% of people have done by my age and it is just ruining my life totally, I cannot concentrate ever, I struggle to keep friendships if they have had these things, I often just cut things off.

I have been seeing professional help (3 different psychologists believe it or not) and I explain and they just tell me to get out in the community more which I have been doing but with 0 confidence left, insecurity about my appearance. hurtful things said to me by peers and my ex, How could I ever woo a girl?

Your pain doesn't matter. Your sadness doesn't matter. Your depression doesn't matter. Nobody cares, and no one is coming to save you.

You are a child, alone, and crying on the floor, hoping somebody will come and help you get out of the hole you're in, and take you away from the pain and the burden you call your life. But no help is coming, and no greater force is looking over you.

It's just you.

You need to realize that it's just you that cares for you. If you don't get up and get things done, nobody will come and do them for you. All of your pain comes from hope. The hope that somebody else will carry you through the pain and it's even more painful because nobody is coming and even if they wanted to, you are the only one who can help you.

So accept it.

Get up, do the things you need to do to make your life better, to make yourself happier.

I feel so ashamed of when people tell me they are going out for dinner with a few friends or having someone over for lunch that I just start calling random people in my contact list and invite them for dinner. In the end however I end up eating alone. 

Do I just suck at life in general? Is it fine to feel this way? Should I just accept it, or try to change things? 

I have had this thought of just moving to a different house, in a place where not a lot of people know me. And starting over, but this being alone and not interacting with anyone. I guess my mind is just clouded and I want to put this out there.

957,hiyaitstimefor,1635227067,1,"I don’t even know where to start so sorry if this is all over the place.

My husband and I have been together 7 years and married for 4. We have opened up the relationship a couple of months ago and it’s definitely been a learning experience. I have found a boyfriend who is really important to me and he has a girlfriend now.

There have been a lot of discussions since I felt that my husband was prioritizing her over me. We all met up for a weekend and he was holding her hand in front of me when I specifically had told him not to. Granted, I didn’t react well to it and stormed out instead of pointing out the boundary he was crossing calmly. He also was drinking so I wanted to cut him some slack.

Then last week, I visited my boyfriend for the first time. Since I was going out of town, I agreed to letting my husband invite his girlfriend to our apartment but established a strict boundary that she couldn’t be in our bedroom. She had gotten a tattoo and was in pain so he didn’t want her to sleep on our cramped couch so instead, he decided to let her sleep in our bed and had sex with her in it. My trust in him is utterly destroyed.

We’ve been talking things over for the past few days. I can’t bring myself to tell him I love him or let him touch me.

He told me what happened on Wednesday when he picked me up from the airport, which was also the day she left to go back home. Then on Friday night, he asked me if he could go see her since he knew I would be busy with my gaming stream. He came back Saturday around 8pm and we had dinner together. We hiked together on Sunday, watched a movie and grabbed ice cream then he asked if he could go see her until Tuesday morning. Granted, I spent that extra time with my boyfriend, gaming online.

I just feel like he betrayed me and I’m supposed to just figure it out on my own. I don’t feel supported in a time when he should be there for me. On the other hand, my boyfriend has been extremely understanding and supportive. Letting me vent and treating me to dinner even if it’s not in person. 

It makes me feel that my husband takes me for granted and that my boyfriend is a much better partner to me. It’s just frustrating and confusing since this relationship is so new. I’m scared that I’m falling into a grass is greener trap or that I’m letting go of a long relationship without fighting for it enough. Relationships are hard work but is it worth it when I’m letting go of my pride and self respect?

My husband had cheated on me in the past, he came clean and we worked through it after I understood that he felt abandoned by me as I was focused on a close friend.  The fact that he was so ready to risk our relationship again makes me feel worthless and that I’m not enough for anyone.

Sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to let all these feelings out! I have therapy on Friday so I will be getting help for my obvious self worth issues haha",lonely,Big decisions ahead and feeling overwhelmed,2021-10-26 16:44:27

968,CustomerBusy3456,1635225045,1,"I have never been popular in my life. When growing up, I was always the shy girl who had a couple friends here and there and usually spent time alone because I didn't like attention from others my age. I was into the arts and drew a lot on my free time. I grew up with 3 brothers and mostly male cousins and family members. I found it difficult to hang out with girls because I wasn't super girly but also not totally hoyden. In high school, I made a best friend who was like me in many ways but as we grew up together, we grew apart. She turned into one of the ""mean popular girls"" and I stayed true to myself. I made a good friend who is a male, who I consider my best friend. When we graduated, I had few friends who kept in touch for a couple months. Once college started the only friend I had was my male bff. Sadly, he doesn't go to college and we both have lives to attend to so we rarely see one another. 

I often think about joining sororities or clubs to make social connections, but often times is hard because of COVID. I haven't had a good laugh in years, I have been single for years, I haven't had a good female friend in years... I am lonely. 

I went through a depressive phase 4-5 months ago. It wasn't good, but I got through it myself. I have trouble staying in the present reality when I am in social situations and it feels like I am self sabotaging, but for some reason I can't control it. I feel like an outcast, like a weirdo. I often look back in high school and reminisce over my relationships. I have come to the conclusion that no one really cared about me. I have always been the loyal friend who no one takes a deeper glance at. I don't understand why people aren't attracted to me, on a social level. I am approachable and personable, never hurt a fly.

I wonder who my group of people are, because I long for relationships. I think that if I had a sister we would be best friends, and I wouldn't need anyone else, but that's fantasizing. I long for female companionships because we would relate better, not to say that I don't appreciate my male bff because I do.

My entire life I've been her therapist, housemate, shoulder to cry on, hell, plenty of times I felt like the parent in our relationship. It's exhausting and as time passes, my own baggage piles up and I'm not sure how much longer our relationship can maintain before she cuts me loose in a fit of paranoia or I reach my limit. This is incredibly depressing - despite our issues, I love my mother. She is practically all I have. I am unsure how to operate emotionally on my own. It's frightening, like jumping off of a ship in the middle of the ocean without a life jacket.

TL;DR: Has anyone else struggled with an emotionally dependent single parent, and the potential pain of losing them as a part of your life? How did you cope with it?

I work at Walmart for now. and this post will only be up for a few hours. 

Girl. Works upfront she’s cool and all. 
Me. Works in a few departments and can’t see her too often but wants to be her friend.  

So I’ve tried to walk up and talk but mainly it’s been me giving her gum and being like how are you.  Little chat. Leave. A day ago it was bigger. I asked if she was thirsty so I bought her a sprite and a whole pack of gum cause I just do things like that for my friends that’s normal for me. 
We have called eachother friend a few times. This has gone on for like 2 weeks. But yeah. 

And the issue we have is I was like we should call soon if you have the day off as I do.. she did. 

Because we would be able to actually fucking talk. Oh yeah btw she has my number. 


But no. Today it didn’t happen and I did call her. 
It didn’t happen and it made me very upset. 

Why? Because I have no one. I have no friends. 
The only friends I have are far away and don’t have time to really be friends with me. 

So what do I do. 

Because what I thought I would do is: 

Not talk to her tomorrow (or the next day or the next or the next) at all. Unless she comes to me.  And that’s that. 

But I don’t know

Friendly, sometimes outgoing, plenty of interests, funny on occasion, handsome in the right light sometimes. I can be the life of a party with a light buzz. The performer in me makes me good in crowds I suppose

But...I just don't hold up interpersonally. Maybe i'm boring to people. Maybe it's my ADHD.  I'm not really sure. 

I just like the presence of someone when I'm alone with them. Listening to their reactions during a movie. Laughing with them when they make a joke or find something funny. Listening to their problems. If they ask me something, I'm happy to answer it. But I don't want to play twenty questions trying to get to know you. I just want to be with you.

My public persona seems to convince people that I excel at leading conversations. In reality, if I'm alone with someone I don't want to perform. I don't want to make small talk. I want to be myself. I want to let my mind wonder so I can experience the feeling of narrowing down to the thought of the person I'm without needing to force it.

I just want to be allowed to be boring with someone if I care about them. People don't seem to like that. I know it's a problem with me. There's a social process before getting to the point where being interesting doesn't matter anymore. I just really struggle with the in-between.

The last person I developed feelings for really messed with my head for a bit. She made the first move, and I grew to adore her. There was in her heart a warmth for others and while she had her flaws, they were easy to accept. I was happy to be around her and she made me want to be a better person. And then she stopped talking to me and found someone else. 

She's still a wonderful person in my eyes, but the feeling that I had something but couldn't be normal enough to see it come to fruition (good or bad) makes me sad. That I can't hold up to my own public image.

I don't see a relationship in my future, but there are still other things I know I can bring to this world. I can still change the world, even in small ways. This opens up a door for me that I've dreamed of since I became an adult. When I have the means to support it, I will probably come to adopt some children. I can dedicate what remains of my life to create a brighter future in kids who may never have known what it was like to be loved and supported. Something I know would likely be an issue in any relationship where kids are on the table

I broke up with someone I met online, we were both madly in love with each other. This person was like no other in the world, we were perfect for each other. I’ve never been cared for or loved like that before, and i’ve never care about someone like that before. I made us part ways before meeting because I knew we wouldn’t just go out for dates. If we had sex he would’ve seen my body. 

I used to be morbidly obese, I’ve lost the weight but my body’s ruined because of it. Not only that, but the way my body looks regardless, its naturally extremely ugly. No exaggeration, it really does look extremely ugly, I would describe it but I literally don’t even know where to begin. 

It definitely would have put him off. 

I’m so digusted by the appearance of my body that I never even look in the mirror, let alone let anyone else see me naked, it makes me feel sick, and would make anyone else feel sick, if I were someone else, even I wouldn’t have had sex with me, thats how bad it looks. 

He deserves better. He deserves beautiful, and i know thats what every guy needs. I didn’t want to be selfish and hold him back in this regards, so I made us part ways before we met in person. I made us break up without a proper explanation. 

The level of mental and emotional pain I feel right now after losing this person, someone I loved unconditionally, more than anyone else I’ve ever loved, and respected so much, is unbearably torturous. 

I’ve never felt so unstable before in my life. I feel so alone, I feel suicidal, I feel very sick mentally. I have no one to turn to. 

I’ve always been depressed, but this person no longer being in my life is what pushed me completely off the edge. I feel guilty for causing him pain by ending it, but I know that someday he’ll forget me and be able to move on and find someone new. That thought breaks me.

I don’t think I can live without him, I don’t think I can grow old completely alone and misreable without a partner, without a family. Being alone like that while watching everyone around me able to live their lives is my biggest fear.

997,shi1t,1635214739,1,"A year ago I posted a thread [for one week, I wasn't lonely](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/kjzw3f/for_one_week_i_wasnt_lonely/). This is an update on how this experience changed me, and where I am now, as well as the lessons I've learned along the way.  For those of you too lazy to read the thread, I will summarize it for you: I thought I started a relationship with a wonderful girl and it changed my life, but she thought we were just jokingly planning a future together. These were my feelings at the start:

&gt;I felt motivated. It seemed so strange. You know that dark veil that you see when you try to look ahead into the future? It was gone. I started working out again, had to put on some weight and muscle. I remembered my ambition. I am a postgrad student and I had nearly given up prior to this. There are three years of research in logic I've done that I haven't published. I used to happily spend the entire day thinking about that stuff while drinking tea and pacing through the house. It's been so long since I've done that. I faced some failures and got scared. But now, when she says she believes in me, it felt like I couldn't let her down. And funnily enough, after looking at it again after so long, I've had a breakthrough in my research. A lot of good things happened so quickly. I made some phone calls, and I even demanded a promotion from my job.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you know what's really funny? I always thought it's really selfish to have children. How could I possibly drag someone into this world, and condemn them to be living, when I myself didn't think it is particularly worth it? But we were talking about starting a family and making this a serious relationship. I told her, I couldn't believe this is what it's like when you have something to look forward to in the future.

And then she broke the news that she was just kidding, and that she wasn't really looking for a relationship. It broke my heart, but I was optimistic about healing:

&gt;What happened sounds like a nightmare. But strangely enough, if I could rewind time and stop myself from doing this, I wouldn't do it. I am glad I misunderstood her. It hurts, but it feels good to be hurting. For the first time in so long I have realized what it takes for me to stop being sad and to look forward to the future in a genuine way. A flame was rekindled within me, and I thank her for it, even if it was done so by an accident. I'll continue working out, and I will finish my studies. It's good to be reminded that I don't hate life itself, just the one I am currently living - and I can change that if I just brave through it.

I have remained close friends with her over the past year. We still talk regularly and I deeply care about her, although now in a non romantic way. She apologized for the entire ordeal, and we moved past it. This experience led me through some emotional rollercoasters and toughened me up. Overall, I thought that it made me more resilient when it comes to trying my luck in love. After all, what could possibly go worse than being in a relationship and then finding out it was just for a joke?

Either way, this is why I wanted to try falling in love again. I knew that I looked forward to the future when I thought I was in a relationship, so I wanted to have that again. There was a girl who really liked me at the time, and I thought that I should give her a chance and see if it leads us anywhere. We quickly made a connection and started dating. However, our relationship was overly sexual, and any time we disagreed it would turn into a huge deal. Three months later, she cheated on me, and I broke up with her. As bad as this sounds, it wasn't so terrible. I feel like an awful person for saying this, but I feel like we were both mentally checked out of the relationship before it happened. I still talk to her from time to time, and we rely on each other emotionally in tough times, but I wouldn't call us close friends.

A couple of months afterwards, I started talking with a really nice girl. I've known her for a few years prior to this, but we've never really been close. It was incredibly difficult to earn her trust, but we shared so many hobbies and it is really nice to talk to her. She's funny, she's cute, she's smart, she's caring. If you bundle every good quality you can think of into one person, that's her. I would marry her if I could, but you see that's the trick: I didn't know she's a lesbian. We still talk daily and are great friends. She's had a profound influence on who I am as a person and on my beliefs. But once again I was unlucky.

In the meantime, I had some quicker-lived attempts too. I chatted up three friends and it turned out that all of them had long term boyfriends.  

Last but not least, I offer to you my final failure. There's a really caring girl that I've known for years now. She would check up on me when I felt sad. If any one of family members died or got seriously sick, she would be there and help me deal with it. We have recently been talking more and more, and I found myself slowly developing feelings for her, all while I helped her deal with her trauma and abuse. However, today when I joined a new discord server, I accidentally found her there. I couldn't resist the temptation of looking up her messages, only to realize that her personality is a lot different to how she had been presenting herself to me. Not only that, but she's had a boyfriend for four years that she hasn't mentioned to me, despite me asking if she was single, and giving her opportunities to mention him. I left the server, and am feeling like I've just eaten a sock.

At this point all I can say is, fuck lessons. Fuck having to constantly rationalize bad experiences and trying to grow from them. I am really tired of trying. I promise I'm really trying. But life really can't throw me a bone from the looks of it. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I don't know where to look for a girlfriend anymore. You see, one year ago I was full of hope thinking ""if I really just tried, I could get out of this mess"" but now I see that the pit is deeper than what I naively thought. Even when I try, I can't seem to get out of it.",lonely,A one year update on my loneliness,2021-10-26 13:18:59
998,Fabulous-Advantage,1635214717,1,"I (early 20) had reached out to a bunch of new people and I was wondering why no one really wanted to meet past a couple times. Then I thought maybe it's because I'm not really offering what they want in the friendship. (Like I want to meet and I don't know if they) And it wasn't because I didn't offer, it was because I didn't know what they want/they wouldn't say/I couldn't. 

I felt like everything socially was taken from me, now how I had to battle whether my family is there for me or not, years of trying to make friends, doing therapy and not having results; I don't know, it's hard to want to really be there for people if it's not reciprocated. And sometimes it is the first few times but then it falls away and they fall away and maybe it's self-hatred or something from all the negative internal voices I had to hear and now I get to wonder how to change that from years? Just thinking of all the work I had already put in, and how I still couldn't make myself want what I wanted or how the roots may have gone down into the child where the effort for change required I can't help but think it is almost impossible. 

I am literally reaching out, and they are not wanting to meet, I've been doing this for years if it has to go down to the way I'm reaching out or what I'm suggesting then the process is hopeless, but I know it's not which drives the frustration (and the anger).",lonely,Change almost feels impossible,2021-10-26 13:18:37

1000,brendan___859,1635213927,1,"I have no friends. In a literal sense. I have zero friends.

I've had a rough year. High school is mammoth pain in the ass and everyone around me is either boring and uninteresting, or just plain horrible. I'm in grade 12 now but I have had problems with my emotions for a while, specifically moderate depression and mild anger management issues, both of which have gotten worse with the latter of the two taking a toll on my life. I feel unbelievably angry over the smallest and most insignificant things. It could be the volume of the classroom, what people are talking about, the smell of someone's perfume, or the fact that we're in school. I'm always angry and always lonely and I don't know what I can do about it. There have been incidents where the anger got to an unhealthy level and there were some altercations.

It's been a persistent problem throughout my childhood. One that began to drive me and others apart. It doesn't help that I'm also a huge nerd about anime and death metal, interests where I have yet to find one person who really likes at least one of the two. I can't relate to anyone and as a result, I stopped trying to be friends with anybody at around grade 10.

Most of the friendships I did make at the time either grew boring, or we simply stopped talking when they moved away. I've never had a longtime friendship that lasted more than 1-2 years.

Honestly, I'm scared that I'll either never find a meaningful relationship, drive away those I do find, or even end up in prison as a result of my emotional problems. I feel trapped at school and have considered skipping but haven't followed through. 

I'm lonely and scared for the future.

I want to see people who are excited whenever I enter a room instead of going away. I want people I can sit around who can make me laugh and smile. I want people who don't avoid me or try to escape a conversation with me.

I want to be happy.

I’ll be using a throwaway for various reasons. 

I am starting to get really depressed that my time will never come. Even though I’m a good looking guy and have a good personality, I feel the girls I’m attracted to are not at all attracted to me. I go to a big party school where frat culture is very prominent. I live in a house with my friends (who are all in a frat - I’m the only one that didn’t get in) and they can’t invite me to anything since only females are allowed in. Along with that, my roommates (including the girls) all pregame at my house and I’m left out of that too. 

The reason why I brought up the frats is because the girls around here only seem be interested in frat guys. Also my school is predominantly white and I’m Indian so that could play a role too. 

I’ve only ever made out with a girl once. Every weekend my roommates come home with stories of who they got with and it makes me so jealous. It’s getting hard to handle being alone.

1021,moonblisters,1635202653,1,"You won't read this, not only because this very sentence is my petty attempt at reverse psychology, but because what I'm about to talk about is very boring.


Chess used to be named Chaturanga, which is a sanskrit word translating to ""the four limbs"", which alludes to four military divisions. The divisions: Infantry, elephantry, cavalry, and chariots. The elephant in Chaturanga, later changed to the bishop in the 15th century, moved diagonally two squares at a time. When the elephant became a bishop, it could move as far as it wanted, no longer restrained to the two square rule. This new rule, along with the advent of the queen and other rules, intensified chess play as games became significantly sharper, shorter, and ultimately more consequential. The elephant, an animagus, became more powerful as a bishop.


In chess, pieces which have access to a high number of squares are generally considered stronger than pieces controlling a low number of squares. Like I said, the bishop moves on the diagonals as far as it wants to. Unlike the knight, which can hop over shit, the bishop can be obstructed by pawns and other pieces, limiting its scope on the board and the number of squares it has access to. Are you asleep yet? It's interesting, you know. The knight and bishop have the same point value (3) and are generally considered equal, but they are good at different things, and are preferred over one another depending on positional circumstances. A bishop is considered stronger than a knight in the ""endgame"", which is when most of the pieces have been removed from the board. Because? Wait, are you listening?? I knew you weren't paying attention. Dumbass, the bishop is stronger in the endgame because that is when it is least obstructed!


Here's the point. I wondered why the simple acquisition of space made the bishop stronger. It's obvious, isn't it? The question is self-explanatory. Apparently self-explanatory. The question seems to answer itself because ""space good"". But what happens in that space that is so important? ""Because you can attack more!"" seems to be the obvious answer. In fact, I've heard this space axiom communicated roughly through the question: ""How many squares does your piece attack""? 


This gets worse. And it's not going to be worth it when you're done reading, either, which is why you aren't reading this. Which is why you stopped reading! Which is why you never started reading. Your ass is stinky.


Ok ok, here's where it gets even more boring. I made you a diagram. I'm really sorry. [Refer to this image.](https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/contents/view?contentsToken=1635202251246LOEv31p&amp;currentIndex=1&amp;linkUrlVersion=V1) Notice the bishop's potential squares branch off into potential squares. Every square you ""attack"" is a square which you can go to, which itself contains a number of squares you can go to. Not only do the movement possibilities of your bishop increase exponentially when her obstruction level decreases, but the possibilities abruptly shift when your bishop actually moves.


The hard part is over. Congratulations on reading like three paragraphs, genius. Now let's go over some key terms:


space

movement

possibility


I'm sure you're anticipating a nauseating metaphor now, and how could I not take the opportunity to hurl allegorical shit at you when chess is such a powerful and quintessential starting point for symbolic thought? I've been really depressed lately. I don't like to talk about it, so I don't. When you're alone everyday, alone with your thoughts, there's this sort of quietness that settles within your heart. And you feel still. And time becomes serrated. And you think of all the reasons you're alone. And walls begin to close in on your consciousness. After what we have all been through during this bullshit pandemic, I'm sure you all can relate on some level. I think about what I am doing here. I think about how I was once not alive, and now I am alive, and then I will no longer be alive again. In the context of time, even a long life is a flicker in the sky. I went on a date this summer. I asked my date what made her life worth living. She told me she was born with a natural desire to live. To live through such a time of isolation, and to come out of it only to hear someone actually say something like that... I still don't understand. The subject of conversation naturally changed and I continued to eat my tacos. 


space

movement

possibility


I take comfort in this system as a metaphor. It's so natural and obvious. It's weird the things you don't see until you're ready to see them. I think as human beings we are, for whatever reasons, inclined to reject possibility under the pretense that what we already have is working for us just fine. And that's cool, and that's fine, but we are products of what we have seen and experienced. What happens in the space outside of ourselves, outside of what we see? I think some seriously vital truths are always in a state of natural deviation from our individual journies for self-actualization. I am tired. I feel like fucking shit, and I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not able to say that outloud for fear of coming off as some kind of defeatist sadboy. Let me break it down: Where I come from, deciding that life is not worth living is deemed a medical emergency rather than an informed opinion, and I can tell you from experience: people don't like being around you when you are down, ugly, poor, or wrong, as if all of these things were not consequential of a natural process which exists beyond ourselves and our dumb opinions about anything.


If you're reading this, know that you are not alone in your loneliness. Imagine your loneliness as a new square. Space. See the possibilities and feel confused. Feel the instability and discomfort. Admit to yourself loneliness is the wooziness of some kind of freedom. Take pride in your blunders, because not everyone is capable of admitting to fault. Take reality at your own pace, be good, and have the integrity to recognize when one inhibits the other. If you are not confused, then we have nothing in common, and I like you. Life is a flicker in the sky. Emptiness is space. I don't know about you, but I'm here to do some cool ass shit.",lonely,(You won't read this),2021-10-26 09:57:33

I was at UCLA last year and decided to withdraw for a quarter to figure out what I wanted to major in. I also withdrew because I believed I chose UCLA for the wrong reasons: prestige and the fact I had friends there. But part of me also worries I chose this path because my boyfriend would live 1-2 hours from me if I were at UCLA. I'm at a community college rn, but the loneliness has become pretty intense. I see my boyfriend pretty often, but he's a student with responsibilities too, so it gets lonely regardless. I sometimes get tempted to go back to UCLA because I feel so isolated - because I have close friends there - but I keep telling myself that's not a way to make a decision. I'm also worried part of the reason I keep convincing myself not to go back is because my boyfriend is closer while I'm at a CC. I honestly don't know how to separate making a decision from other people. UCLA *is* a great school, I just don't know how to view deciding where to go to school post-CC when I'm so fucking lonely.

I’ve been a full time parent for about 6 years now and around 80% of that time I’ve been single. I have become isolated to the point where I don’t know what I want. I’m not happy and I would like to make friends or even a relationship but on the other hand is it to late too. I don’t have any mates and the only person I hear from is my mother lol I knew I was lonely but it hit home the other day when my eldest came home from school and said he’s going back out to meet some friends at the park. 

I’ve been single for 3 years because I just wanted to be a good dad and put all my efforts into trying to raise my kids right and be there for them. But I miss not having someone relationship or friendship for myself. I was in my old job for 10 years of my life and when I choose to leave to be there for my kids I never heard from any of them again. 

Be nice to hear from someone else besides my mum I guess lol kinda bring a a man down. I miss laughing and having good banter ya know. Feels good to say it. Thanks for reading of you got this far.

Just so happens that she’s a girl who goes to my school ( senior, I am) that I have had in some of my classes the past years, and one I’ve always loved from afar cause I never had the cajonès to say anything to her. Really- if I’m being Frank here, what the fuck am I supposed to say to a girl like this? It’s one thing if I’ve known them from working in a group project, sitting next to them etc. but if a girl is smack dab ACROSS the fuckin room, talking to 50 million of her Friends, how in the everloving shit am I supposed to mosey on up, interrupt their dialogue, and just look like a total fucking bitch?? I have NEVER seen anyone do something like this in my 18 years of living, yet everyone I know is swimming in girlfriends up to their fuckin ears. Makes no sense. Anyways, I saw this girl working the cash register at GIANT, I was with my family so I didn’t say anything like “hey do you remember me” because she most definitely has no fucking clue who I am and I didn’t want to be embarrassed in front of my family. Anywho, I decided to visit the GIANT after school today (we had early dismissal so we left at 12) and my darling was working a cash register. I walked up to her aisle, and there was a guy in front of me with a bunch of bullshit. As she was ringing up his items, she said to me “do you have anything to buy sir?” And I fucking froze. I knew it, I goddamn fucking knew that walking up there empty handed was fucking stupid. I just grabbed a bunch of gum, candy, drinks and shit until she didn’t look so pissed. I was up, she was ringing my shit up, and all the rolls of gum  had a hard time rolling up the conveyor belt because they’re cylindrical. She said to me “next time just use the fucking self checkout please” and that’s when I snapped. I took the rolls of gum that weren’t rolling up, and I furiously ran them over the barcode scanner. They were all accounted for, I took them in a bag and I spiked them to the ground like a fucking football, like rob gronkowski does. She let out a scared exclamation, I left the rest of my shit there and stormed out. I got in my car, peeled off, and I’m laying low 2 hours away so the police don’t get me for this shit.

He said, I'm the only one he gets drinks with from time to time. He said most of his real friends are back home where he's from. He's hasn't lived there in nearly 20 years. I said so, u don't have anybody here. He said he has his wife, and one other friend, but has nobody else to go hang out with. I asked why that was.

A little backstory. My last relationship ended when I was 19 after we had been together just over a year. We hooked up a couple times after we officially broke up but eventually I decided to move on. I spent the next couple of years moving from one casual relationship to the next with one timers from tinder and other such places. I got pretty good at finding these hookups for a while which if you saw me, you'd be as impressed as I am looking back.

Then that all stopped when I spent a few months in new Zealand. I think that going there must've knocked my confidence a little bit as it didn't go that well (I had fully planned on being there at least two years and yet it ended being a few months, story for another time)

I'm not bothered about a relationship, i wouldn't turn down the right one but I mostly like my life how it is. I have good mates, a decent place to live and a good job.

Is it sad to just miss the sex?

First, if you are fortunate enough to have a variety of interest, physical or mental, you must make a real effort to develope them. If that don't work, you can search out and help the less fortunate. If you are not up to that, you are thrown back on the conscious cultivation of your five senses and intellectual powers. At the very least, you can tell God every mourning that you hold yourself available for use as his instrument, if only by praying Him to bless everyone whom you meet.

If these alternatives don't work, there is only one thing left; plain, simple, rock-bottom acceptance. Stop pitying yourself, stop rebelling, throw in the towel, and surrender to the obvious fact that since God allows it and you cant escape it, it must ba best for you and everyone.

Were those just sweet lies?

I honestly feel like there is no hope for me.

I am not ugly and somewhat fit, I treat women with respect and I can keep a conversation flowing. I am funny and creative and some other good things. Yet women don't find me attractive. I don't know what is wrong with me.

For a while now, I've been liking a friend of mine. When she texts, she seems like she just might be interested, but when we meet, it feels like she is so distant. Mixed signals usually mean that she's not into me. It makes me feel like a fool and heartbroken.

Other than her, I don't think there are women who could find me interesting in any way. Plus, I am not a guy who really likes discos, which are places where people often hookup, and OLD has always given me a bad time. The few friends I have don't introduce me to new people and the few times that it has happened, nothing really came out of it, not even friendship.

And I'm tired of advice such as ""you have to stop thinking about relationships and it will come when you least expect them to"" or ""focus on improving yourself"".

1119,QueerSkyBall,1635150757,1,"Hello all, 

I will try not to make this depressing for anyone but here goes.   I'm in my thirties, I have a decent job, I have my own apartment, I am in relatively good health and working on improving that.  I have no major disability or health issues, but have been diagnosed in the past with ""generalized anxiety disorder"" and depression.  I have several hobbies and interests that are somewhat enjoyable and a select few I am deeply passionate about.  The would be things like photography, writing, and more recently some basic woodworking, building, painting, general handyman type stuff.  I'm also not terrible at things like cooking, video games, etc.  

Yes I am of course grateful for what I do have, and that many of my concerns can be very ""first world problems"", but the things I do not have can be unbearably painful.  I haven't been in a relationship or had a close friendship for years.  I have no relationship with family aside from my mother and father.  This includes not seeing a single photo or having a single visit with my newest nephew in the 6 months or so that he has been on this earth.  I would explain the backstory on this, but its painful to think about.  Maybe once I've connected with some of you or developed some trust.  I've had some extremely low points in my life, but have come to the realization that I would never do something to myself or end my life.  And in some odd way, because of this, I am now prompting myself to make efforts to make my life less lonely and sad.  I'm not sure if that part makes sense but its how I feel.  Ask me to explain it again if I am a rambling mess.  haha

I am open to talking on here, on kik, or whatever app you are comfortable with.  I won't put information in this thread as its a sub rule, but feel free to ask me.  I also have XBOX Live, don't have a ton of games for it but its another fun way to communicate while doing something.  I'll warn you though, 90% of the time I prefer cooperative/teamwork situations in games.  I am not really a play against eachother all the time type of gamer.  I'm also a patient gamer, meaning if you enjoy the ""planning"" or slow play of tactical or strategy type games we would get along great with that.  Or even the ""grind"" type games where you keep playing to find specific rewards or special items.  You know what I mean.  Looter shooters?  That might be what the cool kids call it.

As a random aside, and a little insight into my interests, the name QueerSkyBall actually comes from an old newspaper article about a UFO sighting.  The old-timey headline indicated people in the town had seen a Queer Sky Ball (as in a strange ball of light in the sky).  Yes I am one of those UFO/alien types. :)

I am a very open and warm person when given the chance.  I find if I am treated fairly and respectfully I can connect well with anyone (which makes the need for this post all the more ironic, right?).  Anyways, I would ideally like a fairly close and strong friendship but am open to more.  I am not specifically looking for a relationship, just someone or some people to talk to.  I am pretty sensitive and empathic so I could be someone you came to for advice and support, and vice versa.  Not sure what else to say, but let me know if you want to talk.  I will check my messages.  

Thanks for reading!

I’m now in a friend group, but i mostly don’t really feel like i’m their friend. I’m second year middle school (system in The Netherlands is different i think that would be Junior High), and there are these kids i knew since first year. But this year i moved classes because i also moved levels (i can’t really explain that, you usually move “levels” if you have very high/low grades) and we coincidentally got in the same class. These 2 kids are now friends with the other kids. One kid (from that group) told me i can always sit with them, but i usually don’t because i feel like i’m bothering them. And they do invite me to events they are planning sometimes.

They also have a group chat where they talk and have fun, and whenever i try to say something i just feel excluded. Mainly because they don’t really pay attention to my messages mostly. And whenever i sit with them i feel like i’m just there, it’s like they completely forgot me.

I have 2 friends but they live in a different country so we can’t see each other every day.

I really wish i had friends and that i could be more socially confident like a normal person. Mainly because i don’t want to be lumped in with a certain boy from my class (he is pretty much of an outcast but he still did some bad things) and it just makes me so insecure.

Long story short. I was suicidal, the one girl invited me to a gathering, a girl I was acquaintance witha couple years before. I am aware that this girl is out of my league, and she has a boyfriend (a chad version of me, Middle Eastern, almost exactly the same unique name, weird coincidences god knows). Now I hadn’t socialised in years, I had gone through some seriously tough things in my life and was constantly considering suicide, I went to the bathroom and cried. She barged it open caught me crying and gave me a look I’ll never forget, something in between disgust and boredom. Later we were chatting and I was planning my suicide, she then messaged me about something work related. I shared my suicide plan with her, because she was the only one there with me in my life. I had nobody. She said she wanted to help, then for the following two months made ‘chat appointments’ that she would ghost out on me for, she out wardly insulted me, manipulated lied and gaslighted me the moment I brought up my social issues (not even remotely sex related) she started treating me like garbage (while posting pro mental health bs on social media). I could not believe her hypocrisy she made me wait for weeks and weeks just for 10 minutes of chatting, lied and lied about times, then when I told her about my life she accused me of ‘breaking boundaries’ it turns out she was only prepared to have small talk with me, but even when I tried that she continued to ghost me. I don’t understand why I’m treated like this, even in a non sexual context. Is it just because she is out of my league? Is the world that shallow that she can’t even look past this petty thing? I humiliated myself over and over in front of her. I’m nothing now, I have had social and sexual and physical anhedonia since my suicide attempt.  She was a part of my suicide note because at that moment I was so lost and alone that I genuinely believed she was trying to help me. I didn’t care about her fucking alphaboyfriend I wouldn’t have even cared if she called me while getting banged by this guy. The guy studies the same subject as me, drives a bmw is fit, was in sports clubs, multiple girls flocked him, now he graduated first class.Meanwhile I failed my uni course even though my studies were the only thing i had my teachers always said I’d win the Nobel prize, people are asking me where I am in life they would never. Believe what happened to me. I used to be so smart and had a successful future but depression and social anxiety ruined that. My social anxiety prevented me from opening up to a therapist or to friends because I d be afraid of being seen as weak and gets even more ostracised, well it turns out that my social anxiety was once of the most rational things iveer  ever done socially speaking. Now ever since my suicdie attempt I’ve had full blown anhedonia. Physical mental. I have a numb penis, I’ve lost my sexuality have no pleasure during orgasm, I cant taste food, I can’t feel satisfaction or joy from anything it even eating. My uni counselling service shamed me for giving her a suicide note essentially saying don’t be a cringe weirdo in the nicest way possible. It’s been a year. Since then my balls have stopped producin semen, when I cum I get a clear liquid. I have not been able to feel any pleasure at all since not with orgasm not with. Anything. I’ve lost my attraction to the opposite sex. I’ve lost my drive to socialise I’ve been living ij pure isolation for 4 years.

Even if she didn’t care about me , she could have at least guided me towards a place where she could. She essentially said ‘do you not have anyone else to speak to?’ No my therapist replied every 3 weeks and my parents are part of my depression, I can’t speak to them my grandma died of suicide she had schizophrenia and my other two grandparents died of covid 19 that year. I have no friends don’t you understand. I wish I was this bold with her instead I let her lie and I believed her lies ‘im busy’ when she was having fun all the time. I let her drive me crazy. I put the blame on myself and asked her to forgive me. Then after about 10 interactions in 6 months of pain she forgave me, essentially implied that I was weak and ‘needed help’ and that once day i would laugh at how weak I was. When in reality  actual I was stronger than her stupid chad who she w worshipped would ever be. I have suffered with mental illness my life has been filled with unbelievable struggles I come from a poor background and I’m an immigrant. The least. Deserve is some respect and dignity while I am suicidal but I think she would rather make herself believe that I’m a weirdo who needs to be blocked than believe that a lonely beta deserves an ounce of dignity or friendship during a time where he has no other options


Why. I’m tired, I used to care about how attractive I was. Now I’m practically asexual, my life is over. I’m broken. I can’t feel fear, hope, happiness, satisfaction, I can’t feel anything I have severe anhedonia. I’ve never even held hands with a girl or expressed my feelings towards a girl. I barely talked to a girl in my life that way, I grew up in a conservative Muslim household.

At the beginning of the semester, I hung out with a group of friends but I quickly realized we don’t have a common ground. They quickly picked up on it and stopped inviting me to their hangouts. Even when I suggested to do things like hiking, they’d completely dismiss me. I feel super lonely seeing them meet new people everyday, living the dorm experience. And before you say it, I tried getting to know students in my classes but that’s the only time we talk and though they’re sweet, they don’t seem interested to hang out. I’ve also joined a club but haven’t found luck yet; most of the people I met were sophomores who have already formed their social circles.

I’ve been occasionally hanging out with my sisters friends but they’re graduating soon anyway, and it doesn’t help my loneliness either. I hear them recalling instances of their freshman year, the funny encounters, and it saddens me that I don’t have any stories to tell (sorry if this sounds cheesy). Now halloween is soon, their schedules are packed with parties, and i’m embarrassed to say that i don’t have any plans or someone to hang out with.

I wish I could live off campus but I don't want to overwhelm my father with the dorm fees + tuition fees.

I found some cool freshman students on instagram that I feel like I’d get along with and thought of dming them and telling them that I live off campus so I’ve been trying to meet new people. I feel like now is the perfect chance since we’re only 2 months in but I don’t want to come off as creepy. I’ve told my sister the idea and she called me lame for it, and that we should at least have something in common. I honestly don’t know how to go on about it, and as embarrassing as it sounds, I’m desperate for friends. I don’t want to spend the next 4 years of my life like this.

I want to get a fish tank and have something to give attention to until I fully process the loss.

I want to do things to help myself and have slowly done things off of my list (i.e. therapy/meds, self care, work/sleep schedule) but have still had issues being social and finding new things to enjoy or even keep up with due to my bipolar II depressive episodes. I don't really know where to go from there.

1149,ballisticautistic09,1635131645,1,"According to the authors, there are a set of identifiable signs in people who are depressed. And these signs include being emotionally exhausted and stressed. Being low in energy and enthusiasm.  
And although they look tired and 'low' on the outside, they are actually overly stressed on the inside. Flooded with cortisol.

The realization I had after reading that had to do with my observation of how some people respond to their children.

I have seen countless times in families around me, and especially in my own Nfamily, that adults respond with ""Oh he/she (the child) is just wanting attention"" and ignore the Childs tantrums. ""Oh they're just tired"" ""oh they're just angry i didn't buy them their toy"". This sort of generalizing on the Childs behavior is a form of abuse that they do. 

Its known as Neglect. And its so difficult to identify whose neglecting their children because of the excuses the parent is making.

1152,umm-yeahno,1635131455,1,"So, after awhile of reflecting on my relationships, I’ve realized that having friends or people in general to talk to doesn’t cure loneliness. 
Truth be told, it just makes it 10x worse. 

It’s knowing that there are actual people out there who know you and know how you are (mentally), yet they’re not really there for you. I’m not sure if that actually makes sense, but when you have a lot of people who you’d consider friends not respond to your texts/calls when you need them to, it’s just a super lonely and gut-wrenching feeling. 

It hits a lot harder when you always tend to their needs and wants, yet all the do is just ghost or barely put effort into a response. It feels like a reoccurring experience, no matter who I meet or talk to, they don’t actually care about me.

It’s almost as bad as not having anyone to talk to. However, in that case, at least you know for certain you’ve got no one to talk to, and you know you’re not purposefully being ignored or hurt. 

All I want is for someone to genuinely and equally appreciate my presence and thoughts. However, I know deep down inside it’ll take years until that happens.",lonely,having friends doesn’t help with loneliness,2021-10-25 14:10:55

Despite this, I cannot deny the fact that I am so fucking lonely. I would give anything to feel wanted by someone else, not just as a friend but as a romantic partner.

1177,DCT1997,1635122854,1,"I just turned 24. Throughout my entire life I never had friends. I'm not kidding.

I never experienced being invited to someone's house, a birthday party, the mall, movies, etc.

I never hung out with anyone outside of school.

I've met various people in school and at work, but our relationship never goes beyond its context.

When school or work is over, the relationship is over.

School and work brings us together because it's a place you have to go to out of obligation, but I never did anything voluntary with anyone.

I’ve never maintained contact with anyone I’ve met in my life. It’s been 6 years since I graduated high school. I don’t keep in touch with anyone. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been out of university. I don’t keep in touch with anyone from there.

I live with my parents. I work in a cafe. When I get off work, I go straight home, go to my room, and just go on my laptop. This is what I do in my free-time.

I’m starting to get lonely.

Growing up I dealt with a condition known as Social Anxiety. I had a pretty severe case of it. I would get debilitating anxiety around other people, in public places, in performance situations, etc. I was very self-conscious and was always worried about what people are thinking about me, how I come across, people thinking I’m weird or awkward, embarrassing myself, etc.

Because of this condition, I didn’t go out much and I had a hard time opening up and bonding with other people.

I hardly left the house. I spent the majority of my time in my room either watching TV, playing video games, or going on my iPod.

In school I was quiet and kept to myself. I would get asked all of the time by people “Why are you so quiet?”

My Dad would get on me growing up on not making friends and spending too much time in my room. He would tell me, “You need to break out of this habit. I don’t want you ending up alone. I don’t want you to be a hermit. Who do you hang out with in school? Why are you always by yourself?” I would get mad and irritated.

However, now I am starting to see what my Dad was talking about.

I even feel like my siblings are starting to kind of exclude me out. I’m the youngest of 4. I’m the last one still living at home.

They all text each other and what not. They meet up. I don’t really participate.

I just feel like it’s too late to turn this around. It’s hard to make friends at this age. Especially starting from scratch. I’m just starting to get discouraged. I’ve had opportunities to develop some good friendships, but I wasted those opportunities.

I’ve missed out on a lot of things and a lot of experiences.

I worry I’m going to spend the rest of my life being friendless and reclusive.",lonely,I've never had friends.,2021-10-25 11:47:34

Let me first introduce you to my story. 
I am feeling this way because a ""friend"" of mine was staying over here for a couple of days. In reality I was always repeating to myself that I am not in love with her and we are just really good friends, but after she broke up with her bf I couldn't take my shot properly(literally I am loving her that much that I don't have the balls to admit my feeling to her, because I'm weak piece of s**t and I fear I will lose her as a friend as well) so we just remained friends and she started dating another guy, because of this and other things I decided to move out of not only my town but my country too(I mean she was not the only reason I moved out, but the situation between us was one of the main reasons).

I moved out and started working in another country, its been a few months since I arrived here and everything was going on alright - ish. I didn't talked with her for quite some time then out of nowhere she called me and said she will come in a week or so to visit me for a few days (not because she had to do something, but purely because she misses me)(I'm talking about big distances, few thousand kilometer to be precise). I couldn't be more happy about it, because of the fact that I felt wanted again.

Long story short, she came, we spend the last few days doing everything together, basically these were maybe the best days for me in years. But as always, everything good should come to an end, now that she is gone, I feel even worse than before, I mean I almost forgot her man, I was almost ready to move on, and now I'm at the starting line again if not even further back.

Sometimes I think the feelings are mutual, but maybe it's my head playing tricks to me. Internally I know that we will never be together, but damn, in the past I did some drugs, and I've never experienced withdrawals as strong as these from knowing that I will never be enough and she will never love more than as a friend.(sometimes I am even questioning if she feel something about me at all) 

If you think stimulant and opiates withdrawals are awful, try love withdrawals, nothing worse than these. I started doing drugs mainly to forget the situation between us and the fact how big of a coward I am, and she totally disapproves everything related to drugs, if that's not an iron E than I am not sure what is(she don't know about my problems with drugs and the cause of it, but if she eventually found out it will be the end to everything between us, I just can't stand myself)",lonely,You can laugh as much as you want but this is how I feel,2021-10-25 09:09:44

Realising that sometimes I could disconnect from the world, social media, etc. and when I return not even have a message wondering if I’m okay. 

Then I also realise that people are busy with their own lives, sadness and stress. 

I don’t notice if other people go away for a bit. So why would they notice me? I’ve got to get away from this complex where I think I’m somehow special, and on people’s minds. 

Thing is, we are all struggling somehow, and we don’t have the time or headspace to check up on each other all the time. 

Conversely, if I do start getting messages from people, I feel overwhelmed. In fact, I leave them on unread until I can get the energy to reply and be social.

Back in 2016 I dated this girl, Fran. She was the most wonderful person I'd ever met and I think I was the happiest I ever was when I was with her.

She broke up with me at the end of the year and I was in a fog for a long time. I tried my hand at dating again in 2018 and it hasn't really been good. I've tied a lot of my self esteem into my profiles and it hurt being ghosted. I ended up with some people who really weren't right for me.

In 2019 I get out of a bad relationship and I decided to focus on myself and my new job, but covid hit and I got lonely so I tried to get back into dating around 2020. I bounced around from date to date and I feel as though I am lesser for the experience and I gave up in November of 2020 to focus on myself again.

I once again tried dating this year and I've been on and off with a few people for about 2 - 3 months and I honestly feel drained. I am just so tired of being ghosted. I am tired of meeting people and not having that spark. I am so tired of being hopeful, that this is going to be the right person.

All in all I am just tired of being lonely. I want to get back to the way I was in 2016 when i had someone to be tender with, someone who I could hold and be held. I just want to feel loved and to love someone else... but it's sorta feeling like those days are far behind me now and I'm not going to feel happy like that again.

I like it when Thursday comes to a close and I have a few days of rest and relaxation to look forward to. But then when the weekend arrives, it's so unhappy.  The worst part is Sunday knowing I have to do it all over again, only to again have a boring weekend at the end.

1270,GeoNinja9,1635090313,1,"I'm 23(M) and really just looking for an outlet for how I've been feeling for the past few months. 

About six months ago I got out of a long distance relationship. I had been with her (24F) for 6 years, and slowly we were bullding up our lives to be properly connected. Covid hit, and we began to struggle. She broke things off with me... Well, not really. She was cheating on me, and I found out about it from her Facebook page. She forgot to edit the seeing preferences on a post about being enganged to another man. Turns out I had been her dark secret all these years. When I confronted her about it, she didn't give a damn. I like to think I've had a lucky escape.

Since this relationship was long-distance, and we only met up a few times, I have very rarely had the much-needed physical contact. A hug, holding somebody and knowing the loving feeling to be mututal. I've tried to meet people, but with the current state of the world, it isn't easy. 

I recently befriended someone at work (27F) who was a new starter. She made me laugh, we shared similar interests - and I interpreted a lot of her mannerisms as flirting. Sadly after 6 weeks, she has quit the job due to indifferences with the management. This happened on my week off, and she told me over text message. I was very sad to hear this. 

I offered her the chance to meet up sometime, which she agreed. She added me on Facebook, but a couple of days later removed me. We haven't messaged one another since, but I was really hoping to have found someone to socialise with. Even if it didn't lead to a relationship, having a friend to talk with would be a huge comfort. 

In general, I don't have many friends - and none I can really open up to. I suppose that's why I'm here... Any comforting thoughts would be much appreciated. I've never felt that ""down hearted"" feeling so often, where the pit of my stomach feels empty and bottomless.

1276,codecrunchie,1635087119,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

1279,ssprue20,1635081572,1,"After living a year and a half in Japan (planning to stay longer) and managing to create a life here, it was not without sacrifice that was at times the most painful. As the months went on, I started to feel disconnected from friends. Probably because I have changed a lot as a person, set up new goals and really discovered myself after struggling much of depression, loneliness, and so on. I have managed to become much happier than before, especially compared to several months ago. I love the fulfillment of my hobbies, I really like my job, seeing my family every now and then, and going to the gym. While I have good days, bad days, awful days, and yes even great days, I feel like I lost family, like they have died from my life. I am a very introverted person and yes I am awful at reaching out to people at times, but the biggest reason of all, whether it was my fault or not, is that I am on the other side of the globe. It almost makes me regret making the decision. Schedules just never align in this situation. I have created a life here but I lost my closest friends. I miss talking about the stuff I love but life gets in the way, whether it is in my life or theirs.  Things start to look like they are coming together for my wellbeing, but the pain comes back every now and then. There was a bit of anger involved early on, since I had suicidal thoughts several months ago and none of them responded. I have managed to pick up all of the glass pieces all by myself, and hold no grudges towards my friends. But sometimes I question what was the purpose of friendship? Knowing things change? People come and people go all the time. Sometimes I send a message, no response comes. If I have gained anything from this, all I can get is that life just...changes. It is just the way it is. I made the decision to leave. I feel like it is more of my fault, and yet I can't be there for that person because I have to live my life, my journey. And yet I feel guilty. I have abandoned them. It is just really hard to keep up with people. I am always open to having new friends, but what I don't know is if I want to show a hundred percent of myself to that new friend. The more I show my true self, the more painful the friendship is if we ever part. People come, people go. It can get really  painful, when you really have that friend to share things and they just disappear in your life.

1292,-Living-Dead-Girl-,1635072958,1,"(long ass detailed explanation of an argument i had with my friend incoming)

here's something i never see anyone talk about on here: being basically forced to forgive people who treated you like complete shit, purely cos you dont have anyone else and both of you know it. ive spent my whole life being treated like shit by people who were meant to be my friends, just cos the alternative is having no one at all.

my only friend does this thing where i'm kind of their backup friend who gets ignored and/or ditched whenever they find their way into a social group. these groups of friends they make never last long, but they always idolise them, changing everything about themself to be like the group, and not only ditching and ignoring me, but also shutting any attempt i make at trying to also befriend said group. (people who know this friend have backed me up here, people can see them doing this, and have even told me that they dont seem to like or respect me the same way as the 'cool' people they try to be friends with)

 this has happened too many times to even count, with every group my friend has been involved with. i became used to it. the last few times it happened, i was chill, i just thought, oh they always do this, they'll come back to me when this friendgroup doesnt last. which, on its own is already fucked. that is my best and only fucking friend, and i tolerate being treated like that purely cos i dont have a fucking choice. 

this time though, its worse. a couple months ago, i was going through the motions, they just started another random hobby they picked up, and were spending all their time with this new group of people. i didnt get to meet any of them, despite my efforts. but im used to that, im too embarrassing to introduce to people i guess? whatever. i'm cool to just be ignored until they get bored of the hobby or fall out with the group, i'll be there waiting as backup, like always. but then, my friend invites me to an event put on by their new friends. not exactly the kind of thing i'd usually be into (a wrestling show) but i was super happy and excited to get a shot at being social, maybe even meet some of their friends cos i never usually get to.  

the plan was, my friend meets me from the bus, we go to the place, sit together and watch this show. that is not what ended up happening. i get off the bus in a place i have no idea where i am, i message my friend, they say they cant come get me cos their busy working the tshirt stand. i'm like, uh okay i guess i'll try and find it myself but i dont know where tf im going. they dont respond. i walk around this town aimlessly, lost, no idea where im meant to be going, randomly run into 2 drunk guys who decide to help me find where im going, and eventually find where the show is happening. i walk in, go up to the tshirt stand where my friend is. i greet them, happy that i found it. they blank me. like, i stand there for a good 5 minutes trying to get anything, a hello, even a glance, but i get fully blanked to the point other people were wondering what was going on. it's a really busy really loud, packed show, i have severe anxiety and my friend is fully ignoring me to the point other people are staring at me. i say something like ""uh.. okay i'll be outside? its really busy in here and i thought we'd be sitting together...."" and walk back out like an idiot, have a full on panic attack in the hallway, and look back in at my friend who still hasnt even registered my existence. 

i stand in the doorway watching the show for like 20 minutes, then defeatedly walk back out to where the two drunk guys are who helped me are, i sit down with them and order a drink. i text my friend saying i'm still outside, no response still. i proceed to just hang out with these drunk guys, which was quite nice (i dont often get to socialise), i keep texting my friend throughout the afternoon, no response ever. i hang around outside of where the show  is when its finishing and people are leaving, text my friend im there, still no response and i dont see them. i end up going home, and even the next morning my friend hasnt responded to me at all. it doesnt make any sense to me, i couldnt stop trying to work out what had happened during the time between that morning when we were excited and planning the day, and me arriving at that place. i couldnt stop obsessing over what i had done wrong. 

i dont hear anything from my friend, for 2 weeks, all the while they were posting about hanging out with their cool wrestling friends. i eventually gave up messaging.

after 2 weeks, im scrolling facebook, and i see they've posted this: ""i'm going to do the impossible! i'm going to get my lighter back!"" literally just as im looking at this post, trying to work out what they mean, my doorbell rings. i instantly know who it is, cos post has already been and literally no one else ever rings my doorbell. i look out of the window, utterly fucking stunned. i then go onto my phone and open all message logs i have with them, and tripple check i havent missed any calls, i havent. starting to get annoyed that they would show up unannounced out of nowhere after ignoring me for weeks, i dont let them in, i call down from the window and basically just ask ""wtf?"" they respond by saying they want their lighter that they left here. what fucking lighter did they want, you ask? a literal 50p disposable lighter that they left in my flat god knows how long ago. that they were now here unannounced to demand back, like collecting their things after dumping someone. at this point i was fucking angry, who the fuck do they think they are. i say ""go away, man"" and shut the window. 

this is where they start to freak out. they start to scream and shout, for like half an hour they screech up at my window, until some idiot decides to let them into my building. once in my building, they literally kick my flat door as hard as they can, repeatedly, and scream. i shut myself into my bedroom, and turn the music i had on right up, with my hands over my ears, trying not to have a meltdown. (i have severe ptsd, especially when it comes to violent or aggressive men) im not sure how long they bashed the fuck out of my door, because i was quite distressed at the time, but it was at least a good 20 minutes before the banging and screaming stopped. after a few hours i looked outside and they were gone. (i want to stress just how unlike them this is, theyve never been aggressive like this before, i was more just shocked than anything)

when i checked our messages again, just to make \*double double\* sure they hadnt messaged me about what their fucking problem was, they still hadnt, and now i was blocked. this was 2 months ago i think? i decided to stop trying to work out what i did to piss them off, because its not fair that i drive myself insane over it when they should have just told me. i knew that they'd come back, when they run out of cooler friends. they always do. but this time, i wasnt going to fucking be there. i wasnt going to take this treatment, i have self respect. thats what i kept saying to myself anyway. 

now, time has gone by, just enough time to remind me what it's like with literally no one. and today, i got a message. short simple message. ""hi""

hi????????? it's not even an apology. fuck, it isnt even an excuse! its fucking nothing. hi????????

i now dont know what to do. should i respond?

Most days I don’t really feel heard and I feel put down when I have opinions because he doesn’t think that we’re allowed to have differing opinions. 

It really hurts me to type all this out as we’re in our first pregnancy and in the process of buying our new home. We’re in couples therapy but my husband refuses to see a therapist on his own to do work on himself - something our therapist has advised for years.

Someone will decide :
1. Let me Go and be a farmer. I will plant to get what to eat. The rest I will barter for timber to build my house and buy cattle. 

2. Another will decide : Let me go to school. I will learn wisdom and come back and build for the farmers in exchange for food and timber to build. 

3. Another one will say: let me join army. I will protect my people from enemies and in exchange I will earn what to eat and where to sleep. 

4. The 4th will say: let me go to far lands and bring things and sell to farmers, to elites, to guards, and in exchange I will also survive. 

5. Another will decide : I dont have a land to farm, money to go to school, energy to join army, and capital to travel to far lands. Let me remain here and help any farmer or builder who needs help. 

6. Yet another will decide : People want to be happy after work. Let me dance and sing for them. I will also survive from the little they give me. 

7. And the last one will say: I am born poor, but I am destined to be great. Let me invest my time in creating some thing that no one has ever seen and I will earn from it to become very rich and more powerful.

  In my life, I didn't have a good start.   A long time ago, my ex-husband embezzled my money and company money without my knowledge and used it to gamble.   All lost.   He owes a lot of money.   When I finally divorced, my debt was 50/50.  

  I was in my darkest time.   With the help of my friends, I started a new job, repaid debts and gradually accumulated funds.   I have reached this point.  

 But my recent performance is very poor.   I spend every day in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness.   It has been more than five years since my marriage ended.   My failed marriage is a short story, but it has brought me great pain and unimaginable process.  

  The pandemic has made life difficult for everyone.   It is difficult to meet a suitable person in life, but the good thing is that I still hope that I can meet some mature and stable men, preferably from Canada and the United States.   When the pandemic is over, plan to do meaningful things together!  

 Over time, we will make new friends, but I believe that few people are fortunate enough to meet some kind, positive and sincere people.   So I will look for it slowly.

1355,nicojahh-,1635045374,1,"I’m truly grateful for Reddit, as I’m often a coward who cowers at the thought of being emotional in person to people so I often hide my deepest feelings, to start my parents never taught me anything about growing up or being in a relationship, they didn’t warn me about sex, relationships, life, literally nothing, my mom was a gambler and she constantly put herself in bad situations that made her poorer even up until now, she doesn’t visit me,And hounds me for money, I was able to get away from her at a young age as the court declared her unfit for a parent so I got emancipated and my friends mother took the guardianship title of me, 

anyway I’ve never had any love I truly felt to begin with, in high school I kept getting my heart broken or used by guys that would sweet talk me into uncomfortable situations,I didn’t know any better and wanted to feel some kinda love even if it was fake, I met a few guys who mostly tried to rape me and I didn’t know what sex was because I wasn’t taught about it so I let it happen, I met my ex in high school and we quickly fell in love with eachother, we had a great relationship, he was super loyal, loving, patient &amp; then my grandma kicked me out because I wasn’t important to her and I had to live  with him and his family, 

after 2 years he would make comments about other girls being attractive that upset me, whenever I tried to talk to him he told me shut up bitch, or go away. I was in love with him so I stayed with him despite the mental abuse, then it got worse he started physically abusing me( slapping, grabbed by the throat, pushed me into the wall) he would also call me stupid and useless, I was so stockholme syndromed for love that I kept forgiving him, 

then after putting up with years of suffering,  I had the courage to end the relationship, for the first time I opened up to a guy I had met at work about the situation and that I didn’t understand what was happening to me or why, and the guy was their to comfort me and he gave me the affection I desired, so I went behind my ex’s back got drunk with him and we hooked up, I felt guilty but I was hurting and wanted someone to show me some love, 

anyway the guy had left the job and we didn’t talk much, I began meeting new guys at work and one I liked very much but he used me for sex and bought me gifts and said the sweetest shit ever to get me to fall for him, he got promoted left the job and came in person to my job to come break my heart, he said he found a girl that wasn’t mental and crazy, and that I’m too much to handle, 

I’ve been through so many hookups that I generally can’t feel my heart anymore I solely rely on pleasure and I end up being emotionally dead to any guy I meet,yet I’m flirty and I’m full of hormones but since being abused and heart broken I have no interest in guys romantically, dating itself actually makes me sick to my stomach, 

I have lots of guys I talk too but I cannot feel anything for them, even pleasure Is becoming too much of a chore to fake, truly I don’t know what is wrong with me but my heart physically feels shattered, I’m only 23 but I just don’t care for love anymore and truly lost in finding my heart, I feel lonely in the sense that I push any guy away and never acknowledge their feelings because I’m hurt.",lonely,Broken or broken hearted?,2021-10-24 14:16:14

I am at a loss for what to do. It feels endless. I struggled with substance abuse for a year due to loneliness (have been nearly 3 months sober) but it all seems futile and I am getting increasingly allured by relapsing.

Usually, it doesn't really bother me but It made me sad knowing that all my life (I'm 17) I have never talked to a girl that I loved and that it will continue that way. She was cute, and I'm never gonna be able to have a conversation with her. I'm always in my room listening to people that I will never meet and imagining myself doing things I will never do. I want to show affection to someone. I have always daydreamed about starting a conversation with a girl, and that's so sad. I lived like that for so many years, it's starting to be just really sad.

I try to make plans with people, but they never have time for me. Even my own “friends”, they rather hang out with other people instead. And I try to make new friends, I go out to parties and other public places, but afterwards I never hear from them again. 
Nobody cares about my feelings, they only care for my appearance. People use me for their own benefit. They only hang with me for my money, car, or to gain status.  
I sit home laying in my bed on the weekends all the time. My only escape are online apps where I can meet new people, I have more internet friends than in real life.

1386,AbductorDigitiMinimi,1635036307,1,"I just got off the phone with another person I catfished. Man does it suck, knowing whatever connection is there won't last forever or move towards anything in real life. I have a few friends at school, both of who have bigger friend groups they're closer to. I just try to act busy during lunch if I can't find one of them which is easy because I'm class president. I could just join a friend group but the things they talk about are just so absurd sometimes. For instance, I overheard someone complaining about a grade they received and wanted to ""smack"" the teacher in the face. They drag their feet about school being so hard but if you put some genuine interest and effort in, the work isn't so bad. But I'm not going to tell them that of course. So I resort to talking to older, nerdy men who understand the value of putting the work in and who will laugh at my nerdy astronomy jokes or genuinely congratulate me after running half marathon distances. People might say to go to your parents for that. My dad doesn't even bat an eye when I tell him the distances I run and my mom forces me to be caught in the crossfire of her hatred for my dad. She told me to call my dad to ask him to pick up my brother and me from school on Wednesdays because it was his day off after he's already told me to tell her he's busy on that day too. She knew he was going to say no. After I called him to ask he said he was busy and my mom said, ""Your dad is always busy."" Like what do I even say to that while my dad is on the phone? Who do I talk to about my catfishing addiction as a result of emotionally neglectful parenting? I guess just a subreddit. At one point I was talking to a twenty-something-year-old who had a thing for younger girls so he was half-willing while paranoid to talk to me. He was nice but at some point, he recognized he shouldn't be talking to me, someone who openly said they were fifteen. I get it. But when he stopped talking to me, I was so incredibly sad. I never told him about my catfishing issue and he still left because of my damn age. I didn't even enjoy talking to him too much but just having someone to know the half-truth about me was so so nice. I wish I could go to therapy or go on SSRIs. I know I need help. Sometimes I promise myself when I'm really sad at night that I'll get it one day when I'm an adult and I don't need to worry about my parents knowing from insurance. But I end up crying more because that seems so far away. Will I even make it that far? I will because I have too much going for me. I have a one-centimeter diameter growth superficial to my Achilles tendon. I finally told my mom about it after two months of working around it because it hurt to wear closed-back shoes. Turns out I have to get surgery to find out what it is. I was so incredibly scared and I kept asking my mom if I should get the surgery and miss the first month of school as a class president or wait until December for my winter break. I just got yelled at in the car. I felt so alone when I went to go cry in my room after holding it together. I got my first B in my summer anatomy college class that Friday. That's great for my GPA. It isn't everything anyway. My dad told me if I can walk fine it's probably nothing. I was terrified that it was cancer. Now I don't really care. That's one way to take me out. So I currently don't even have a surgery date. My mom's scheduling things during winter break as if I'm not getting the surgery. So I probably won't be even though it costs fifteen dollars after insurance. It doesn't hurt to wear closed-back shoes anymore and I'm not vomiting blood so they're probably right. Just leave it I guess. I overshare with all these men on the internet because I have no one to really talk to about these things. I wish I didn't have to lie. I really wish I could tell someone all my worries and childhood trauma and all the things wrong with me. But I'll have to settle to pouring it little by little on thousands of men. Because I'm pathetic. Other people have bigger issues than me, I shouldn't be complaining. I have a roof and food and all the basic nessesities. That's how my dad sees it. ""Oh, my child should be happy because they have all of that so I shouldn't have to be involved."" My mom likes to use my dad's absent parenting as a rebuttal during her screaming sessions. She's an angry parent. She screamed at my brother and me that my Dad never pays attention to us, never wonders if we've eaten that night, and doesn't love us but we're too glued to our screens to notice and we're stupid. She was yelling at us because she heard my brother playing video games at 12PM on a school night. I think my brother and I both realize it. And we distract ourselves with the online world. I need to wipe my tears o go eat dinner soon.

I just had probably my first ever emotional breakdown. I have been having rough couple of days, barely had 4 hours of sleep and only had one meal yesterday and I live alone in a shitty rented room. I usually don't communicate my feelings and just push them at the back of my head and have been doing this for years now. I woke up today around 3 because coz I was hungry and decided to boil some milk to make something, and the shitty thing happened. It started foaming and I panicked, It slipped from my hand and it all fell on my right inner thigh and most on my left foot. I shit you not now I'm laughing at my pathetic self while writing this. I got rid of my lower cloths as it was buring like hell. And I don't know what happened but for some reason I started feeling freakish nausea and extreme  dizziness. I felt like vomiting. Ran to the toilet and🤣 took a shit instead. I came to my room stumbling, naked from the waist down and just passed out from pain for like 5 mins on my bed door fully open (mind other tenants live across the hall). After that I woke up to this unbearable pain and burning sensation. I didn't know what to do. Tried to call my parents but their phones were switched off, could call other because never I have talked to them and was naked. AND THERE I WAS realising I am truly ALONE, in PAIN and SHAKING, no one to ask for help. I started crying (can't cry loudly because of childhood stuff).Thinking what a worthless pile of crap I am. Not fit to live alone. No one who I can count on . All while am in pain I started remembering that at the age of 22 I have achieved absolutely nothing even without comparing myself to my sibling or my cousins(which my parents love to do). This thing went for half hour. Then I just applied the only thing I had, an antiseptic petroleum jelly and sat here. It's not as painful as before. It swelled up a bit now the swelling is gone and there are couple of blisters. What should I do?

1393,justajuicebox,1635034640,1,"so much so that i'm scared of getting close to people. 

i've always been guarded and on high alert with people, and selective of who i let into my life because i'm scared they'll get to know me so well enough, that they'll find the door themselves and leave. i know people come and go, and i've grown up teaching myself that i'm fine by myself, that i love my company and respect myself enough that if someone wants to leave i won't beg, but it's honestly getting hard to say goodbye to people i wish would just stay. 

during my uni days, i had one close friend who i could talk to about personal things, would hang with outside of class, and even once had a huge breakdown in front of (about the topic i'm talking about now). he was the one who reassured me that although people come and go, better things will come and all you can do is wait for the next best thing. i really trusted and felt like i had made a life long friend who understood me, but after getting a girlfriend, he stopped talking to me. i've been left on delivered for over 3 years now, haven't seen or spoken to him since. i wish i could reach out and catch up but i don't even want to bother if he's the one who let me go. i don't hate him for it, i just don't really understand. i thought our friendship was meaningful but i guess it was something he could let fizzle out. i guess i was someone he could live without. 

i try not to care because like he said, that's just life. but i've been saying that way too much lately because history keeps repeating itself and the people i open up to and get close to always seem to find a way out of my life and t hurts. i want to be able to trust people but they just keep proving why i shouldn't. 

i'm just getting tired because as much as i try to lie to myself that i'm ok by myself, i'm still human and slip up and wish people would stay.  i wish i meant enough to someone that they'd be scared to lose me the way i'm scared to lose the people i love. but i cant imagine that happening with how guarded i've become as a result of losing people. it's a terrible cycle. what a scam",lonely,everyone i get close to leaves me,2021-10-24 11:17:20

We would talk about everything and anything, crack jokes, tell stories about crazy people we have encountered throughout our lifes. It was ""perfect"" you could say. They honestly formed my identity when I didn't have one to admit sadly.Of course we had our issues and arguments like any other friendship. These two were in on and off relationship. For two years if I can remember. The crush was always be one sided or they would have crushs on each other. While they were dating we call but everytime we didn't. I would always assume they would be on call with each other. Even when we were on call they always have a conversation between each other. I would sometimes mute myself so I would interpret them. In most friendships I was the third wheel.  I didn't complain because I was happy to talk them. All of three of us stopped talking to each other. One moved away to a different state, cut off one due to issues I wish to keep private. I am finally feeling the withdraw of constantly being the third wheel. I have noticed that if my freinds are talking to someone or talking to their partner.  I go silent and listen to music. I don't text anyone because I think they are busy, talking to someone more important, or busy. I feel like a bother to put it plain and simple. I just wish this feeling would go away.

I already felt lonely going through this... missing the person I thought would be my life companion, but when I reached my hand out for help and there was no one at the other end....  in that moment, I don't think I've ever felt more utterly alone in this world.

What makes life worth living is time with those you care about. Well he's gone. Others are busy. I don't blame them and I'm not upset with them for it... it just simply *is*.

I know if he were here, he would have helped me recover.... done the laundry, picked up that tissue when I dropped it on the ground and can't bend over to get it.... instead I'm using a grabber, doing all these things alone. You know when you cry and you hurt so deeply that you feel it from your heart all the way down to your toes? That's what I feel right now... drifting away on a cloud, curled up, scared, looking down at everyone else... they seem so happy, so close, but just out of my reach.",lonely,When you reach out and there is no one at the other end to hold your hand,2021-10-24 06:12:18

I told my mother that a few friends forgot my birthday and I was actually totally fine with it but then later when we were fighting she kept saying look at you no one really likes you. My mother has been abusive towards me from a very young age. As a kid I never remembered receiving any kind of affection from her. I was not born very good looking and she always called me names because of that. She is really pretty and is married to my father who is very smart but ok looking. What pissed her off even more was that I was not even smart. My parents keep pointing out traits in me ~all undesirable traits from one another. To top it all off my brother is a olden boy extremely good looking very smart sociable charming extrovert and just a lot more. I have realized that ppl keep me around cause I am funny (I just say stupid shit to make people laugh) they call me when they are bored and down but not when I am bored and down.

1465,Independent-Bird1133,1635013231,1,"How damn lonely I felt during my last birthday (turned 24 a week ago),realizing that I didn’t mean anything to most of the people I “was always there for”. It would’ve really made my day if they sent me the simplest text to wish me a good one. I have never cared about this specific day of the year, but for some reason I felt really sad not getting a notification from certain people.

I wanna tell myself that I’m a nice person, always there for people, listening to their problems, hearing them out, and offering help when I can, but situations like this just makes me feel used and not liked by anyone.

I never show these emotions to anyone and act like everything is fine and living life even if I had problems (which I don’t mind having some of them here and there), but I sometimes feel legit lost, unwanted, and wanna delete every social media account I have and disappear from everyone’s virtual shitty life (of course other than my parents and siblings who have always been by my side)

But in the meantime, I don’t feel like I have anyone that I can turn to and tell them the silliest thing that happened in my day or what I am going through, and even when I open up a bit, I’ll either get ghosted for days if not weeks and then get the standard reply “sorry I was busy”, and by that time I just stop giving an F about telling anyone anything. 

So yeah, always listening to people and trying hard to help them but never listened to. And apparently the only thing I can think of right now is to just stop communicating with anyone and not caring about them as well (which sounds like a horrible trait for me, but whatever, Time to  look out for myself I guess)

1496,rslashdyla,1634986748,1,"Recently moved off to college to pretend to be smart. Back home I actually had friends yet I still felt lonely so out here my loneliness is through the roof. Its so hard living life without an individual I can depend on to be there for me. In terms of past relationships I have never once had someone who was truly mutual best friends with me and I've longed for that for the last 3 or 4 years. I did once have a gf for 2 years but I realized I was showing her who she wanted to see instead of who I really was and that we wanted completely different things. However it was nice to be her #1 and have her be mine. She was the only girl I've ever felt truly connected to. Since then I met another girl and we hit it off but we were only able to share a month together because of the upcoming school year and neither of us wanted to do long distance. She was much more ""my type""and was the only girl I've ever truly related to. 

The reason that I feel lonely despite having people around is because people rarely ask me any questions about me. It also goes without saying that no one asks me things I consider important: Stuff like ""Is there something on your mind?"" or ""How have you been feeling?"" It sucks because none of my long time friends seem to care whats going on in my head, let alone anybody I talk to at all. I would just love to have one person, one best friend (or long time gf) who i can look out for and vice versa, to take care of each other. Having one single person in my life would make all the difference and help tremendously with my anxiety and depression.

As of now I am practically alone out here, I barely open up to anybody partially because barely anyone even asks me any questions. I am trying new things to make new friends and ideally also make a best friend so we will see how things pan out.

She's a lovely person and I love her. It's a story about how we met years ago. We didn't start of really well at first but became closer by the end of third year of high school. She's the typical attractive, tall, fit and fashionable girl who can easily attracts guys. She is not academically gifted though. Whereas, I'm just an average good looking girl. Most people tell me that I'm cute I don't believe so maybe they're just being nice. I admit I'm not that attractive or fashionable as compared to her but I'm smart. I went to a really good law school. I'm kind, humble and emphatic. I don't mean my bestie is a bitch in comparison to me. She's a nice girl too. Anyway, so the end of my high school experience was third wheeling on her dates, movie nights etc. I remember her bf ( now ex) called me out to help pick up a gift for her which was really sweet of him. They would make out or kiss in between movie scene while I was on the same room as them. I wasn't jealous at that time but looking back I'm jealous rn lmao. She used to hide the fact that they had sex or night outs together. I really don't know why she hid that fact. I wasn't going to judge her 😅. Anyway after high school, we both went to separate college and field so we weren't in touch with each other at all. In my third year of college, I made plans to visit her as I wanted to have some fun because my college life sucked a lot. I made good friends in college but felt left out most of the times. It was nice seeing her after a long time. She set me up for blind dates with her guy friends xD. I felt really good hanging out with her guy friends lol.

I always wondered why it was difficult for me to make male friends let alone date someone. It definitely has to do with the fact that I'm not conventionally attractive. Although, I believe I'm a nice person and have girlfriend potential. My experience so far with dating has been disappointment. I can't manage to go beyond the talking stage with guys on apps. If a guy ever reach out to me he would do so for some kind of help. Lol, I guess some of us are not worth for romantic relationships or platonic friendships and that's because of appearance or looks. As I have seen I'm resourceful person and people do reach out to me for work.

I just sit alone at home and cry and cry and cry.
It's so fucking pathetic.
What's the fucking point.
I have no friends, and I'm too pathetic to actually open up to my family.
Even if I did open up to them I know I'd just get the usual generic ""awww it'll be okay""
No it won't be okay.
I'm never okay.

I can't keep going on like this.
The feeling of being so unwanted and unloved is crippling.
All day all I ever see is women complaining that all men are evil or that all men are assholes who just play games.
Meanwhile I just sit here... Alone... Wishing I could meet just 1 person to fall in love with.
Wishing I had 1 person I could really talk to and be with.

But I'm a man and men are the enemy and the whole world just be better off without me in it.

1501,Insta_36DDDs,1634981704,1,"I’m excited for this movie but not excited that I’m watching it alone. Alone without a boyfriend. I already watched Venom 2 alone. Going to see Eternals alone. Going to see Spider-Man no way home,  alone.

I think from my movie taste you can figure out what type of girl I am. I am a nerdy, gamer, Otaku and movie buff. I love going to the movies and watching movies. Especially if the movie has a lot of the cast that I’m interested in.

I mean look at this movie. You got Khal Drogo (Momoa), you got Cable (Brolin) who is also Thanos. I love MCU movies. You got Poe Dameron (issac) Who was also that ahole in sucker punch. Yeah I saw that movie and I love that movie and I’ve cosplayed as baby doll. I don’t know who the kid is that’s the lead but he’s pretty cute.

Ideally if I had a man, we would’ve had dinner maybe at Buffalo Wild Wings, then saw this movie, nerded out and discussed this movie, went home where we live with one another because we’re in a long-term relationship like that, fun time in bed and then go to sleep. Oh and we would’ve totally discussed any movie trailers. Because I love the previews and I get mad when people wanna skip the previews. 

But alas, I’m single. Looking for a long-term monogamous relationship with the goal of marriage.

1502,MasterYodaSex,1634980948,0,"Forgive  me for my bad English because  it is my second language. 
I was born with a family that isnt really rich nor poor . But i live in a neighbourhood where most of the people are poor . I was raised by an old maid who basically is like my mother at that point. Growing up i didnt had to do much . I did not learn how to do laundry , cook , anything  really. I never asked anything from my parents. But i do sometimes complaint a bit because i was and still dumb.  everyone from middle school to highschool treat me like i was the villain. But yeah that was pretty understandable i would hate too if someone live nicer and had it easier too. Everyone would look down on me. Being picked on alot of times asking money and bullied a lot and criticized  . To a point everything they hate about  me made me hate it about my self. They hate how I had it easier and I hate it how I had it easier.  They laugh how I lack knowledge  about living and I hate how I did not experience  what they had . They hate how I have a maid to babysit me and i hate how i grew up having someone taking care of me . They hate how soft I am and I hate how weak I am . They hate what a waste of money I was and I hate how my parents  would waste  money for me. They hate how ugly and disgusting I am .They say I don't deserve it and I do feel I don't deserve everything I have and I feel guilty  about it. They say I wouldn't understand the suffering they had and I wish I had suffered  the same because I don't deserve anything good .pretty  much made me insecure  about myself. I feel like I deserve to be treat like shit . I hate everyone , I hate smiling , I hate taking a picture  of myself  , I hate my whole existence.i became very insecure that I always try to hide everything I have and wore things that are either torn or broken , but that was when I was a high schooler . Now I am 21 and I live by myself in a car. And I think I am going to end myself.  Because I deserve it . I had given most of my money to charity and people in the street because they deserve it . I remembered I fell in love with the only girl that was helping me in my art class when the art teacher yelled at me and told me to figure it out myself. I wish she is doing fine . She even told me good luck on the day I was about to be sent to a chess tournament (spoiler alert I only thought about her the whole day that I lose the match lmao) . Because she smiled at me a lot,  I thought maybe she want to be either friends with me or something more. I guess  I was wrong she was just a very kind person. Her father died before I met her and one day when I was asking her about math one of her friends came to me and drag me away from her and told me "" you are disgusting "" "" don't you know today was the day her father died last year "" or something like that I don't  remember what she really told me but it basically  mean I was disturbing her or something . And then I learnt that she also were from a poor family. I was simping so bad   I gave some of my saving with rubber band  and my math tool or whatever you call it including my scientific  calculator under her table with a cat drawing on a paper (because I knew she love cats ) without telling her. And after that I left her alone for good. she probably have a boyfriend  for being that pretty ( and I was correct she had a boyfriend she probably  just broke up or something idk ) I feel guilty for just taking her attention. I don't  deserve to meet someone like that . I regret making her wasting her time on me . But yeah that was when I was like 16 or 17 . I guess  this is where it ends . Thank you for reading my broken English  essay of my undeserving life. I love you mimi, I will never forget for what you had done that had inspired me but this is the end .",lonely,Bye,2021-10-23 20:22:28

I never had a girlfriend before and nothing shows me that this will change any time soon. I try to have one but I always end up in the same situation wondering what am I doing wrong, what’s wrong with me and why do I always have to go through this.
I thought it will be less painful with time but no, the more it happens the more it hurts.
Is it that hard to find someone to who you can say « I love you » and get an « I love you » back ? 
I just want to love someone, to get hugs from her… I just want to be truly happy for once.
Every time I thought I’ll finally get what I want the most, it disappears and I end up alone once again.
Tomorrow I will have 23 and it will be another disappointing year alone. 
I know there’s more difficult situations than mine and I shouldn’t be complaining that much but I wanted to say what’s on my mind for once.

I have a tendency to become obsessed with media I like , and right now it feels like some characters in a show I like are my only friends. Like I actually have a connection to them and have been there with them throughout their journeys. (I'm aware it's fictional just as an fyi)

Here I am on a Friday night, sitting on my phone in my childhood bedroom. I come back home often cause there ain’t shit for me at school. But here I am doing literally nothing at all other than being alone on a fuckin Friday night when I should be having fun and getting laid and all that shit.

I had dreams of what life here would be like. I really thought getting here a year ago would change everything for the better, and that being in a new environment would be good for me. I thought I’d be going to parties, meeting lifelong friends, and doing everything the ever so bullshit college experience that was illustrated for me was supposed to be.

1550,MarvelUniverseTheory,1634955647,1,"(Please read) This issue has been going on for the past 3-4 years although the main problem has happened on/off since I was 8 years old. 

Basically most of my family were born into Jehovah’s Witnesses. My mom and all her siblings, and my grandparents on my moms side. 

I was born (twin) in 2001 and my mom shortly after had an aneurism that basically left her paralyzed her whole left side. She was a great mother looking back, surviving another 20 years before she passed away this year on Jan 1. While growing up tho, even though she was a Jehovahs Witness, she hardly showed the qualities you would expect. She wasn’t great but she wasn’t bad. She was strict and was on disability with social security checks every month so my childhood wasn’t as memorable as most other kids. I didn’t make many friends because of this and just kinda floated my way through school. High school was good but I wish I did more. Looking back I wish I participated in sports, in order to make friends and less about the Witnesses.

The congregation I grew up in is probably the exact opposite of what you would expect from Jehovah’ Witnesses. They are supposed to be kind and caring. The congregation did hardly anything to help me except push me to get baptized. They aren’t supposed to gossip or talk badly about others. They always spread lies about my family. And gossip spread like wildfire. Looking back, I know I was never ready to become a witness because I had a bad addiction to porn and kinda still do but I’ve moved on now. The serious problem was I realized I was bi and absolutely nobody knows, most likely due to the addiction. Ever since Covid started, the witness’ have been the last thing I worry about because they aren’t my friends and they don’t actually care about me. And being bi, I have had quite a few hookups with guys that no one knows about either. All during Covid because why not? I’m happy with myself and don’t feel bad being a witness while also being bi. I plan to denounce my faith soon, probably when someone finds out. Basically every problem in my life has been caused by the witnesses. I couldn’t make friends at school. I couldn’t pursue dating or relationships with girls. I couldn’t participate in school activities. I had to go in service every weekend and meetings twice a week. I had to stand in front of 100 or so people and read or lecture them, which stressed the hell out of me. And now that I’m 20 years old and seeing how the witnesses could have actually helped my mom but didn’t, I no longer have friends who I’m honest with, and someone who knows my whole story. I’d love to at least have at least one good friend.",lonely,Alone and no one knows (20M),2021-10-23 13:20:47

I really can't find the cause of this painful emptiness that just manifested in me. Maybe I'm lonely, sick, tired or I'm missing something I haven't discovered yet. I can't enjoy my days having actual fun with friends or family. Today I went to my parents room so I could at least talk with them, bond with them and my father literally shouts at me: ""Your actions were bad.""
I seriously didn't expect my father to tell me that just because I didn't have much sleep or genuine fun. They see me everyday playing video games and then call me fine like nothing is going on. I find it really difficult to even open up to my parents, I feel like I can't do it.

She's been with me for two years now and hasn't abandoned me and neither am I planning to, but I just don't want to flood her chat with me ranting about my issues in real life.

1559,Fabulous-Advantage,1634954497,1,"Early 20s.

I had to endure not having any real friends, that I would hang out with in college, though I probably had a lot of acquaintances. I definitely thought it was a problem then thinking 'I don't think it's healthy to not have anyone...' I still am not sure if it was a preference or something out of balance in my life. Even after self-imposed therapy and getting to know people, now that I'm older and have tried harder, I find myself reverting to the solitude where I feel alive.

After putting myself out there again, and connecting with another person, I found myself contacting him. It was forced. I hadn't done that for a year, at one point I would meet new people, but I would not contact them unless they did first from a mixture of my own hurt and anger from someone who used me when I put myself out there. Well we met and I thought maybe I would do the impossible and keep a friend. 

He wasn't the only one so I went out again and tried to find strength to try again. I stood there alone, I saw a person and made a comment which he responded but that was it. When you can't push yourself anymore. I knew tomorrow I'd wake up and face the day and forget it, but the limits were painfully there. Even if I forced myself it look like I was going to cry than meet someone. I'm still trying, but it once again feels like no one can really help me, almost like I don't have a problem. If you think having no support system/real friends doesn't constitute a problem.

1560,AimlessSpectatress,1634954023,1,"Hello. This acc is new but I made it as a way to find communities where I can find someone, anyone, to talk to. The past 3 years have been kind of hard because I haven't had a solid friendship (or friendship period) and my attempts have seem to fail. I believe its all on my behalf. You see, it takes me awhile to come out of my shell, but when I do I know I joke and talk alot. I think it may come off as ""attention seeker""- ish, but I just get really excitable talking about things I'm passionate about. I've tried making friends online, amongst the fanfiction/writing community and the art/fanart community, so I can see if I could find friends who share common interest. But I either get to shy to talk in a conversation or get steamrolled and can't recover. I've joined discords, but the thing about those is that everyone is already friends and seem to prefer the ones they know over randoms like me. I understand. I just wish I wasn't so awkward and didn't ruin the conversation.

An example of this is yesterday, I joined a new discord for a writer/artist bang for a ship from a show I watch. I come in and see the 5 mods talking in general and I say hello. One says ""welcome"" and I get so happy that I feel inclined to join the conversation. It immediately switches to more personal things like work and lunch. I add my input with an open ended question and the subject changes abruptly. I was immediately filled with shame and humiliation for even thinking to interrupt what was clearly friends talking to one another. I wait a day for others to join, but by then, more popular and well known fanfic writers are dropping in and people are going wild for them. And they have great, loveable personalities. My inadequacies has never been more apparent.

I have no one to talk to. I work from home and even in school, I was alone and people never really wanted to talk to me. Based on how things are going, I don't think there's really any hope for me. For anyone liking me. For me having any friends. And having no one to talk to besides my mum and my therapist. 

It really does hurt to know I'm not likeable, enough to make me cry even. But I think I'm done with trying. Feels like the more I chase it, the more easily it escapes my grasp. It wasn't meant to be. The sadness is crippling.",lonely,I have lost hope,2021-10-23 12:53:43

Great listener, If there were a leaderboard for listeners I would definitely be ranked up there. 

When I'm miserable (spoiler alert: often) I've found a new positive way to deal with is it is make people laugh, I also like going to subs where people upload selfies and ask for compliments and gas them up by pointing out attributes about them that they may not be aware of.

I don't hit on friends, I highly prefer a female friend because I was raised by and around females and there's also a history there that makes it hard for me to open up to dudes, having mostly female friends since I was a child I have a predisposition for recognizing that it's not appropriate to put friends in an awkward position by being inappropriate.

I'm interested in learning about hobbies that I don't have, it doesn't matter if we don't have much in common because I love hearing about topics that I don't know much about by people who submerge themselves in it, I'll totally make you feel like a rockstar for your interest.

Aside from that my hobbies include walking (mostly to the park) songwriting, playing acoustic guitar, photography, and watching YouTube. I've also made it my mission to win over the affection if my neighbors cat, which has proven to be a task.

Anything else about me you're wondering you can probably learn from my profile, and if you don't see it there then it's probably something that I don't think matters.

It's made me realise it's not just social interaction I crave, it's being wanted.

To know that they don't just stand having you around, but that they actually want you with them.

It's not fair when you're attracted to a woman who's in a relationship and you get that feeling of her being ""off limits"" why should it have to be like that ? Just because those two happened to meet one day and now they are just off the market for 10+ years. Our society is so dead set on monogamy and I feel like it's actually hurting the dating market. People like to pretend that ""there's someone for everyone"" and that there are just single/available people everywhere but it's just not true and if they are single either they are extremely picky or they are choosing to be single so they are not actively looking for someone. Being attached to one person has become the norm so much that women will just say ""oh I have a bf"" wether it's true or not, just because they think it means I'm not allowed to be attracted to someone else. I'm not saying they have to be interested but rather than saying they are not interested they just say they have a bf as if that's going to make a guy any less attracted to them. Look it it were up to me I would like there to really be enough single and looking people available for everyone but it's just not reality, go to a restaurant, movie theater hell anywhere and look how the entire society is designed for couples, friends, families etc. Society is not designed for single free spirited individuals to meet up.

1631,Randomposts004,1634925481,1,"So today I got a job, I got so excited and wanted to tell my ex (we broke up 3 months ago) then I remembered we don’t talk anymore. I wanted to tell someone else but I have no friends. I’m so alone, every day is practically the same. I hope this job changes my life in some way. 

I just really wish I had someone to talk to, someone who understands me, someone I’ve known for awhile. But when I got into my last relationship, I pushed everyone away. I just wish I could go back and change it all but I can’t. I miss her so much and she is always on my mind, everything reminds me of her.

Sometimes I get dressed up to go out, I go out and walk around by myself, listening to music or taking photos, I wish I had someone to share my ideas and thoughts with. I cry all the time knowing that I’m all alone. It was my 17th birthday the other day, no one I used to know said happy birthday to me, I waited all day to get a message from my ex saying happy birthday, she always said it to me. We knew eachother for 5 years, I never thought she would leave me.

How do I get rid of this feeling? I genuinely think I’ve thought about her every day since we broke up. Everything reminds me of her, I make so much shit up in my head, I hate it. I hated it so much to the point where I considered taking my own life, I was at my lowest and no one asked if I was okay or checked on me. Do I just not exist to them? 

I feel sick to my stomach making things up about what her and her new boyfriend do together, it’s gotten so bad to the point where I can’t even watch porn without thinking about them. She pushed it in my face that she had sex with him before we stopped talking (we stopped talking like 2-3 weeks after the breakup). Now I can’t stop thinking about it, I try to convince myself she was just lying, but I feel like I need to get back at her wether that’s by hurting him or destroying stuff he owns. I won’t do any of that but I just think about it to make me feel better.

Little rant over.

-Would like to have game night/movie night. Maybe play some tabletop dnd or rp on a game. I’ve never played tabletop dnd so it would’ve been fun learning with others.

-Go to anime conventions. Friends I had in the past liked anime. Would've been nice to cosplay, walk around booths and take pictures. 

-Kpop random dance events. I usually feel awkward going to one by myself even though it's fun. 

-Have an inclusive guild in a game that do activities together. It's difficult to find those kinds of guilds without being subjected to cliques, isolation, and sexism (because “gIRL gamers” like me don't exist). Just logging in and talking to others, getting close would be enough for.

Then after being with these friends for years we can look back on all the fun things we did together. But I know that’s unrealistic. I'm getting older and seeing how I can't get integrated into communities let alone make friends throughout the year's show. I've tried making my own but they died out.

My mom is really the only one who completely supports her and taking my grandmom to the hospital is going to be a massive challenge and pain for her (physically and mentally).

Anyways, I told my friends about it and they deadass laughed in my face about it and told me what I already know ( like bitch I know she needs surgery, chill with the fucking doctor ego) and it literally took me almost crying in front of them and practically spelling it out to them that right now trying to take my grandmother to the hospital is gonna be mentally taxing for my mom (they know that my mom's the only one looking after her) and me (since feel super guilty I cant help her) and that I'd probably miss a ton of college to help out post surgery. After that, they shut up, one of them tried to apologise for laughing which I just tried to play off ( I'm not in the mood for confrontations and fights rn) and the other I haven't seen since (it's been a couple of hours since this happened).

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since high school and at the time they didnt really provide the support I needed. I didn't feel like they cared all that much either when I'd muster up the courage to talk to them about my true feelings so i started to keep things from them. Gradually, I let myself grow apart from them because I didn't feel cared for and we all got busy with more important priorities like college and work.

But last summer, we all started hanging out again. I tried to tell them about my new job and how the adjustment has been hard, but again I felt like they didnt really care so I stopped. Then, they'd still invite me out from time to time and every single time I'd accept the invitation I didn't feel like myself. I felt the need to put on a mask everytime I was with them and I hated it so I went back to keeping contact with them to a minimum.

Now, I see them hanging out with each other on social media and it just makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I keep wondering whether they hate me for not communicating with them enough or for not being more positive and joyful. 

I don't know what to do, I've already started therapy 2 months to deal with other problems, but I jusr feel so lonely and they are/were my only friends.

But at some point along the way I started developing some self awareness and realized the insane lack of structure we had, and how hopelessly unprepared we were to raise children.

I've learned so much about responsibility and integrity and rightful action and humility and the importance of relationships. I feel like I finally have a hold on life in one way.

Won't talk about how we're raising our children. It's just so fucked up.

I have severe abandonment issues and i just feel like basically everybody i ever meet is just going to leave me. I have been so fucking lonely for basically my entire life and it's got to the point where i just practically gave up on trying to find a bf but then i found one unexpectedly and he has severe depression and he goes through periods where he just ignores me bc of it. Not only that he works full time. I'm so confused bc every time he has talked to me it genuinely seemed like he liked me so much. He always comes back and apologizes when he ignores me but this time he blocked me so idek what's going on w him. I would literally do anything for him I love him so much and I don't want to let him go. It's all my fault bc i was spamming texts all the time. do u think its really over or is it his depression and i should just give him time bc my heart is literally fucking broken tbh im going crazy,lonely,I can't stop ruining all my relationships,2021-10-22 22:55:16

I don't care or didn't think I care about people wishing me a happy birthday but I just keep thinking how everyone is supposed to have at least some people like a significant other or close friends that know when your birthday is. It's kind of sad when the only birthday wishes you get are automated emails from companies whose services you use. 

I was talking with this girl a few days ago and we were on the topic of birthdays and she told me she doesn't really care either but she does enjoy the gifts and that's when it hit me, I didn't actually get a birthday gift for the past 5 years ish. I didn't tell her that of course because it sounds embarassing and attention seeking but somehow it makes me feel very alone. 

What makes it weird is that I don't even particularly like the custom of being wished a happy birthday, seems like a pointless empty gesture if someone you only talk to a couple times a year wishes you happy birthday and then you're supposed to be something like ""thank youu🙏🥺😗"". Yet I have this cognitive dissonance sort of thing where I actually wish people would do it. 

Also what I guess adds to how I'm feeling is that I lost my parents when I was a teenager. Who else is supposed to remember your birthday and give you gifts if not your mom and dad? I can't help but think of them.

I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this.

I don’t feel like there’s really a point to my existence. I don’t have anyone close to me except for a couple of online friends I’ve never met irl, some family members, and my partner. My partner finds it easy to reach out to and connect with other people. Most other people I’ve met do too. But I feel like when I try to connect with other people I often get ignored, or quick polite conversation-ending responses. I feel like I am always the one to initiate anything, even with old irl friends, and I’m just sick of trying. In irl conversations I’m too quiet and get spoken over and generally overlooked constantly, even when I try to speak up. I am told all the time that my presence online seems confident, sexy, and successful, yet I have nothing that proves any of that to be true. I feel like something is genuinely wrong with me. Maybe I’m on the spectrum and don’t quite realize it or maybe my social anxiety is too bad or maybe I haven’t met the right people yet, but I can’t seem to be able to form a connection deeper than polite friendliness with anyone I meet. I’ve tried bumble bff and different groups, and though I’ve met a couple of nice people and hung out a few times, I either get more surface-level type interactions or I get bored because nothing ever goes anywhere. I am terrified of dying alone, but I’m starting to have a massive aversion to people in general and am more and more inclined to stop even trying. I never thought I would be this lonely.

I don’t know what it is about me that makes every single person I grow close to stop tolerating me within two weeks. I’m 19 and I have never had any romantic involvement that hasn’t ended in me getting ghosted. I’ve had hook ups, casual flings, and almost relationships. But every time I get romantically involved, things start out so well and as soon as I start to trust that maybe things will go well, they ghost me. Every. Single. Time.  

I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. I’m not mean, or awkward, or too forward or too distant. I’m no goddess but I’m decently attractive and I take care of myself. I try so hard to be nothing but kind and supportive and I’m taken for granted then dropped within two weeks.  

And it’s not like I don’t put in the effort. I try to hang out often, talk at least once a day, ask how they’re doing and actually listen. It works out so well for a short while. They want to meet up at least twice a week, they always text first and they’re so sweet and caring. Then after about a week, it tapers off and I’m left feeling like I’m putting in all the effort and receiving nothing in return. Suddenly they’re always too busy, too tired, just want to be alone. And I respect it! I’m never one to demand attention. Everyone has bad days where they just want to decompress. I’m constantly nice and supportive and offering help if they need it. They just brush me off. 

They make plans just to cancel them, or they follow through with plans and I’ll get my hopes up that maybe they actually do care, then they’ll just want to sex and ask me to leave right afterwards.  I have literally never been anything more than a sex toy. Which I wouldn’t mind if they also liked me in other aspects but nobody does.

Has anyone figured out how to connect and build friendships in a new place? online or offline. 

I've done little research for some discord channels. maybe hoping I can find other artists to just hang and chill on zoom or discord. or even someone to just say 'hey' every now and then. 

Or a good gaming discord? I'm not sure where to look for that. Im not a great gamer but I enjoy playing with others on switch or PC. 

I do battle depression for years but this time it just feels so isolating. Reasonably I think I should just figure it out on my own but I do like talking to people and hear ideas or views that I never would on my own. 

If anyone has suggestions please let me know :) maybe this is just talking into the void (and making this post is kind of therapeutic too).

 In my life, I didn't have a good start. A long time ago, my ex-husband embezzled my money and company money without my knowledge and used it to gamble. All lost. He owes a lot of money. When I finally divorced, my debt was 50/50. 

 I am in the darkest period. With the help of my friends, I started a new job, paid off my debts, and gradually accumulated funds. I have reached this point. 

 But my recent performance is very poor. I spend every day in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness. It has been more than five years since my marriage ended. My failed marriage is a small story, but it has brought me great pain and unimaginable process. 

 A sudden epidemic has made everyone's life difficult. It is difficult to meet a suitable person in life, but fortunately, I still hope to meet some mature and stable men, preferably from Canada and the United States. When the epidemic is over, plan to do meaningful things together! 

 Over time, we will make new friends, but I believe that few people are fortunate enough to meet some kind, positive and sincere people. So I will look for it slowly.

Solution - 
Borrow money from different people and don't pay them back. Trust they will call you text you daily for their money. You just need to spend time with them. You won't feel lonely anymore those people will surround you all the time.

Warning - 
Once you pay back their money they will ghost you and you will be lonely again. If you got into any kind of physical violence or cops arrest you I'm not responsible. Try this on your own risk but it will work 101% guarantee.

This trick works 101% guarantee. Thanks me later and please no clapping no autograph no photograph please. Peace ✌️😜",lonely,"Are you feeling lonely, depressed, Ghosted. Here's the solution...!!!",2021-10-22 06:17:31

he was the first person to hold me as i fell asleep, play with my hair, kiss me passionately, go out of his way to talk to me, spend the night at my apartment, and make me feel like i mattered to someone.  

we spent the weekend together.  over the course of the weekend i had 2 family hopsitalizations, my grandpa and dad, i lost a study abroad opportunity, and throughout everything he was so sweet and supportive.  he held me tighter than normal, he stayed with me much more, we had an amazing time together.

i ate lunch with him on the day he broke up with me, and he was sweeter than ever.  he was holding me, laying out in the grass with me, and being as amazing as ever.  i was literally thinking about how lucky i was to be with him all day.

then, he spontaneously came over to my apartment, crawled into my bed, and broke up with me.  he told me he wasn't ready to be monogamous with me, and asked me if i wanted to be friends with benefits.  he came, broke up with me, and left within 15 minutes.  

i saw he was on dating apps later that night.

i've never felt so hurt, humiliated, and lonely.  he was my best friend and only friend at my university.  he was the thing i looked forward to every day.  now, he's gone.  my baby is gone.  he just wanted to be with other guys.

my first relationship was so short, and i couldn't even do anything to prevent it from ending.  he lured me in, and right when i got comfortable and started to really get feelings for him, he destroyed me.

the way he broke up with me and the timing hurt me so much.  but i still miss him.  i even asked him if there was potential for us to get back together and he said no.  all this taught me, after looking for a relationship for so long, is that i am going to be alone forever, than i am unloveable, and that nobody is ever going to care about me.  i can't let myself care about other people because look at what they do to me.  i got chewed up and spit out by the first person i really really liked.  i want to cry because i know i'll always be alone",lonely,got broken up with by my first boyfriend this tuesday,2021-10-22 05:40:37

1808,comicbookgy87,1634836253,1, I met a girl on Reddit a month ago. We hit it off pretty good. She’s an amazing person. I started getting feelings for her after the first week. She’s Poly and I’m ok with that. Her partner wanted to be monogamous so she went with it and told me we would never be anything but friends. I accepted it and told her I enjoy her company and will always be there for her no matter what. Last night her and her partner broke up and she needed someone so I stayed up most of the night with her. Just calming her down and being a good friend. Halfway thru the night she said she would like to create a relationship with me again. She talked how she would fly down and visit me for a week and even looked up tickets that night. I was even planning a nice date. When the morning arrived her partner wanted her back so she went. Just made me sink. I said I’m fine and I’ll still be there but I feel broken. I won’t give up finding someone. I know I will eventually. I just wanna be number one to someone one day.,lonely,One roller coaster of a night,2021-10-22 04:10:53

Instead of taking an extra night to study for an exam I could have accepted those social invitations I once received and enjoyed my youth.

1864,AssignmentCapable,1634797773,1,"I’m a   senior in high school with a great group of ≈ 5 friends I regularly talk to in and out of school. While I love them and cherish each one of our conversations, whenever I’m on my own I have horrible my lonley and scary thoughts. You see, before I found my group of friends in sophomore year, I went to school where no one from my middle school went there, so everyone knew each other and I knew no one. I’ve been in my head and lonley most of my life, even in middle school I would never talk to friends outside of school despite having a phone. The first time I ever had someone’s number in my phone was in freshmen year, and it was just for a class project. 

Recently I decided to go to one our soccer games, cause why not? It’ll be fun, right? Well… I planned on going with one of my friends, but they couldn’t attend, so i went there not knowing anyone really. 

It was one of the most eye opening, horrible experiences that was pretty much where these lonley thoughts stareted to get really loud.  I went there and started to get the feeling like I was not supposed to be there. I’ve never been to a game or have been in any extracurriculars. And the worst part is that it’s probably just in my head, because I’m reality the only reason anyone lookwd at me was because I started looking first. Now whenever I’m around other people I can’t help but feel like a ghost. At home I stay in bed trapped in my mind hating myself and wanting to cry, the only time it’s inturrupted is if i am talking with one of my friends or when I’m asleep. Whenever I get a sudden motivation to try and put myself out there a bit more, I begin to hate aspects about myself, I’ll say that I’m not funny or creepy or unpleasant to look at, which sucks because if you asked me a year before I would have said that I love myself, now I guess not.

I look at this sub and feel guilt cause im a teen who might be whining about nothing, so I’m sorry If it comes across like that. I just wanted to right this so I can better understand my feelings, which I believe I have achieved. So thanks for listening I guess",lonely,I can only blame myself,2021-10-21 17:29:33
1865,tepct,1634797670,1," in high school, birthday is in about two months and I’m scared of not doing anything at all for my birthday. For the past few years i have just celebrated alone without any friends other than my family I guess. I’m a senior in high school and haven’t gone to any of our dances. I have never gone to any football games. I’m just sitting in my room all day wishing I would be out somewhere having fun. I’m just too socially fucking awkward and can’t make any friends, the closest anyone will get to me is being “convenient acquaintances”. I just want a friend who I can talk to on the regular for the sake of just talking. Back during my freshmen year I found out there was a girl who liked me, but I didn’t know how to react to that and I didn’t even talk to her at all because I’m fucking stupid. I was probably just a hallway crush or something, because there’s no way in hell she liked me because of my personality, because I’m so fucking boring. she probably dislikes me now as I never even tried to talk to her which I deeply regret. I wish I could just turn back time and at least try to talk to her. It seems everyone around me has their own clique of friends that they have had over the past 4 years of high school, and I don’t fit anywhere. It just fucking sucks man I hate it. I just applied to colleges for next year and I’m absolutely terrified that nothing will change in next year, and that I will continue being a lonely, socially awkward person in college. Why is socializing so hard for me? aren’t humans supposed to be social creatures? I can’t even socialize properly without being viewed as a weirdo who probably doesn’t have any friends. Even on the internet where I used to have a “friend” group on discord that I used to hang out with practically every day, it felt like hanging out with them was forced, and I was there for the sake of just playing a game, not that I was actually interesting or anything. My mom passed away right before my birthday last year which made my feelings of loneliness amplified to the next level. It just feels so shitty that no one really cares about me. I guarantee that if I just happen disappear one day, people will just forget about me in less than a week, or perhaps won’t even notice that I’m gone. Not to mention, I’m an only child so I don’t have anyone in my family that’s close in age that I can relate to. I love my family, but we don’t really show affection for each other like hugging or giving gifts to each other. This just leaves me touch-starved. I want someone to hold hands with, or just hug. Every night, I pretend I’m holding someone using pillows, and it feels really nice until I realize that I’m not hugging anyone at all. I just want to feel what it’s like to have warmth of another human on my body.

1871,_SluttyPrincess_,1634793625,1,"I don't know if it's advice I'm looking for or just venting. So I met someone online earlier this year.  I was suicidal at the time and he convinced me not to end my life. I grew fond of this person over time. He was there for me pretty much every day for months. I went through a divorce a couple months ago, which was the alternative to suicide so it had nothing to do with this person I was crushing on. I didn't even mean for that to happen. It just did. And he seemed kinda interested too at times. He's wishy washy about me. 

I needed some time to get away so I thought vacationing would be nice and refreshing. I decided to meet him in person bc at one point he was okay with meeting. Then suddenly he went off on me as I was planning my trip and cut me off, saying things like what we have is not true love. Kinda a lot was said but I had no real answers. He was vague. I went ahead and still booked my vacation bc he loves in a touristy city and I was kinda looking forward to the experience. I text him and told him that I was still vacationing there, told him when in case he changed his mind and wanted to meet. I'm not desperate. I was fine either way- meeting or not. I just really wanted to meet the person who helped me at my worst.

Anyway, after not talking for over a month he messages me and asks me if I'm still coming to his city, I said yes, he said he wouldn't ""ignore me"" so we ended up spending the week together, around his work schedule. We hung out all week, he was affectionate, thoughtful, funny, we laughed a lot, he held my hand and cuddled next to me in bed. And we hooked up all week.

When I was leaving he said things didn't need to be over between us but that he couldn't be what I need right now and said what we have is FWB. Which I've never done before. I identify as demisexual so I'm either strictly friend or altogether gf. It's hard for me to vibe sexually or enjoy sex with ppl unless there's an emotional connection. He knew that. 

Since I feel affection and like/love for this person, I want to stick around as a friend but yet again he stopped talking to me shortly after returning home. When I message him he's short with me and I'm still trying to be there for this person but he barely texts anymore and when I text him he ends conversation quickly. We knew we may not have the same feelings for one another when we met and we were okay with that. You don't know until you take the chance to find out. 

I'll always be there for him if he needs me and I told him that. I feel like a fool hanging around but when I care about a person I'm emotionally invested, whether it's friendship, my s/o, or family. He did message me a couple weeks ago and said he was going through some things, I reminded him that I'll be here for him but then he disappeared again. And maybe it wasn't an excuse and he does have his own personal things going on that he doesn't want or know how to talk about. Or maybe me giving up on him is what he wants because he did tell me in a text a couple weeks ago that he wouldn't hurt me intentionally. Since he doesn't want to hurt my feelings maybe he's just avoiding me, so I'll make the decision to go away lol. I'm a fucking idiot sometimes.",lonely,Conflicted,2021-10-21 16:20:25

We have known each other for over 10 years) and she told me she liked me too, and i was ecstatic, but she pretty much right away freaked out at the threat of being a part of the rainbow flag (God forbid) and cut me off. She now has a girlfriend of 2 or so years and, in all honesty, I sort of despise them both. 

Within another group of friends, one of the women had gone straight to my closest friend at the time and told her that I was spreading completely false and out of this world sexual rumors to other people in our group when i wouldn't have ever dreamed of doing that to anybody, let alone someone i looked up to and loved very much. She was basically my unrelated big sister. Big sister gave me the silent treatment for 2 entire weeks....2 weeks of mental torture, reeling, having go round in circles in my head trying to figure out what was wrong, why she was acting this way to me suddenly.. i basically lost her too. And what fucked me up even to this day is that she never once came to me herself and tried to communicate anything with me and believed every word this other bitch was telling her. Never, not once. And guess what? They are devout Christians. 🙄🖕 Go figure.
This Christians actually traumatized me to the point where I had begun to experience some ugly PTSD. After that, I would basically suffocate in crowds and the idea of seeing a friend riddled me with ridiculous anxiety. It was literally the worst.

Now I'm like this:
All in all, I used to love people and deeply care about them.

I've lost a lot of possible real friendships due to my depression and anxiety and family trauma, I barely talk to my one (online best friend) and that is a bit easier because her and I share the same issues so we could go on days without talking and we'll both understand. 
But in the span of two years, I managed to lose everyone; I disappeared completely off of social media and real life, didn't answer anyone's messages and phone calls for the previously stated reasons, until people just gave up on me, and just recently i made a new Facebook account and added a few of the folks i knew, sent a message apologising for being MIA, some understood and some were very perplexed,  the thing is, i don't even have any kind of relationship that resembles to being just half real, and I'm so scared, I've never been one to care for having too many friends i never did and i still don't, but just now it hit me that I'm only getting older and if making friends was hard in my teen years, could you imagine how hard it would be in your early to mid twenties (not mentioning the baggage i have).

It is 4 am and I'm sitting on my Laptop in bed and wide awake. I feel like shit. Honestly terrible. On one hand because i twisted my ankle pretty bad just recently because I'm stupid. On the other hand is because I just installed TikTok earlier that day. And you might ask yourself whats so wrong about installing TikTok nowdays since nearly everyone uses it even though it can be a bit cringey sometimes. And you're absolutely right. There is nothing wrong with that itself. It's just... my for you page became a depression filled mess. It changed from the usual happy go lucky content you'd might expect from a platform like TikTok to a depressed and sad pile of bs. And in the middle there's me. I've been in bed and watching those sad and depressive ""motivational"" type of tik toks for the last couple of hours and feeling miserable. Part of me just wanted to die internally. The entire time I just wanted to cry. But i couldn't. No matter how hard I tried I just could not do it. Until I stumbled upon one video that hit me really hard and it felt so relatable because I was going through that exact situation they were describing in that video. And so I just started crying all of a sudden. And I really don't cry very often. It was the first time in 2 years I was able to cry like that. I kinda felt relieved afterwards.

Now its nearly 4:30 am and the weather outside is just going nuts. I am still sad. Why am I like this...

I didn't really gel with anyone very well in college, and then covid hit which mucked things up even worse. I took a gap year and got a job, but my colleagues and I didn't really chat to each other outside of work, so I was stuck there as well. 

Now this entire time, university has been bigged up as this brilliant place where you'll meet so many new and interesting people. That it is rich and diverse - super fun and an easy place to make new friends, except its just not. 

I have been here for over a month now, and still haven't actually properly met a single new person. I'm not the greatest at social situations, so its a bit tricky, and I get really nervous in social situations, but for probably the first time in my life, I actually put a determined effort into meeting new people. I went to clubs and societies, I joined discord servers, and I spoke to student representatives... and yet it just hasn't worked. In person people just brush me off, or I get too awkward and just sit by myself in silence while everyone ignores me, and online it is basically the same. I don't understand how the hell anyone actually meets anyone new here without being extremely extroverted. 

And when it comes to my coursemates, none of them even talk to each other, let alone me. I made some attempts to chat with them, but I just got left on read and gave up. How in the hell do you meet and chat to people? It just seems impossible.

1919,Craterkhan,1634773283,1,"I am not sure where or how it started, but I am a male in my early 20's and I feel incapable of starting lasting relationships with anyone. (A fairly big read ahead)

Since I was young my family has always been traditionally very poor. I grew up homeschooled and so I didn't make a lot of friends during my younger years, and I officially joined real public school during 7th grade. Though because I was homeschooled I had and still have practically zero social skills.

I've always been made fun of for how I look. Puberty hit me quite hard and I was always made fun of for my appearances. Id like to think now im at least reasonably ok looking (180lb, 5'11, blue eyes, brown hair, some muscle growth, fair skin, and significantly less acne than my early teenage years) but the consistency of me being labeled as a 'terrorist' due to my lineage (My family is partially Syrian and I inherited half of it) always upset me. I tried in school at first to be upbeat and friendly, but the consistency never changed and I ended up falling into depression over it, practically forcing myself to go to school every day.

One winter was particularly cold and my family gave me a leather jacket to keep at least a little warm, and that basically solidified my appearances as a terrorist to other people for my whole life up to this point.

As such I had very few friends growing up and by the time highschool hit things went from bad to worse. Never have I ever been involved with drugs or alcohol or anything of the sort, but a lot of other kids were (My area where I live is rural) and I didn't want to fall into such a dangerous trap so I never could form connections with classmates. I shifted highschools at least 3 different times due to familial issues. A couple of girls actually went out with me but it never lasted more than four months. I stood up to my bullies and told counselors my issues, but the problems never stopped and my counselors advice was decidedly poor at best. Ultimately I retreated into my studies and hobbies to avoid it all.

My senior year went from bad to worse. A really cute girl 2 years younger than me had an obvious interest in me and I accepted it cautiously. My family however did not like her and through a series of unfortunate events I was kicked out of my home since I was 18. She took me in with her parents. I sided with her because despite being the loner in the corner of the cafeteria reading or drawing, she recognized I existed and wanted to know more about me, something I didn't have before ever with anyone. Heck she was the first person I was ever physically intimate with and by far the longest relationship I ever held.

I come to find out through my year and a half tenure with her that she was incredibly abusive. She lied repeatedly about topics big and small, stole money from me and I at the time was working a low-paying job, cheated on me twice, and constantly attacked me physically and verbally, of which I now have standing scars. It is partially my fault it lasted so long as I was very forgiving, mostly cause I didn't want to lose the little bit of happiness I had with her that I failed to find anywhere else. I finally escaped back to my family after she cheated for the 3rd time, but my already frail mental state was pretty much annihilated at that point.

Thus I have spent the last 5 months recovering from that ordeal. I got my drivers license, I began working out, got a better job, changed my outfits to something more normal for a boy (Jeans, T-shirts, sneakers, etc.) and am trying to save up enough money for a vehicle and college. 

Yet despite all this, basically no one has talked to me. All of my friends from the tiny group I had have disappeared. No one, be it guy or girl, wants to form any sort of relationship with me, be it a friendship or a relationship, anything, and the nature of my work has me talking to people of all ages, but mainly people near my age due to my town being a college town. I don't believe I am completely uninteresting. I have a video game hobby, I read a lot, draw a lot, synthesize music, exercise frquently, and practice swordsmanship with a sword my family acquired as a means of physical exertion since I don't have the money for a gym pass and my family has practiced with swords before so I had people to learn from. Outwardly I do my best to be bubbly, bright, and positive, but despite all that, the closest thing I have to meaningful communication is the internet, and that itself is dubious. Basically I am regarded as the nerd due to my expressed interest in particle physics, structural engineering, and naval history.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I want to be social and make friends and girlfriends and such because I feel like it would make me happier, but every time I try either family matters stop me, the people are dangerous or do dangerous things, or simply, my chipper attitude garners no interest. Even now its late and I am laying in bed feeling mentally dead. A feeling I despise at this point as its a feeling that hasn't left me for well over 14 years now. I don't know whether its failings on my part or simply life giving me the middle finger, but I genuinely wish it would stop and get better as the last thing I want to do is resort to a bad habit like drinking or drugs as I have witnessed firsthand what it does to people.

Ultimately I am sorry for the long read. I hope maybe just putting this out there will help my mental state a little bit.",lonely,I feel incredibly lost in a sea of loneliness,2021-10-21 10:41:23

I have no energy for anything. Food has flavor but no enjoyment. I paint, draw, game, read, but nothing is tying me to this world.





My friends, gone. There is no one i can be vulnerable with. My joy is gone. 




When i was suicidal in the past, and upset with my boyfriend, id fight and stay alive because of my friends, not for him. And when we didnt fight and it was all me, it was my friends that i fought to stay alive for.





But now... theres nothing. I have a therapist, i have hobbies. Ive traveled the world. Ive got a lot done off my bucket list.




What else is there? Why do they abandon me?




Its a lose-lose situation. They get mad if i dont reach out to them, and then they get mad if i do. Im not even heavy handed about it. I try not to guilt trip, id say something generic like hey, no response. Then they find out and then get mad and say i should have said im having a hard time. So i do that and they say well now that puts the responsibility on us and its manipulative. Like i would understand if i was like ""hey im suicidal"" but im just like, hey i need someone to talk to or hey im having a rough time are you online.






Everyone tells me that ill find new friends. Its not really about that. Its that i was comfortable around them and trusted them. They wont tell me whats wrong
 5 years of friendship and im getting ghosted. It hurts. I dont want to exp this pain ever again i tried and tried for so long. 




I have a lot of stuff to do before i give up though.





I have a lot of stuff to get rid off and give away. I need to get rid of all my stuff so theres no extra heartache of my boyfriend disposing my stuff. 





I don't think ill find peace dying, but i dont think id suffer anymore. Being alive has been shitty. Nothing can go back to how it was. Its gone and destroyed. It keeps happening. People running away from me or pushing me away. I have nothing to offer people, my friends, or society.

Right after university (marketing major), I started working at the 9-5 corporate job. I got burned out and it really consumed my mental health. After 4 1/2 yrs of staying and at the middle of pandemic, i resigned. I decided to do full time freelancing (digital marketing niche). At first, it was doing really well. I had 6 clients that time but I got overwhelmed. I had a hard time adjusting to the freelance world because I was used to having a top management that always tells me what to do. Then, after 2 months, I let go of my 4 clients. 

Afterwards, I thought that I haven’t really healed from the experiences I had at the corporate job and took online therapy. 

By this I only have 2 clients and they really gave me peace of mind. But I need to survive and pay bills, I have to increase my income. 

Few months passed, I got another gig. It was paying really well. Downside is, I don’t like the work culture and I really felt disconnected. I stayed for the money. Then after almost 5 months, i got laid off. Without notice, they cut me off just like that. Well, to be honest, I was relieved because I don’t have to deal with them. I thought that its okay and I would just find another one. But I got my problem again, my finances. 

I used this time to reflect on everything I went through. By the way, all of these (freelancing) happened just this year. And now, I am completely lost on what should I do. I only have 1 client at the moment. Finding job is so hard and draining. 

I am torn between doing jobs that pay well but will cost my mental again or following my passion but it barely feeds me? 

I thought that when I left my toxic corporate job, got my freedom and be able to do the job that I really want, everything will be fine. But now I am starting to question everything. 🥲",lonely,What should a 25 yr old be doing in life?,2021-10-21 05:49:44

It's partly break up, partly this new girl and everything is new here now.

1987,emotionalcrybaby,1634749477,1,"Hi, i just turned 18 this year. Fresh out of high school, or half a year actually. Anyways, i've pretty much been cooped up in my room since i graduated from school (boarding school, to be exact, just to show you how mundane my life was during high school as well). I could say COVID screwed me over of my what would have been, super fun out-of-school break. But all those hours in my room, stuck in my own head, made me realize alot of things. 

Firstly i have strict parents. My dad's more lenient though. Either way, i have only gotten to hang out with my friends twice in the span of the last 5 months. It's making me soooo depressed seeing my other friends (all my age) going on road trips, and vacations TOGETHER. I love my parents, but somehow i feel like i got the super short end of the stick. I'm not even allowed to have a boyfriend and despite the fact that there aren't any potential suitors knocking on my door, the idea that I CAN'T date either way is such a bummer. I'm 18. It's not like i can drive either because i haven't gotten my license yet. 

I have very few friends that i kept in touch with after high school. One which i'm super close to and trust with anything. One friend who is really fun to talk with because they get all my pop culture references but sometimes drains the life out of me with little unsuspecting comments. Another friend who i talk to maybe once every 2 weeks. And one who doesn't bother to text at all unless i do first and even then, i feel our friendship has run its course. 

Then, there's also the existential crisis that takes over my mind every now and then. Let me explain. For practically my whole life, i have been 'that girl'. Not to sound condescending but this is literally how people have described me. By 'that girl', i mean i'm usually the prettiest girl in the room. Now i know what you're thinking. ""Oh, she's a pretty girl who wants to complain about her excessive pretty privilege."" 

That's really not the case. I'm tired. I feel like i've been set up by every single person that has said or made me feel that way. I don't expect anybody to understand what i'm feeling here but i just...i feel so fucking invisible. If i'm so fucking pretty, then why do people never talk to me? If i'm so pretty, why doesn't anybody ever reach out to me? If i'm so pretty, then why hasn't a single guy ever asked me out on a date? 

I know that these things typically revolve around a person's character (and trust me, i'm good enough). I'm certainly not some shitty person that everyone avoids. But it's just depressing that everybody has basically given me this narrative that my life must be so full of blooming flowers and excitement when that's literally not the case. I feel dead. I feel so unhappy. I don't get to experience anything. What point is it that i'm so good looking when i dont get to live my life as half as thrilling as the other kids? Basically, i feel like i've been given this script to the movie of my life but the more we film, the more i realize nothing in the script is happening. 

This rant was all over the place. If you've read this far, maybe u could take a minute or two to just say something. Maybe some interactions with redditers would help :(",lonely,disappointed with my unmet expectations and life in general,2021-10-21 04:04:37

After getting rid of a desparate relationship, I realised that I lost almost all the connections and bonds (my friends moved to another the city, I finished uni earlier than my classmates, I don't have a job atm). My life turned to a new chapter: loneliness. 
To be honest I have never found myself in such this situation, I tried many ways to get rid of it such as watching therapy videos, reading about my conditions and even using a dating app. But nothing changes, it even went worse on dating app since those people made me feel more unconfident. 
I try to keep myself happy by being on my own but I also found that it would be unhealthy for my situation atm. Anyway, I am still on my way finding my new friends or community which I can fit in. Hehe. I hope whoever in the same situation as mine won't feel bad about themselves or wondering if something was wrong with them.

1991,codecrunchie,1634747289,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

I wasn't expecting this so I was a little surprised. Now it seems he isn't interested to talk anymore which further proves that he didn't want anything serious. I texted him asking if he wasn't interested we could stop talking in a polite manner. He replied back saying he was busy with an interview etc. We haven't talked since then. I would really appreciate if he just tell me that he lost interest so I can invest my energy on someone else. It's not like we were going to date each other anyway.

When I've tried to get into events and groups to meet people both before covid and now, everything is centered around older individuals (I live in an area where people commonly retire)  or there's groups and events that only happen during my working hours.

I left an abusive relationship over a year ago, I came to live with my grandparents. I don’t feel I really had time to process what happened as I was always surrounded by them, having to pretend I was happy because we don’t speak about feelings in my family. 

I get no time to myself here, I moved about 1.5hrs from all my friends, if I do go and see them I have to be back by 9pm, so I don’t wake my grandparents, even then, as soon as I pull up on the drive they are at the door waiting for me. I then have to come in and tell them about my evening. In the morning, I have to go and spend 30 mins with them, eat breakfast, drink tea or they’ll wonder what’s up, usually I’ll just skip breakfast. I’m not good in the morning and usually running late. 

They expect me to take my hour lunch break with them and watch tv. If I tell them I’m going back to work early they’ll comment that all my life seems to be is working.  They’ll bring me about 10 cups of tea during the day. I have to be down for dinner at 6pm and then I feel rude disappearing upstairs straight away. 

As sweet as the are, I need SPACE, routine is not my thing and I don’t know how much longer I can cope with this. After a long day at work of meeting, phone calls etc I just feel like I need to socially recharge. They are also so negative about everything and it drains the life out of me. Sometimes I just want to scream. 

Moving out is not an option right now, prices are so incredibly expensive, but fingers crossed in the next 6 months I should be able to.

Days where I cannot put up with this any longer, I’ll go and work in the office, about an hours drive away. These mornings I’m up at 5am and my Nan always makes sure she is up before me, but I don’t have time to stop so then I feel guilty.  

Living with my mother is not an option, she lives 5 mins from my office but she is incredibly toxic. My dating life is suffering because how am I ever supposed to meet anyone in this situation.

I lived in the same city for 13 years and made lots of friends and even best friends but all of those best friends left (no arguments, it was civil), all of the people I made friends with are there on social media but not to talk much at all or share life experiences etc. I’ve had a couple of moments this past week where I have wanted to message someone to tell them something funny I have heard… only to realise I actually have no friends, no one at all to tell these things to. It hurts so much deep down but I always put a strong front on so people don’t realise how lonely I truly am. I use to smoke a lot of weed to numb myself and everything from my childhood and present events, I have bpd and severe ocd and I definitely think all of these things contribute to me not having friends. People don’t seem to stick around for the long run, I genuinely do have a big heart and would die for anyone. Overall I think I am a really opinionated person and I should probably just shut up half of the time. I wish I never smoked weed and fell into the right friend group as a kid, I imagine I would still have childhood friends and maybe even a best friend.

I waited ages, my whole life really for those days to come. I still have brand new clothes, outfits with tags waiting in my closet for that day, but it just stays there. 

That perfect life. That life I assume people with a good upbringing had, or just a healthy mindset overall, w loving parents or people around them. Hah. That's the life I want, and shame on me for wanting that because my life has been designed for otherwise.

2019,throwawayblue900ss,1634728041,1,"I am the most miserable person I know.

I know alcoholics. Meth addicts. Felons.

I'm more miserable than them. Who would have thought such a thing?

All I wanted to was to be a loving husband and father, and that looks less likely by the day. Our society, and I, am too broken. The dating ""scene"" is a disaster. I only get led on and lied to my face, like I am an idiot. That is all I am good for, being led on and lied to. Being used. I no longer interact with humans. These aren't humans. There has to be another classification. 

I am never good enough. I never was. I can never be who I am demanded to be. My overachieving isn't enough. I am not enough. I am unworthy to be loved. My whole life has taught me this, and how I wish it were not so.

Not saying I would, but that whole ""suicide"" thing, really starting to understand why someone would check out.

I am a workaholic. The money is good, but more than anything, it keeps me from facing my loneliness directly. It is a reminder of how I am not worthy to be loved. How I don't really exist. How I'm not really a human being. 

I throw myself into my work to put off facing the inevitable: the end of my work day.

I hate leaving work. Do you want to know why? Because that means I have to return home and face the same thing I face, every night: I stare at my bed before I lie down, and imagine someone who loves me, reaching out to embrace me. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

The same cold sheets, every goddamned night. The same lack of conversation. The same lack of shared body heat. The lack of hearing her breathe, her scent, her touch, her hair draped across me. All a dream I will never experience, to be loved. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

I wake up so many nights, reaching out to embrace someone who isn't there. I wake up and see, it was just a dream, a cruel mirage. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

In the morning, the same occurs. I reach, hoping to embrace her at the start of a new day, but nothing is there. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

What a goddamned terrible life this is. I don't want to wake up. The pain is so overwhelming.

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

How can this be ""life""? I'm a dead man.

I'm unable to be loved and I am tired of reaching out at nothing, no one in the night.",lonely,I just realized tonight...,2021-10-20 22:07:21

Also on top of that, she’s still getting over a really toxic ex bf and both works and goes to school almost all day everyday. Her busyness plus my inevitable moving, prevents us from being serious. It pains me. It’s a different type of lonely different than what’s typically posted in this sub Reddit. 

I won’t lie I’m not as lonely as I could be thankfully, it’s just I don’t know how to comprehend this feeling between me and her. It’s like I’m not lonely because I have her, but at the same time I am lonely because I know it’s coming to an end very soon. We can’t REALLY connect because of that. We can’t REALLY establish that we have feelings for each other, we can’t REALLY date often, we can’t get too close to each other, and it’s just kind of painful to be so in love but she most likely feels like I’m just another guy who’s fun for a while.

Life once felt so full of promise- almost so much better inside my head than when I went out there to experience it. And the growth that I got in this time was so not worth the loneliness, isolation, anxiety and the rest of mental problems I gained in the process.

In the end I never got the group of friends I wanted, or the city I dreamed of living in. I just struggle on the day to day, overwork and come home to a relationship that is not what I wanted after trying and trying to change all those things. I am just tired.

I want to be tense with someone. I just want a companion.

But, I’m not her real partner. She lives with her real partner. Gets to talk to him, and touch him every day. Gets to tell him she loves him, and hear it back. I don’t have that. So yes it’s sweet to hear that she loves me but it isn’t the same. And I have beat self care to death… I just want someone to take care of me. I want to take care of someone. I want mutual respect and understanding, the kind that takes time to build.

I am so, so unbelievably lonely. I think about going back to cutting my arms just to feel something again, to feel more in control; I don’t know exactly why. I just want to feel something physical, a break from the mental pain that I feel every single day. It’s so hard to get myself to do anything.

2074,guygoingthroughlife,1634697264,1,"Where do I begin. 
Firstly, to anyone that reads this, thank you. This is something I barely do. As my life progresses I’ve realised a few things - mainly I’m a mess. I can no longer pretend everything in life is going to mysteriously fall into place or simply the idea that soon everything is going to be ‘alright’. Let’s get right into it. Truth is I’ve never really known what I want from ‘life’ or what I’ve been doing with my life for the majority of it. For example. Although this cannot possibly summarise the depths of what I’m trying to explain. Some people want to be doctors. They work hard and become doctors. Essentially, there is a clear goal. My problem is during my time in school even up to university I just did things ‘because’. 

‘because’ that’s how it is. You’re expected to get good grades and make your parents proud. I wanted to do well to keep my parents happy - and to keep them off my back. So I did the bare minimum to do so. I got good grades. Got into a good university but somewhere along the lines everything began to catch up to me. Long-story short I dropped out of university. I tired to blame a issue at home for my main reason of leaving but truth is I slowly became disconnected with was I was learning and everything had just became a chore. Unlike being in school - you don’t get into trouble for not attending classes. In university if you miss deadlines or have poor attendance for classes/lectures there’s no ‘real’ sort of repercussions -  I started smoking weed heavily in university and do think it may have worsened my feelings of disconnect or disengagement but a few things became clear to me: if I had some sort group project or work -  I would always go above and beyond - not for my sake, I know how important others value their degrees/courses and I never want to be the cause for anyone’s misfortunes so I always pulled my weight. Then it occurred to me - I was still doing things just to do them. Just to ‘keep up’. Just to ‘appear normal’. Just to act as if I’m getting on. Same as exams -  I always wanted to pass exams to avoid the feeling of failure - the exclusion felt from when you don’t pass or do to well. Knowing that I’m on the same steady pace as everybody else. In other words ‘Safe’. 
I can even apply this to sex. I had literally forced myself to have sex when I turned 20. Just so friends could stop asking me whether I was a virgin or not - the experience, I wouldn’t even call  ‘sex’ nor ‘enjoyable’. I took a viagra pill and met this girl I had been speaking too. She claimed ‘it went in’ in my brain, meaning virginity lost, I left it there - I realised yet again I’m just doing this ‘because’. 

After this encounter I never even tried to have sex with this girl again - it was like I had just checked something off my check list. Thinking back on this situation - it was embarrassing. She probably told her friends how bad my d*** game was but I was so oblivious at the time I never even thought this way. 
Essentially I did something just ‘because’ again.
Not cause I want too but ‘because’ where I’m from and the friends I had being a virgin at 20 is ‘embarrassing’ or not the ‘norm’. I remember being present at places where my friends had lost their virginity way younger than I did. I never really understood it. Maybe I was overthinking it and should just ‘crush pus’ like my other friends do - I had my own fair amount opportunities to lose my virginity even before I had turned 20 but just never felt the ‘need’ to have sex. So never did. I literally never pulled through whenever it really got down to business which made me question - why did I even speak to girls? Guess what. Just ‘because’ again. ‘Because’ my friends did it. ‘Because’ if you didn’t - you’re considered weird or gay. I remember I would literally rather watch porn than have sex with a girl I have no real care for or she has no real care for me but I’m waffling off topic I hope this all just builds understanding for the ‘just because’ explanation I’m trying to give.


When I dropped out - I had returned home without knowledge to a terrible situation regarding my parents. My parents have never been together. It’s the typical story of a broken family. Abuse. Dysfunction etc. You get the point. I could get into details but would probably need to make a entirely different post. 
The main impact from this situation was that I was told a lot of things that were supposedly ‘hidden’ from me - I guess for my ‘protection’ . I was told my father used to abuse my mother. Which he denied. He never wanted me. He disowned my sister. Essentially it became a game of he said / she said. I had lived with both parents separately in the past -  on and off but such situation immensely destroyed my trust in anyone. I mean hearing my father never wanted me yet spending years living under his roof, eating his meals etc made me question whether it was ever love or something he just had to do. Unfortunately, as I grow older even if it was love or something he just had to do I understand it now. My mother is weak. I hate to admit but she’s one of those people that are too good for the world. Overly Innocent. Too Kind. Vulnerable. Weak. My dad had claimed she had her own problems but as a boy, your mother is always your loving mother you don’t question anything until you grow up. The hardest thing for me to fathom was I started seeing each of their points about each other.  The fact that my mother was a broken woman battling mental health problems for the majority of her life. Then my father who they claimed never aimed to raise a family. I have a older sister and things didn’t go well with my father and her so I guess everything started ‘making sense’.

In university, my dad didn’t visit me once - we rarely spoke but I had noticed our relationship becoming more than non-existent. I don’t exactly know why. I mean I got into the best university I could have (Top 10-20 in my country at the time)  and had never really let him ‘down’. He had got married and kind of forgotten about me and it seemed like I was just permanently stuck with my mother. 
Please don’t think I hate my mum but as mentioned she was unstable I sadly only remember her more for her worse moments as it is what I can recall the most seeing. 
But anyways. 
Here’s the real problem:

After dropping out. I had the house to myself I’d say for about a good few months (only because my mother had fallen ill again due to her mental illnesses so I had the place to myself as in that state it wouldn’t be healthy for her to be around me) This is where everything had caught up to me. I became insanely lonely to the point I had forgotten how to socialise - I would meet up with  old friends (people I’ve known for years) and barely could think of sentences or keep conversations flowing but did so just ‘because’ I wanted to appear like everything was fine. Not only this. Me being alone for so long I started to dislike being around anyone. As I said my mother was unstable -  she could be smiling one day and crying the next so I had to always suppress myself or keep a ‘guard’ up. She would always pretend things were okay even when they weren’t. I smoked weed almost everyday couldn’t give you a WEEK where I went sober. I hadn’t seen most of my  friends since I dropped out (year and a bit) and it just seemed everyone had forgotten about me. Phone was dry. Only here and there people would check up on me but then it all stopped. You would of thought having a free house to myself I would constantly have friends over or even host a party but truth is I was just drowning in depression. 
I’ve been drowning in depression my whole life - I’ve only realised my feelings of depression when I began university and properly had alone time - I realised I don’t have any real connections or relationships with anyone. Never had an Ex and my friends we always were in groups which meant we never had to get too personal we were always just kind of in the moment.

The time I spent at home was during the Corona period (which is still going on?) The effects of my isolation began to creep up on me. I always had the blind shuts. My health was poor. Would barely wash or brush my teeth - take any care of myself unless I had to - had to meet a friend or had to do something where I had to look somewhat presentable -  when I went out. I realised how overly paranoid I look always questioning ‘do I look normal’  am I ‘blending in’ yet I never used to think this way before. One day I had noticed I usually start conversations with myself - a person on the train had caught me and I always went into a panic as I didn’t even realise I was doing such thing so blatantly  - it got to the point I would pretend to be on the phone to just ‘act’ like I’m talking to someone.

As a kid or a teenager if I had told you I was doing things like this no one would believe me as I never acted this way. I must add I lost a lot of hair during a young age and underwent surgery at a fairly young age too. I can’t say the surgery went too well but during the process of the surgery and my recovery my life became even worse. it was summer, scorching hot. Obviously with the surgery my hair looked crazy. I had hair in my bald spots uneven to the rest of my natural hair. For a long time I felt I had to stay indoors and ‘hide’ away until this issue cleared - months and months passed and I soon started living the exact same day everyday. I felt I couldn’t go out as my hair was uneven - I couldn’t even bring myself to go to a barber shop in public nor take a walk or even just let my hair out I knew how bad this was for my recovery but a voice in my head wouldn’t let me free. Try to understand from my perspective at a time in life my hair was bad but i could accept it -  I could go out with my hair out, confident - then it got to a point I couldn’t - then I got surgery and had hair where I didn’t but didn’t know how to act as I never had hair there before. Do you understand? Also where I’m from it’s absolutely unheard of to do things like this - I had to essentially keep this a secret - I didn’t tell anyone - I missed a lot of holidays, birthdays etc simply due to the fact I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin and when people asked for reasonings I couldn’t share the real reason as I was scared of being judged. 
But yet again I didn’t understand myself - why did I do this if even if the results were successful or not how would I go about it? It seems my whole life I had made decision without my heart fully wanting those decisions to be made. 
I wanted my hair back so I could look like everyone else ‘because’ everyone else had hair. I was like the only guy with hair problems in my entire school. People noticed early I was balding but yet again going off topic.

How do I bounce back?
Please don’t tell me to start going gym every day.  
Start a business and make 4-5 figures in 6 months. Not that these are bad things.

But right now I feel like an alien. I need to rebuild myself essentially restart life. 
Is there any films I can watch? Any books I can read? Any podcasts I can listen too. Any music that will reach me?

It felt like someone for once actually appreciated who I am. A couple days ago I talked about my problems of how the friends I make eventually always seem to eventually never want to talk to me.

I’ve spent the last two years trying to form a real friendship at university. 
Throughout the first year I met two other people whom I thought I could’ve been friends with, unfortunately, due to my social anxiety I couldn’t get myself to have a conversation with them that would last more than a few sentences.
Eventually, once the pandemic hit my city and we went into lockdown, I lost contact with them. 

The second year was fully online due to the pandemic, I thought I would be alone the entire time, thankfully one of our modules had us get into groups to work on a project. After we finished the project, out of the group of 6 people, only three continued to talk to me, one of them ghosted me, and I stopped talking to the other two since they were only after my solutions to assignments. 

I’m on my final year now and this is my last chance to form a meaningful relationship with other students, I’ve signed up to two clubs, an art club and a photography club, the art club held a meet and greet the other day, I actually was social this time and managed to speak to several people. 
The next meet-up will happen next week, I have to make sure I don’t waste my time so I can form at least one good friendship before the end of my course. I feel like this time will be different. 

Hopefully this 4 year long period of loneliness will finally come to an end.",lonely,Hopefully the end to my loneliness. And a new beginning.,2021-10-20 12:05:00

2092,VeryMentallyStable,1634691144,1,"Don’t even know why I’m thinking about this. I don’t even want a girlfriend. I already know that. I only like the *idea* of having one, not the real thing. So I don’t know why this is bothering me right now, but it is. I’m covered in self-harm scars. They’re all up my right arm, across my chest and stomach, my thigh, even up and down my back. There’s no angle you could look at me from and not see a scar. 

I’ve heard all the “they’re not ugly” and the “they’re part of who you are” and “if you meet the right person, they won’t judge you over them”, but honestly I think it’s bullshit. At least partially. Because people might try to believe that stuff on the surface, that’s what they might think consciously when they see them, but there’s a subconscious reaction that I think is impossible to avoid. 

Now I’m not the type of person who normally gives two shits what other people think of me. Live my life alone, so people mean next to nothing to me in general. But one thing I really hate I when I feel like people see me as weak. And that’s why my scars frustrate me so much, how to hell could I ever let anyone see them and not have them think of me as weak on some level after that? I don’t think they could help it, subconsciously, if they saw that I’ve self-harmed before and saw how much, it’s kinda unavoidable to see that person as vulnerable, fragile, weaker than they were before. I don’t think you can avoid seeing someone differently after seeing that. 

You hear it in people’s reactions all the time, it’s always something like “I’m sorry”, it’s sympathy. I don’t want it, don’t have any use for sympathy. Don’t want someone to feel “sorry” for me. But I can’t avoid that reaction. Even if they say nothing, I’ve seen it in their eyes before, back when I still forced myself to be around people and had casual encounters. I saw them look and there’s always this same reaction, even if they say nothing about it. It makes me wanna call the whole thing off and kick them outta my fucking house. I hate it.

I’ve never experienced it in an actual relationship before, but I don’t think I ever could anyway. Like I said at the start, I don’t even want one, so I don’t know why I’m caught thinking about this but I am. It just makes me so fucking angry that I’m stuck with these for the rest of my life, that my skin will never be smooth ever again, that even if I somehow found a way to tolerate people and maybe actually wanted a girlfriend, that I couldn’t have one now because I already know what she’ll think of me when she sees the scars.",lonely,My scars have already ruined every relationship I’ll ever have,2021-10-20 11:52:24

As men we are told to not really have emotions and to hide them. Most men never get hugs from people outside their family. Whether or not a guy tells you or not we all want hugs. Sometimes we just want to break down crying the the arms of a friend but are told not to. So we bottle it up and sometimes those bottles up emotions turn violent. I guarantee you that if any of the mass shooters in schools were given hugs and asked how they were doing they wouldn’t have done it. Bottling up emotions is unhealthy but unfortunately most men do it. We all look fine on the outside but on the inside a storm is going on. Sometimes we just need the warmth of a caring person to feel better. So next time you your guy friend give him a hug.

So you know how your mental and emotional well-being impacts your health? I'm not talking about feeling sad for a few weeks, that will not noticeably impact your health in the long run, but humans are social creatures and we all have minimum social requirements to feel ""healthy"", even if they vary individual to individual (e.g. extroverts vs introverts). 

Now take me: I have fallen so far past my minimum threshold that I'm at the bottom of the pit. I have been starved of my minimum social requirements for over five years now. It's been that long since I've had a friend that I trusted or felt close to. I'm not clinically depressed, and I do what I can to enjoy and take pleasure in things that's in my power (i.e. hobbies, volunteering, pets), but my dominant and consistent emotion throughout these past five years is sadness. I've coped but the lack of social bonds for this long is absolutely impacting my health. It's hard to explain, I'm not spiritual or anything, but I can just sense that this persistent sadness is absolutely having repercussions on my lifespan. I'm of average health now, physically mobile and active, but in the future? Perhaps nearer future than I realize? Who knows.

I'm not talking about self-harm, I would never do that to my parents. But... I don't know. Will to live is somewhat low. It's hard to imaging myself fighting for survival against an illness or an injury when I'm in old age, unless I'm saved through the power of friendship. I literally feel like I need medicine but no one can give it to me. I know what I need, but for whatever reason I'm incapable of turning acquaintanceships into true friendships. I have friends who I can hang out with occasionally but the bond is superficial despite what I'd like, or need it to be. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but it's a problem. When I was younger I was the type to just have one good friend at a time, and usually they ""pursued"" me. I've never been able to make a strong friendship with people on my own. 

Basically I can't treat this on my own, I need someone to really like me, and I feel like I'm ""handling"" it by slowly dying LOL anyone else?",lonely,Is anyone else so lonely you can literally feel your lifespan shortening?,2021-10-20 10:15:05

I had this theory that loneliness was just something I was always going to have to deal with and with what’s been happening lately, I’m starting to trust my theory. I’m a lonely person. I’m sure that obvious since I’m here often. Anyway.. I’ve been trying (sorta) to be more social so I can be around others and maybe make friends, but nothing works. Let me explain what I’ve tried…

1. Getting a job

I planned on getting one anyway so I can make some money, but my therapist said it would be good for me so I could be around others and maybe make friends. It’s been months and I’m still not working yet. The HR team hasn’t gotten back to me yet and I’m told that they’re under staffed (which I understood) but that completely erased my dreams of possibly socializing and being around the same faces everyday.

2. Talking to people here

Every time I get a message, it’s from someone who stops replying to me after 2-3 days (btw no one is obligated to reply to me I’m just expressing how I feel) or it’s a guy who only cares about 18+ conversations which makes me uncomfortable and they can’t take the hint. I come here to express wanting someone to talk to. A friend. Getting to know each other.. but that rarely works out.. so that isn’t an option. 

3. Joining groupchats with people who have similar interests as me

The groupchats always die and I always end up being the oldest there. As a 22 year old, I can’t relate to a 16 year old and there are even moments where I become insecure about my age. People my age don’t seem interested I guess. 

4. Taking a class on campus

Did nothing for me. No one even sits beside me in class. I would’ve been alone if it weren’t for the person who sat across from me. But I don’t really see her much. Seems like my other classmates are already in their own little friend groups and then there’s me. My social anxiety messes with my mind so I couldn’t even imagine myself trying to be apart of their friend groups. A lot of them seem like first year college students and again, there’s me…

5. Posting on so social media 

I have fan pages only and no one pays attention to me. They look at my posts and move on. Sometimes I try to be interactive and ask questions and people just ignore me. There’s no point of me creating a social media page where I post my face because I don’t have any friends and I’ve always been ignored. People with the same interests as me don’t even wanna interact with me (im a kpop fan btw)

Nothing works out for me ever. I keep coming to the conclusion that I will never have friends or a significant other.

It sucks that a pet could help with my loneliness a bit but no one in my family will let me, a 22 year old woman, have one. Clearly they don’t take the pain of loneliness seriously or understand how hard it is to deal with it everyday.

I've felt emotionally numb for really long. I'm not sure why but I'd guess it's because of loneliness, but I don't even feel sad about being lonely anymore, just numb and empty. Being almost all alone in life makes everything feel so meaningless.

My loneliness is not one of craving a romantic partner, I've never been much interested in such and I feel I'm odd for being that way. I value close and meaningful platonic relationships (emphasizing on the word platonic, I'm not saying that romantic relationships can't be that way) and I just wish I had one real close friend. 

I have a few online friends I really care about and can talk freely with. But as much as I love them it's different from irl friends, especially as I don't feel comfortable showing myself nor voice chatting with them so there's a lot we don't know about each other.

However, I've been friends with one of these friends for around 5 years now and we've actually met irl a few times. We knew each other quite well and we were extremely close. They really were my best friend. In the passing year though we've drifted apart. It was my fault because I didn't appreciate them enough. We talked less and less while I was engrossed in chatting with someone else (completely online friend) to who our friendship ended up meaning nothing. 

Now they have other very close irl friends and I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on in their life anymore. They don't want to talk to me about any heavier things that are in their mind either. I ruined our friendship and I don't think I can ever get back the great relationship we had.

I'm not sure if anyone will, but thanks to anyone who read this far. I appreciate that so much, random stranger. Also, English isn't my first language so I hope it wasn't too bad.",lonely,I feel so emotionally numb and I've ruined my friendship with the best friend I had,2021-10-20 09:20:06

It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.***

I am fortunate to be born when I was. In my mind it was a blessing.  I learned later in life, we were poor but comfortable and felt loved which is very important.  
We did not have a lot that kept us home so I have always been out in public because I had to be in order to enjoy life. It forced me to come in contact with many people each day. It was just a fact of life. In that way, just by shear numbers,  you came across people and you could not help but to make friends. 
I am now lonely like the rest of you here because of my depression because of changes in my family life and covid. 
Video games, reality TV,  social media and working from home are most of the cause of your loneliness. It is not that these things are bad, but they promote not being physically around others.  They give the feeling of interaction but deprive us of physically interacting.  Jmho. 
The cure for this. Go for a walk each day at the mall each day? Go to the library or book store once a week? Join a book club  or some other club? Take a night class? Donate time to charity? Food bank ? Homeless shelter? You get the idea.  Sitting at home and  complaining about it here is not going to make it better.  A dream come true for me is two Years from now would be for the only ones on this sub is for people on this sub helping new people that would wander into it. My depression started 2 years ago and I have had 3 panic attacks.  I have never had these problems in my life. Circumstances in my 65yo life has caused them and increased them by the way I went about correcting it. 
The good news is I finally achieved my goal. I am going on a 6 week adventure to Malaysia and the Philippines to be with friends I have made on the internet.  It sounds extreme but the heart wants what it wants. 
In summation life is a beautiful gift.  We are given unlimited choices each day how we use this gift. If we continually make the wrong choices depression sets in and it is hell getting that pest off. We can all do it. 
One more note. My wife is totally bedridden with a spinal cord tumor and the results of encephalitis.  She is fed by a feeding tube and pees with a urinary catheter.  I am not looking for sympathy.  I am going to tell you that she is happier than all of us on this sub because she sees her granddaughter each day and eats and plays with her from her bed. She has only complained once about her plight and that was thirty years ago when it first started and she did not know what she was dealing with.

This makes a lot of sense. When you feel like other people have similar perspectives, values and opinions as you, it makes it easier for you to bond with them.

After reading that, I felt a bit hopeless for a brief moment. I feel like I usually have a different outlook on life as other people and I know that's one of the reasons why I can't connect with most people. But I don't want to go through the rest of my life feeling like I have no one that shares my kind of reality, it's so lonely and miserable. I want to to be true to myself and not pretend to be someone I'm not for the sake of other people but at the same time I'm very socially anxious so I tend to prioritize other people's feelings above mine. So I basically created this barrier between myself and the rest of the world because I'm so afraid of judgement and rejection that it seems to be the only way I can cope. The problem is that I'll never find people who share my reality as long as I keep that wall up.

I did alright the first time I was here, made friends, had an active social life and was genuinely enjoying myself. It was still hard sometimes, of course, but I never stayed in my room for weeks at a time. Sometime during May when the whole Covid thing kicked up, my parents wanted me back because they were really worried, so I moved back to my parents place. 

I always felt like an outsider in my hometown, like I would get penalized for trying to make friends because everyone knew everyone already, so it was really lonely while I was back. I think quarantine fucked me up, too, because now I’m terrified of holding actual conversations with people and I get tired so, so easy.

A high degree a supposedly prestigious research position
Married to the person who dated me since college

But just scratch the surface and you can see the wounds the darkness the depression.

My friends are no longer in vicinity they stay far with their worlds their time lines separated again by continents and cities. The truth is no one knows and will know that beneath my smiling face lies these ocean of tears.

How is it that I sense people's agonies mirth but they can't sense mine!

I met someone a few months ago and immediately the way my damaged heart is spiralled down quickly into another dark abyss.. I keep dreaming having illusions about this person.. My heart fell again..

Sometimes I am too happy to be on my own to be with my silence at other times I wish... Someone would want to have a chat with me maybe share a cup of coffee.

Then again there is no one.

There I wallow again in self hatred and self love simultaneously... Fooling the world telling them all is well..

Years ago I saw someone take their life and I know that's selfish so I won't go that route but nevertheless I keep imagining this life to be over the only thing holding me back my mother.. An innocent soul bashed so much by life yet standing strong..

I was very insecure and lonely at the time, and I think that influenced my feelings. I think those were feelings of attachment combined with lust more than anything. I remember she wanted call things off and I believed I was going to die of a heart attack.

So I was catfished over the weekend. GORGEOUS guy, or so I thought. Long story short, ended up finding out after a night of sexting. That's on me. 

What bugs me the most out of all this is the guy in question defended himself when I called him out by saying, ""sorry I just really have a thing for trans women"" so literally all he did was reaffirm my belief that I'm nothing more than a fetish fulfilment device. I don't have feelings in other's eyes. I'm little more than a walking Fleshlight. Honestly. I've come to accept that part of it over the years. It's sad, but that's reality in small-town US.

We have 30 days of vacation that we can use throughout the year (using all days is mandatory though). This, in combination with my relation to work, means I work without vacation almost for a year and annual dealing with the abundance of vacation had always been a nightmare.

I had a short relationship (9 month long) and actually planned a vacation with someone else for the first time of my life. She broke up with me this May. This was before our vacation so I promptly cancelled all vacation plans.

My mental health deteriorated to the point I became more easily irritated, gloomy and outright hostile towards colleagues in some cases. It was about time my boss noticed it. We had a talk about this and she sent me on month long vacation.

Today it marks 3rd week of being stuck alone between four walls, mindless internet browsing and talking only to the Vietnamese cashier at grocery store. The only semblance of regimen are daily showers and work out days (outdoors cardio and weightlifting at home gym) but I'm slowly losing track of what day is today...

I tried reaching out to the few people I consider friends. The most positive answer I've got was about them being busy right now but reassuring me they'll get back to me when they have time. Others simply didn't bother to answer. I'm aware about the possibility they're just really so busy they simply forgot but there's also a chance of them not just wanting to go out and left this open because that's easier to do than outright rejection... It's been a week since I asked last one...

I thoroughly cleaned my apartment. Learned few new recipes. Pushed through the procrastionation and finally finished one personal project of mine, progressed at weightlifing... This vacation was supposed to get my mind clear but I feel as if this effect is rather opposite...

#1 Ask questions:- all u Have to do is ask questions, if u ask questions ur in the lead of the conversation....so if u think that the conversation is going dry ask some unexpected question now the question should be related to something u both can talk about. For example let's say anime....u both like anime so u would go ""which is ur fav"" or ""which one have u seen Latest""?? Then on the based on answer like lets say the person says a anime u know about....then u can talk about it like what they like in that or when have they seen it, fav character and all. 
And if they some anime u haven't seen then u have two choices.....u can go like ""ohh what's that anime about""?? Or the other thing u can do is say them ur fav and u can talk talk about ur fav.....if both of u have seen it. 

A conversation is the on the spot thing haha. But hope this helps the ones who struggle with the conversation.

2223,no4reas0n,1634620175,1,"I (M18) feel like I would really like to have a girlfriend, but I need to accept the fact that it's not gonna happen anytime soon at best. 

I don't have even close to the confidence in myself to talk to a girl or convince myself I'd ever have a chance with them. Even if I could talk to a girl, I'd never be able to make it work. I think I'm asexual (in my case that means I still have romantic attraction), or if I'm not, I'm at the very least terrified of intimacy and definitely not ready for sex, which I realize is a problem for any prospective relationships.

So for the like, two girls in the world that are compatible with me and just so happen to be asexual as well, I still feel like I would just push her away. I'm so terrified of being ""tied down,"" to the point where even having something as simple as my gym membership stresses me out and makes me feel like I can't leave where I am. So I feel like I would just push away something as important as a girlfriend.

Not only that, but I'm so introverted, I don't think I could handle spending time with someone. When I spend a fair amount of time even with people like my immediate family (I'm lucky to be very close with my family, so at least I'm not alone there), I feel like I absolutely need to be alone for a while because I get drained so quickly. Not only that, but I'm constantly irritable and annoyed at the people I care about, sometimes for no apparent reason. I guess I like to keep people at arm's reach, so I can be with them or push them away whenever I want. It's one of those things where I feel bad about the way I act, even while I'm doing it, but I can't figure out how to be better.

I realize these are negative traits, and if I'm a person who has these negative traits, and is so emotionally unavailable, and who keeps people around only for myself, how could I ever give a girl what she deserves out of a relationship? It would be unfair to be in a relationship with me.

I'm young and haven't even begun to figure myself out fully, so maybe and hopefully these things change, but I also get worried that maybe someday I'll be 40 and still terrified of settling down, terrified of intimacy, and pushing away the people I love.",lonely,"Accepting the fact that I can't or shouldn't have a relationship, at least not at this point in my life",2021-10-19 16:09:35

They made a lot of new friends there and are always going out to parties and stuff and I’m just at home watching their stories. I don’t blame them for losing contact because people get busy but it sure does hurt. I was trying to sort of get over it until I came across a group album and all the memories kicked back in. I love seeing them make new friends and find love interests because I still want the good for them but it hurts that we went from talking everyday to not talking at all. They weren’t the best friend group to me but I still miss being their friend.

It's 2 AM where I am sitting. I have to get up in a few hours and get back the daily grind. Got off a long and tiring work day today and I just felt truly and absolutely caged. I'm married, still don't know why I said yes to getting married. Feels like I'm not made up for this kind of thing. Too scared to end the marriage cause I know it'll break my mother's heart. I now know why married men choose to rather end their lives than face the ordeal, but I want to live and do things. Anyway, so I finished work, cam out for a walk and grabbed a smoke. It didn't felt good, in fact it didn't feel anything, I think why I did it because that something I wanted to do. Came back home and wife questioned if I had been smoking, I said no but this thought creeped inside my head that why should I be answerable for my actions to anyone, and this thought refuses to go away now. I have to get back the next morning and I'm always scared, always worried, always tensed.

Oh, but life had other plans. One person who would sit by me and listen to me has left me. She’s right in college - right there - having fun with her friends while I’m just here, sulking in a corner - wondering what did I ever do wrong to deserve this. 

They say loneliness comes in various types and forms - but I think one of the most complex ones is when you physically have people around you, but you are wallowing in your loneliness. 

I don’t think I deserve happiness. Too many things have shown me that. I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m unloveable. To the fact that I am ugly. To the fact that I’m not a “cool” person whom people want to spend time with. I’m just someone who can be discarded very easily - and replaced even more easily. I don’t contribute to anything in life. 

All I can ever be is a burden to my friends and my family. My arm is filled with scars and I sit on my bed with a knife on the other hand, resisting the urge to slash my wrists with that knife.

Everywhere I go I have a constant fear and stress of people, I can never relax. Nothing is enjoyable ever I can try and make myself seem like it is but it’s always just me panicking on the inside the whole time I’m doing anything. Whenever I have a moment of happiness in seconds I’m overthinking again. It never stops. I don’t know how to fix this and I can’t keep living like this. People will make fun of me for being quiet or awkward to my face and think it’s not rude.

2320,-Soah-,1634566425,1,"Just venting and I dont think my paragraph makes much sense nor is it very well structured.   
I've been feeling lonely for the past couple of years and for the most of it... preoccupying myself with work and studies has helped put it aside and made it less noticeable. It wasn't a deliberate action it just happened to be like that.. a subconscious action? My family is not a very affectionate one and since my mother passed it has been even more evident as she was the only one who showed an ounce of affection. The overwork and rigorous studies might have been my way to cope, but I only recently realised how bad it was when a friend of mine pointed out that she only saw me twice in a year (before corona) and how recent in the first year after her death I got used by my workplace often overtiming and working past midnight... With work, I think I'm burnout or I think I generally find no meaning in it... I have no strong passions or ambition so I really rather just work part-time or not get promoted. I wish I had something I am passionate about to learn and work towards.. I admire people with passions and hobbies and dreams. I mean I have interests better never to the degree to have the motivation to pursue something in relation to it...I  also have never been in a relationship and never really sought one, but recently whether biologically, mentally, physically or everything its really hit the multiply button in the past year. The possibility that I am unable to feel romantic love is quite painful and somewhat opens a void in me. Like I want to fall in love too, feel a real connection with someone who will rely on you as much as you do them? Mutual respect, trust and loyalty...When I explain to friends they say give it time one day, I understand that but this void is indescribable and so painful and without the physical and mental affection at home or from friends I think my limit is at its peak.  I am probably depressed at some level or just really chronically sad. So I tried to take my own step forward... pushing myself, when I got into uni I pushed myself to step out of my comfort zone, got my first job, joined the gym, socialised, made new friends despite my introversion. I'm tired. I just want to be in my bubble, not work and stay in my room and sleep, chill, and do what I want to do. But I won't I need t work to look after dad, he's not good with money (like real bad, gambling bad) and old.  I've been independent at a youngish age not too young as some have experienced (I'm privileged I know)  but from a circumstance where I was always babied before mum's passing.... so I think it caused some mental blockage or damage when the support just went poof. I think this has contributed to my problems with loneliness and relationships, it's hard for me to truly grow close to someone... I wish I did not crave companionship and at the same time, I don't really want to socialise... I think I'm tired of socialising at the same time. It is so contradictory .  I progressively become so cynical with life, I overthink, I see no future, it's bleak and I'm tired. I'm probably burnout socially as well, cause I have been communicating even have a group chat with these friends I've grown closer to since quarantine that we video chat daily, but somewhere in my heart I feel it's superficial, I'm still lonely. It doesn't help we have dissimilar interests and not really the same sense of humour or way we talk is different idk I'm fairly pessimistic/self-deprecating which is not ""their type of energy"" so I have to rein myself and I guess that's probably stressing me out subconsciously... and I'm on the scale of introversion so. I need rest but I've been pushing myself to reciprocate and now it caught up so I'm so tired and have been withdrawing which they have noticed and have a hard time understanding why and I feel bad. Not their fault just me... super tired and lonely.... man i'm a can of worms ain't I lolololol",lonely,on a slippery slope...,2021-10-19 01:13:45

I would say that I'm not a bad-looking guy and I do have friends, but for whatever reason, a romantic relationship has always been outside my reach. In high school, I was rejected constantly and constantly got made fun of and people would go around saying I was going to shoot up the school (even though I exhibited a lot of anti-social behaviors and basically gave them the ammunition to make fun of me). 

Going into college, this situation hasn't gotten any better. Pretty much every woman I meet is either taken or not interested (and it's been quite a lot). On top of this, I've even been sent to the dean's office for harassment just for trying to talk to a woman once. As a result, I've turned to online dating exclusively. 

The few times I have managed to talk with someone online, things ended badly. Back in 2019, I met a woman on Interpals. She was Russian/American (her parents were Russian, but she grew up in Colorado). I'm a huge Russophile and love women from that part of the world. Within days, we were saying we loved each other and wanted to meet up (I fell hard for her). It turns out that she was talking to other men the whole time and ghosted me after a while. Before this, I met a woman from England who I also ended up falling for and she ended up finding a guy IRL. 

After investing so much time and money into it, I've decided that it's just not worth it anymore. I've lost all hope of finding someone. I just don't have many opportunities to go and meet women and the ones I do meet are taken or totally not interested (as mentioned previously).

We fell in love rather quickly and always talked to each other. I lived in Orange County and she lives in San Diego. Our first night together went well. She wanted to see me again. I saw her a couple of weeks later when she was done visiting Riverside and moved back to San Diego

I did not mind the drive at all. Especially since I stayed the whole weekend. Friday through Sunday. Our first weekend together was great, we had a good time and we had sex. 

I'm very sick with Celiac disease so my body is still relatively weak since I found out about a year ago and only perfected dealing with it a few months ago. I had trouble getting erect with her. It was a surprise to me since I was a virgin and did not know I have erectile disfunction. I know my health is improving as I see myself slowly gaining strength over the last few months.

She kissed me and told me it was OK. We found other ways to make love. She was a very beautiful girl. I'm kind of chubby and unfit. A couple years younger than me. Outside of the bedroom, we never fought and we spent lots of time non-stop talking and cuddling.

Lots of laughing and making memories. After the weekend, she told me she needed to get school work done and I said ok, I'll give you this weekend to finish up. I'll see her the next one. But she said no, that she wanted me to go visit her and that I could just watch her do schoolwork. Again, we had a good time again. Lots of cuddling, talking, and compliments to each other. Again. I had trouble pentatrating her but I managed to do it to o
He for a bit. I felt so bad that I couldn't perform but she kissed me and told me it was OK. I tried to give her time to do her homework. But she just spent her time being with me instead.

After that weekend. I asked her when I could see her again and reminded her of our upcoming trip to Knotts Scary Farm. She said that she needed about three weeks. I said, ok. I thought to myself that's quite a long time but I can wait. I noticed she started to change. We usually texted quite frequently and sent lots of compliments and hearts, and I love yous. 

She went two days without texting me. I asked her if her feelings changed, she was acting distant. She wrote me a lengthy message saying that she too busy to focus on a relationship. It's not anything to do with me but that she's not ready for a long term long distance relationship yet. The whole ""It's not you, it's me"". That she needs to focus on school. I want being pusby or obnoxious.

I could read between the lines though. I asked her if there was anything I could do to fix our relationship. She said no, it's final. And to stop messaging her so much.

I dont understand how she went from being so loving and the best person I ever met to just so cold. She was the first one to say I love you. She reached out to me first, she told me she would ""simp"" for me. She broke my heart. I asked her if I could at least see her one last time and say goodbye but she said no.

I'm so heartbroken. I spent so much time alone and I meet my first ever girlfriend at 24years old. She's even better than I could ever hope for.

For once in my life I experienced true happiness and love. I understand what it was to be loved

2370,Grief_Slinger,1634540975,1,"There is nothing I hate more than hearing the words “you need to love yourself,” or “it’ll happen when you least expect it.”

I’m lonely, motherfucker! I crave human contact—both physical and emotional. I want to lie down in bed at night, with the person I love snuggled up next to me. I’m tired of waking up from an amazing dream, only to find myself spooning my pillow in the morning. I’m tired of hearing shitty, unsolicited advice from people who are happily married or in the relationships that I want for myself.

They think they’re helping. And I honestly can’t blame them. I’ve heard it all before though. I know I need to love myself. I know that, and I try. I love my job, I have friends who care about me, and I’m genuinely happy with my life, for the most part. It’s just that one glaring hole that prevents me from being happy sometimes. That extra key to the front door that never gets used.

I know some of my wants are purely physical, too. As a guy who’s been actively putting himself out there for years, yet never held a relationship beyond the second date, never been kissed by anyone but his mom, and never had sex with anything besides his own left hand, I am no stranger to the baser of emotions: lust.

I realize all of this. Yet people seem to only want to regurgitate the same “advice” at me every time I mention the fact that, “hey, it sure would be nice to have someone special to help make life just a little sweeter.” One can only be told to love themselves so many times before they begin to think they’re unlovable. I’ve been “least expecting it” for years, now, so why hasn’t it happened yet?

But the worst, by far, are these self-righteous fuckers who think they’re doing me a favor by telling me that I’m not ready for love. Apparently, on their planet, desiring deeper human connection and romance is a sign that you don’t need it, and, in fact, you’d only be hurting yourself if your want for love was met. So, you’re telling me that if I decided to shave my head, move to a momentary, and take a vow of celibacy, THAT is what means I’m “ready?”

Fuck off.

Anyway. This really just a vent. I genuinely do like where I am in life, just wish I had someone to be happy alongside me. I guess it was seeing a friend I had a crush on in high school get married a week back that set me off. Seeing them so happy and being happy for them just got me thinking, “Will that ever be me?”

I am trying holy hell i am trying but I am burning out. Told a lot of people I have to interact with family disability coordinators but in the end none of them are in the business of pulling people out of pits. I am just running into a brick wall and told to force myself through it and there's only so much of this that someone can handle before they shut down. I am nearing that limit.  I am just getting overwhelmed just managing class work and one class for utterly no reason besides being unable to seek help from anyone is causing me to break down. It isn't the class itself it is just the final straw type deal. I can't let go. I can't distress. Physical touch is the only way I feel any sort of comfort or safety and none one wants to hold a 30 year old loser. So I get to cry in my room then hurt myself physically to make the anxiety filled PSTD moment end before it causes social harm. I don't know what else to do I am nearing that point where I just want to make them pain stop permanently. It seems to be my only option because without money without resources I am a sitting duck just floundering around. Ffs. it is hard knowing my surgeries is what caused a lot of this. My parents divorce all the yelling. I am constantly hypertensive always on edge. I WANT TO BREATH I WANT TO WAKE UP FEELING LIKE I CAN MANAGE THE DAY.

2400,BroodingBatman,1634528534,1,"Long story short, I missed out on my teenage years. Looking back, it was incredible how much I was sheltered.

To put it simply, I just think I'm better off alone, and knowing how much more difficult to make friends at 26 compared to 16, why would I want to try and make friends?

Think about it. People are much busier at my age and lack the free time like they use to. Also, we no longer have that safe school setting. Our only choices are work. The worst place if you ask me. Or hobbies, which you can do for years and come out with nothing. Or you can make good ""acquaintances"" but never really see much of them outside of your hobby.

I wish I can be 19 again and live in a dorm room where friends are just down the hall. I wish I had a hardcore group of friends like some of my teenage cousins do right now. There's a certain innocence that teenage friendships and romantic relationships have that can never be replicated in adulthood. Everything and everyone just seems overly serious.

I guess the truth is, I'm just uninterested in friendships now because they won't be the type of friends I would have made as a teenager. They won't be nearly as close that's for sure.

I have missed out on the boat that's for sure. I guess I can have friends but they'll act like adults. I can do some of the same things I missed out on as a teen, maybe even better. But the thing is I'm 26 and I'll be surrounded by other adults doing it.

I don't know why. But there's something off-putting and boring about that. I can't help but still want to be a teenager deep down.

Either way, I don't really have a choice about it. I wish I can just befriend a bunch of college-aged students but society will rage and tell me to be age-appropriate. Same thing with romantic relationships. So yes. You stupid boring fucks are all I'm getting. The only reason I'm bitterly swallowing this is that it's better than nothing. So, I'll try my best to be nice to you even though I dislike you deep down.

Yesterday, I had a ticket to a football game that was given to me. I put it out there that it was for free, anyone was welcome to tag along, not one person responded. 

A coworker text me today that he was at a football game, he asked if I was there, I replied to him I wasn't. He let me know that him and someone else went and that was it. I was thinking to myself ""I would have loved to have gone, he knows I would have gone, but he didn't ask me, why?!"". I sat at home watching the game and realized I can't remember the last time I had someone over to just hang with me. 

I can't begin to tell you how many times I have reached out to friends and ask ""let's get together for a drink, catch up"" or friends that are fearful of being around others because of COVID, so I suggest facetime....nothing from anyone. It hurts.

I see a therapist and I've told her at times I've had suicidal thoughts. 

We all have our problems, I have mine, I won't deny that. I do think that I have a lot going for myself, and in someways I am stable. I just want to feel wanted and appreciated by my friends and peers. It feels like my friends like me from arms length, like they have no problem wanting to text over the phone or snapchat, but god forbid that we can ever have that human interaction. 

As for the lady I left a week ago. My friends tell me I am such a catch, yet a lot of times I can't seem to find a woman that wants to talk to me. When I do, I just doesn't end up working several months later, they just end up ghosting me. 

I know this sounds crazy, but I'm at this point. I've never traveled abroad, it was because I been waiting to meet that right someone that can travel with me. I'm at the point where I would even PAY for a companion to travel with me just so I could have SOMEONE to spend time with, create memories with.

I run a airbnb, and wouldn't believe how much I can't wait for my guests to come through, because I finally have a person to talk to. I just appreciate the little things like that and it just seems few and far between....

But there has never been a sound

It’s slowing oh it’s slowing

I’m looking at the ground

I see the tracks in front of me

O how far do they stretch out

The years only come and go 

It has been so long since

I tried and tried those failed attempts

I look back and I wince

The agony the pain 

Could never be contained

I used my body as a canvas

To express what’s in my brain

I did the same thing again again

You could say I’m insane

I am on a track of life

On this southbound train 

I look at my past and see

The puddles left by the rain

It’s hurts more now that I’m all grown up 

It’s no longer teenage angst",lonely,No Longer Teenage Angst,2021-10-18 13:36:25

Every moment crushes my heart. Even now, as I'm typing this, some 90's sitcom in the background serving as my friend for the night while I try desperately to quiet the voice constantly telling me no one cares, but that voice is the only truth. It's the only thing I know to be true, no one cares about me and no one ever will.

Most times I feel like a phantom, like I'm not here. I witness people talk to eachother and enjoy each other's company. I witness a man look at a woman, holding her hand, a friend making another laugh, a stranger making conversation. I do not belong. I never have and never will. Understanding that is painful. Ignoring it is temporary relief. 

There is not one person in this entire world than will ever understand and accept me. I will not know love. It's terrifying, but it's my only truth. The only real thing I have.

He's nice and we have the same interests(basic geeks) he wants to meet this weekend, but there is some problems that I might face.. First of all I will unfold the problems. Age difference; he's 21 and I'm 16. I don't mind a 5-year age difference, but I heard so many horror stories that older guys are going after teenage girls, because they're easier to manipulate to etc..I don't think it's this case with him, but I talked with some people about it and they said that an big age difference(with a minor) is a redflag. We actually started to talk when I was 15 and he was 20. Basically he was pretty sexually talkactive then and that frightened me and I was also scared that my strict parents will find out. I messaged him because I felt so lonely and I matured a lot in a year. He told me he's sorry for being too sexual and he told me that if there's a problem I should always let him know. In the beginning it was nice, we talked and called a lot, but then after a period the conversations started to get cold. I had to put all the effort in starting a conversation, I get ghosted a lot, I would get a message 2 hours later even though he's constantely online. He only talks actively when the conversation becomes sexual. He explained to me before that he has a high libido and such so he becomes horny a lot, well I have the same, but I can still talk normally and not ignore someone I like and what saddens me the most is that I know him from a discord server and it might be me being paranoid, but he's also friends with the typical ''hotty, slutty'' popular E-girls from the server. It makes me feel so unworthy. Also when we talked about our meeting, he also says stuff:'' I cant wait to \[insert sexual deed\] with you. Even though I mentioned so many times I do not immedaitely want to lose my virginity with someone on the first date. I'm raised in a foreign culture which makes virginity for a girl important and honestly I want to be at least 18 year old to have sex and be in a relationship for a long time. I explained this to him numerous times, but he still thinks somehow he can convince me to have sex. So if we meet, this is what the situation can turn out to: My appearence looks different compared to my pics, so he gets disgusted and find a way to dump me, he likes me and starts to manipulate into having sex, he will manipulate me into having sex and after block me or the best ending: he respects my boundaries and we will only kiss and hug and from that point our relationship starts to get serious.  oh and aside note, i already kinda see him as my bf, but he doesnt see me as his gf, he told me he will decide after meeting, which is kinda logical, but hearing that hurted me.

One of the things I'm trying to break away from is a friend group I've known for since i was kid. we met over the internet when we were all kids, now we're all grown up.

It was fun while it lasted, but sometimes i feel like I've grown so much from these people. It's a little hard to hang out with them without feeling extremely lonely. Of course i care about them, but i just feel so distant. I don't relate to them anymore, and feel like none of them are actually there for me. whenever we hang out it feels like we're just trying to pass the time.

But like... I've known them for SEVEN years. Its kind of hard to break away from that even though i know i should. I talk to them almost everyday, its like a routine.

its also hard because if i break away from these people then I'll truly have no friends. Its really rare that I can connect with someone so I just know it'll be a while before i have friends again.

However my dad &amp; I sorta divorced from the D&amp;,D group, more or less cutting me off from socialization with other people irl.

Xbox Live doesn't do it for me anymore, no one wants to be in a party with me, I have a microphone to talk to other people, but they don't really say anything back.

Any other important place that I recently left, was the restuarant  I was working at. Just like school though, I didn't hang out my coworkers outside of work &amp; I don't really talk to any of them, they typically don't seem to be interested in my company. As if it's inconvenient for them to hang out with me.

I haven't had a relationship for a year, I haven't had sex ,(mainly due to my faults &amp; insecurities), the last girl I wanted to be with wasn't interested in me, and the one before that, I screwed up entirely. It left me bitter, hateful, resentful, and sad and lonely and filled with seething contempt for anyone happier than me. I hate people who are happy  I want to be them, I hate myself.

I have ADHD &amp; on the spectrum, I feel like I have to work on eggshells everywhere, yet I'm impulsive &amp; have an addictive personality. I'm extremely critical of myself, to the point of being scared to do anything that might not be within my limits at all.

I just want good friends &amp; a meaningful relationship, it is the one thing that hurts me the most, when nothing occupies my mind... my mind picks me apart , it only gives the existential dread of dying &amp; having only one, short life that I'm squandering. I'm waiting money on stuff for gaming, dnd, &amp; airsoft in the vain hope of socialization with other people. It never pans out well, I basically buy the infrastructure/stuff needed, but it never amounts to anything.

If youre going to comment...please dont say anything mean, im not feeling strong enough currently to deal with any of that kind of stuff right now.


Im SO lonely. I have no friends. My family doesn't love me. And the thing is, I try so hard to make meaningful connections. I am a very kind hearted person, I am a pacifist, I am completely non judgemental. I dont know what it is about myself that makes ME the kind of person who ends up completely alone and isolated. I dont know what I'm doing so horribly wrong that I cant seen to make any friends (im in my 3rd year at university, with no friends despite constant trying). I'm not overbearing, i know how to recognise when someone doesnt like me (because it happens all the time) and i thus know when to stop trying with that person. Its honestly not fair. I dont care if i sound like a whiney bitch saying that-- but its not fair, it really isnt. Every person out there who is lonely experiences an unfair life. And please dont tell me 'lifes unfair, suck it up', because that wont be helpful. I do 'suck it up' on the daily, just get on with life alone but right now i just really want to vent about all of this because it makes me so upset and so angry. All i want in life is for someone to care for me and love me. Its not much. I still have hopes ill find something some day but christ its SO HARD to keep going sometimes. Sometimes it just hits me like a pile of 100 tonne bricks and I cant breathe. What makes it worse for me, that extra squeeze of lemon and salt into the wound, is that im an identical twin. And my identical twin grew up under the same conditions as me yet, no matter what, she has ALWAYS has a big friend group who are supportive and active and love her. Ive never had that and it confuses me how ive always been excluded from everyone for longer than I can even remember. Even if people couldnt tell us apart, they always knew that i was the inferior twin that they didnt like, and my sibling was the superior one who they wanted to be friends with. And im so tired of being compared to my sibling. The ""whose your favourite twin"" but its never ever been me. The ""im only inviting you because youre [siblings name] sibling"". The frankly fake sympathy when my siblings friends realise that i have no friends (yet make no moves to include me, just say (sarcastically it seems) ""aww poor [my name]"".

Im out of things to say but...my life just frustrates me so much sometimes!! And i get so overwhelmed when i try to work out just *why* my life is like this, what i did to cause it and why i cant seem to fix it or get out of this isolated life.



Because they're relatable, here is the Torches Together lyrics:

Why burn poor and lonely?
Under a bowl or under a lampshade
Or on the shelf beside the bed
Where at night you lay turning like a door on it's hinges
(First on your left side, then on your right side, then your left side again)
Why burn poor and lonely?
Tell all the stones, we're gonna make a building
We'll cut into shape and set into place
Or if you'd rather be a window,
I'll gladly be the frame
Reflecting any kind of words
We'll let in all the blame
(And ruin our reputation all the same)
So never mind our plan making
We'll start living
Anyway, aren't you unbearably sad?
Then why burn so poor and lonely?
We'll be like torches - We'll be torches together!
With whatever respect our tattered dignity demands
Torches together, hand in hand
Why pluck one string?
What good is just one note?
Oh, one string sounds fine I guess...
We we're once 'One Notes'
We were lonely wheat quietly ground into grain
(What light and momentary pain!)
So why this safe distance, this curious look?
Why tear out single pages when you can throw away the book?
Why pluck one string when you can strum the guitar?
Strum the guitar!
With no beginning, with no end
Take down a guitar and strum the guitar if you're afraid,
And I'm afraid and everyone's afraid
And everyone knows it but we don't have to be afraid anymore
You played the flute but no one was dancing
You sang a sad song and none of us cried",lonely,As the song Torches Together goes: 'arent you unbearably sad?',2021-10-18 04:45:11

I think I have abandonment issues because I refuse to let anyone close because I know they are just gonna leave on day.

2480,glowssy,1634491248,1,"20F, putting this here to vent and see if anyone relate. I'm unable to make friends. Like I really don't know how to. 

Most of my friendships from kindergarten to highschool were toxic or distant. Basically my friends were also my bullies.

Now I'm an animation student but I can't seem to connect with my classmates. While I'm very outgoing with them in the day, when I go home in the evening no one messages me.

I'm afraid I unfortunately dug this hole I'm in myself. Indeed, when someone tries to be friends with me I push them away. I really don't like sleepovers and going out with someone gives me bad anxiety. 

It seems I'm only able to (badly) have smalltalk with people. Having deep conversations make me really uncomfortable and I always take hours to respond to texts even tho I see them in my notifications.

I also don't know how to seek friends ? Like I can't just go to a populated area and talk to someone. I don't know how to meet people outside of my classroom.

Maybe it's obvious seeing this post, but I've always had mental health issues. Anxiety at 8, depression at 13, social anxiety at 17 and I'm currently going through depression again. I sometimes wonder if I'm on the spectrum because I've always felt a bit different. In highschool I had the bad idea of starting drinking alone when I couldn't stand life anymore. 

Rn it's sunday evening where I live and I'm having a big group project tomorrow. My dumbass decided to drink again this afternoon, so I hope I won't be hungover.

Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming my life away. I imagine I'm going out with friends, I imagine I'm having deep conversations with my best friend, I imagine I'm holding someone I love. I'm used to loneliness but it gets old. 

What's scary is not having no close friends right now, it's being alone forever, dying without having accomplished anything and having formed meaningful relationships.

I guess my real problem is that I've always been very passive. Putting this out there is already a big step.

So for a couple of years now I've just felt so lost and alone. I feel that I can't relate with anyone. That I'm not really heard, appreciated or taken seriously. I've lost all confidence in myself and my abilities as well as self esteem about my quality of character and appearance.

When I was younger I would definitely try finding something to do or just walk around but now I just stay home or go to school. The problem is that I've never been the one to start a conversation with anyone. Now that I'm back in school it seems super creepy for someone my age to even try to talk to most of these girls at school. I notice that girls just look at what I'm wearing (I wear nice sneakers all the time) and that's it. I'm working on my bachelor's degree and ever since I went back to school I noticed that girls even in my class wouldn't even look at me. I guess since I don't go out I really won't be able to meet someone.

My main focus is to get through these obstacles of obtaining these degrees to eventually become a psychologist. I want to be a therapist and help teens that are going/went through similar situations like I did when I was younger.

As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

They're on their phones a lot messaging other people and playing games.  I understand we live in 2021 and people use their phones. I'm an IT specialist and I understand technology is a part of our everyday life. I just wish people would put them away when we're together. I've reduced my phone use significantly(From 6.5 hr/day to 4hr/day) over the past year (through usage monitoring apps and awareness when I'm out with people) because I noticed how it made me feel less connected to the people around me. I've addressed this with 5 people now in my friend group. Some understand and have backed off using it while we're out eating or hanging out. Some have told me I'm being ridiculous and phones are a part of our daily lives. I know many are trying to back off using their phones but I feel so disconnected and unwanted that as soon as I see someone pull their phone out it triggers my anxiety so bad I wanna start crying. I've stopped taking calls and messages from family and friends when out with others to try and stress the issue. From what I've seen this behavior is defined as ""phubbing"". 

I've tried therapists. I've tried communicating. I've tried finding new hobbies. I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy.

2514,MemeJohn69,1634477385,1,"Loneliness. A common feeling that apparently over 240,000 of us are experiencing. The sad thing is, there's more. And that number goes into the 7 digit region unfortunately. 

I've always found it funny that I feel this way. I'm in a friend group with about seven people and we all do rely on each other and I have a great relationship with my family, yet there's something missing. There's an empty void. And once that void is filled, it could be the solution to everything. 

I remember the first time I ever had a crush on a girl. It was in kindergarten. I would've been about 4. Although I can't remember her name and can vaguely remember her face, I remember we were best friends and we'd play every day and we relied on each other. And I remember one day, (this all happened in 2008) in the classroom there was a computer that we could play educational games on. I remember everyone was just doing their own thing in the classroom and it was just me and this girl sitting together by the computer. As we were playing the game and just laughing and smiling, I remember she kissed me on the cheek. ""Oooo, wow, big surprise"" you're probably thinking. It isn't anything special, but I can remember clearly how I felt in that one moment, almost 13 years later. I felt I was cared for and I had butterflies in my stomach. And I was smiling and I was happy. And then she kissed me again on the cheek and I remember we just held each other after that as we were still playing the game. No one else saw this. Wherever this girl is now, she's probably forgotten it long ago, she's probably forgotten who I am. I bring this up because that's the furthest I've ever gone with a girl. 

During primary school, I would end up having crushes, but hey, it's primary school. It's not like it's really going to lead to anything. When I got to secondary school, I did develop more crushes on girls I thought were genuinely beautiful but the thing was, I never had the guts to actually talk to them. I remember this one girl I had a crush on, it was for about two and a half years. I had a snapchat streak with this girl for TWO AND A HALF YEARS. Lasted for about 870+ days. During that entire time, I never had the guts to talk to her once. Eventually she got a boyfriend and I wasn't even shocked or jealous by that point because I knew I let that happen. There was no reason to take it out on them. And a few months later, I ended up repeating this mistake for another girl. It ended earlier thank God. And the thing was, I had an opportunity to go out with a girl. She liked me but I didn't share the same feelings back. I did for a short time but eventually I lost it. And looking back on it, it makes me upset because this was the only girl I'd ever known that had a genuine interest in me and she loved my quirky and weird side, we'd have conversations about movies or school and life sometimes and what did I do? I turned her down. and I guess that was why I didn't want to turn it into a romantic relationship. Because I valued the friendship we had and didn't want to lose it in the event we broke up. I'm still questioning whether she would have been good for me or not. She has a boyfriend now so that too was all for nothing. We barely talk anymore and it's down the toilet too. 

In school, I didn't really set up the greatest reputation for myself. I was always shifting personalities. If I was in a class with barely any friends, I would be quiet and for others, mysterious or awkward. When I was in a class with my closest friends, I didn't care what others thought. I would also always distance myself away from girls on purpose because of the way I saw myself. I was always paranoid that I had bad breath, that I smelt bad, even though I really didn't. I'd overdo it with deodorant and spray every single day because of this. 

I live in Melbourne, Victoria. The most locked down city in the world. The final two years of my high school didn't give me a chance to redeem myself and try to push myself to become more confident in myself because we were in remote learning for the majority. I finished high school a few weeks ago, I'm never going to see these people again and just with the current lockdown, I've never been more lonely now than ever. The days feel never ending. Time feels like it's in limbo and the days feel like Groundhog Day. They just repeat and it's more shit news on top of shit news. I'm a massive movie buff so I try to just escape as much as I can in the vast amount of spare time I have now but once it's over, these feelings come back. Sometimes it seeps through while I'm watching. Even in alot of movies I watch, I see myself as these characters. John Wayne in The Searchers. Harry Dean Stanton in Paris, Texas. Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. Maybe not their personalities but I connect with their feeling of never ending loneliness and their quest to search their heart and soul. When the lockdown lifts, I don't know how I'm going to find someone. I'd say I'm someone who does believe in fate and I'd rather just let life send this person in my direction instead of just going on a dating site and matching up with someone that I know I'll probably never see again.

That's the missing void in my life. Some people wonder if love is a need in life or a want. In my view, it's a necessity. I don't believe one can go through life without finding love. I believe that everyone is meant to and will find love. It may take a long time but one day, love will show itself to you. It's been hard getting through the pandemic this way, basically just alone with my thoughts for the majority and struggling to talk about it with anyone, but I do have faith that one day I won't be alone through this anymore. That's my story. I've never really done anything like this before but I just wanted to share this for some reason.",lonely,My experience with loneliness [18],2021-10-18 00:29:45

I will probably end up deleting this post as no one cares enough to read it.

The only person who cares about me lives in the US. She has helped me out so much and she genuinely cares about me (in a platonic way). But I live on the other end of the planet. The difference in time zones and her busy life makes it nearly impossible for us to have a proper conversation.

Where I'm from, everyone my age has a wealthy father except for me. I have been lonely my entire life because of this. The guys don't want to hang out with me as friendship for them depends on what you have and what you can offer, i.e if you have a motorcycle, a car or a super expensive PC to play online multiplayer games with. And all the girls avoid me as I'm poor and and I have nothing tangible to offer... I can't afford to go on dates or afford to buy them gifts.

Online I can't make friends because of my nationality. Yes I'm Indian but as you can see I do not speak or write broken English. I never asked any girl for anything sexual. I'm nowhere near as ugly as the guys you see in those stereotypical memes. I will never send a dick pic, even if you ask for one. I have no intention of scamming people. I do not have a heavy, laughable accent. My accent sounds more like the Californian-American accent rather than the typical Indian accent (verified by native English speakers). The ridiculous memes and the imbeciles on YouTube have ruined our reputation. I mean, how would you feel if I said: all Americans like to sex with their siblings? All British people are tea drinking racist colonizers? All Italians are lazy? All South Americans/Latin people are drug addicts and drug dealers?

Sorry, I digress.

But that's the thing... I have posted many times on places like r/r4r and never received any responses. Men already receive far fewer responses compared to women and on top of that people already assume negative things as soon as I mention my nationality.

All I ever wished for was to have a someone send me a ""good morning"" message. It would be enough reason for me to be get out of bed without feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders. Someone who would actively want to have a conversation with me. Simple things like, ""how was your day?"", ""what did you do?"" would give me enough motivation to do something productive. And in return I would also listen and try to help you when you're having problems.

Whenever I have talked to a girl or anyone online, they said the same thing: you're so kind/you're a nice person. I know I am, I always try to be kind to people because very few people have ever been kind to me. I know that kindness can be heartwarming. And yet... Why am I am always alone and suffering? Do I not deserve any happiness? Am I asking for too much?

I might sound like an incel or a ""nice guy"", but I assure you I'm not... I am not a misogynist and I do not blame or attack women for not being interested in me.

I once hugged a girl at a house party when I was 17. We were both extremely drunk and she started to get wobbly, so I helped her to an adjacent room and she started hugging me on a sofa. She started to look sick so I helped her to the toilet so she wouldn't start vomiting all over our friend's house. I tied back and stroked her hair while she vomited.

Sometime after, I started texting her and we got talking almost every night. One day she told me she didn't remember any of it.

The pair of us (myself mostly) were too socially awkward to talk to each other in person while sober. I was too anxious to organise a date and I kept putting it off so it never happened.

At the next party a few months later, I was so excited to finally be able to speak to her in person while both drunk. She completely ignored me and my anxiety went into overdrive, convincing me that she was lying the whole time or that I'd somehow completely misread the entire situation. This caused some kind of panic attack/existential crisis that I've not had before or since and I lay on a sofa despondently, ignoring those around me who thought I'd passed out from the alcohol.

I messaged her after the party asking what was going on and she told me she was just shy.

I was extremely relieved and the come down from that crisis was a bit rough. I can't remember exactly what I messaged her, but suffice it to say that the alcohol mixed with the emotional rawness/mental illness caused me to textwall her some, I guess, obsessive and repetitive stuff. 

She got weirded out and the combination of that and the lack of interaction caused her to break it off. I can't really blame her, it was *very* weird, though I did make her acknowledge her part in the lack of interaction while not trying to downplay my own.

That was the only ""relationship"" I've ever had and one of maybe three instances of any girl being remotely interested in me. How screwed am I?",lonely,20 years old and never even kissed a girl,2021-10-17 22:20:52

I worked up the courage to give a girl my phone number, and bam! Soft rejection.

For weeks, she went out of her way to greet me, looked over her shoulder at me (looked away when I noticed, every time), found excuses to talk to me when we were in the same area...laughed at my stupid jokes...and nothing.

Probably just toying with me, sending mixed signals. Or, just using me for attention and validation.

Thank you so much for that.

I did find some acquaintance by talking to some students online but thats pretty much it.

Anyway, I was scrolling through instagram recently and saw Mike's story. It was his birthday and he showed him with a huge friendgroup having fun together. He even put over 10 stories of people from his class wishing him a happy birthday.

In the beginning, I didn’t mind it because many people around me were still adjusting, but after seeing that they were coming out of their comfort zone, my insecurity and jealousy grew larger.

2565,Cultural_Practice925,1634444271,1,"I am incredibly lonely and here is why 

I am a 17 year old male and I have been really struggling to relate to people as of late. From a psychological perspective, I understand why people around me are the way the are but despite that understanding I really am hopeless when it comes to connecting with them. I feel as if people very infrequently understand my thought processes even though I believe, and have been told, that I am very excellent with language and, in turn, am great at putting things into words. Another aspect of this lack of understanding is how misguided everyone my age seems to be. It doesn’t seem like people my age have virtually any meaningful purpose behind their actions whatsoever. This creates a very apparent lack of alignment in lifestyle choices between me and my peers. My actions are almost solely focused on improving myself and I don’t see a lot of people doing that.

I feel like a lot of people like me but no one understands me and, despite numerous attempts, I really struggle to enjoy the company of my peers. There is a very, very small group of people I deem my friends and I can’t see that group increasing in quantity regardless of if I want it to or not. I spend most of my time alone but ironically feel most lonely when I am amongst most others my age. I typically occupy myself with reading, exercising, or practicing music (singing, guitar, and piano.) I have been single for all of high school and have lost many friends it seems because I have outgrown them.
Now my main sources of recreation/leisure are going to diners by myself, watching tv, or looking into colleges in order to plan ahead. 

In short, almost all of my actions are geared toward practicality but I wish I had some people to have stimulating conversation with.

2. Although we have messaged a few times on social media over the years, the convos were very short and usually in response to something she posted on social media (specifically IG)

3. She has a BF and may seem suspicious of me suddenly messaging her out of the blue

2588,Wingdings_Master,1634431923,1,"&lt;For the longest time I have been ""Lonely"" and never ""Alone"", I have 3 people who live with me, my half sister, stepdad, and occasionally my grandfather that comes by. I can't really ""Talk"" to them and sometimes they don't even feel real, My stepdad is that type of person to do what he wants and he avoids almost all negative emotions, and my half sister hates the living guts out of me because she is ""Simply going through that phase"" and I rarely get to talk to my grandfather, I have tried opening up my feelings to all of them at some point, SEVERAL TIMES, and every time it feels like they just don't know how to react and play it off like a joke, I say it in many ways and still they just forget and never think of it  


It might have to do with my situation, I can't leave the house because I need money to get one and I am in a legal situation with my mom that I will not go into detail about, another thing that might be causing confusion is my high functioning autism that messes me up in a million and one ways.  


I do have a councilor but she says the same things that the last 8-ish councilors I have been to ""Give it another chance"" ""Try something else"" etc. the thing is I HAVE TRIED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING ALREADY AND NOT A SINGLE THING HAS CHANGED, I feel like I am going insane!  


Why I say this here is because of how this effects my non-existent social life, I feel alone, I feel like nobody is there to talk to me, not my family, not my councilors, not even the few online friends I have, and the friends I know IRL left me because of my bad decisions I made while going through another depression while I was with my mom, I feel like what I did was unforgivable and the people that it affected seem to feel the same way (at least it feels that way because they ignore me as much as possible).  


All I have ever wanted to have was someone there for me who genuinely cared, someone who never had a ""Oh I got to go because bluh bluh"" moment any time I try talking to them, and don't even get me started on my love life! I think I have given up on ever having a romantic relationship because nowadays being a straight white man is illegal for some reason! So I think I might be alone on that. I have tried to have normal friendships and those never ""Spark"" and then the person finds me as an inconvenience.  


So what do I think of all of this? What \*I\* think is the world hates me, why would there be any other reason?! People find me annoying, and bothersome, several people even told me that directly, and I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER MYSELF IN THOSE SITUATIONS, I try to be ""Less annoying"" and ""Less bluh bluh"" but I have no control at all! I am one of the biggest disturbances to everyone around me, so why should I be here? Why should I even try to talk to people? If I don't interact with people, \*maybe\* just maybe people will like me more because I am out of there way, It doesn't matter if I am touch starved or not getting my daily ""Hello"", I want to make people happy and I will do anything to do it, even if I stay lonely forever.  


But even then, will that be enough? Maybe it's my own existence that makes people mad and I should just ""Disappear"" and people will like me more.

  
I am probably overreacting at this point but a lot of things here are true, a lot of people hate me, or ""Don't like me"" and I have seen enough to confirm it, maybe some people would say something if they knew this about me, but at this point I don't even care anymore, everyone I know closely broke my heart one way or another, a lot or a little, I am sorry, I wish I could cry for you&gt;",lonely,"&lt;I feel like I can't take this anymore, it's been happening for years&gt;",2021-10-17 11:52:03

It seems (to me) as though it’s easier for someone to love themselves when they have people around them that love and care about them.

I have family, which is nice. But, I honestly don’t really talk to anyone in my family much more than a couple times a months. So, the love/support from them is relatively minimal. And, I do have one friend I talk to from time to time. But, we don’t really have serious, in-depth conversations about life or whatever. So, the support I feel from this relationship is fairly minimal.

So, I always wonder if people who say “love yourself” would actually still feel the same way if they had minimal (or no) social/emotional support from family, friends, or a significant other.

2614,rioboy1985,1634420717,1,"I first got my with ex in 2016. I was looking to learn Portuguese and she English, so we met on a language exchange (2015). I wasn't looking for love but ending up finding it. Since I already wanted to come to Brazil it all worked out. We became crazy for one another, speaking every day and I finally fulfilled my dream of coming back to Brazil (first time was in 2007) in 2016. I stayed with her family for a bit then got my own place. I was crazy in love, but then I had to leave as my visa expired.

To cut a long story short, we were together on and off since 2016 until the end of 2020. One of the main reasons we split is because I have OCD and I really gave her a hard time with my constant questioning. I can't blame her. The guy she was crazy about was bombarding her every day with stupid OCD questions.

Last year we got back together and she was much less passionate. After about 5 months together I suggested we split as the love seemed to be totally one sided (why did I do this 😭?) 

I think if I could get over this OCD it would work out. We work well. However, even after getting this chance last year I messed it up AGAIN.

I feel so useless. I'm a 35 year old male. I'm a good looking guy and get a lot of female attention. Yet the only girl I want is my ex. She actually cared about me. She knew me inside out. We were deeply in love. But I know I hurt her and she seems dead towards me now. We don't talk much. I've tried to be with other girls but it's not the same. I can't stand these self-obsessed girls of Instagram.

Why am I posting this here? Because I feel incredibly lonely. It doesn't help that I'm still in Brazil. I need to make more friends here. I think this pandemic also hasn't helped. I wish this pain would go away and that I could move on to another person. But, as for now, no other girl can compare and this sucks!",lonely,Only want my ex and it's killing me,2021-10-17 08:45:17

So what else is there to do? I'm too old to start take up on some hobbies, because a lot of sports teams recruit only kids. What can I do for myself? I always did everything that would sound cool in front of others, but now that I do not care about others... I have no idea how to better myself.

In the end I only knew them for a little bit, and they were mysterious enough that I was able to project my idea of a perfect person onto them. In all likelihood, if they came back I would probably end up disliking them and leaving them like I do everyone else.

I haven't been able to forget that feeling, and now every person I meet just rings hollow to me, so much so that I begin to dislike every single person. Given the chance, I disappear out of everyone's lives. 

I thought it would just be a matter of time, that if I was able to form a connection once I would be able to do it again if I met the right people. I don't need or want love, I just want to connect. I couldn't find anyone here so I blamed my school, then my university, then my country. Even online I've hated and left everyone I've met. I don't know if people out there exist that could fill my stupid and pointless standards, but I don't want to settle for less. 

Normally I'd just apathetically keep on living, but I'm emotional at the moment, so I'm writing a vent post shamelessly hoping that some magical figure that understands me is going through the same problem, that somehow this stupid post on reddit is going to be the key and I won't just end up dismissing everyone again. This isn't the first time I've attempted this, it probably won't be the last, but who cares in the end.

Even if a person like that was reading this, I wouldn't want them to bother. I've stopped trying, in every aspect of my life. I don't even see myself when I look in the mirror. If a perfect person for me really did exist, I wouldn't want to burden them with who I am now.

2652,shylonelynerdx,1634404812,1,"One of the very few things I was taught as a child, was to be polite. But over the years I have learned that people take politeness as a sign of weakness. I never understood why after a few interactions with people, they would start being slightly colder and would talk down to me like I was a child, as well as have me do petty a favors for them. They knew I was afraid to say no. 

That's when I started becoming reclusive. I started to learn to say no to people, and when I did, they would try to appeal to my emotions to make me feel guilty for not letting them take advantage of me. That's when I learned to just not deal with them. Because I knew, once I did their favor, I mattered to them no more. 

Because of that, I forgot how to build relationships... and now I'm suffering all alone. afraid that the person that gets close to me is only in it for themselves.

No one actually seems to genuinely care anymore or reach out unless they need something from you, and once they're done, they will discard you. No one seems want to spend time with you either, you need to convince everyone why you're worth someone's time to get a glimpse of attention. No one thinks about anyone else but themselves.

2665,TUN1927,1634399892,1,"I am currently studying abroad for high school in Korea, and it is my second year already. I am a week away from the mid-term test, and I suddenly just feel empty and burned out.
The school has been under quarantine for covid since 2020, thus, I have been stuck in the dorm and school ground for almost two years. I can only go out on a selected date, usually once a semester, once during vacation week, or not more than 5 times in summer vacation. In school, due to the education system, most of my time is dedicated to studying, which is from 8:50 am till 9:00 pm. However, in order to keep up my grade, the studying time needs to be until 11:30 pm or even 2:am on average. This is not counting the extra research projects, presentations, and hours I need to fill to graduate.
I have gotten used to the systems, and I have managed to get much higher than average results. However, today I suddenly just feel incredibly tired, and I cannot find nor see any point in, well, doing anything. The homework flow is so constant that when I finish one, another pops up. Studying can be really fun and rewarding, especially the interesting subjects, but I can never have enough time to digest the subject and dig deep into it before I am forced to follow the syllabus, which is quite demanding. My hobbies have been reduced to occasional gaming, small-talk with a small group of friends, and, well, masturbation. I also watch movies and read manga, novels, and do research in my free time, but all of them are starting to get really really repetitive. I feel like I am stuck in a loop, a grind to nowhere and nothing. I can't really share nor talk with my friends that much, as they are also very occupied, and frankly neither of us can afford time for an extended conversation like this without feeling guilty about not studying later. Sleeping also begins to feel like a waste of time. I truly find it hard to find joy anymore.
I have read about solutions online and consult with some people, but I can't really do anything in my situation. I quite literally am incapable of taking a break to get fresh air, as I am confined within the campus with just 7-8 buildings, small enough that I can circle it in 15-20 minutes on the estimate. I can't extend friends group, as I am an international student, making it hard for me to communicate with the native students. The population of internationals is small, no more than 30, and I am already friends with all of them. I am not sure what new hobby to developed, and I am hesitant to put in the time due to numerous demanding tasks. Thus, I am stuck in my routine, and I can at most sneak in some exercising routines, which I admit is very refreshing. My most exciting past time in the past has been cooking, but I cannot now as I have no place nor equipment to cook and clean up. I can't afford to slack off my study, because of my GPA, all of my acquaintances and friend now expect me to perform well.
I can't really complain to my friend, because they all reply like I am having an easy time here. They all see me as a very smart person because of my grade, but I do not feel like one. All I did was study and did all I can do, and it was also hard for me. But to them, it might feel like I did not put any effort at all and still get the highest score. So now I am known as the smart one, but I don't think I am at all, and it is tiring to live up to that expectation. On the contrary, I think they all are smarter and more hard-working than I am. They all came from less affluent families, but they all are so smart and work so incredibly hard. Thus, every time they compliment me, it feels like a mocking insult to me. I admire them so much, their tenacity, their grits, their passion that it feels horrible for me when they put me up just because of my grade.
I was in a relationship here, but it was not an affectionate one. It was the first time I felt so strongly for somebody, and I was truly feeling over the moon when she accepted my confession. However, she has never expressed her feeling for me, regardless if it is just affection or something more, on a physical, verbal, nor emotional level. I truly pour all my effort, attention, and time into that relationship, but I even have to ask if I want to hold her hand. She rarely if not ever show affection on her own, only when we broke up after a 3-weeks break does she start showing affection after I limit my interaction with her. When we were dating, I feel like I was the only one putting in the effort, the emotions, and taking a risk. Thus, I was truly heartbroken when she broke up with me, with the reason being that she cannot stand me. She rant for the entire conversation about how horrible of a person I am, and I truly felt that way for a while. I was only out of that dump when I explained everything to my friend, and they told me I was gaslighted and lied to. However, even now I still wonder if I deserve to be liked, as I have rarely received any form of physical affection, like a hug, a pat on the shoulder, or just, ... something to tell me that... Well, I don't know. I just try hard to be a good person, to mind my word, to show my appreciation to people. I was taught to do this not expecting any rewards, and that when I am being good to people, they will know it in their hearts. I tried really hard to follow that teaching, to be generous without asking for things back, to apologize and try to fix my mistake, to ... be the best person I can be and make my friend's life be less hard.
I am suddenly just tired. Not tired of being nice to people, I want to do that too. It feels nice when they smile and I see that small happiness in their body language. But today, when I went back to the dorm at 11:30 pm, I randomly see a couple. They weren't doing anything special, just walking together in the same direction I do. But I notice some small details, like how they adjust their pace to walk in synchronize, how she grabs his arm affectionately, and just how they are in their own world. I suddenly just froze, and all this exhaustion and feeling of ... lacking something hits me. I don't know what I am feeling, but it is a horrible state to be in.
I am now crying on my bed for no reason and typing out a long paragraph for Reddit, which made me feel better but cost me time that I should have spent studying. I am just stumped. I don't really know what I want to ask, nor what I want to hear. I just feel like sharing it with people who I do not know in real life, so I won't have to worry them.

When I was a young teen my family decided to uproot everything and move to a different continent. I feel like this was the start of my major problems with my anxiety. I felt so much like an alien that it was really hard for me to start and maintain meaningful connections with people, I was too scared.

Throughout high school and college I had various friend groups, but being so anxious, I failed to cement these into anything more permanent. I wouldn't open up about myself, turned down one too many invites to hang out, was too scared to message first. Full self-sabotage before I even realized it. But I didn't feel this loneliness too heavily until after I graduated. My friends all had their closer groups, and I felt desperately alone. I felt like I ruined my own chances.

It was at this point that I worked up the courage to reach out to the singular person I felt a real connection with - someone whom I hadn't spoken with for years. I reached out and we talked every day, finding out that he had missed me just as much as I had. He told me he had feelings for me, and I couldn't ignore mine either, and we got together. I didn't feel as alone, and his support helped me get out of my shell in a way I hadn't before.

A year and a half ago he passed away. It has been the worst for so many reasons. But one of the hardest is the crippling loneliness I now feel along with all this grief. I hardly had anyone I could open up to, or who checked in on me. Covid makes it worse, as I can barely see or meet anyone even if I wanted to in this country, but it all just has been awful.

I have a best friend I made online in the past year and they mean a lot to me. But they also live on the other side of the world, and when they're not around, I feel kinda empty again. And I don't want to be too dependent on them. On some nights I hang out online with the group of friends i adopted from my boyfriend, but I still feel like I'm not fully in it. And every time I try to connect more I feel like there is this barrier making me feel robotic and not allowing me to really be myself.

But right now it easy to feel really lonely. I came to my hometown because there’s a medical scare I’m going through. With the US healthcare system, this pretty severe scare can’t be seen for two months, but I live near the border and can have the problem assessed in MX over the course of the next two weeks. I normally live with my boyfriend, he’s a senior college student. But since I got (maybe) sick, he brought me to my hometown, back w my family to get treated. It’s hard, my friends here are from high school and have erratic schedules, and honestly by now they are more acquaintances than anything. I stay home day after day, just waiting for doctors appointments to happen. My mom goes to work and has dates, my sister has school and sports and tonight my bf he got to go out with his friends while I stayed home watching greys anatomy. I’m just jealous of everyone, I feel so isolated. And I contain it because I don’t want to ruin anyone else’s happy times with my loneliness. It’s bad enough that I have all of those people worried for me and my health. But rn I just don’t know who to tell or confide in. Normally I guess it’d be my boyfriend, but he had so much fun tonight and that shouldnt be ruined by guilt or worry for me.

2704,Urabraska-,1634364755,1,"First off. No real idea where I'm going with this post. Kind of just writing it as I go along. But I've had a lot on my mind and I figured I should actually write it. As a heads up. This is not a suicide thing or anything like that. Just my thoughts that stem from my loneliness and for the first time I feel like I should just put them out there. Express myself for once I guess.   


 First off I'm writing this while listening to chill music. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAhvvQQurw4&amp;t=72s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAhvvQQurw4&amp;t=72s) Really good for just thinking if you like chill old-school 80's techno. Goes by Synth/Chillwave now. It's not mine I just have it playing if you wanna get into the same kinda mindset as me while you read this.  


 Anyways. I said this stems from my loneliness. This is true but it goes far beyond that. My life has been a rough one. I don't like comparing because everyone's life is hard in its own ways and you can never truly know the pain someone else is in. Even shared pain is not the same among us. But I've never really had the chance to finish school or go to college. But I'm blessed with natural abilities that let me excel in anything I set my mind to. I turn 30 next month and it has had me thinking a lot about my life. Where I've been and where do I wanna go from here.  
  My biggest thoughts are why am I alone? I've only had 2 GF's in my life. One is actually an ex-wife of 7 years. Getting into that is a story in and of its self. But long story short she cheated on me. In fact, both of them did. No idea why. I was raised by a single mother and she taught me right on how to be a good man in a relationship. But they just didn't seem to think so. My divorce was in 2019 and since then I've been up and down in emotions since then. 

  
 For years I stopped using social media. But recently I had to relog into my Facebook account cuz my roommate needed something. Well, I got notifications about my ex's cuz that is what Facebook does.  I did what everyone does. What you really shouldn't do. I clicked on them and found out they both moved on and had families. This upset me of course. But after I let that original sting subside I started really looking at it. They both settled for less. The ex-wife is now with well.....Trailer Trash. Not saying it to be mean or anything. But like actual red neck drinks all day asshole. The first GF is with an actual gangbanger working on her 2nd kid from 2 different guys.

 Personally, I never put myself on any kind of pedestal. But did they really sink that low? I thought I was bad sitting here feeling sorry for myself. Like I'm just some bad person who ruins everything. But no. In that same time period, I've met great friends. Move to a whole different state and started a new life. But as much as I want to think I'm better. In some ways I actually am. These women left deep scars on me. I honestly don't think I can trust someone anymore. At least not on that emotional level. This pains me because I'm the type of guy that if you told me you always wanted to do something. I would make it our next date. Not to be some kind of pleaser or anything. But because it would make them happy. Makes it something truly special. It could be skydiving(I'm deathly afraid of heights btw) or just sitting at Mcdonald's at 3 am watching cat videos and laughing when we both got work in 3 hours.

It honestly never mattered to me exactly what me or the person I'm with was doing. As long as we were happy then I'm happy. But lately, it just does not seem that the world really works that way anymore. I've tried dating app's and it's either bots or people looking for something insanely specific. It pains me that all these people. All these singles. Male or female. Are so willing to pass up so many chances at happiness just because of XYZ. Course I'm not saying you can't have standards. But it happens so often that it's one of two extremes. Either they bullseye on the 1 thing they don't like while ignoring all the good or they focus on the 1 thing that's good while ignoring the blatant minefield of toxic behavior.

 Turning 30 does not make me old. In fact, I'm still pretty young. But I'm definitely an old soul. Too many people want to play games with relationships and emotions and I really just don't want to play the game anymore. I really don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. More than likely as I continue to build my new life and push forwards as I always have. I will meet someone at some point. But I don't feel like gaining any more battle scars on my soul for it. If I end up alone then I'm fine with it. If I meet someone then I hope I can learn to let someone in again and not be afraid anymore. The edge I'm standing on where I can either fall in love or fall into obscurity. I've accepted either outcome and will continue to try living happily within it. If you made it to the end I want to personally say thank you for taking the time and hope that you as well can learn to be happy in your own way in this life. 🌹✌",lonely,A lost soul standing on the edge.,2021-10-16 17:12:35

But then I changed schools, something I welcomed at first as a fresh start but…nothing happened. I made no friends these past four or so years, and it certainly isn’t going to change now. I’ve never hung out with someone after school on the weekend, never been invited any where, never added anyone to my contacts, never had a need to download Snapchat or any other social media, never anything—you get my point. I *tried* somewhat, joined a club or two in ninth grade, continued them even for a few years, but never made an actual connection and I left whatever I joined. And the worse part is that *I* did this to myself, no one else to blame. But I don’t even know what I’m doing wrong. 

‘What’s wrong with me?’—this question hits me from time to time. But I have no answer. I mean, I take care of myself so I’m not physically repellent. I try my best to be polite and conscientious and appropriately jocular—granted I’m awkward and shy, but many people like this do just fine. I have hobbies and interests, and I can talk about them to no end. I can keep going. I’m just at a loss. There’s just some ‘spark’ that I’m missing that everyone else has. I’ve tried to find it, honest, but nothing has turned up. I’m doing something wrong, but I can’t quite identify it.

But it’s too late now, at least for high school. By senior year, everyone has got their friend groups, and everyone is off busy with classes and college applications. God knows, so am I. I think I transferred my frustrations into academics. Somehow I clawed my way into the top 20 out of a class of 500 or so, so I can’t complain there. But I can’t help but feel it’s all been so worthless. I don’t have a single good or memorable experience here. Nothing truly meaningful, nothing that I haven’t ruined, nothing that I won’t forget (for good reasons). I know college is around the corner, but I can’t help but just mope about on how much I missed out on. I’ll never have old high school friends to reminisce out, no conversations to remember fondly, no memories of stupid stuff done for fun—nothing.

And I’m worried about college too. If I ruined high school for myself, whose to say I won’t ruin college for myself as well? I know myself too well, and I know I’m nowhere near finding the “secret” of human connection. It’s all so tiresome.

2730,LeadingNebula,1634349599,1,"Sorry, this is probably going to be really whiney, I'm really sad right now.  
I'm not doing good lately. Actually I was feeling this way for years. I feel like I haven't spent the last five years living at all. Just... existing somehow. Everyone left me who meant something to me in the past and I feel like I don't have anything left to give. They all took a piece of me with them and now I'm just empty, I don't know who I am, I don't know what I'm supposed to do and I'm incapable of forming new friendships. It overwhelms me and I always worry about ruining everything, which is like a self fulfilling prophecy somehow. Even though there are billions of people in this world, I feel alone, like no one actually wants to get to know me and I can't blame anyone but myself. I'm just an insecure mess who lives in the past and to be honest, I just want to be found, I just want someone to find me and say that I'm not as worthless as I think I am.  
I want friends so badly. I want to laugh with them about stupid insider jokes, I want to travel with them, go to concerts together and to be able to honestly say that there are people who I care about and who also care about me, without any doubt. I want friends I can rely on. People I could invite to my wedding if I'd ever get married, who would actually come, and who would be happy for me, too.  
The people I used to care about in the past left me when I needed them the most. Or tossed our friendship away when they couldn't get a use out of it anymore. It always felt one-sided, like I wasn't really important anyway, no matter how hard I tried to be a good friend. I was just a back-up to many of them, when their ""real friends"" somehow weren't available. It makes me so sad that this is all I seem to deserve.",lonely,I feel so empty and unimportant in this world,2021-10-16 12:59:59

2733,ThisAWasteAccnt_,1634348774,1,"Oh well, I honestly saw this one coming. Ive...always been lonely. Even though I was good at making friends, I just....kept losing them. I lost my bestest friend to cancer. Lost 3-4 friends to suicide...shit's just never been good. But then i found this one BIG group and I was one of the most respected and like one of the most loved people in the group because I fit perfectly in and you know it just...felt right. Basically, I joined this group along with my best friend at that time in the month of March of 2020 and it took us literally no time to fit in and get friendly with everyone. Im a very introverted and awkward person but  if someone strikes a conversation with me I dont really have a problem continuing the conversation. Anyways, so last year in the month of December I started dating this one girl from the friend group and we hit it off really REALLY well. Before we started dating we even had an agreement that if we broke up it should not affect the friend group in anyway. We dated for 9 months  then last month around the 23rd we broke up and shit started to become apparent right after it. I started to get ignored more often, people stopped texting me, people just....stopped caring completely. Even the BEST FRIEND I joined with made a new best friend so he also stopped giving a singular shit about me. And now ive stopped talking in the groupchat's completely. Its been around 3-4 days and ive not received a single text from anyone there. Im gonna be leaving the groupchat soon and ill be cutting them off permanently. Im sorry if my grammar is kinda weak im just not in a  good mental state right now. The worst part is, these were people I thought would never leave me. Never. NEVER. I had never met such a perfect group of idiots. It was like a second family to me. Tbh I loved this family more than my own because my own family has some issues I dont want to get into that. I always knew that shit would go wrong after the break up but honestly I didnt know it would be this bad, that id be completely thrown out of the spotlight. Funny part is, ive been in the group longer than my ex and i used to be way closer to everyone there. I just....feel so neglected and its like I am not even cared about. Im not suicidal dont worry LOL im used to this happening. But its just....it still hurts alot. I mean i do end up blaming myself for everything which bothers me even  more because  its not really my fault. We broke up mutually because it was bloody obvious shit wasnt going to work out and  the smart thing to do was ending it before it could get any worse. To add salt to the wound, I had this online best friend, lets call him M, even he abandoned me around a month ago. So basically I used to be an avid gamer and I met him through a streamer's chat so our friendship really started through csgo. but I have now grown out of video games. i physically cannot enjoy playing a video game anymore. No offense to people who do. But just because I dont play games anymore he has stopped giving my attention at all. He used to be the one who used to say shit like \*we are more than friends who game together you can tell me anything\* but now whenever I used to text him, he used to   reply in 1 or 2 words or used to leave me on read. So I stopped texting him as well and now its been 2 weeks since we have spoken. He doesnt even care anymore. No one does. Absolutely no one cares about me. Oh wait but theres more. Ive always struggled with depression and ADHD. So I had this one friend from the friend group who used  to live like......30 houses away from mine so we used to walk daily together and these 2 hours walks used to be extremely therapeutic for me. Because I just genuinely enjoyed his company ALOT. ALOT. He was one of my closest friends ever. But he also had to shift to another state in the beginning of this month. Shit is just....not good. Im being abandoned by everyone. I have absolutely no friends at all and I honestly.....dont know what I should do. I mean, I severely struggle making friends online because I find the whole \*send a text randomly\* thing weird. Am I such a horrible person ? Is it my fault ? I dont really know....but ive always struggled with  friends. Even my sister and my cousin neglects me and my father is never around or always busy with his tv shows and my mother is an abusive alcoholic. Life is horrible right now. All the people I considered the closest to my heart have all abandoned me and left me to rot. And now im just...an empty confused shell wondering what should be my next move.    


Just some extra information I want to add, Me and the girl had the most healthy breakup possible.   
The best  friend I joined the group with I had known since 2nd grade. (Im in 11th)   


But I am still......gonna hang on because I atleast have one person to live for. That is my best friend since birth. Me. Because theres also a good side to this. Now I have the  chance to find better people and the motivation to find better people as well. People who will actually care for me. And not leave me. But ive been repeating this process ever since I was born and no one has stuck...... :(

2737,WADUBBER,1634346457,1,"I'm a 24M currently living with my single mom and brother. I just graduated from college and really want to move on with my life and live on my own, but I've had health issues that have kept me from working or doing anything social over the past year, although I've tried to keep as busy as I can.

Over the past couple of days, I've felt so lonely that my chest is tight and my head feels like it will implode.

I have a small, but very tight group of friends, but lately I've felt distant from them and my family. Everyone I know is Christian. I grew up in a Christian house, attended Christian life groups, went to a Christian highschool, and was very involved in all of those. Over the past couple of years, I've come across some things that have made me question the faith and as of now, I wouldn't consider myself any religion. My friends and family still love me, but I feel so disconnected because they are all Christians. I feel outcast and separated from them and I have incredible guilt because I feel like I've let them down by renouncing my faith. I have also reached the age where my friends are moving or starting families anyway.

I've never even been on a date. I've asked two girls out, but got rejected by both. My friends are starting to get married and yet here I am never getting noticed by anyone. I've gained weight due to my illness and I feel so unattractive. Doesn't help that I'm 5""6'. I haven't talked to a girl in ages and I can't really get out or date rn because of my circumstances. Every time I watch anything with a girl showing a guy any attention, especially anime, I feel so depressed and lonely it's overwhelming. The closest I've felt to a girl is watching Projekt Melody livestreams, which I know is ultimately empty. I feel like due to my uncertainty in faith and my current situation I will never meet anyone. I just feel so pathetic never having been on a date as a 24 year old.

The loneliness and desire is so overwhelming that nothing I try to relieve it works. It just comes back. To be clear, I am not suicidal at all, but sometimes I imagine putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger because it's the only way I can think of to make the thoughts stop.

I've felt trapped at home for years and every time there is a glimmer of hope, it's ripped away. I question every day if I will ever escape the pit I feel I'm in.",lonely,I feel increasingly separated from those close to me and I feel like I'll be lonely for life.,2021-10-16 12:07:37

We didn't really get to talk about ourselves a lot. Two of them seemed to know each other very well, talking about each other's preferences and every minute detail from when they woke up.

2747,facemecoward,1634339615,1,"I never thought this would happen to me a second time. This is a long and very personal story that I've never told, not even anonymously online. Only my therapist and close relatives know. 

About ten years ago, when I was 20, I put an episode behind me during which I was obsessed with an actress for about 6 years straight. Not exaggerating. Everyday I would go to the fansites, check the papparazzi pics and so on. Watched literally every movie and interview she was ever in. I still got a pile of 20 DVD's lying around that I'm too embarrassed to sell.

Several times a day, I would wonder what she was doing, what she would think of me. I checked the timezones and estimated when she would sleep, and when she would be awake, depending whether she was in New York, LA or Sydney. Guessing by the time of day, I would fantasise about what she was doing. When it was her birthday, I kept congratulating her in my head. I hated every man she ever dated from the bottom of my soul. When one of her ex partners died, I laughed and cheered when I saw it on the news. I'm just telling you that to give an idea of how deep this obsession goes with me.

So I couldn't just sit idly by forever. I had to meet her. Through a fan site, I ran into someone who knew her address in New York (I'm from Europe). I figured yeah right, there's no way. But when I checked the address on google street view, I quickly found out, through my large archive of papparazzi photo's, that a specific graffiti marking on google street view matched a marking in one of the papparazzi photo's shot outside her house. Then I was certain.

So I went out there. With my mom, grandmother, and baby nephew for christ sake. They all thought I just wanted a fun trip to New York. But it was only about her. Only my mom knew that beforehand, or at least had an idea. So we went there, to the address. We went there, she wasn't waiting outside her building of course, why would she be? Even then, as a 17 year old boy, I was smart enough to realise I couldn't just ring her doorbell. That I was a stalker basically. So we came back later the same day, and waited. All four of us.

By some freak twist of fate that still has me reeling when I think about it, she actually showed up. Not leaving her appartment, but going toward it, with a stroller, her two sons, and her husband by her side. He saw me, us, sitting there. I had my camera ready, and took pictures. I still have them. My hands were so shaky, you can't tell who's in the pictures unless you know before looking. We were sitting pretty far away. Luckily, he didn't approach us.

So that was the end of it. I was extatic just to have seen her with my own eyes for a moment. But that quickly changed when I realised we still hadn't technically met each other. I realised I had failed.

When I arrived back home from New York, sitting in my room all by myself, I cannot describe to you the botomless emptiness I felt inside. My life was over. I no longer felt the need to pursue her, but I did feel like a failure. After that my obsession lingered for some time. Then it gradually became weaker. At age 19, I got my first girlfriend. After my relationship with her ended, the spell that actress had put on me was definitively broken. 

Nowadays I can comfortably say I couldn't care less about that woman. I still see why I was attracted to her, but the magic spell she had cast on me has become completely impotent. A few years ago, I heard she divorced her husband from the photo's I took. When I shrugged at the news, and felt nothing, I knew she would never bother me again.

Enter 2021. I saw a movie I absolutely adored about four months ago. The actress in it was cute. I had only ever seen her in one other movie, and somehow missed all the others, as if fate was trying to protect me from her charm and power over me. Didn't think much of it. I was actually so confident in my being over these types of obsessions, that I saw no harm in watching a few more of her movies. Big mistake. I already recognise all the symptoms I felt ten years ago. It's all coming back, like a chronic disease. It's like I've been thrown into a time portal back to where I was then. I thought I had grown, became a better man, someone too confident to show this type of pathetic behaviour. But i was wrong.

Now I'm shaken to my core to see I'm still that insecure boy. I'm no man at all. I haven't grown. The last ten years of life, have been pure stagnation. Having had a real relationship, didn't change me like I thought it did. It's hard to describe this feeling. It's pure hopelessness, powerlessness, madness. The only cure, my heart tells me, is to go find her. To stalk her, and all of those stupid things that lead to ruin. In my mind I've actually concocted a plan to, get this, \[I\]become a Hollywood Composer and meet her by composing a soundtrack for one of her movies\[/I\]. That way I can meet her without being a creep. If that isn't pure madness, I don't know what is. I barely know how to work Garageband at this stage, and I'm 30 years old. By the time I'm that good, she'll probably be happily married. Right now, she's 24. I'm not sure whether meeting her is even enough, or whether this time I want a relationship. 

Needless to say, I don't want any of this. I want it to go away, to feel normal again. I don't want to set a goal for myself that's this difficult to achieve. Before this second obsession, my goal was simply to make a living creating music. If I could achieve even that, my life would feel like pure bliss, I thought. But now...everything feels ruined. Dead ends all around me. Nothing matters to me but her. 

I realise this is all way too heavy for this forum. But the forum for the actress in question on reddit only allows photo posts, no text. I won't mention her name because I'm extremely delicate right now. Someone could blurt out some fact about her in response to my topic that I wasn't aware of, and send my emotions reeling. The fansites also lack forums. So where else can I go? Back into therapy? I can't believe this...

Is there anyone, anyone at all, who understand how I feel? Please tell me, did you heal yourself? Can you live your life normally and forget? I am on my knees begging for a solution to this.

So, I eventually get tired of it and unfollow them on social media or whatever and delete their numbers if I have them. Then, a couple weeks later, I get the “I miss you” text/message.

Good afternoon, everyone!Introduce myself so you can get to know me.

I am a lovely girl who likes romanticism.If you want, you'd better come from the United States, because I'm from Singapore. I like reading books, because it can enrich my knowledge.I like running because it can sharpen my will. I am lively, cheerful, enthusiastic, persistent and strong-willed. However, it is not easy for me to know some American friends because my English is not very good.

I often travel to different parts of the United States, but the pandemic has stopped me.I hope there will be more opportunities in the future.If someone can stay together, we can build deeper friendship, help each other and make everything better and better in the future.

2768,Afro0018,1634330325,1,"I'm currently studying within my 3rd year of university and I have to say, it hasn't been all it's cracked up to be. I'm fortunate that I really enjoy the topic I'm studying, however, socially things have been quite difficult. Along with not being very academically gifted in secondary school, I was quite a self-isolated kid. I had friends, but never made the effort to go out and see people. It's safe to say tbat I'm quite an introverted person who struggles to push myself out of my comfort zone. I was content staying home and playing video games, which was okay at the time, but has become less satisfying as I've gotten older.

I left secondary school with not the best grades and if I wanted to go to university one day, I would have to attend college (which is a step before Uni for us here in the UK). I studied really hard in college to make sure I could go to Uni and didn't really give myself many opportunities to make friends. I stuck to the belief that Uni would be a fresh start for me, where I could meet more people and find my group. 

My first year of Uni was quite tough. I was meeting new people and making friends on my course, however I still struggled academically which meant I had to repeat one of my modules. This meant being held back a year, while the rest of my cohort moved on and I unfortunately lost contact with a lot of them. Since it was only one module I had to resist, I was only attending Uni for one lecture the entire year, which didn't really give me the opportunity to get to know the new first years that I was now a part of."" That's okay though"" I thought, ""I still have 3 years after this so there's plenty of time"". I also decided I would use the extra time that year to get a job and earn some extra money while I wasn't in University that much. Again I believed 2nd year would be a new start.

Unfortunately for me, Covid-19 had other ideas for both myself and every other student in the world. Gone were my in Uni lectures and seminars, gone went my city's night life, gone went the chance to join clubs and gone went my chances to meet new people. It wasn't all bad. I was able to meet some of my cohort through online studying but it just wasn't the same. That year was so tough to work through, but I pulled through and now I've reached my 3rd year.

I'm currently on placement this year, which I'm really enjoying as it's a great change of pace from being stuck indoors due to Coivd. However, this takes up nearly all my time and the rest cohort is in the same boat. I decided this year I wouldn't let life just pass me by, so I pushed myself to do things like join the volleyball club to meet new people, become student rep of my year to engage more with my cohort and spend my time doing things outside my flat like going to cafes to read. I really want to push myself outside my comfort zone so that I don't feel so trapped and it's being going really well. However, things are still early days and I'm often still feeling that strong sense of loneliness at times. I know that I'm doing the right thing to put myself out there, but I can't help but feel the weight of having a long road ahead of me.

If you made it this far and read part of my life's story then thank you. I'm not really looking for advice, this was just a means for me to put my thoughts out there and see if anyone can relate in some way. I feel like I'm making a positive change in my life, but I know that growing comes with it fair share of pains also.",lonely,Not quite the university life I imagined,2021-10-16 07:38:45
2769,GManASG,1634330044,1,"It hit me very hard these last few days. I have learned to cope with loneliness from growing up a lonely child.

I am estranged from ALL of my family, they are not all bad but the good ones also aren't good people. If it is not outright vitriol and violence then it is an endless supply of problems they want you to be burdened by to help them survive because we share the same blood. 

If that wasn't enough the place we lived in, the city I come from, it is on the list of most violent places on the Planet. It just so happens to not be in the middle east, but also not in an industrialized country. The things you experience, the people, what human beings do to each other, it is horrible. No matter who you are you do not leave that without carrying it inside you the rest of your life.

The only way to get ahead in life was to leave and sever ALL ties. 

My life got better the day I left home, left the country, and got the cheapest smallest apartment I could afford when I was 18. That place was 300sqft no furniture and it was incredible. It felt like I chopped off a gangrenous limb. Sure I lacked a limb but the pain was gone and the wound healed, though the limb never ever grows back.

Needless to say that type of upbringing makes you a very bad person on the inside. I spent years learning all the ways that life made me angry, made me prone to violence, made to quick and willing to bend the rules. It takes constant round the clock will power to keep yourself in check. Years and years of carving out neuropathways that prevent you from getting angry at the slightest of things. You have such jelousy over everyone that had a better life, hearing someone talk about golfing or taking tennis lessons growing up. It makes it impossible to relate with ANYONE at ALL. 

To have any kind of human contact requires maintaining a constant fascade, if they tell me about their lives I have to pretend that my life was just as nice and I pretend I can relate or else I've lost them. You can't respond with the truth, ""Oh you did this and this with your parents, well my father was in prison growing up, my mother was too drunk to know I was alive""...lol yeah that will have them inviting me to parties real soon. So all people relationships I have are superficial, no one knows about the blackhole inside my soul because to show that would further alientate me. Would I even have a job? 

I end up knowing people but they never truly know me, nor do they want to. Because being around people like me is toxic, the same toxicity that suffocated me growing up. Alone I can breathe and let people breathe

2771,Arturion34,1634328989,1,"I am starting to think there's no fix. No cure. A childhood of being consistently devalued, unwanted, thrown away, taken back, thrown away again has deprived me the ability to feel any human connection beyond physical. 

I have no trust, no faith or belief that anyone actually cares. And I don't think there is anything that would actually ever change that. I have a partner of 8 years. And I often feel just as disconnected to her, as I do a stranger. Oh, I love them. I truly care. I even let down most of my barriers somehow. 

But if the connections a 2 lane bridge, the lane coming to me has long crumbled and fallen into the river. 

I had hope. A friend, who I didn't feel the need to protect myself from. Someone who called me family. Someone I could do the same.  And then, suddenly there was a fight between them and my partner, over a conflicting communication style and trauma responses. They weren't friends anymore in a matter of hours, and who could say where I was with them. They assured me we would still be friends. And then, they were essentially gone. We went from messaging all the time and planning trips and things to do, to 2-3 messages that it feels like I dragged out of them. The irony being, this person gave me the confidence to remove the people I called friends who were toxic to me. The ones who made jokes about my trauma, excluded me, were rude to my partner. I thought, oh, I have X, and they would never do this. I don't need this. And now, I have nothing. 

I tried harder than I thought possible. And I still have no connection. If anything, the crushing feeling of hope being ripped away was just that much worse because of how close I felt. Knowing that the closeness I thought we had, is gone, and that the crumbs that are left will be gone too. How can any of it have actually meant anything to them, or been real, if they would so casually discard it I ask. And the answer hurts. Because the only one that seems to fit: it didn't. Once more, i found myself filling the role of friend and confident just because they needed one. They didn't actually want to be mine. 

I don't know what the point is anymore. Growing up, I wanted to be independent. Control my own life, and have the ability to be secure. Here I am. I have enough money. I have a home.  A stable job. A partner of 7 years. And yet, I feel a crippling loneliness. A need, for just 1 person to be my friend, through the hard and easy.

2775,whiiteTra2h,1634327812,1,"But I met him in a weird place, admittedly. I had myself admitted into a mental ward, because my mental health was getting worse and worse, from a bunch of (not-so) little issues piling up, and making me have more and more suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

And I met this guy there - he immediately caught my eyes because, well, I'm a transgender man, and I could just tell that he was too. Sometimes you can just tell, even if they have a perfect passing, it's just about the similar things we went through shaping us in a certain way, you know ?

I got to know him, and immediately felt comfortable around him. He had issues too, obviously. A burn out. Undiagnosed mental issues, that aren't being treated properly. He just needed help and to rest. Kinda like I did, actually. We had a lot in common, too - similar tastes in fashion, music, movies, video games... We had conversations about obscure topics like the occult and our beliefs on resurrection. All of it matched. I very quickly realised I had a crush. But we were in a mental ward, and is there honestly anything weirder than trying to ask someone out when you're both institutionalized?

We both got out around the same time and kept in touch through whatsapp, chatting about everything and nothing. I convinced him to try an online game I'm a big fan of, and he talked me into getting into kpop, which is a big interest of his. To this day I can't tell if I'm into it because I enjoy it, or because I like him, and that makes me want to like the thing he does.

Finally after a month, we spent some time together yesterday. We chatted a lot, had snacks, showed each other stuff on YouTube... it was fun! I was so anxious on my way to his place and I had butterflies in my stomach up until I knocked at his door, but he just immediately made me feel comfortable. I didn't even notice the day flying by and I didn't really want to leave, but I did around midnight. 

When I got back to my place I was so giddy and so excited, grabbed my phone to tell him I got home safe and... asked him out on a date. No reply before I went to bed, but I wasn't surprised, he doesn't exactly reply to texts quickly- he's definitely not spending all his free time on his phone. 

This morning, I got up and went to work, already expecting to quit for personal reasons (I have very bad physical health issues, and I just can't handle the pain, the amount of meds I have to take and the fatigue of a job, all adding up together...). Still no reply, but it's fine. He's recently unemployed, I don't expect him to be up at 8.30am.

I get to my office, being the first person there... and then my phone buzzes. I went to check it so quickly but it was nothing I'd expected. He replied, and told me something along the lines of ""under any normal circumstances, I would've said yes, but I'm doing really poorly and I don't think I can welcome someone in my life right now"".

I had expected complete rejection. Actually I didn't have my hopes up. I'm not attractive. I don't feel like I'm a particularly person interesting either. I have no self worth, and I expect the worst out of relationships because I've been through some really, truly bad ones. But there I was hit with the knowledge that I could actually be desirable to someone I liked... and that wasn't enough.

And it just really hurt. I feel like fate keeps actively going against me. I'm a deeply romantic person, I haven't been in a relationship in 3 years, and I'm reaching a point where sometimes I feel a physical ache in my chest if I think too hard about it.

It could've been yes. It was so close to being a yes. But life isn't allowing me to get that bit of happiness I'm yearning for so badly.

I told him I'd be here to support him even if I was just crying my eyes out in my office because all my self loathing just came back and slapped me right across the face. My boss walked in and I was so embarrassed that I lied and said that a close friend had passed away. I was just ugly sobbing, and what kind of 25 year old dude just breaks down like a child after being rejected?

I quit my job and immediately got started on trying to help him - I knew he'd be interested in the job I just left available, so I told him to get an application ready, warned my boss about his app and that he would be a great fit. I want to help him get better for entirely selfish reasons. I hope that if he does, maybe he'll be able to open up to me. I can't say it tho, obviously. Now I'm lying in bed and I just feel so profoundly sad. I want to see him again, but I can't just be too pushy about it. I know I need to give him space. It's just so... I don't know how to say it. I do have attachment issues (BPD specifically) that make me overreact like I'm doing. And I'm aware that I'm blowing it all out of proportion.

there's this person within my group which I talked way more than the others. Honestly they were the reason I stayed. Had lots of fun together but because of this being online i think they grew bored of me. 

Doesn't help that somehow now i don't say what I think like I used to do, I think it's anxiety. 
I can't do anything with them like I used to do, starting something feels like a hassle (even though later I end up enjoying it thanks to their presence) I feel like now everything bores them even though I know this feeling it's irrational but their attitude and emotion then (when we first met) vs now wants to prove me wrong. 
My interests are fading away, I don't enjoy the few things I liked anymore and im pretty sure it was because that void inside me was filled with the presence of this group. **I stopped whatever i was doing just to talk to them.**

Now we don't even talk.

I don't think i'm interesting enough, making conversations became hard for me. I wish i was like the me when we first met, more spontaneous and carefree but it seems like since i like them way more than i ever thought, now i dread the thought of them leaving me, the realization that without them i'm alone again just crashed onto my brain and it's the worst fucking feeling in the world.
I knew this was going to end soon but never thought it would be THIS soon.

**I am way too self-ware, though, so much that it hurts.**
the moment i realize i feel so strongly for some internet randos is when i feel like I want to die, it's just so irrational and i fucking KNOW IT BUT I STILL FEEL THIS WAY and I fucking hate it.

2835,robograndpa,1634279781,1,"Hi, I’m sorry if this is long, but I feel like I need to provide the correct amount of context. I’m 26 (M) and have no friends. I live with my parents in a small country town and I am by no means country as I wasn’t raised here.

I’ve had a lot of friends in my life, but none that have stuck with me through the tough times. I get along better with women, than men. I’m not trying to sound vain, but I am a decently attractive person and my problem with guys is that they’re always insecure and think that I’m going to fuck their girlfriends so I’m usually kept at an arms length. I’ve never been that type of guy, but I guess I give off those vibes? Idk, maybe I need to work on my demeanor. Anyway, so I’ve always had a harder time making friends with guys. 

I don’t want to ramble too much so I’ll get to the point. I’ve had several close friends and every single one of them has fucked me over in some way or another. Also keep in mind I’m really not trying to victimize myself. I like to think I’m a fairly objective and understanding person. I won’t fool you though, I’ve done plenty of shitty things that I’m not proud of, but when it comes to my friends, I’ve always put an emphasis on loyalty and always tried to do right by them. 

I’ll go chronologically here.

My first best friend was actually my childhood bully. We reconnected in high school and put the past behind us. One night he and I had snuck out to go to a party. I had a bit too much to drink and he insisted on driving. That was the right call so I have no qualms about that. It’s what he did after that was the problem. We’re driving along the snowy highway sometime in December and because it was like 2am, no one else was on the road. He starts purposely swerving saying “IM THE KING OF THE ROAD! IM THE KING OF THE ROAD!” Naturally he loses control and we slam into a wall totaling my car. Luckily we were okay, especially considering my airbag didn’t deploy, but naturally as 16 year olds we start freaking out. We weren’t far from his place so he actually said he was going home and that this is my problem. He starts to run and I tackled him to the ground. No way I was going to let him get off Scott free. He then turns to me and says that he will stay, but that I had to take the blame otherwise he would tell my parents all of my secrets. He straight up blackmailed me and I decided I would rather take the blame for the car then have them know all those things about me (I wasn’t a good teenager). So that’s what I did.

Moving on. My next best friend was someone I met at my first job. That’s also where I met my high school sweetheart. A couple years after meeting both of them he gets diagnosed with cancer. He lived with his dad and since his dad was always on the road for work, I moved in and took care of him during his treatment. I’d drive him to and from sessions, make food, comforted him when he’d cry because he was scared of dying. Good news is that he made it through. By that time I had been broken up with my high school sweetheart for a few months. He asked me if it was okay if he started dating her. I said I wouldn’t be comfortable with that and told him I wouldn’t approve. He promised me he wouldn’t make a move then, stating that our friendship was more important to him. Fast forward 6 months and he comes over to my apartment high on acid. Starts breaking down admitting that they had been fucking the whole time. That was the point of no return for me and I just couldn’t be his friend after that. Our other friend, who I had introduced him to, told me I was overreacting and that he couldn’t be around such an emotional person so he moved in with the ex fucker. I lost my two best friends during that time.

Jumping ahead another 4 years or so, I moved in with a friend I had known since we were in diapers. 20+ years of friendship right there. Things were good until her bf moved in with us. One night were out at a bar and he’s all coked up and angry. He ends up slapping a bunch of stuff out of my gf’s hand like her phone and vape. I pushed him and we end up getting in a bar fight. I know, classy. My friend was scared of him that night because he was so out of control so her, my gf, and I go back to our apartment and she locks it so he can’t get in. Eventually she lets him in and my girlfriend and I decide to go to her place for the night. I never heard from my friend again after that. Not like she was dead or anything like that, she just decided that the three of us couldn’t coexist and cut all of her friends out of her life to be with this guy. I’ve never seen such a rapid change in a person. It was so bizarre. So I end up moving out and in with my girlfriend, still haven’t heard from her to this day. Just woke up one day and got the everlasting silent treatment.

So I’m living with my girlfriend and she just wasn’t a very nice person. I won’t get any further in depth on that though because it’s not relative to the story. I move out and back in with my parents. My other best friend and I decide we will move in together. Well covid happened so we figured we would ride the wave a bit longer before moving out. About July of 2020 we were getting ready to move out, but he decided he wanted to take a 6 month class and wanted to wait until after he was done with that to move out. Okay sure, that’s fine with me. He finished the class and then decides to quit his job because he was scared of contracting covid from someone there. Okay, I can kind of understand. He finally gets a job about 2 months ago and we’re gearing up once again to move out, but then he says he wants to save up money for a few more months, maybe until January, before moving. Again, a reasonable mindset. Well this last weekend he hits me with a bomb - he says that his other friend asked him to go on vacation to Korea with him over a year from now and that he wants to stay living with his parents to save up for that.

Look I’m not mad that we aren’t moving out, I’m just mad that he’s strung me along for 2 years now before making it clear that we won’t be living together. I put my life on hold for him, promising that I wouldn’t move without him. You think I wanted to live with my parents for this long? Hell no. But I did it because we promised each other that we would find a place together.

Yet another disappointment from another one of my friends. We talked every day for years and now we haven’t talked in a week. It really feels like the end of an era and that he’s trying to distance himself. I feel alone, and frankly I don’t really want his friendship at the moment. I don’t want to feel alone, but I want a quality relationship with someone. It always feels like they put their self interests over the friendship when I have always given them everything I had. Maybe im the problem and there’s something about myself im not seeing or addressing. Idk…all I know is I’m tired of being left for dead by people. I’ve done a lot of bad things, but nothing to any of them that would justify how I’ve been treated, that I’m sure of. He was the last friend though. I’ve burned through the rest of them for all the reasons listed above and at 26 it’s hard to meet people and make friends, especially when you have none to meet new people through. I’m not sure what types of responses I’m looking for. I just kind of needed to vent. Kudos to you if you made it this far seeing as how I wrote a novel.

2848,nomanslandishome,1634272754,1,"I'm sure my predicament isn't quite as bad as some of you out there, but I certainly think this kind of loneliness still hits home just as hard as the typical circumstances you find yourself being lonely in..

The type of lonely where you might have very few people or friends around you, but they're so embezzled in their own lives that you have very infrequent dealings with them.. You feel forgotten about. This is understandable to an extent. 

Imagine this though. Whilst the above may be an unpleasant predicament to be in, what I find makes my loneliness crippling, is the knowledge that there's people out there who don't/won't/can't have a connection with me due to whatever reason it may be.

These are people who throughout life I've had a really strong and meaningful connection with. Most notably a recent person who I met at the end of last year. But its always been short lived and distantly intermittent at best.

I mean, its just crippling knowing that someone explicitly said they wanted to have a friendship with me and actually include me in their life, yet they actively chose to end it. Someone who wanted to be around me and do stuff with me. I've maybe only ever been told this once or twice in my life.

I refer to the last person I had significant dealings with, because frankly I haven't had any other sort of real connection in such a long time.

I've just been missing them so much and it's made me feel stupidly lonely after being able to actually see what life is like on the other side, with a friend who acted more like a real friend than anyone else I've met in the last 10 years.

They even reached out to me about 4 months ago, (and about the same amount of time after we stopped talking) to apologise for how things ended (because it was sudden and abrupt), and to see how I was doing.

I was honest. I told them how lonely I've been since, not in a pitiful way either, just being deadly honest. That I'd tried to connect with others to no avail. But even after trying to make amends, telling them how much I appreciated them being around, etc... 

 I still got hit with the ""sorry I just can't"".


It's more a kick in the teeth than anything else. All things considered, would you push somebody away without proper explanation, knowing full well of the situation they're in?  Even if they admit that you both get along really well? 


Just to clarify, there was no romantic affiliation with this person.

But yeah, my point is, it's a different kind of lonely knowing there are people or someone out there, not that far from reach, that could somewhat easily help to at least alleviate life, but choose not to.

This is not la be all and end all solution, however, I might add.  It's just an objective opinion based on the environment surrounding me.",lonely,I just can't cut this out anymore.,2021-10-15 15:39:14

2870,hollycxh,1634261818,1,"I feel like most people have no idea how lonely it is. Most people go through periods of their life, maybe its a few months or even years of loneliness but they eventually find some people to be around and spend time with and make genuinely real friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when I say I'm lonely, I really am and I really mean it when I say I have felt this way for 8 years straight.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had many friends; or I did up until a certain point and everything just changed. I got bullied and was the outcast and suddenly a flip just switched. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that I became a jerk without even realizing it. Years later and suddenly some of the memories come back and it shocks me because I can't believe I didn't even know about the fact that I was so toxic or the fact that people would even bother sticking around for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

From their point of view of course they would want revenge. I cant blame them for that. I turned down all their offers because I didn't want to feel like a liability, and I know i'm wrong there but I'm just too scared to apologize and I don't even know exactly what I did wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cant blame anyone else at this point... I can list bunch of reasons or logical explanations of stuff that happened in my life but what's even the point. I just feel like I totally ruined all my relationships. I feel like past a certain point no apology will do anything for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my brain chemistry is permanently messed up. I don't know how social interactions work, I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to self reflect on anything without totally spiralling, I don't know what the right thing to do is... I always feel confused and stupid and anxious and regretful and ashamed

I knew her for a couple years already and then last New Years we were ganging out and ended up hooking up.  She had just broken up with her girlfriend and we ended up hooking up al month long.  There were conditions like that I knew she wasn’t gonna be my girlfriend and no being super drunk etc.   Well, I’ve been single my entire life.  This was only the second person I’ve ever had sex with and I had never been thru anything like what I went thru with her.  It ended at the end of January.  

I already started feeling terrible back then because of how amazing it was and then abruptly stopped.  I had never felt that good in my life and for the first time I felt like a normal person and had a huge confidence boost and then it all went away.  I started drinking really heavy and eating bad.  I gained lots of weight and was feeling miserable.  In the meantime I’m still just friends with her.  

She starts sharing with me how she’s getting tinder and bumble dates, which was really hard to hear.  I thought I could learn to be ok with it.  I even didn’t care that much when she got a new girlfriend although I felt sad and unwanted.  Then I had to start seeing pictures of them together and that kinda fucked me up.  She wanted me to meet her and I kept putting it off.  A couple of weekends ago I went to the bar with them after kinda being forced to meet her,(my car isn’t working and she was giving me rides to and from work and I ended up at her place after work one day and the girlfriend came over).   

Last weekend I ended up going to a small gathering at another coworkers house where her the girlfriend and some others were there.    Well I was drunk when I got there,(got a ride of course), and proceeded to make a giant fool of myself.  I had to see her and the girlfriend making out a ton and then come to find that the other guy maybe both were all planning on having some kind of orgy with them and I showed up and ruined it.   

I had been doing pretty good the last few months.  I’ve been dieting and have lost like 30 plus pounds and had been feeling like maybe I could get over this.

Where else can you find gatherings of people with your interests, with flexible schedules, within walking distance, in a setting with plenty of indoor public spaces where you can hang out without having to buy something? At 35, work snd household chores take up most of my spoons. So scheduling in time to socialize while coordinating with someone else’s schedule on my days off feels like a chore. I’d much rather use that day off to recharge in bed or clean the house or go grocery shopping.

I wanna share my issue that I’m currently struggling with.

 yo and recently I’ve visited a psychologist ( the reason was completly different from the one I’m talking about ) where we both realised that I’m a bit more mature than my peers. 

I am aware that it sounds so immodest but I wanna explain.

The thing is that 98% of guys my age don’t care about other’s and their own emotions. They just wanna lie in beds watching tiktoks or game entire weekends, while I need to talk about phylosophical topics or emotional issues.

I really don’t feel that I’m above them or something. I’m just different, not better or worse.

Some people listen to me and I appriciate it a lot but nobody can’t give me the feeling of understanding.

I also struggle with overthinking. One small action can destroy relation that we’ve been building for years. For example I one hate my friends for that he is being lazy. This affected our relation but other guys would just let it be.

I have pretty few friends but I don’t feel anyone. I also feel strong attraction to primitive activities like parties or smoking because of that.

I grew up in an abusive household. My childhood had been extremely traumatic. Even though I am certain my parents love me, I just never felt loved enough in life. 

Because, for obvious reasons I had been deprived of love, I grew up developing unhealthy attachment to people. Even if someone's niceness equivalent to an ounch, I end up giving them my world, and get hurt in return.

I not only trust people easily, I am a people pleasure, and I am sensitive. When I love someone I love them with passion, when I hate someone I hate them with all my heart. 

Currently I am extremely bothered by an incident that happened when I was 22 years old, when I was on a trip abroad. I met a boy who I really liked, who led me on. To be honest, I guess I liked him first. But he ended up breaking up my heart, and after all these years, I am still salty about it. 

People call me naive, they tell me how I have a big heart, and ready to love people too easily, how I am so kind, and a ray of sunshine in their life. But honestly, I am just tired being the way I am. Staying around people is what fuels me for the better, I absolutely cannot stand being alone.

They look for what they **think** they should be looking for.  Put another way, people often look for what they *want*, instead of what they *need*.

Where am I going with this?

I have a friend who has been 'looking for love' for some time.  She keeps throwing herself at people, and coming up empty.  Yet while trying to get the attention of others, she hasn't noticed the person trying to get **her** attention.  So while she keeps looking ahead, she doesn't see what is right behind her. (The same applies for men too of course)

The irony of course is that people 'pass over' someone pursuing them, yet they get upset when someone does it to them.  They want someone to give ***them*** the chance that they don't give to other people.  

To those who may say there is no one behind them--look closer.  You may have put them in the 'friendzone'.  Or maybe they don't seem like they're interested, but they're shy.  Ask yourself... does this person make an effort to be around you?  Do you find yourself seeing them around more often than other people?  Maybe they send you random messages asking how you're doing, but you kinda just dismiss their interest. After a while they give up.

I see this happen all the time.  

So look around and see who is there.  Maybe you're at school, and someone seems to pass by your locker and say 'hi' to you more often than other people.  Don't dismiss it as coincidence.  Maybe they don't have the nerve to talk to you, but they are trying to be **noticed** by you. That should tell you something. People don't do that for no reason.

I'm not going to sit here and lie saying that 'popular' people don't get more attention and affection than other people.  They do.  More people 'chase' them.  But the more people who chase them, the less will actually 'catch' them.  Hey, unless you want to be part of a harem of girlfriends, (or boyfriends) chasing after someone who already has a 'line waiting' is a waste of time. 

This is not a magic solution though, and it won't work for everyone.  However, it will work for some.  All you need to do is take a look 'behind you'.  Stop chasing, and instead **WATCH** people.  Make notes of who smiles at you.  Make notes of who says hi to you.  Make notes of who tends to sit alone at lunch near your table all the time.  

These are the people that may already be interested in you, so give them a shot before giving up.",lonely,Sometimes we're so busy chasing what's in front of us; we don't see what's behind us.,2021-10-15 02:31:38

Maybe, I have one gift - memory, I’m able to remember what I did past two weeks, i have knowlegde, but usually that knowlegde is based on the memory, I used to be creative, but I ruined that with bad habits, also my memory, bit frustrated, but it’s recovering now, that’s why i’m happy, I’m hope that they will recover a bit, to make myself good again.

2968,Unlucky_Ad7732,1634205294,1,"Every day. Every fucking day I think about these kind of scenarios in my head:

•Driving over to a friend’s house on a cold, Winter night to hang out.

•Staying up late at night to watch movies with friends.

•Going to the mall with friends.

•Driving around the city with my friends.

•Having friends who I deeply love and relate to. Lifelong friends.

Every day for the past two years I have daydreamed about scenarios like these.

I crave recognition. I crave to create SOMETHING to get people’s attention and recognize me. Any kind of attention. Despite this, I just can’t gather the energy to be creative anymore. I’m just an ideas guy now. It sucks.

Maybe I should admit to myself that I’ll most likely be a nobody. I need to stop equating creative pursuits with fame and praise. It’s kind of vain. After all, recognition doesn’t really matter when you’re alone.

I just want friends. Above all else I want a family, y’know?

I’ll watch these TV shows with characters who are lifelong friends with each other, and it just makes me feel like absolute shit. Just total trash.

I mean, I do have some good childhood memories. I visited a few friends’ houses, I played outside, I went to the mall a couple of times… but those friendships always ended in us drifting apart.

And honestly, I never really related to anyone irl on a deep and personal level. I’ve took every friend for granted.

I think it’s because I’m so unhappy with myself, and have such a weak identity, that I don’t know how TO relate to others. I don’t even know who I fucking am. All I’ve ever done is talk to others about video games or some media shit. It feels so shallow. I don’t wanna keep up with gaming or entertainment just for the sake of a conversation topic.

I have online friends but honestly, they’re kind of abrasive and give off negative vibes. They’re not terrible people but I’ve been in their chats long enough to recognize that they can be judgemental. I’m probably just hyper-sensitive but these people can be draining.

I never attempted to reconnect with my high school friends after the Quarantine began. That’s probably my fault. I should probably try to reconnect, but part of me… maybe doesn’t like them? That sounds horrible. They’re good people. I just don’t feel up to it. I feel awful for that, because I never really emotionally opened up to them.

I had a neighborhood friend who I used to hang out with. Gave him my phone number after coming across him about a year ago, but he didn’t give me his, so it seems like he’s pretty much moved on from me. Maybe it’s because I’m a weirdo shut-in kid, or that he probably has friends of his own, but it’s pretty sad on my part.

Life sucks. Back in my Junior year of high school, when I was really getting lonely, I thought these scenarios in my daydreams would’ve been realized by now. It has been nearly two years since then, and I am even more alone.

So what? In another two years, will I still be alone in my room all the time?

I don’t wanna become a loser/incel… I want some friends to chill with. Fuck man I can stay a virgin for all I care, just gimmie some homies.

I know this will sound mess up but one of my family memebers passed away last year I didn't feel anything which made me afraid I would force myself to cry and act angry, my paranoids mind search it up and just made things worse for me, ""am I evil, am I a psychopath, am I this and that, am I gonna hurt someone"" shit like that that just made me feel crazy. I write this now knowing I am not those things but I cry and feel those emotions I have hold in for a long time.

2996,benzedrin_,1634185494,1,"Hey Everyone,

I hope you guys are doing somewhat okay.

Here is my story:

3 years ago my girlfriend broke up with me - I totally deserved it, and was a piece of shit back then -, but since it happened everything is going in a downwards spiral, and I just can’t stop it.

Before this all happened, I was a really energetic guy, who always was down to any random ideas any of my friends brought up. I enjoyed talking to people, sharing experiences, having debates and also had no issues talking in front of a crowd.

After the break-up, I started to develop some mental issues, and I isolated myself from anyone. I also started drinking and doing coke heavily which - surprise-surprise - didn’t help at all…

Right now I‘m experiencing crippling social anxiety whenever I’m surrounded by people - kinda interesting but I’m still good on a 1 to 1 basis, I’m starting feeling anxious if there are more people, who listen to what I say - my self-esteem is at an all time low, and just to put the cherry on the top of all this mess, I buried myself in work just to forget about all this, so naturally my friends drifted away for good.

Here is the thing: I have zero friends, no family and basically no-one to talk to except for the random girls I met at bars, and we somehow end up at my apartment.   
But even the one night stands cannot make me happy anymore, not socially nor sexually. I feel like a walking dildo, and I’m super ashamed of myself, but on the other hand I’m craving social interactions, and it seems like this remained the only way I can have talks, and share my thoughts with others. 

I hate this feeling, I hate being alone, and also hate feeling isolated.

Sometimes I just think about other peoples life’s and how I’m just a background character in everyone else’s life.

There is music playing.

Something he’s played surely a million times, but with his fingers grabbing my belt loops swaying my hips to the rhythm of his breath in my ear I don’t mind.

This is intimacy.

Presence without performance. Unwrapping each other emotionally. Seeing each other for who we truly are, and staying.

Leaning in closer to taste even more of this imperfection.

This isn’t a honeymoon, it’s better.

It’s his hands scrubbing my back in the shower. It’s my borrowing his deodorant.

This isn’t a performance anymore.

We piss each other off regularly, yet we always return.

We have no fear of rejection.

There is no reason not to show up exactly as we are; broken, sad, anxious, excitable.

I don’t want to be part of the lgbt community if that means I have to pick friends from like 5 lgbt people wtf, I don’t want to have to question whether someone I’m talking to supports gay people, I don’t want to have to deal with that uncertainty, idk I don’t think it’s like that, why is life so hard, people will never understand the struggles of being lgbt unless they are, like take all your problems socially and make them worse, life is so fucking hard.

3020,DragonDragonDragon1,1634174075,1,"I suck at making friends and always have. Growing up, I've always made acquaintances with others very easily, and would even be invited to join others in activities. For some reason though, I would almost always turn them down. Sometimes it would simply be that I wanted to go home and just relax all alone and play video games. Other times I think I was just afraid to. I'm not sure why. My mother would encourage me to go out with them whenever she could, but I was always stubborn about it. Looking back now, I deeply regret it, having missed out on so many opportunities for other friends and experiences. Friends that I would make back then would eventually become frustrated with my turning them down and we'd quit talking. I don't blame them for that either.

&amp;#x200B;

I've somehow made friends with two people back when I was in middle school, which then continued after graduation from high school. Due to unfortunate circumstances, my one current friend, Steve and I, cut ties with the second friend, Trevor, so now it's just us. Steve is a great friend, and I'm glad to be stuck with him, but sometimes I wish I had more likeminded friends to just talk to. I believe that the only reason that Steve and I are still in regular contact with each other is due to our love for video games. It's what we became friends over way back when, but as time goes on, it's become harder to ignore the fact that we have very few little things in common now. Steve also has a family of his own now that takes up a lot of his time. When we do find the time for games, we mostly only talk about the game we are playing, gaming news, what's going on in the world, our daily lives, our work life, etc. His other interests and hobbies, I have no interest in just as he doesn't have any interest in mine.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a good amount of game genres that I like and I don't have anyone to play with or talk to about it, like JRPGs or Platformers. They're not Steve's cup of tea, which is understandable. I never went to college, and started working right after graduating from high school and have worked ever since. It was hard for me to make friends back in school, and now I find it damn near impossible. I live in the middle of nowhere (USA), so I don't have much to pick from when it comes to meeting new people (even more rare to find others with similar interests to mine.)

&amp;#x200B;

I adore Japanese culture. Anime, Manga, Vtubers, History, Music, you name it. I've recently began self-teaching myself Japanese, and have been enjoying it so far (Kanji is hell lol). Steve loathes anything anime related, so I also have nobody to talk about it with either. Anime in my area is seen as extremely weird by the vast majority, so I don't go around announcing it to others, especially at my workplace. I goof around and talk to others at work over random things, but I feel like that just makes me feel even more lonely, having to stand there and just listen to the others gush about their interests and hobbies to each other. I do rarely find some people that like playing games. But they're very casual gamers, and it's only the same games that Steve and I play, which is always disappointing to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried using Discord to talk with others about games, anime, and vtubers, but it never goes anywhere. I sometimes have fun with one server I've found, but it's rare to have an actual conversation about something that lasts. (For some odd reason it seems that most people I've found on Discord are turned off to long-winded conversations)

You see all these posts and campaigns where people spew nonsense like ""check up on your friends or that quiet stranger"" or ""be kind to each other"" or what have you but 99% of the time nobody actually does that unless it benefits themselves, the only thing that matters is themselves and their social clout or status or whatever and

nobody cares about anything besides how much money or power or status you have anymore, your value as a person is defined by these stupid things like looks or the the dollars in your bank account or how popular or cool you are even though none of that is real and everything is subjective

compound all this tenfold if youre poor and ugly, pretty privilege and the halo effect are so real, everyones always ready to ""fix"" others if theyre good looking or handsome or cute or whatever, but if you arent youre treated like a piece of scum

everyones so ready to throw away their morals for a quick buck or instant fame, loyalty is damn near nonexistent, people shame you if you're a virgin for being a social reject, and if you have had partners theyll shame you for being promiscuous

the people that make the top level decisions and laws are often unfit to lead and quite stupid, we worship and idolize politicians but in reality most of them are sociopathic narcissists and as a result the majority of society finds these inhumane selfish characteristics to be valuable and those that are machiavellian and cunning like them can easily rise to the top without any reguard for their humanity or morality

why is it that when i am sad and reach out to people for support they tell me to just get over it and that its all in my head, when my friends that are traditionally attractive get all the support and help they need from anyone they ask, am I less human than them?

Even then it doesn’t last very long because being in uniform while on leave seems kinda taboo to me so I’m never in it long.

I'm throwing a message in a bottle into a sea of messages in bottles here, but I'm so unbearably lonely. All of my recent attempts to post here or elsewhere have gone unnoticed-- or have been downvoted.

I don't know where to start, but I'm not sure if I need to worry about that.

Over the years, I've grow to be comfortable with-- and enjoy-- solitude. Part of it is genuine, but part of it feels like some sort of ""melodramatic emotional masochism"". I have always enjoyed the romanticised portrayal of melancholy, and I am a creative, so I put my own such feelings to use in my creations.

I'm fine with all that, but when something real and important IRL comes along, it isn't so enjoyable. But it still is to a degree, as I've already suggested.. It fuels my creativity.

Without such things, I have no creative drive. I've already tried. I cannot be creative when I am anything other than depressed or lonely.

It ought to be noted, however, that any attempts to dissuade me from such thinking or methods would be nearly \*offensive\* to me.

Anyway. I have 2, \*maybe\* 4, friends, but I never see any of them because they're always busy. I'm an only child and I live at home (which I'm not happy with-- both being an only child and still living at home at my age...) I have a mild physical disability, am poor with socializing, and have agoraphobia, severe anxiety, and dysthymia.

It's hard for me to make friends for various reasons-- and also I don't really want more at this point.

What I want is, as I put it, ""a companion with whom I may be affectionate, and for &amp; about whom I may care"".

I really just want a companion. I'm working on myself, and building myself up to a point where I'd be more of a ""catch"", so to speak, but what am I meant to do in the meantime?

I've had to change myself in so many ways over the past 9 years. Mostly because I'm young and I'm not sure who I am or what I think yet-- indeed many are the same way until at least middle age-- but also because I want to be more appealing to the opposite sex. 

None of the opinions or lifestyles-- political, religious, or other-- that I've held over the past number of years have stuck. Primarily for the former reason, but a little for the latter. I have experimented with almost every viewpoint and combination of viewpoints and lifestyles under the sun. Nothing has worked, clearly, for me. So I don't really care to much for these topics in general anymore.

Point being, I have wished to have a wife and children one day, but due to various factors, I have been steadily downgrading my expectations in this regard to the point where I would be happy enough with a mere companion as I have already mentioned. The way the world and society are, as well, it may be better to not have children either. Despite my feeling that to be a ""family man"" is my life's purpose.

I am very asocial and reclusive to begin with, but I understand the necessity of going out every now-and-then, and I bemoan my human nature for wanting someone to love and care about. The world, and many in in it, frustrate me very much. Hence my desire to seclude myself as much as is realisitic. I especially dislike governments...

I also feel, given my charateristics, aspects of my living situation, tentative opinions, and my lack of luck with any kind of romantic pursuit, that the world does not want me. It is good, then, that I have learned over the past 10+ years to be content with my own company. That does crack every now and then, however, hence my writing this.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a Classicist or Historian, and I wanted to be married by the time I was 21 or so... It's interesting how life tends to ""fork"" as you go along, but I'm pretty settled on my current endevours, so this is really just an observation.

There, perhaps, is more I could write. At this point however, while I know I can build myself up and be more successful, I wonder whether-- even with ""Paradise \[Re\]Gained""-- I am meant to live out my life as some stereotypical brooding, reclusive creative of recent centuries...

3089,Crafty_Rip7662,1634144763,1,"Hey,
I’ve been lonely for a while, coming up on 2 years. Deleted all social media and cut myself off from everyone, as they were seriously bringing me down and holding me back. I live in a deprived area, and I was getting pressured to get involved in drugs, rape, all kinds of stuff that I just don’t agree with, and found the people around me to be self-absorbed narcissists who solve boredom with fights and extremely self destructive behaviour. 

At times, I like the loneliness, being disconnected from it all. Never worrying about the latest trends or whatever, not caring what anyone thinks, but mostly I’m just sad. I’ve recently started having panic attacks, and the loneliness is just really getting to me. I’ve had a bad couple of months, and having nobody to turn to or talk to, no way to let out all this sadness and bad emotion. I’m struggling to move forward in life and have no motivation at all.

Does anyone out there have advice, ways to cope with hard times on my own, ways to stop wanting to be a part of society. I see people together, enjoying each other’s company, and it makes me jealous. But I don’t want to be. I chose this path, and I guess I’m better for it, but it’s hard man.

My family members never talk to me at all. When my grandparents do talk to me, it’s only ever been condescending, judgemental words. Saying that I can never accomplish anything. It’s obvious they look down on me and don’t believe in me. Why? Because apparently i’m just too stupid according to them. But they treat all my siblings like pure gold. Especially my sister. My sister never talks to me unless she wants something. The only family member that talks to me like a decent human fucking being is my mother. 

I don’t talk to my family members at all besides my mother because of how they treat me. Frankly with the way they talk and act towards me, I don’t want them in my life what so ever.

To make matters worse I also have a very hard time creating friendships. 

I use to have a small bunch of blokes I hung out with heaps. Until I was nothing to them. It happened very under the blue. Completely unexpected. They stopped putting in any effort to hang out and talk to me. They stopped inviting me to events,  parties, road trips and hangouts. They would post it on their Facebook and Snapchat story. So I would always see it. Eventually they kicked me out of their friend group. After 5-6 years of friendship. It didn’t help that they did this at a very low point in my life. Now when they see me uptown they all give me the “oh it’s you look” like it’s such an inconvenience and they turn and walk the other way. Sometimes they even grunt disappointedly when they see me. One of the blokes in the group has a girlfriend and even she glares me down with such hatred. Like I murdered someone. She was like that the moment she first saw me, and met me. Naturally my first impression of her wasn’t great. All of this absolutely breaks me mentally.

All the other people I was friends with at the time also used me. For my car, money, etc. Especially this guy I use to class as my best friend for 11 years. Even though he never once acted like a best friend.

But it's not like a thing or an object that is lost in space and you have to phisically search for it to find it. When someone feels lost, that's multidimensional. It's not exactly about the place you live in. Not exactly about the time in history that you're alive. I'm sure people of all cultures in all moments in time have felt something similar to the feeling of being lost. But humans are good at creating meaning out of nothing, that's why it was possible to build a society around a green piece of paper we value more than most things.

The ex mentioned above contacted me recently which filled me with pangs of lonliness and self-defeating feelings, which concluded with the subject line - I quite like being left alone. If you guys like being alone to, dont worry about it, if you were wired differently you would have acted differently by now. All I ask is that you accept the odd invitation that comes your way.

My girlfriend of 3.5 years told me that she can't keep the relationship going anymore. We were long distance because of the pandemic, and while we made as many trips as we could to see each other, the distance was making it too hard. I was dealing with it a bit better than she was, but I was still struggling too. When we talked today I had ways I could move to her, but she had other reasons that made the relationship too hard, and I agreed that it's best for us to be apart. 


Our love for each other hasn't faltered at all, and we still consider each other best friends. I hope there's a way we can keep that friendship for as long as possible, I know it'll be uncomfortable, and difficult, but we both said that if the pandemic didn't happen we'd probably be happily married by now. 


I can come to terms with the end of an amazing chapter of my life, but now I don't have anyone to talk to. I never realized just how loud silence was until recently, and it's really painful sit in it. I used to have a tight knit group of friends, but I had moved away and only returned home in March 2020, now I still have those friends, but not like I used to.

I went to bed and had a dream where It was some event in a place and there were a group of people aged around early 20s. There was an instance that I was talking to a girl who really resembles a crush I had years ago who has a very cheerful and playful personality at the same time a soft voice and a heartwarming smile. When she look me in the eye, and talk to me, it feels like she knows everything about me. In the dream I didn’t say the wrong thing I just looked so awkward and not confident which is not who I am. I know that no matter how not self insecure I am sometimes, I still have a little bit of “something” in which I would still be awkward but at least i sound confident and capable of humors and putting some smiles. But not with her. So in the dream we had a lot fun with the group, and at the end of the day I had a little chat with her and that was it. 

So in reality I was a friend of the person and we share some classes. We would do homework together, etc. when I asked her out one time, she was like “I am sorry I am not interested”. It was already near end of the semester and then I never really talk to her again. 

I know the past is past I should always look forward to the future and truth is I haven’t really thought of her for long time as I know there are things that matters more.

I also have a group project for my professional practice course where we have to do a proposal as if we’re starting a business. Nobody teamed up with me so I’m doing the project alone.. 

I joined a Facebook group in my area where females can introduce themselves and hangout in person. I introduced myself to a couple but they also did not reply..

There's someone I've been hoping to ask out but I'm tempted to just give up on them. I already know that I'll never be good enough for them, even if we did start something they'd likely drop me once someone better came along.

I have never made a real connection with anyone friend wise. I have never had a group of friends to hang with. I have never been invited to hang out with anyone. I am always the one who has to initiate a hang out. During high school this didn’t big me much. The being lonely wasn’t as hard because I had “school friends” (friends you just talk to at school) and I was on the swim team both high school and professional so I had friends there too. I also worked out every day so my day was packed and I didn’t really notice my loneliness. But now that I’m out of school and I’m the real world I want to die. I’m so damn lonely and sad. I have never had a girl friend or even a friend who is a girl. I’m shy because I was born different and it has made me very insecure. Needless to say I have never gone on a date but I have asked 3 people but they all said no. That didn’t really help with my self confidence. Now I’m just living day by day waiting for something different and exciting to happen. Unfortunately for people like me that doesn’t happen. Sometimes I wish I would have sole terminal disease like a brain tumor. That way I wouldn’t have to plan for the future. Wouldn’t have to care about finding a partner or having a family. I do want those things but I find it very unlikely.

3183,SportsMajor,1634088920,1,"Back when I talked to them, I didn't have many friends. I didn't feel lonely (not because of them, but I never felt this emotion of loneliness even if I was lonely). I wasn't going through anxiety nor was I going through waves of deep sadness like I do now. On the other hand, they seemed to have their fair share of struggles and a lot of the time, they'd come to me for help. I really didn't understand how to deal with them at the time, but I tried. I really did and I'm still glad to this day I was able to help them. 

There was more to our close friendship than this too. We really seemed to bond with ease. We shared a common interest in hockey (in fact, they found my personal account through one of my sport pages I had), we were in the same grade and were around the same age, and they actually admitted to having a crush on me. I never got with them though because I was never really interested in them at the time and even if I was, I'm not a fan of long-distance relationships (they were from Canada). I really liked them as a friend though. Like I don't think I've ever felt closer to someone else. 

We began talking less and less though slowly. This wasn't out of hate or anything either, I'm pretty sure it had to do with them trying to change. Plus, I was already slowing losing interest in them anyways as their problems were becoming too much for me to handle (I was only 15 and wasn't used to dealing with such problems). Eventually, they let me know they were going to unfriend me on Snapchat and I let them know I was fine with it. I was glad that we didn't just stop talking to each other like everyone else did.

Looking back though, I really miss that friendship. Honestly, if I experienced what I did back then, I feel like our bond would've been even closer and even stronger. It may have ended up as more as well. It's a shame that friendship had to end and it's a shame that we were never on the same page in one aspect. When they were down, I wasn't. When they were beginning to change, I was truly beginning to feel pain. Nowadays that pain runs deep and I can understand what they were going through in a way. 

Ever since that friendship ended, I haven't gotten close to another one. The closest friendship I had was one that lasted up until last year with someone from high school. We both dealt with anxiety and were really good friends, but not super close. That one slowly evaporated after high school though. Sometimes I wonder who'll be that next close friendship because I know I won't be lonely forever.

3211,mrfailpt,1634075370,1,"I already did this post on a another subreddit but I want to know opinions about this from other subreddits.
 
Starting this story, I have 16 and she have 16 too, we are on school, we are best friends but everything got wrong yesterday.

So we talk for a long time, 3 years, and we talked a lot (not on school because she said she didnt liked) so we had a nice friendship, we only had 2 discussions but everything was good.

1 month ago i had a discussion with her were i was wrong all the time and she blocked me but i apologized to her face to face (1 week after the block), she apologized me and we got back talking, the first week she was very angry to me, but after sometime we was back again being nice to each other, i tried to be the better me for her, but here comes a new characters.

On the first week after we stopped talking she got a new friend, i thought it was a like a guy from her class but it wasnt, I didnt care too much because i wasnt too much of jealous.

But after we started talking again, she was talking a lot about him (when i say it was a lot, it was), but she was always talking like this. ""I did somethings with him that i didnt did with anybody else, dont ask me details im not going to say"". I was like ""ok"" 

Skipping to this week. I wanted to talk with her why we didnt talk on school (face to face) but she was with the other guy 2 days in a row and i couldnt even had 1 minute with her. She said she was busy and only could talk with me on wednesday (she never talked with me on the wednesday even when i was waiting for her).

I was a bit tired and i said that to her and at the same i said the fellings i had (im in love with her, a lot). (She cried).

Day after i talked with her again, we did a call and was talking for some time, i did a playlist on spotify to her. And the topic about liking someone kicked in and she was talking and she said she liked a guy that didnt care about her, she said that she hugged the ex. I was like ""Wtf?"".

I talked with her about that and said if i had any chance with her ( i know that i did bullshit a month ago, but i was already a changed person for her, i was always wanting her to feel good with me, it was working) but she brings up a topic that made me angry, so, that guy that she said ""I did somethings with him that i didnt did with anybody else, dont ask me details im not going to say"", she said me what it was and she said she was giving hugs (a guy that she only knew on 1 week) and was talking a lot with him. She said to me ""Do you know that guy that i walk with him? So the detail is that im giving him hugs, and having a good time with him but i said to him ""we are not going to have anything"" so i think you know what im saying""

When she said that i hanged up the call, she could only say yes or no to this answer but she got the worst example that i didnt wanted to know. After hanging up the call she said ""Please come back, you know that you are important to me, please comeback""

When she said that i said ""that i wanted some space"", because i was sad, i liked that girl a lot and did everything i could for everything to go well. But she saying that she hug this guy, that another guy, more and more.

We didnt talked today, but she saw me on school and smilled to me and said hello, but im so mixed on my emotions. I asked help to my closest friends, many said to forget her, to move on, that i was better than her. (i cant move on)

I dont know what to do on this situation. I feel lonely, I want to talk withe her but at the same time I want space because she broke my heart.

Honestly I sympathize with this sub a lot. When I was younger I was very lonely. Over time you learn how deal with it.

3236,codecrunchie,1634061755,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

For a few months I actually believed I could be something. I was so close to success and just like that it was gone. I should have remembered I was doing it and everything I love is something I'm not good at.

Everyone from my past is graduating college now and here I am still chasing stupid ass dreams that are getting me nowhere. 

I'm 21 and I started this when I was 19. All the pain and sleepless nights just led to more pain and sleepless nights.

Do I just keep fighting and go for a third year? Am I strong enough? The last two years were hard enough battling my depression and now I'm battling depression and loneliness. 

I didn't care about the loneliness at first. ""Oh I haven't talked to a friend in a couple months? Oh well, I'll hit them up next week to go hang out."" Then we all know how that ends. Now there's such a big gap from then and now. It's like they didn't even care I disappeared off the face of the earth.

3241,Hadesrex2,1634058188,1,"I’ve stopped using most social media and have stopped reaching out to most people because I rarely receive anything back. 

I wouldn’t really care if it was just a few isolated instances but it seems to happen often, with a lot of people. Usually I will message people because I genuinely care. It happens in all different contexts (sending a bday message, checking in on someone, and just trying to make plans). The common defense I’ve heard to a lack of reply is “I’m busy” but then I never hear anything else from them or it takes a very long time to hear anything. This makes me feel indirectly lonely because this is how most people in my life, especially on social media, act. 

It got to a point where it was just draining to even try since I knew it wasn’t going to amount to much. As a result, I kinda just stopped using social media and reaching out to people. Since then, only two people have reached out (not very surprising but saddening nonetheless).

I thought this new approach would help but I still feel lonely. Living without much communication is definitely doable but it’s not very enjoyable.

The only reasonable thing I am thinking of is the one thing I don't want it to be. My first thought was love. I mean I need someone who loves me, not as a friend even more as the person I am.

There was a time when she was the sweetest to me and we used to talk a lot to each other about every small detail, now it feels like everything was just a illusion I created in mind. We used to talk a lot and then suddenly she stopped talking to me, she'd even leave my text on read sometimes. She texts me once in a while now just when she feels like it.

Now suddenly she says that ""All the love and care that you showed felt like I was just pretending in a selfish way"". Like wtf, seriously??? That's all? That's all you are saying? That's all i went through? I was always here, always here for you when you were feeling low and needed someone by your side and you are saying that i am selfish?

iEvolve is a brand new VR gaming experience, focusing on solving daily life challenges and overcoming bad behaviours in modern society, schools and even in work spaces. Throughout the storyline of the game, your self designed character gets approached by various types of bad behavior. It is up to you how you will interact and deal with these given situations. But choose your actions wisely, as your character evolves based on your actions. It's a very physical game, requiring lots of arm movement to control your character, yet you will also have to think carefully before making choices.

iEvolve will contain a multiplayer feature, making it possible for you to connect with other  players, communicate and even complete daily challenges together. It is also a way for you to build relations with people from all over the world.

Do you want a best friend? A lover? A mentor? A devotee? A confidant? I'll be what you need me to be but I want camaraderie, comfort, and confidence. I want the people in my life that will ride out until then end.

My day job demands a lot of attention but after about 630pm PST I'm free.

I'm sick of the isolation and melodrama, I just want to be close to you, whoever you are. I have no trouble talking to people, I just feel that rejection anxiety very acutely, but on the internet it's easier.

He was a guy I could relate to most, we used to share our feelings with each other and everything was cool. In 2020, when the school's shut down, we became much closer friends. We used to do frequent voice calls and used to play on our play stations, it was just great!

I used to consider him as my best friend, but from the start of this year, he has been acting kinda strange. He leaves me on read, we rarely chat and in general, we only talk if he needs some favours. 

I waited for a long time and we only distanced further, today I manned up and decided to ask him what was wrong. 

This is what he said:

 I want to talk and chat with you but not as much like we can be friends but not friends that talk a lot.

its just I don't want to talk to you as much

And then when I asked him if he had any reason to that he said:

 not really man, I just feel like we can't really be that close

I tried to go to a favorite coffee shop today but they had closed unexpectedly. The coffee shop thing helps a LOT with my loneliness. I bring a book and people watch. Even just sitting there hearing people talk is huge.

Podcasts help a bit too. I listened to a board gaming / RPG gaming podcast and enjoyed the discussions.

But overall still feel that ""heaviness"" of the loneliness. Between covid causing a lot of places to be closed or have limited hours/seating/etc., and the gray and rainy fall weather arriving, and being off from work for a bit (had a contract job end a couple weeks ago), and living alone == lots and lots of time to think and ruminate and be by myself. Even my neighbors situation has been lonely: there's been two nearly-vacant houses surrounding mine lately.

I'm introvert and do enjoy lots of time to rest and recharge. But covid has been so many months and months of isolation, work from home, meetup groups being cancelled... bleh.

3334,Judge-Mission,1634005999,1,"Hey I’m M(19) and feel so disconnected from the world. I was born with a rare form of deafness which has resulted in me being having severe hearing loss for most of my life. These days I don’t hear much of anything. I faintly remember the voices of some family, mostly my dad, before my hearing got extremely bad.

Anyways, I’ve always felt alone even growing up, I went to a normal school and I was the only deaf person for my whole schooling career. I had some friends in middle school and high school as I was in speech therapy, and had a few friends from that. 

Yet last year when quarantine started it was really hard for me to attend online classes as at first, as I didn’t have access to a relay, and the translator I have just didn’t work out with lag and other internet issues, so I ended up just getting all my homework sent to me and not having to attend live zoom classes.

To make a long story short, I lost my friends that I did have and now I’m into my second year at college and I’m completely alone. I go through my days hardly interacting with anyone. I have no friends, no family to talk to. No one. I go and sit in the dining hall and no one even bats an eye. I’m in massive classes with hundreds of students yet none of them seem interested in interacting with me.

I try to make friends, yet I still manage to mess something up. I try to go to groups that share similar intrests yet I’m still somewhat pushed aside as it seems like no one wants, or knows how to to interact with deaf people.

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, whether I’m trying to vent or ask for help or something else I don’t know.

I’m just lonely, and tired of sitting by myself.

Found one dude off reddit and he pushed me away so i gave him space, he stopped inviting me to play then got mad i didnt invite him. I double checked my message history and i was the one always asking. I guess since i didnt ask it made him upset and with my depression i sleep a lot so he thought i was ignoring him and threw that in my face saying i was using that as an excuse, still didnt invite me to any games or to chat, then removed me off everything.






Its kinda hard to meet new people and much harder after what that guy did, but tbh he didnt seem genuine, he said he found me off my gamerpals post but then revealed he saw my relationship post and asked about it. There were other things that i could tell he was lying about but i enjoyed his company but i guess since he was being fake it doesnt matter, he showed me what he thought i wanted to see and not who he really is. It happens, its the internet.





#back to the main topic



So, after weeks of just chilling alone i go back to them and they reveal a bunch of stuff they were unhappy about, some of it being twisted or rumours/assumptions and after what my bf told them, it was too much, they couldnt handle it. 





They slowly let me back ""in"" but its not the same and honestly never will be. They said they hate it when i read to them or talk to them about the stories i read. Not every thing i read is horror. 




So, i stopped. I stopped talking about my feelings. I stopped sharing memes (my memes are wholesome is just cute animals typically), i stopped talking about my day, and didnt ask them how they were doing as much as i used to. 





And now they get a little aggressive and passive aggressive. They ask me why the fuck arnt i talking. (And i am, we played an urf and i wasnt ""talking"" but would call out ""mia"" or say, ""do you want to swap lanes"")



Its just gaming stuff now, and they are fun to play with, but i feel like everything is empty. Things are already ruined. 




I dont know what to do. I know i gotta make more friends, but how do i balance who i am? Do i just put on a mask and just never show who i am to others? I dont even remember how i got comfortable talking to them about stuff. I guess it happened over time? Do I really have to start over again...? I tried being open with that one dude off reddit and i dont know if thats where things went wrong or what.





My bf suggested I make a youtube channel where i just talk and read to an audience. That just seems kinda lonely, i like reading aloud to share what i like with a friend. I guess sharing with a channel isn't that different but its less personal?





I guess it could be better than what im doing now, which is mostly isolating.





I like to draw too so maybe sharing those to a channel as well.




Heck, maybe even a discord for people who want to hear me read. I can even screen share and i also have audible to listen to stuff together.",lonely,"""Friends"" upset when I talk, now they are upset I'm not talkative. Can't win.",2021-10-12 13:07:06

3347,Exa747,1633998988,1,"Making friends nowadays isn't a crime, right? At least I like to think so. As of late, due to depression, anxiety and some other personal situations I've been struggling in being social, in general. 

I've been slowly isolating myself from people, somewhere in my late-ish teens I tried expressing these feelings through Art (I suppose you could call it that). They started as photos that I'd take and put as a profile picture (like the one in my profile right now), I also posted a few days ago all the drawings I've made depicting some of these feelings on my profile, if you're interested in knowing what I mean.

Most of the time I feel like a choker, as I've grown and learned how to (better) deal with this I've been trying not to be too hard on myself regarding my mental health state. Started an Alprazolam treatment (Xanax) with a very low dose, recommend by my psychiatrist to treat my anxiety, they also suspect that my depression, etc, could be caused by an underlying physical condition, this one being Cerebral Dysrhythmia (sounds way worse than what it is, to Sum it up, everyone's brainwaves follow a pattern, so cerebral dysrhythmia is when your brain waves lose such pattern)

I suppose I wrote all of that previous stuff so people have a rough idea of who they're going to be chatting with (if interested, ofc).

Regarding my interests, they're quite general. I've been told that I'm a very mature person for my age (19), and that I'm very smart and all of that. In my case, I believe it's true, but everyone's entitled to have a different opinion if so they decide.

I love learning how stuff works, and with stuff, I mean everything: Science (I'm a lot into physics and astrophysics, but also into medicine &amp; chemistry), Psychology (which technically isn't a science), Technology (both retro &amp; up to date tech), and some other things that interest me too, but not as much as these. I like gaming, I'm mostly a PC gamer, but for personal situations I sold my gaming rig about 2 years ago, so I've been playing on my cellphone and some lighter games on my laptop (good news tho, a decent gaming laptop is on its way!)

(Start the conversation by saying any color so I know you read everything!)

I usually like talking to people older than me, since I feel that we connect better, but everyone's fine, I don't think age is a defining factor when it comes to a person's mental maturity (except when they're very young, hormonal changes do affect maturity)

So, who am I looking for? Anyone that's interested in texting me, really. I don't have a prototype of a ""perfect person"", neither as friends or romantic interests.

If you've read all of this, I'd recommend you to check my profile too.

More years pass, and college happens. Jobs happen. Your free hours go from more than 12 hours a day down to 4-5 assuming you wash and cook for yourself.

Jobs get worse, stuff gets more difficult. Things get more congested. People get married, start families or chase passions—your free time with them cuts down to maybe an hour if that.

* They start ghosting me
* I ghost them because its impossible to hold a conversation with them.
* They are up at completely different times, instead of the time I am up, so I get to barely talk to them if at all.
* They only talk to me to try to date me and then block me when I inevitably say no.

So honestly, I don't even know what to do.  I do have friends... just no one that is up at similar times that I am that I could bond with.

I realise how out of proportion and so how cringe this sounds to a lot of people but when you're 18, never been intimate with someone, have few friends and you're a fully blown empath who's dreamt up countless  idealistic scenarios since you understood the concept of love, life comes as a big smack in the face sometimes. 

We all need love, but I'm honestly so starved of anything close to it that once I finally do have a real attractive connection with someone my heart will literally explode. I can see it now, It will be the end of the date and just before saying goodbye we hug and I literally start sobbing as my head is over her shoulder. She'll think I'm crazy lmao and I'll just have to pour my heart out on the street there and then. What a story that'll be hey! 

It's not like I'm ugly or anything, decent looking infact, but I class myself as an INFP for personality and I have  bad social anxiety which has meant I've missed out on a lot of the important experiences teenagers have. If I'm honest its left me with a big hole that only love could fix. I'd love to know if people can relate, if not I hope its given you a bit of insight into some peoples lifes or you may have found it humorous which I completely understand lol.

3367,Fabulous-Advantage,1633993635,1,"In early 20s.

I was one of the only who didn't make close friends in college and still trying to find out why. 

I tried/or did therapy for around 2 years and I still don't know what I'm working on. My last therapist left me without a word. I'm getting back into it again but they can't care for me, can they?

Meals and eating enough are hard in a way I can't describe and no one seems to understand it, not even myself but it feels like I have to go back and solve that when all I could do was cope.

It just feels so unfair all the work I had to do to have a friend or a girlfriend, to be normal. All the times I went out of my comfort zone, all the activities I joined, all the things I did, it just feels unrecognized. It did make a difference, but it takes too much work; I don't know how I can live with how everyone is normal and I have to be different and fight it on my own too. Even my own family I had to make changes in which I don't contact them much for my well-being. I don't understand why I had to go through so much to be left with nothing. 

I found some new people to hang with (because I went out of my comfort zone, again) but I don't want to. I want to talk about my problems. I want to be there for them but I can't. How do you try again. People don't care about my problems, because of their own I don't need them to. But I do need to feel like I matter, somewhere. 

I feel like I need a year to grieve all that I lost and was taken from me and understand the reality of the situation.  But most importantly, how do you try again? How do you go back and fix problems you had since middle school that you didn't know should be fixed? How do you care again? How do you do it without judging yourself for not making progress? Without being afraid that if you let yourself down the hole you won't come out of it. How do you get over anger at the people who didn't understand you? At the people who assumed things you were fighting to control were things you did on purpose? How do you live feeling good when you move forward but other days paralyzed by all the feelings realizing how different I was.",lonely,How do you try again when you can't anymore?,2021-10-12 10:07:15

3373,realneocanuck,1633992279,1,"23M, this is a vent post. I'm at a breaking point now, realizing that my mind literally lacks the ability to make connections in the way normal humans can. The ability for people to be funny and come up with witty stuff on the spot, just doesn't exist for me. The ability to connect with people based on common interests also is something I just completely lack. And I don't even think that my interests are all that uncommon. I watch sports (popular ones), I run and go to the gym, I pay attention to news and politics, I play guitar and I ski. But for some reason I just completely lack the ability to use my interest in these topics to actually get people to connect with me or like me, and it's been this way for years. I simply have no charisma and have a shit personality. Literally my only ""friends"" right now are girls I've hooked up with or met on dating apps. So in other words if I wasn't mildly attractive, I would literally have nothing and nobody. I have no guy friends.

The root cause of all of this might be what happened to me when I was a high school freshman. I had one really close friend at the time who transfered to another high school, and eventually we completely lost touch. As it turns out, he's gay and only really hung out with me because he liked me and now all his platonic friends are female. Anyway, in high school after he transfered out, I tried reaching out to a new friend group that I thought was cool with me but quickly enough they started pushing me out and talking shit about me to my face. From then on, I completely hated going to school and lost all confidence in myself. I quit playing sports that I'd loved for years and lost all interest in social media, further isolating myself. Later in high school I found some more casual acquaintances who I would eat lunch with and talk to in class, but we would never do anything together outside of school, and they made no effort to keep in touch with me after we graduated. College was kinda the same for me, I had acquaintances in clubs I was part of, guys I would go out for drinks with, but I had no relationship with them beyond that and club stuff.

Through all my previous lonely years, I at least thought that if I stuck with the plan, building a successful career, working on my body and overall appearance, people would naturally gravitate towards me and I'd become popular. But over the last few weeks I've come to the realization that it doesn't matter, since I still can't carry a conversation and have the personality of a dried paper bag. I don't even expect women to want to seriously date me because why the fuck would they be proud of having a bf/husband who is a loser with no guy friends? And it also sucks because there's so much stuff I want to do, so many big ski/hiking/sports trips I've always dreamed of doing, but I can't for the foreseeable future because my female ""friends"" aren't into that, I have no guy friends and I'd look like a complete loser doing them all alone. I'm just so fucking tired of being myself and not being able to connect with others in the way an average human being can. I was never diagnosed with ASD but I strongly believe that I am in fact on the spectrum. I'm just so tired man.",lonely,It seems like I just flat-out lack some friend-making skill other people are born with,2021-10-12 09:44:39

So a girl from work and I have been flirting with each other for a few months. She had honestly always been much more open about it than I was (I’m kinda shy). But a few weeks ago, she asked me for my Snapchat, so I gave it to her. An hour later, she messages me. So you know, we start chatting.

We actually started messaging each other almost constantly, from the time we woke up to bedtime (we were also talking at work when we got a chance). Snapchat even showed that we were “Best Friends” (which just means we’ve sent the most messages to each other out of both our contact lists).

So that’s how things were, up until a few days ago when she started responding back to me a little slower. I didn’t think much of it then; I mean, we all have lives outside of our phones, you know. But the next day, just mid-conversation, she stopped talking with me altogether, leaving me on delivered.

I don’t know what I could’ve said, but I don’t think I ever said anything remotely wrong or inappropriate. I just can’t help but feel like she’s lost interest in me as she’s gotten to know me better, and this feeling is eating away at me.

Work was so busy these past couple days that I didn’t even get an opportunity to talk with her face-to-face, and we aren’t scheduled to work together again until this Friday. I snapped her again a few hours ago, just saying “hey,” but that message still appears as delivered too.

3422,SportsMajor,1633971949,1,"Before college began, I'm not sure if I was ever ""lonely"". Sure, I only had one friend in high school, but I had plenty of acquaintances I talked to in school or occasionally on social media. Even when this was happening less and less as high school went on, I still felt comfortable in school knowing most people. I also had my cousins who were willing to hangout with me often during the summer and always would let me stay over at their place in the summer if they were allowed to (it was like a 10 minute walk). I definitely was happier then, that's for sure.

Now I'm a college sophomore and I most definitely am lonely. When high school was finished, I was told that it would be easy to make friends in college, but that couldn't have been any farther from the truth. Two years in and I have no friends, barely know anyone, and my only interactions come from professors. Last year, during my freshman year, I actually opted to take one in-person class and four online classes and I surprisingly loved it. Too bad I couldn't do that this semester.

Anyways, like I said, since everything I thought would happen clearly hasn't (and likely never will) happened, my loneliness has began to take a toll on me. I've felt bored with almost everything I do except for playing or practicing at the basketball courts at my park and at college. I've felt a disconnect between me and nearly everyone else except family. This disconnect has gotten so bad that I've quit almost every social media. I only got this Reddit account a very small Instagram account after removing plenty of followers over the year. At least once everyday, I feel this emptiness that can only rid itself naturally. It doesn't matter where or when it happens: at home, at college, on the city bus, during the day, or during the night. I just feel like I only got myself and my family. I've also began to lose motivation for college at times since I can't rid this feeling of loneliness, but I'm still passing and I plan to graduate in a few years. 

Loneliness hurts a lot when being single too. I'm only 19, but I don't want to be single anymore. That may not have been the case if I made a move on someone who may have wanted me, but that was two years. I still run into them too so that hurts even more, especially when I still don't know anyone at college and can't simply find an interest in anyone there. I could hit them up now, but considering we never really talked and all I got was hints two years ago, I think that'd be awkward. I was thinking about using a dating app, but I'd rather not.

I know things will get better eventually. I already got something to look forward to soon. I just hate this feeling of loneliness and the negativity which thrives off of it. I feel like I need more than just basketball to distract myself off of the loneliness, but I don't know what I can do. I don't got any money and live with family, so it's not like I can do anything interesting or fun at the moment either. Patience is key as well, because who knows what opportunity may arise to break this loneliness off?",lonely,19M and this loneliness has already caught up to me.,2021-10-12 04:05:49

I’m 23F and work hybrid. I currently live at home (and did throughout college) to save money. Recently, I’ve been thinking about my next life steps since my life right now feels boring / dull. I live in the suburbs and all of my friends are in the city (40 min train ride away). So when I’m home, I’m basically just isolated from everyone I know besides my family and I also don’t drive.

My options:
#1 - I can move out and find a place with random roommates that’s closer to my job in the city. Right now, my commute is almost an hour and the areas I’m looking at would lower it to about 20-30mins. 

#2 - Continue to live at home to save money that would be going to rent and get a dog, which would be my main responsibility.

Some points:
- I can afford a room for $1k, but I definitely would have to budget myself and won’t have as much freedom with my purchases like I do now

- Owning a dog has been a dream of mine and I know I would be responsible in terms of caring for it, but i don’t know where I’ll be exactly in the future 5-10 years from now

- I feel like I need more excitement and independence in my life. Living at home makes it hard to see my friends that are in the city",lonely,Living at home is taking a toll on me.,2021-10-11 23:48:18

For this venting session I would like you to know that  i'm secretly a loser who pretends that she has everything under control and constantly fakes being  happy and not having any mental health problems, just because it makes me sick to my stomach when i think about being vulnerable and admitting that i'm simply lost, and truly miserable and the worst part is that i think i deserve it. It's my second year in law school. I pun on a fancy blazer every morning, put some color on my cheecks,  and on my lips, concealer under the heavy eyebags to cover up that fact that i've cried myself to sleep last night and that i haven't slept in days and i either binge eat or starve myself till i feel like colapsing. But it's fine, at least i look presentable for the teachers and for my colleagues, right? I study all this awful subject till i'm exhausted, i joined a stupid law students association just to get to know more people hoping to feel the void. (spoiler: it didn't help). Many think that i'm smart and capable, but i'm pretty much a fraud. I simply cram my twisted brain with all this information just so the other respect me. I smile all the time to the point where my cheeks hurt, i don't want to let them see, i truly don't want to let them see the cracks. I pushed so many people i loved away from me. I feel like i'm ruining everything. Why do i find it so hard for me to show myself some basic human decency? Where does all this self hate and lack of kindness come from? When did I stopped enjoying the sunrise and the sunset? When did I start caring more about appereances and little white lies? When did I lost my sparkle?

3456,Dannyboi_i,1633954718,1,"Tl:dr - I need friends and advice on breaking up ties

I've been contemplating posting on this sub for a while and today presented an opportunity to do so. I turned 21 last week it was a very off-putting birthday celebration. I first went out to the movies in the morning with a couple of friends. They didn't remember my birthday but I didn't care because I like spending time with them and we forget birthdays all the time. Fast forward a few hours and another group of friends literally coerced me into meeting them at the same time that I promised to get dinner with my family. I explicitly told them that I already had plans but they somehow convinced themselves that it is okay to wait outside the restaurant I was having my meal at, instead of probably going out another day. Dinner inevitably became late and it began raining, so we drove to one of the friends's house where they had a 'suprise' waiting for me. The surprise was bottles of alcohol. I've told them time and time again that I do not like drinking but it clearly didn't get through. They purchased so much alcohol and I had a dreaded feeling that they did so at my expense and will expect money back. It didn't take long, 15 hours to be precise, until I got a message asking me to foot the entire alcohol bill. I'd been expecting it so it wasn't a shocker but it still hurt. 
Today happens to be the birthday of one of the friends from the group. I wished him in the morning and he mentioned that he'd let me know if there is anything planned for later in the day. This friend in particular is rather close to me and when we spoke later in the evening, he made sure to remind me about paying for the alcohol and also didn't invite me to the party he was having at that very moment. 
I feel disgusted with myself more than anything at this point and have serious questions about my relationships. This post is not about birthdays but I didn't expect to be treated like absolute shite, given that my previous birthdays were rather positive. It feels like this treatment was long due and I could have avoided this by simply being straight with them.
There's also a backstory to this but that's a little too long. I will mention that I do not enjoy the company of these friends anymore and I'm somehow stuck with them because they're the only group I know in college. It's an excuse I've been telling myself for months now and I sometimes get nervous when I think  of the lack of friends whose company I enjoy. 

I have two rhetorical questions that I really need help with:

1) How do I make friends again?
2) What advice do you have for lonely people that have very few friends, whose absence would make everyday life extremely difficult?",lonely,It is difficult to understand people,2021-10-11 23:18:38

But then again i always have these days where I feel appreciated yet i am really empty inside. Its like everything thats positive only meant words for me. Sure i got a lot of friends but theres really no one looking out for me. I am okay just being by myself but it hurts being empty and not knowing what to feel whether i should be happy or sad its just always a plain expression or feelings in me.

These are quite useless advices, I have to say. A person is lonely precisely because one is not able (or is finding it difficult) to do those abovementioned actions.

Yes, I am fully aware that if I am not the one who is taking actions and making changes for myself, nothing is ever going to change. I know that. However, just telling a lonely person to go out and be with other people simply does not help, and it's not like I haven't tried it before. I have been out there before, and was involved in groups before, and tried contacting old friends. It's just that I didn't find those relationships interesting or particularly fun. Those were for the most part, draining and time consuming, and in the end I am plunged back into emptiness. There was no fulfillment and enrichment. After all that hassle, everything was for naught.

So in the end, I found out being on my own is more cost efficient. Back to loneliness it was. It's everywhere and I just can't seem to shake it off.",lonely,"??: Reconnect with old contacts, Go out and socialize more",2021-10-11 22:36:25

It's obviously hard to have nobody to talk to and being the lonely kid in class. But sometimes all I fucking feel is like having someone talk to, give me a hug, talk to me. Had a lot of friends back in the time before this pandemic thing, but isolation made me realise that friendship like that really had no meaning, just stayed with them, everybody had their own friends and I was the only one left. I thought I had many friends but turned out they were all acquaintance. Had 2 friends recently, but now with time, I am the one left out, they stay with themselves, and they try to seclude me from their conversation, and like before I can't really can't go upto people forcing them to talk to me. Liked this girl a lot, first time actually liked a girl and wanted to have some realtionship, but couldn't even talk to her and well now she has moved into a town, so can't even do anything now.

I feel fucking miserable upon myself, not doing anything's, having thousand of things in my mind, listening to music all day, and sleep being my best friend.  It's easy to tell for others to go out and talk but it's not. What I have understood is? We all are lonely deep inside but most won't express it to others and stay with themselves acting all strong, only if we lonely people could help each other out but no we all are busy and won't move out of our circle, only of some of us actually want to talk and be with others except knowing most of us are lonely.

I just want someone to talk to and take care of me, I can live alone and that's 100%age true, but I don't enjoy it. This thing has been moving into me since a year, should have done something back then, but all I feel like is a void inside. I understand people have trauma inside, and feel that sometime.

My group of friends were dead quiet, my family actually started to ask for help to release my mom from purgatory, I still get depressed at night because there's no one to talk to. 

So I joined a community. I joined a discord group and recently I've been in another one. However more relationships that were once personal now crumbled to the ground. In the end, the community of people became my friend instead of one on one.

I’ve longed for a connection to someone where we innately understand each other; where we provide full attention and compassion towards one another without hesitation. Is it an unrealistic romanticization of love? Absolutely. Does it change the fact that I think about it all the time? No. 

About two years ago I had this dream. I was lost in an urban hellscape - no knowledge of how I got there or how to get home. I walked through the metropolitan nightmare, passing through corner liquor stores and empty stretches of road. Every direction was filled with concrete. Even looking up meant following monolithic urbanization until my eyes finally reached the clouds. 

I wandered for so long. Nobody wanted to help me. It didn’t matter how kindly I asked. It didn’t matter what I asked. They always refused. Until a woman approached me. She offered me a ride back to my home; despite it apparently being days away.

At first, she seemed to genuinely dislike me. It seemed she offered me a ride out of abject pity. Nothing more, nothing less. She had this rusted green truck. The type that creaks when you turn the wheel the slightest amount. It didn’t matter to me. She was the only human capable of helping a lost soul. 

We drove for so long. She started warming up to me - started actually talking about everything and nothing. Throughout that ride I learned an incredible amount about her life; though I’ve unfortunately forgotten most of it. After some time, we fell in love. 

I can’t remember most of the dream. I know what she looks like, what she acted like. I know she isn’t real and never will be. I know I can’t hold onto this dream characterization of a woman, but it hurts. It hurts to be in reality and know most people don’t give a fuck. Most just want to use you, or they realize you’re a fucking weirdo and leave you alone.

But, slowly, but surely, I started to realize that they were just there cause I could help them in some way or other. Mostly with academics, since I used to be pretty smart. Sure enough, once i got out of school, they all left. I tried staying in touch, but there was no point. They weren't interested and that was pretty clear to me. Never experienced love neither.

Then, I found the one person who I felt was it. I felt she actually cared about me, and I became so close to her. I used to talk to her everyday. We used to play games together, watch movies, sent each other meme, shared our joys and pains with each other everyday. It just made life all that easier to hold on to. I was suffering a lot on other aspects at the time, but I never felt overwhelmed, cause I knew at the end of the day I could talk to her and forget about everything that happened. I only had one fear, and that was she would leave someday. 

And that happened many months ago. It was partly my fault, and partly situational. A misunderstanding that ruined everything. It was a pain I cannot express. I tried messaging her yesterday to see if we could make things slightly better, but she just blocked me. It hurt me..so much. But I still wont blame her. She was an awesome person and I wish the very best to her in life.

I do what I have to do at the best of my ability then just do nothing for the rest of the day. Anytime I learn something or something that excites me, no one cares. Just learned to keep everything to myself and just fake it everyday. Always have been social, played football for my whole life and then that just stopped. Always used to go out that just suddenly still stopped. It is my fault though. I isolated myself from anyone that I talked to because the problems I have had internally. Never vented or talked to anyone about it. Feels good to just spam this shitty iPhone keyboard. Maybe I just spent too much time on social media or hated school so much that it’s had a spiralling affect. No clue, all I know is I am lonely and sad and don’t think that’ll change for a while.

But almost constantly, whether I am around my friends or not I feel a sense of loneliness. What I've decided it is, is that I want to have a relationship with a girl. Because I really like the idea of being able to snuggle up under a blanket with a girl and cuddle while we watch a movie or talk about our lives. But I don't really have any traits that would be interesting to a girl, and also I go to an all boys private school which makes it kind of hard to meet girls.

But I have a hard time opening up to people because the few times that I've opened up to people before it hasn't gone very well. Sometimes when I tell people about my true feelings, like my loneliness or how a lot of the time I feel sadness in regards to my life and the world around me they don't seem to know how to respond. Maybe they think it's a strange way to view the world or maybe they just don't wanna hang out with someone who feels like that because they think it might rub off on them. I don't really know to be honest because they don't usually tell me, they just quietly distance themselves and stop talking to me as much.

I am a very loving person and it hurts me to not have someone to give my love to and have them return the feeling. I just wish I was as important in people's lives as they are in mine.

It seems that besides my parents no one really cares about me, I have been going through a tough time mentally and I have no friends to talk to about it.

Recently, I was really looking forward to a short trip with a couple of my what I thought were close friends. Now one of them has canceled and is practically ghosting me over flimsy reasons. I am scheduled to travel in a couple of and am really dreading the experience.

What does one have to do for things to just be normal? I see so many of my college batchmates going on trips, getting into relationships, hanging out with their friends and doing things which people in their 20s usually do.

I don't post too often, but I need to let some things out. 

Sometimes I feel so lonely and unhappy, eventhough I don't have problems with my family or friends. I actually have a lot of good friends. However I still feel so depressed. I don't feel like this all the time, and I try to suppress these feelings as much as I can, but sometimes it is too much and I start crying. I feel like an asshole because a lot of people have it way harder, that I shouldn't be overdramatic. 

I don't even know what im typing right now. Just what comes to mind, hope you guys don't mind. But I just can't stop feeling so lonely and depressed. I usually try to ignore these feelings, but ever since I started a new education  I am only getting more stressed about my future and what i want to do in life, about how friends think of me, and it makes me so frustrated.

I also get pretty jealous when I see couples, especially when they are close friends. It feels like everybody around me is so wanted and I'm just not good enough. But than again I feel like im just being overdramatic, and that I shouln't complain because others have it more difficult.

I don't know if i'm actually depressed, or if I'm being overdramatic, or maybe just having 2 bad years in a row. 

to the people who read this, thankyou for listening, and I'm sorry it is a bit of a incoherent mess, just needed to let these things out.",lonely,"I feel so alone some times (M,18)",2021-10-11 05:53:52

I'm getting worse and don't have enough courage to tell it to someone like friends or parents. just for context: I'v been an hikikomori since the beginning of middle school, i isoleted myself from the others for a looooong time, i try to be the most kind with everyone I meet and want them to know how much I think how good they did certain things, like taking a good grade in class, or excelling in a sport but none of them ever seems to care, in return i always get insulted or joked about at school, maybe for my still childish way of being, not in a negative way, in a good way like being over excited for things or having innocent reactions, it's been like this for almost 5 years and through all this time i got and stille get sucidal thoughts, not just for this great loneliness i feel of course. Now i'm lonely except for very good and serious friends online, differently from the people i find irl they are very kind, respectful and say how beautiful and strong i am, and sometimes i can see that beauty (i'm pretty fit, muscular and with a cool jaw and nice voice too! really) it felt like kinda of a dream hehe. but now i'm wondering why after all these years, no one ever said those things or ever complimented me for the minimal achievement, i suck at school i get it, but at least i hoped for even a bith of simpathy from them...

and now here i am, i feel incredibly phisically and psichologically lonely, i want to be desired by people but at the same time, i feel disgusted to even the thought of being with a girl because i'm not enough.

3635,throwaway_wannadie,1633865728,1,"22M here. At a very very rough patch in my life rn. Social life, Personal Life, as well as financial and career aspects, everything is a mess for me rn. 
And I've seen that some times, internet does trigger me too. 
I don't use any social media besides twitter and reddit. Never used insta or fb because I have had major body dysmorphia and self esteem issues and stuff, so could never get on a platform where people mainly posted their own pics. 
I'm thinking about stopping usage of twitter and reddit for the rest of this month too, because it's triggering a lot of my issues a bit too lately.

But I'm very scared about this decision. I have no social life currently. Im staying at my parents house and haven't spoken to anyone else except my parents and the retail workers etc since 2 months now. Reddit and twitter are my only sources of any sort of interaction in which I can be genuine, especially reddit. 
I'm scared I'll lose track of what's going on in the world and lag behind in terms of news etc., And also lose out on this small sliver of interaction I get. Reddit is my only hope of making true frnds anywhere. And I'm super scared that stopping it. 

But I kinda wanna too. I'm also scared that if I determine myself to pull this off but relapse, I'll feel even more like crap.

3638,Im_Meikuari,1633862805,1,"After typing all this I’m realizing it’s just a really long pity story so I’m sorry for wasting anyone’s time 

This may come off as a bit childish, but I used to be somewhat popular, I used to be known, I had a big friend group, then because of some mental health issues I got put in a class for kids my age who had bad grades or bad mental health 

(my school system refuses to actually care about mental health, my friend was in a really bad place to the point where he almost took his life and they just sent him to a different school system so they didn’t have to deal with it.)

So instead of helping me and other kids, they send us to “the bad kids class” where the kids they don’t wanna deal with go and play games instead of being educated, don’t get me wrong it was fun, but they didn’t educate us and when they did it was work we did years before. Then COVID hit towards the end of the year and I didn’t even get to do finals, then they decide everyone passes automatically because of COVID. 

So I go into the next grade without knowing anything from the previous grade &amp; not having my friend group as we couldn’t hang out when all of my classes were in one room. I gain weight cause of depression from COVID, and I start the school year with online school for personal reasons, then halfway through the school year I switch back to normal school without knowing any of the online school work cause of my horrible self control (never did any online school work.

So I’m dropped in with no knowledge from the year prior or the first half of that year, I have no friends, since my town is VERY athletic to the point where it’s discriminatory, I get shamed for being overweight, no one even wants to look at me, I fail, I redo school again trying online, and now I’m almost halfway through a school year, having done practically NO work at all.

I have one friend that stuck with me this whole time who introduced me to his two best friends and now we all hang out together. Thing is my best friend who was all I had. Through this, just found a girlfriend online and is going to a different state across the country until he graduates to be with her.

So to recap, I lost my little popularity I had, (idc how childish it sounds it made me feel happy that people knew who I was) I lost two of my big friend groups, I’m failing school with no option but to drop out and be disowned by my parents, I’m losing my best friend soon, things aren’t too healthy with my other two friends so i don’t think they’re gonna be around for much longer. 

And I have NO way to meet new people my age. No school, I do homeschooling. No job, grades are too bad to get one. I barely leave the house. And even if I DID have a way to meet people besides online (I can’t do long distance relationships, I need to be able to hang out with whoever I date a lot, I’m just clingy idk..) my crippling social anxiety is way to hard for me to overcome I get sick as if I’m in a life or death situation while just talking to people.

TLDR: I used to have everything, happiness, friends, popularity, and I now i have absolutely nothing, I’m failing school, no hopes of success with my schoolwork AT ALL, I’m losing all my friends and i have no way of meeting new people so it all finally leads to I’m lonely…",lonely,God.. what happened…,2021-10-10 21:46:45

It’s not rocket science. I have a chemical imbalance in the brain that requires me to see a psychologist and take medications. It by no means is “cured”. My psychologist tends to compare it to diabetes (I’ve gotten flak for the comparison), in which it never really goes away, I’ve just gotta learn to manage it.

I have a shitty attitude, and miserable demeanor. Not afraid to admit it. I’ve done some terrible things in my life that I carry extreme guilt for. I would apologize to those I’ve affected but they would prefer to never see me again, which I can’t blame them.

The bridges burned, the insults spewed, the disinterest in others, it can be rooted to one thing, depression. It’s caused me to drive away every friend I have.

I’ve become a better person though, I’ve completely dropped drugs and alcohol, and go to the gym everyday. Although I’ve tainted my reputation as a person. It’s hard for people to give me a second chance, in which I understand.

I used to have a group of friends freshman year, but I sorta distanced myself from them because I'm not into the party and drugs scene, which feels so difficult to avoid in college. I want sober, nonparty friends.

I tried talking to these 2 or 3 other girls more, but I feel like it's always me who initiates. Why doesn't anyone ask me to dinners or invite me to their hangouts? I know I'm not close enough to them, but it's just so hard. I hate that it felt like everyone made friends the first month of school and just stuck through. It's so hard to break in, and I feel like I'll never have a real best or close friend because everyone else got years of friendship on me.

There's even a guy I'm trying to talk to who I'm interested in hanging out with more and maybe something more, but I think I just look like a shy, innocent girl, so it's hard to ask for anything more.

I don't think I'm ugly or anything. I'm decently smart and funny. I just don't get it. I've been alone for years. Help me.",lonely,How do you make friends? Or at least have people actually hit you up first?,2021-10-10 16:31:57

Most everybody who was a friend, was so because they were in peripheral space towards me and to make it worse, someone who I thought was my best friend, could care less about me being gone. On top of that, they weren’t even a positive figure in my life in the first place. Anyways, I’ve basically realized most of my, I’ve been in a bundle of bad eggs bundle after bundle. I have much more freedom and energy to act on my own now, but I feel like I have to find people I can vibe and coexist with, without having to zap all my energy for them. I believe in the saying: “go alone, go fast, but go together, go far.” So this is my SOS for finding new friends and who knows, maybe new stories. I just turned 26.

I am truly wondering how people are able to build deep and bonded relationships, friends or otherwise. It seems like I somehow missed the boat on how to make friends and groups of friends. I fully admit I'm not the best at starting bonds. I am extremely awkward and shy, I prefer work style communication, as it is easier to work with.

Everyone I know seems to have these great bonds, where I can say I have 3 people I think of as real friends, and not 1 lives even remotely near anymore.

I feel like I've built this fortress of solitude, and I love my peace and quiet, but some days I really, im just lonely. And it seems like no one really cares or gives a damn.

I cant seem to break the shackles of my way of being, I am well aware I have a serious rbf, which does not help. But how can I even begin to change when it seems to go against what I am.

I decided it was best to move back home and commute to school to save money. I thought I would still keep in touch with these friends but haven’t spoken a word to them since. It’s hard to get into but it seems they are mad at me and completely have cut me off. We all said how we would have to hang out even when I moved back home and I’d be invited to our old house, but this hasn’t happened. It hurts to see on social media their posts hanging out or having small parties and not being included. It may relate to the fact that I became very close with my boyfriend and hung out with him more than them. 

This has left me with 0 close friends. My boyfriend obviously has a life of his own and even though I see him a few times a week he is busy with his sports and also has friends/roommates of his own to be with. I feel so lonely when he is busy with them. It is not his fault at all, but it makes me jealous of what friends he has. I regret moving out of my uni house as at least I had people to see every day. I feel at this point I won’t make any new friends either. I don’t like relying on my boyfriend to have someone to be with. I miss feeling included and having friends to have fun with.

Sometimes people just start uncomfortably laughing in conversations. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I can't hold a job for very long.

There's this impending dread and I'm just wondering how much longer I can take this before I get fired for being too weird or just leave.

I live in a major city at the moment. I hate the noise and it makes me constantly anxious, I do like how anonymous I am though. I can just disappear pretty much. I form no real connections with people just keep jumping from one place to the next...surviving. It's no way to live but what's the alternative.

I mean, I could just go home. But there’s nothing waiting for me there either. I suppose it doesn’t even make a difference where I am, i’m always alone. 

I bet my coworker is out here somewhere having fun. No, i’m sure she is lol she’s always out. Probably not enjoying bottomless mimosas with her countless girlfriends. No dull moment in her life. I wonder how she does it. Like, how is she not exhausted? Being that social seems so draining. But as long as she’s happy I guess.  Not me, I could never lol I’m not bitter, to be honest. I wouldn’t want anyone to feel the mind of loneliness that I do. I’m just sad for myself is all. 

She called me earlier and I didn’t pick up. I’m sure she was just gonna ask me for something. Probably some adderall. Or money lol. That’s always the only reason she ever calls. That’s the only reason anyone ever calls me, to ask for something. It’s so deeply depressing when you reach that moment of realization that nobody actually cares about you. 

It’s really crazy how alone one person can feel in the world. So many people all around me and I feel like i’m completely invisible. Am I even really here? 

I guess if i’m feeling desperate enough I could go over to his place. That’s always an option. I’d only feel worse though. He never makes me feel better. The last time I talked to him I told him I was depressed and not feeling like my best self. He told me I was already depressed for months and asked when i’d get over it lmao.

My ex gf from high school was verbally abusive towards me, cheated on me behind my back and refused to ever have sex due to her religious beliefs and I respected that. Turns out after she dumped me, she fucked him thus I’m a 28 year old virgin who’s never even seen a woman naked and I feel left out that I’ve never had such a connection with anyone. She pretty much made me feel like I’m not worthy of anyone’s love

I just hate seeing all these couples in public holding hands, kissing and teasing with each other. Now for those of you who say I should try dating apps, don’t. I’ve tried Tinder, Bumble, Facebook Dating and OkCupid. Every time I matched, it was for a fake profile, causing me to think that if I was even worthy of love. After about four years on those apps, I gave up and deleted them. 

Every time Valentines Day comes around, I have to control my inner anger because everyone is talking about plans and each time I’m in public, I have to force myself to ignore advertisements or whenever I’m watching TV, I look at my phone and ignore it.

A few years later I had a crush on a girl in my school. After months of preparation I told her about my feelings. That was the biggest mistake I ever did in my life. She told me to cancel any contact with her and delete her contact everywhere (Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp etc.). But I still was desperate in love.

We have been working on it and have made good progress but we are not as happy and she is not as loving as she used to be. A guy was recently hired where she works and she became friends with him very easily more than her other coworkers. It has been about 2 months since they became friends and she hangs out with him all the time now. And they text every hour of the day, she is always talking to him. She is open to me about her relationship with him and has told me they just want to be friends and have very similar interests. It reminds me a lot of how she and I used to be when we met. And now  It has gotten to the point where everybody thinks of them as a couple at work. She used to spend all her time with me before. I know have a better job where I work 6 days a week and no longer have as much time to go out on dates or time to do things together because she is a student and part time worker, our schedules don't work together too well. Now most of the little time we are free at the same time, she spends with her new friend she met. I feel jealous of him because she is doing all the things that I have wanted to do with her recently with this new guy. Things like going to a nice restaurant we had been talking about going to for a while for the first time, or like I talked of going to the theater to watch a movie with her because I was really excited to watch it and she went to the movies to watch that movie with him instead, I feel like I am slowly being replaced and sad because I can't leave my new job either because we both depend on that money to be able to keep our apartment. I am also scared that she will end up falling in love with this guy that she is hanging out with all the time and likes so much, and I still love her the same way I did when I met her, I can tell she does not feel as strongly as she did then about me, she still says she loves me and we do things together when we can but I feel like she is losing that love for me. We recently moved in together 1 week ago and part of me really wants to to just let go of what i fear is happening and continue to try with her, but i can't help thinking about it over and over again and now i feel like she might be using me for money because she would not be able to live somewhere on her own with how much she is making from her job but she really needed to leave her mom because their relationship was not the best.

So I am left just feeling useless, like I am here for everyone else’s amusement. In England, especially where I’m from, there is hardly any Christians my age. People subtly take the piss about the fact I am a Christian. They say it’s a joke and of course I have to do a fake laugh. It’s just not funny though is it.

No one checks up on me, I am always the first to text. I don’t have a girlfriend nor am I anywhere near having one. I don’t have any major hobbies to keep me going in life. I don’t have any goals for my future other than to be happy, which I have no idea how I am going to manage.

I would say the only thing keeping me going is football, family and weed (which I regulate my usage of).

And typing that down is just so sad to me. But it’s true. 

I’m always questioning whether I’m enjoying my life. Sometimes, pretty much every time I’m high, the answer is yes, other times no. But the fact that I am constantly asking myself this just goes to show I am not content with my life.

About time you found me, I am a 24 year old torontonian bean. I love cooking and want to get into baking. I love horror movies and romcoms. I love long walks with ice caps and runs, writing, and reading, and listening to people talk about their passions. I love finding 'easter eggs' in people - when they tell me a seemingly insignificant story that i can connect back later to their present life. I love hearing people's stories, i love it when they give me the chance to invest in them. I love making people laugh, and helping them be better people - I think being the therapist puts me at ease because it takes the spotlight off of me, though recently I've become more comfortable venting.

People say I'm funny most of my humor is pretty dark, I write about cannibals and accidental murderers so my humor can sometimes edge into that territory, i consequently have a bunch of awkward uncomfortable stories where people have thought I'm serious when I'm not. Having to watch michael from the office feels like someone personally knew me and decided to make an attack on my character in the form of a sitcom. I promise to spend at least 80% of my time trying to make you laugh,
If you still need a better picture of me, I am really nerdy, i like harry potter, and marvel, and videogames, and there's a bunch of nerdy stuff i'm not into but I feel as if i have a duty to get into - llike dnd and boardgames.

The only real requirement i have is that you need to be a spammy, rambly person who can keep up a conversation. Sometimes I can lose interest if someone barely responds or is putting in minimal effort. I don't care what you look like, and you don't even need to give me your name until you're comfortable with it. I think it's just respect to be respectful in general.

During elementary school and middle school I was awkward and didn’t know to to talk to girls

High school I at least had some friends who were girls so that was progress.

During college I had a few girls who are friends and still do. Some hookups and fwb here and there but never a full relationship.

I think I always put my best foot forward and when I’m in the  “talking” stage and when I’m on a date. But for one reason or another a relationship never happens.

Maybe I’m a bit overbearing by texting everyday. I don’t double text or anything but I do say good morning and good night everyday. 

I talked to a friend (girl) and she said sometimes a girl just gets a bad feeling and at that point it’s over and it’s not that i did something wrong necessarily. That was helpful and made me feel a bit better. 

2 of my cousins got married recently and my sister just got engaged. I really am happy for them. And most of my friends have entered serious relationships. 

It just hurts to feel unwanted and not have any intimacy with someone. 
I used to pay for hookers just to cuddle with me(I know I’m a loser). 

I’m a short guy and introvert so I know I’m not a top pick. I know I need to work on my confidence. I think I just wanted to be loved for too long that I’m frustrated with myself when I see all this love around me.

Oh thanks wow I’m cured. I suddenly have a robust social group just like that. I feel like natural social butterflies/extroverts/“normal” people don’t realize how easy they have it making friends. And keeping friends.

I’m out of college and in a new town. It’s a small town. I wfh. The pandemic has shuttered many activities and potential meetup groups. There are very few meetups that aren’t “60+ singles meetups” in my area. I live alone. No family nearby. 

I have tried to make friends. I’ve met up with at least ten people since I moved to this tiny town a year ago. Here’s what happens. We meet up exactly once. I think it goes well. We do a simple chat over coffee sort of thing. They usually end out meet with “oh we should totally do this again sometime!!” 

And then they never contact me again. I’ll try to reach out with “hey do you want to do x y or z activity?” And get met with “oh haha sorry I’m so busy right now”. And then nothing. Even got Unfriended on snapchat right after our meetup. 

I keep trying to make friends. And it’s just not working. And there has to be something wrong with me. But I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. Beyond I’m kind of an eccentric artsy type person.

It was unlike any experience I have ever had in my life. Of course, most experiences are like that because you have not had them. They are a series of strung-out moments; some seem to build and bond eternal memories that we look back on to bring joy back to our lives and some bring about too much pain that it causes you to spiral downward. This was both. 

I was fortunate enough to meet the love of my life by accident. A whim of the universe if you will. We met at work and spent the night chatting. The conversations that we had were unlike any I had known or ever had with another. All I was ever told about her was that she was quiet, and I knew with my personality, that would not work. She came in as a replacement for someone who was supposed to be there that night. Then, I was awestruck at this green haired goddess. She spoke for the first time when I introduced myself nervously. Then she smiled. I will never forget that first smile. Things happened that night, changes in me that I could not explain if I tried. 

I found myself months later, several in fact, thinking about her from time to time. Not in any sense that you pass a woman on the street and find yourself curious about her life and beauty, but in the longing for a deeper connection. Passing by the place where she worked and wanting to stop in and say hello. I could not conjure the bravery. I would ask about her more than any person that I worked with from that company. Eventually I told an old co-worker to give her my number and have her call or text me because I knew I would never have the strength in me to do it myself. 

On the night I found out that my mother had Terminal cancer, stage 4 breast, I had been awake for over thirty hours and was just scrolling on my phone. I received a text message saying, “Hey, It’s Jett.” The following couple of days turned out to be paradise. Things I will never forget. I told her immediately about my circumstances and why I was so tired and rambling. I told her about my moms, and she said, “Seriously dude, if there is anything I can do- let me know.” She stated that she knew that people said that all the time, and yet somehow, I knew she meant it.

The longer im alone the more alien it feels to me. Seeing two people sit down and have a normal conversation looks bliss

I ride past a group of girls chanting on their way to a club as I sit I ride to my next delivery, I imagine myself with them, embarrassed as they want me to chant along and I do momentarily and then I smile. Only before realizing it's all in my head, I stop smiling and do the job 

I think about how I could've played the game differently for the 1000th time today. How I could've just focused on minimal subjects at school so I would've been able to do what I wanted in college instead of the course they picked for me, the people I would've met in film, photography and business class, the chance I would've went to uni, had a gf and went clubbing with people. 23 years old and not had a friend since I was 16, I feel drained and humanity further seems feel more alien as the days go by

That person you know has made your world turn upside down, and you hope that it was for their best. Because you'd care so much about them, that you'd obviously want your existence to be something that makes theirs at least more bearable, happier, 'better'.

3796,hgilbert_01,1633797065,1,"Right then…

**Some context**

- So, I have a bit of issue of resisting making my acquaintance with other boys/men or conversely being unreceptive to others reaching out to me, having been more accepting of girls/women or being more deliberative about reaching out to the opposite gender for connections, and my approach with that has not been without faults, I must admit.

- I believe my resistance to male acquaintances began somewhere in childhood, quite particularly as far as my father and brother are concerned - they are much more emotionally expressive and affectionate people as compared to my stoicism and personal bubble; there’s still a bit of resistance today.

- And then there’s the more typical matter of previous school experience in which I was the quiet “nerd” compared to the energetic, extroverted “jocks”, making me self-conscious about being “nice” because “niceness” in itself was more of a “feminine trait” (I don’t actually put stock into these stereotypes, thus my quotations, I mean to speak to the culture of my public school experience) - unfortunately, this has painted itself over desires to try and befriend guys who are more like me.

**More on school**

- Yeah, I was more recipient to making my acquaintance with girls/women and am even guilty of faulty efforts to connect with them, as if I have been projecting my greater reception towards my mother upon girls/women with the underlying thought they I would provide “gentler” friendships, even though I consciously know energetic/charismatic personality traits are not bound to gender.

- To this day, I think about an on/off friendship with sorts I had with a girl who actually understood me (and was likewise neurodivergent), but I started to like her as well… …more than a friend, but because of intense social anxiety and insecure feelings, I never initiated upon that crush.

- It shames me to say that my ending communication with her only ending recently (recently being bad, because ending those things was overdue), because romantic tension grew between us - it would’ve been an unhealthy and indulgent relationship as I became increasingly codependent on her by regularly sharing my woes and she started engaging in harmful practices/behaviors that would’ve made the relationship bad.

**Lingering thoughts**

- The painful thing is that I actually had a dream about her last night, the perpetual obsession over what could have been having ingrained itself in my mind; one of my deepest, and probably darkest desires to this day is that the idea of who she was to me would “repeat itself” in another individual to befriend - and hopefully keep it fucking platonic.

- Right now, I keep on convincing myself that I am okay as I am now without any platonic connections with people my age - and yes, that is very much true as I thoroughly enjoy and *need* extensive solitude - but the friendship I had with the girl and other lost acquaintances from school has left a bit of a hole in my mind.

- And as much of an asshole as it may make me, I do have a lot of boundaries when it comes to forming genuine friendships; I just wish the intimacy element wasn’t such an obstacle to comfortably sharing silence with someone - I yearn for the experience of being alone, together.

3804,SportsMajor,1633793254,1,"Two years ago, I finished my junior year of high school. Life was great: sports had some great moments to witness, I had some amazing and interesting classes, I was hanging out with my cousins A LOT (although not as much as the year before), and after three years of failure, I may have finally had someone share a mutual interest in me (I never hit them up though). 

At the same time though, there was something worsening over that past year: my social anxiety. I was always shy, but I was cool with most of the school. I had plenty of acquaintances and talked to them in school a lot. Outside of school, I made an effort to as well (through Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram). Although they weren't my friends, we had some great conversations. However, in 2019, talking to anyone outside of my school was difficult for me and I quit trying to. In person was not an issue though.

One year ago, I had just finished high school and started college. I was really looking forward for a fresh start in college as I truly thought I could fit in! One problem though: this is where my social anxiety really began to shine. The first semester I talked to no one and just went to class, did work in between classes, scrolled through social media, or headed home after class. The second semester I opted to go with four classes online, one in-person and I loved it that way. I really wish it could've stayed that way.

After that semester ended, I went through a lot of reflection which brought me to where I am now. I wanted to live happier, and I figured the best way to do that would be to change my diet and cut off social media. Both have worked, but cutting off most of social media has made me feel lonelier than ever. All I got is this Reddit and a very small Instagram page with less than 20 followers (I removed plenty over the years). Other than close family, all I got is myself.

These days, I don't recognize many people. The only people I recognize are my family, the few people in college I followed on social media before my first semester began, and the few people from high school I run into from time to time (and there's one I run into occasionally: the person that may have been interested in me two years ago. They still recognize me as well). 

It's crazy that within two years, I went from being really happy with the way things were going in life to becoming lonelier than ever. I do think things will get better eventually as I'm on the right path and am only 19, so that's good. I love life, I really do, but this loneliness frustrates me and there doesn't feel like an end to it and I hate it.",lonely,How quickly things can change...,2021-10-10 02:27:34

Even the few people I have attracted as friends or who have shown some lingering interest eventually distance themselves. As someone who is successful in their career, and not weird in their interests or habits -- I don't understand why others are not flocking to me like they do everyone else. Plus I put the men I date on a pedestal, I must seem so desperate.

I'm again at that point where I try too hard to connect to people and am trying to figure it out..

So I want to connect, right, but because I am getting more and more needy the more time I feel disconnected from people, I am trying too hard which can be sensed by others.

So, one solution I see is to try and hide the feeling and, you know, idly stay there and be the seamingly chill person and give the other person the space to connect and open up. Doesn't sound too healthy though.

Another way is to actually accept my feelings of loneliness and somehow be chill about it. Idk how to do that though..",lonely,Forcing those connections,2021-10-09 20:33:44

I was never close to my dad's side because all they care about is drama and talking shit on each other and I grew apart from my mom's side when I came out as pansexual as they are extremely homophobic, transphobic, etc.  I further grew apart from them when my mom passed away a little over 3 years ago. After that, I really only had my dad and sister (10 years older than me.) My mom was my best friend. She was who I always turned to. She was the one that comforted me when I was upset, hurt, etc. She had a lot of health issues and I always worried about her. So naturally my loneliness grew when I lost her. My dad and I had a fairly good relationship despite him being a little strict. We spoke every day and were pretty close. But I moved a year ago. As time went on we started talking less. Now, I'm lucky if I get a text from him once a week.

I was getting ready for bed and realized he hadn't responded to my text. I noticed he hadn't contacted me in a week. And it just sent me over the edge. I'm laying on bed crying. Because what did I do to be so lonely that my own father doesn't even want to talk to me? I don't have many friends. I only have one friend that i talk to regularly. And i guess that's why it's hitting me so hard. My sister is the only person that's bothered to check on me in the last week. Aside from my friend who I live with.

How is this guy supposed to gain experience if A) nobody gives him any. And B) crushes the guys confidence and tells him he's a loser because he isn't banging everything that moves. 

I was starting to feel optimistic about the future and decided to come up with a plan in hopes to get into dating and maybe even get a girlfriend. 

I was going to workout really hard and improve myself up until March/April time, get a new hair style, get some confidence and take a few pictures for some dating sites but what's the point?

So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships these days. 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude because of the pandemic. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with any depth beyond something like professional acquaintances. And, I'm too trapped by the weight of my obligations and commitments to do much about it. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'm not promising that it's even possible given how restrained I am these days. But, I'd like to try. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time and I'll try for it with what I have. I can at least promise that. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows.

No one else has to do this much, were they born meant for love while i wasnt? Each thing is so massive to tackle. It begins to make me feel massively inferior to anyone who is in a relationship because they must of done all this plus more and i cant. After nearly a decade, i am unable to. Ive gone beyond the point of improvement and just gone to hopelessness. I am not staring into the abyss but literally inside it as it fully engulfs me. I am unable to help myself or truly stop any of my behaviors no matter how badly i wish to because its so ingrained in my personality now. Ive been dealing with so much of this stuff since i was at least 14, and thats just recorded proof, more than likely its been going on so so much longer. I just had more hope because i was younger.

Afterschool was the first day of the meeting and I was excited, wanting a special one, but also wanting to know people there and maybe even become friends. At the cafeteria theres just a few boys talking looking at papers. I ask them if this was the singles club and they said yes and that they are currently waiting for others to arrive.

Some more people came by and a group of girls came by too. For now THEY were talking about ideas for activities and even laughing. The girls group said they only came for food.

I stood there waiting for an activity to start. Eventually I take a seat and wait longer. Then I notice nobody actually talked to me. Not even a greeting, just that one question at the beginning. Maybe I was hidden or forgotten? I start growing impatient and more annoyed as nothing has happened and everyone else is talking except me. I start talking to myself.

As I was talking to myself I felt miserable and left out. Hearing others talking and laughing made me sad. They have something I don't. Well, I do have friends, but I feel like I need more friends. Especially a lover. I don't know why I am so demanding of myself.

Half an hour has passed, most of the girls have left. Some boys left too. I continue to talk to myself feeling depressed. I start thinking about why I even came to this meeting.

She was just such a better person. Like a geniunely good person who deserves so much more than what I can give. The freaking newspaper wrote an article about how she helps kids for gods sake. Now shes with a guy who can give her a lot more than I can, and im happy for her. I just keep having dreams about her. I dont ask for that. I hate it. 

I like to watch youtube videos. I was in the military and have PTSD and anxiety. When I was a civilian overseas contracting a documentary came out and it was talked about at the job. ""bro you see someone get shot in the face"". People keep talking about how the documentary is crazy or whatever, and people recommended that I watch it since I was one of the only guys in there that was a combat vet of the same area the doc was shot in. I watched it. The guy who gets shot in the face is my friend. He was my fucking friend. You get to see his face as hes desperately clinging to life after getting shot in the head. Why was that even released? he was a kid, his mom could see that. Its been a while since i watched that shit ass ""documentary"", the quotation marks because its not even a documentary, its a cash grab by a combat camera kid who just did an edit of every terrible fucking thing he could record and isnt educational or informative in any way. I havent watched it in forever, maybe 2 years, but now in 2021 that kid is shilling his war porn on advertisements on youtube so I get to see it over and over. sometimes adblock doesnt work. 

Currently in a fight with the girl im ""talking to"". she said some very mean and hurtful things that I dont think can be resolved....and now Im scared to even watch fucking youtube to take my mind off of it.

I feel like I’ve ruined my relationship and all of our conversations are awkward. 

I feel like whenever I talk with friends that they just kinda tolerate me, except when it’s 1v1. Me and another. In those cases it’s usually just silence. 

And when it comes to meeting people I always feel like an awkward mess. I trip on my words and can barely keep a conversation going due to how little I actually invest time into todays pop culture stuff.

Multiple “friends” pulled the rug out from under me these last few years for looking for houses and I left my housing search to beginning of the semester. I asked my one friend I have in this city to look at a place for me as I live far away and can’t check places out. She did but the housing folk fell through and nothing ended up happening. After a few more weeks and a few more dead-ends I decided I’d come up myself for a few days and look at places. I asked this same friend if i could crash on their couch. I didn’t get a response for days and decided to book a hotel room. They responded as I got on the Amtrak and said it would be an awkward situation because her roommates boyfriends were over and I said it was fine and that we should get dinner while I’m in town cause she did me that favour of checking the place out earlier that month.  Nothing like a date, she knows better, just me returning a favour.

Well I’m back now in my hometown. Still no response. I’m tired of people “not seeing messages” or “responding to it in their heads”, I know better and its bullshit. I’ve had three friends total over my three years of collage and they all do this shit. It’s good for a month or two and then they just stop responding. I spent my money on three days in a hotel and it all could’ve been avoided if I just HAD FRIENDS.

I am now around 20ish and about to graduate with a job lined up. I am generally a positive person. But every now and then loneliness hits me hard. I have people around me that I know love me. I have friends that I share interest with and can talk to. But even then I feel lonely. Whenever I try to open up about these issues, whether it be to friends, family, or therapist, I cannot. It feels like my skin is being peeled off my body.

I am just frustrated that for as long as I have known about this issue I have been unsuccessful in addressing it. I do not feel close to anyone.

I just want advice. I want to change. I just don’t want to wake up one day in another 10 years and realize that I could have done something or I had been selfish and if only been more thoughtful and considerate I could have solved the whole loneliness issue.

3920,Ursiwave,1633731765,1,", my first time posting here. So I decided to put my birthday on Facebook be hidden so the birthday notification won't pop up for other people (I know it's all fake when they greet me there anyways) and once I did this I knew immediately there wouldn't be a lot of people that would say happy birthday to me and that came to life I guess. My birthday was on September 20 so a couple weeks have passed and I think only five people greeted me that day, one knew about my birthday and messaged me and the other four are my online friends and two of them didn't even know lmao we been talking for years (they still cool though, at least they greeted me through message). I wanted to do that because social media is all about fake happiness (for me), How are you gonna tell happy birthday to me if you're gonna scroll down and forget about it later? Are you really a friend or are you just keeping me for your own self interest? You remember me when you need something but ignore me when I'm not of use to you, how convenient for you. 

I treated that day as any normal day since I knew that the moment I become optimistic/hopeful that I'll get greetings I'll be disappointed. Last time it happened on graduation day as well about half a year ago I think, I became hopeful and I wanted to get some congratulations on my friends but I didn't receive anything, what the heck.

Idk if this sounds like an a-hole thing to do and of course it's my fault I wouldn't receive a lot of greetings but in my eyes it shows that no one really cares about you unless a notification pops up so now you had to say something fake as heck and act like you didn't ghost your friend for a few months or years.",lonely,My plan sadly worked,2021-10-09 09:22:45
3921,Glass_Ant_3220,1633731730,1,"\[mod approved\] I'm reaching out to communities of people who may be experiencing feelings of depression and/or anxiety and who might be interested in participating in a brief, online, self-guided intervention. This study (detailed below) examines an intervention adapted from a lengthier treatment shown to effectively reduce symptoms of a range of anxiety and depressive disorders. Feel free to share with anyone in need.

\----------------------

For my doctoral dissertation, I am examining two brief online self-help interventions to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. **Anyone over the age of 18, residing in the United States, and fluent in English is welcome to participate in this online study**; however, if you are currently experiencing severe depression, especially if you are feeling hopeless or having thoughts of suicide, I encourage you to seek treatment with a provider you can interact with.

If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a few surveys and then you will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a video intervention, a text-based intervention, or an assessment-only group. The intervention should take you roughly 2 hours depending on how often you pause the video or how quickly you read. No matter which group you are in you will be asked to complete surveys at four follow-up periods after you first sign up, around 2, 4, and 6 weeks, with a final one in 6 months. These will take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. **After the 6 week follow-up**, those in the assessment-only group will have access to both the video and text interventions. **After the 6-month follow-up**, those in the intervention groups will have access to whichever intervention they did not already have. All participants will be able to use these interventions until December of 2022. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Central Michigan University. IRB protocol #: 2021-238

I'm an 18yo guy, I have a good family (two parents, one brother and one sister), a LOT of friends (real ones, but people who always help me if I ask for something), but when I am alone during my daily routine I feel so fucking lonely.

I started university's lessons a week ago, met many new people and made some new friends, but nothing can fill the sense of emptiness I feel inside me every time I'm alone.

I don't even think about it until I'm alone, so most of the time I try to distract myself hanging out with other people or doing something that makes me not think about this (playing videogames, reading, watching a movie...), but sometimes I cannot do it and I start remembering that I am completely alone and that nobody really cares about me, not even my family. The only people who cared now are dead or too far to meet them.

I feel like I never really got included in any group (my family doesn't really accept me because I'm slightly different than their expectations, my friends because I don't like football and talking about bullshit as much as they do)

I'm here drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette to occupy my time until it's time to go to bed, and then tomorrow, the day after and after...

I'm looking for any advice from someone who felt like that and now feels better, but any suggestions is good I think, I need help but I'm not strong enough to talk to somebody I know about this (also because I don't trust anyone that much and because I don't feel confident talking about this face to face with other people).

I first want to say and offer encouragement to those who are really struggling out there. my experiences with loneliness have severed with the progression of my drug addiction. obviously, i now realize now that i am sober, that people don’t want to hang out with people who smoke meth and opiates off tin foil. i had no friends and talked to no one, and never left my bedroom, unless it was to get drugs or go to work so i could feed my habit. i was severely depressed and didn’t love myself, so it was impossible to sit with myself sober. drugs became my company. 

but anyways, still today i’m not fully capable of loving myself. i’ve made improvement. i got on tinder and bumble, i’ve had several dates and have even had the opportunity to have sex, which was a huge milestone from where i was a year ago. BUT, i feel like i’m using people as a distraction from myself. the thought of being by myself makes me sad, and the thought of coming home tonight without any plans after work also makes me sad. it is so hard to sit with myself, that sometimes i find myself desperately scratching at whoever i can that i can get to do something with me, almost like i’m some desperate cat clinging onto fabric for dear life. 

I know this may not be the best place to ask this question since many of you probably feel the exact same way and have no idea on how to break through into the shattering sunlight of happiness, but: how do you feel okay when you are alone? how do you take a friday night with no plans and turn it into something that isn’t depressing? again,  i know this may not be the best place for this question, but i had no idea which other subreddits to ask. thank you and i bid you all the strength to hang in there!!!",lonely,Coming to terms with not being able to hang out with people all the time,2021-10-09 06:44:10

I don't think I ever really felt like my peers understood me, and even around friends I have always felt isolated. As though everyone else can form these connections but I am alone in my head. It has been that way for as long as I can remember. I have since been intimate both emotionally and physically with others, but I still to this day feel isolated, on my own little thought island. I like my island, it is lush and vibrant and full of amazing fantasies and ideas. It only has one drawback...it is so lonely here. I am 25 now and I still feel as though no one really understands me. This used to be okay because I was ambitious and intelligent, I could outshine others so being understood didnt matter, I waw effective. But I feel my mind slipping more the older I get. I make silly mistakes at work and fall into bad habbits. Ambition has given way to complacency. My self esteem is lower than it has ever been and I find myself self concious about every little movement or action I make. I have just about given up on others being able to truly connect with me and I am no longer at the top of my game performance wise.

3970,THE-SILVER-SERPENT,1633710092,1,"Ok so I am in my 20’s and I have never had an actual romantic relationship.

No bigee it’s fairly normal at my age.

But my experiences have highlighted things about my myself I didn’t realize as well learn valuable lessons about engaging with other people.

A key part to this is emotional trauma I have had (to keep the story short, my mom stabbed me in the back after she got divorced and loved a random guy she met over me causing me to have to leave my house and live with my dad)

During that time I made my first female friend (I am born male but genderfluid she is still confused with her identity.)

She opened me up emotionally and from that point forward I was never the same and became more and more neurotic, leading to suicide ideation, random fits of driving around in attempts to escape stressful situations, self harm thoughts and other problems of which she helped support me through the darkest pits of depression.

She’s my best friend and I confessed romantic feelings to her some years back thought she didn’t feel that way. We are still close friends and we are open and honest with each other even admitting jealousy whenever she would have a girlfriend or be interested in a guy yet not being ready to start anything.

I knew that just because she had good relationships with others didn’t mean it harmed our relationship but even so I still had attachment issues due to my own mom throwing me to the wayside.

I’ve had a lot of mental health issues and periodically still have these dark fantasies with people I know of doing violent and sadistic acts, having people fear for myself as I self mutilate or inflict pain upon them.

I also got with a genderfluid coworker that went by she/her and she was neurodivergent like me and we clicked very well almost scarily well. 

I only got to hang out with her outside of work twice before she left the state we were in due to getting a free house from her grandmother and wanting to start anew in life.

I wasn’t able to maintain contact with her but with the little time we did meet and text each other we were very close and she gave me new confidence in myself because she was the one who wanted to be with me though she was not looking for romance due to trauma she suffered from abusive assholes. She also had problems with BPD and ADHD. I loved her and she was really interested in me.

At this point I know I am an ambivert but I am worried about my fits of mental illness and fantasies that cloud how I look at myself. I know that I am a person a lot of people tend to like but I worry that if I become too emotionally attached to others they will leave me and forget I even exist throwing me into a spiral of mental escapism and fantasy. I can function normally in my life but I still suffer from these emotional issues. Ik that I will find someone who loved me that way but I am afraid to fuck it up due to my trauma and creeping mental problems. I also suffer from chronic existential struggle with my life.

I wanted to get some perspective from other people on if they experience similar things or if they want to ask more specific details in my case.

Now it's october and i'm laying in my bed holding back my tears. I feel like i've improved so much as a person. I've managed to discover who i am really and what should i change. I've never had a proper relationship. My ex gf dumped me after 4 days. That was in november. In march we started to talk again and we played the same game again. That was the point when i've decided that i wanna change. I felt so stupid, and naive, but i've wanted to change that. But what happened was that i've started a bunch of shit which i've didn't finished. At summer i felt even worse, and i spent the whole summer break laying in my bed and trying to sleep as much as i can just to break up with reality. I've played a lot video games like 10-12 hours a day, and i felt worse by every day passing. When school started i've decided to leave all my insecurities behind and be as social as i can. Turned out i can't find anyone who i can really connect with as a friend. I had only one friend and i've shared everything with her. But in the past couple weeks i've noticed that if i don't aproach her, she don't approach me neither. And the worst feeling was seeing that the only person who considered me as her best friend (i'm an heavy introvert and she's extrovert btw) get along with others much better. I've tried out if i don't talk with her will she gonna talk with me. We haven't talked since 2 weeks... Now i have nobody to talk to and i spend my days in my room wanting to run off somewhere far away and start everything again. My parents always argue about something and there is always tension between them, which doesn't help at all. I'm missing out so much, but nobody invites me anywhere, i would really like to go out somewhere, but i don't have anywhere to go. I'm wasting my best years and i know that i'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I really want to be that rocker guy with his guitar who is loved by everyone and always goes out somewhere, but since i'm an introvert my social battery is a piece of crap and i can't even keep up a conversation with someone. I literally don't have anything to say. I know that i havea great personality and i have higher iq and eq than the avarage. I'm emotional as a guy and i cry very easily but i don't think that this is a bad thing. I feel a bit better now that i can write down everything that i feel, but i don't know what should i do with myself. Others see me as a cold and a logical guy who lives in his own world and doesn't need anyone to be happy, meanwhile i could die for a hug. I'm not an attractive guy i don't get any attention from girls. I'm skinny and tall which don't go along really well. I can't find any hairstyle that suits me and since i've got glasses i look kinda gay with that and my hair and i hate that. (I don't have any problems with gay people that's not the point)That takes away so much from my confidence. I hate to look at myself. Now i'l start everything again. I'l start by customizing my room so i can feel much more comfortable at home. After that i'm gonna change my looks. I try out a new hair, glasses and i change my clothes cuz they look kinda boring. After that i'l start to make efforts to improve my communication and i'm gonna find people who i can really connect with don't matter how introvert i am. It's just so hard.

I’m pretty sure their point was that there is no such thing as a perfect person. But I came to realize that in a relationship, she would make me better, but I would make her worse. It shouldn’t be that way. 

I have horrible, awful attachment issues. I’m terrified of being abandoned and get separation anxiety. I am *so* much better than I used to be, but my neediness and clinginess showed through a few too many times, and she put up a wall. She said she couldn’t be my therapist, and that she didn’t want a relationship with someone who needed attention like I did. 

So I just told her it was better to stop things. From her perspective it seemed like I was just rolling my eyes, saying “well fine then” to her putting up those walls. I wouldn’t say it like that. It was just that when she *did* put up those walls, everything came it to perspective. 

I knew I couldn’t trust myself to be a good boyfriend. She clearly deserved better than me. And the fact that walls *were* being put up just wasn’t a good sign for the relationship as a whole I thought. So I just…ended it. 

It’s eaten me up. She thinks I just bailed because I hate for not putting out or something. And that’s not the case. But I still don’t know if I was 100% right to do what I did. I’ve been so miserable the past few days because I lost someone who really cared about me and really understood me in a way most people don’t. I hate myself and what I do.

4008,BeautifulSoul9999,1633681187,1,"I am alone with my thoughts. No one wants to hear them and if they do, they wouldn't understand. It's too much to convey at once anyways. Empathy and compassion are nice things and I am glad it exists in the world no matter how insignificant it all may seem. This is me sharing.

My friends and family are all gone for one reason or another; differences in opinion these days or a result of my own isolation. I act like I have agoraphobia, but that would be a misunderstanding. All it would take would be one person to get me out of the house; but the truth after all the years alone is that no one wants to or would like to. They might say they do, but do not want to. One might even want to, but not want to spend the time or effort. I justify this in others as I would myself; I will just be alone again when they are gone or are tired of me.

I get that everyone has their own lives to live. Everybody has something. I have one person I talk to that offers me empathy and compassion that I can count on. They are all that I have left. If or when I should lose them my life will change. I will have utterly no one. 

I wished I had known this was going to happen when I was younger because I would have prepared. The more I feel pushed away; the more I push myself away. The more I feel unwanted; the more unwanted I make myself feel. I have made life choices to ensure I never bother anyone or I never feel like I need someone. I basically made it so I almost never have to meet a soul to hurt or be hurt by.

It started a long time ago. All my friends and family got married, careers, etc... and I just got pushed away; no one has time for any of it. So I got a job at night and moved very far away from them all to a beautiful place that is isolated. It worked great. Family and friends were always happy to see me visit like once a year for a very short while. What I did not realize is that by doing that I had become estranged. They see and maybe feel that disconnection that we or I created. It is awkward at the very least.

I confirm to myself every time I try to contact or visit friends and family for that short while once or twice a year that I just stress everyone out. They talk about how they will have to rearrange their schedule to make time, they may have to place some condition or just a general expression of some sort of stress about my visit. I take this very hard. I don't want to be a stress or bother so I do the very bare minimum and of course, this backfires into a mess during and after the visit because of how short we all made it.

I have put myself in a very safe place away from any harm, in my own self-isolation for many many years. It's not getting any better though. It will get worse enough I am afraid to isolate myself even further. I have thoughts of selling everything here and moving even further away to a place even more beautiful without any people at all. And in some weird way, justify my existence by allowing nature to take me if it won't let me survive.

4018,Contrary_Pariah14,1633676561,1,"\[24/M\] 

Many of us may be very lonely-- especially given the isolation many of us have had to deal with over the past while. I feel it's healthier to view it as an opportunity for self-improvement and to be kind to oneself.

I don't want to go on about my own life story here, but I will say that while certain circumstances have led to me being single-- and lonely for other reasons-- perpetually, I'd rather try to get some good out of my time in this state. 

I'm trying to get fit, I'm engaging with my hobbies, and I'm being kind to myself. (Occasional treats, gifts, etc. every once in a while).

If I **really** need it and am in the depths of despair, I put on some music I like and write a journal entry. It helps me to calm down, and sometimes rethink things or learn about myself.

Believe me, I'd like to introduce myself to the sub, but that would take to long. Being a ""good writer""-- apparently-- means that I tend to go on for ages. Having done most of a philosophy degree, I also therefore tend to go on for ages and try to revisit points. E.g. everything I write, even if it's casual, comes out like I'm trying to write an airtight philosophical essay. Haha.

I just can't switch that off, so if I'm meant to write about my circumstances relevant ot my lonliness, it'd be a long-ish post. To be sure.

But that's me, and I'm sure many are the same way. No doubt.

\-----I'll try to sum up:

\-Never been employed.

\-Never been in a relationship. Three dating site accounts; no luck. I never hear back.

\-Live at home.

\-Anxious, chronically, severely depressed, **really bad** agoraphobia for all of my adult life thus far.

\-Only child.

\-Two friends but barely see or talk to them-- even in the ""Before Times"".

\-Having to drop out of school the end of this semester for personal reasons-- even though I'm **so close** to getting my degree.

\-----Positive points:

\-Aspiring musician; getting quite good with keyboard, still learning guitar, and would like to learn violin. (Have one but can't play it for reasons). I have a Soundcloud and am building a professional presence online.

\-I write poetry and occasionally I write philosophical things for fun... Would like to write short stories eventually.

\-I love my music, so I more-or-less collect it. I have about 80+ CDs now! (Not sure about a few of 'em, though..)

\-I try to get in my workout every day; I can do 115 push-ups now, for example.

\-I like cleaning and cooking.

That's all for now. It's frustrating that I'm so alone, but I have all these other things I'm \*trying\* to do with my life that some days I don't really notice. It's bad for the mental health to dwell upon that. To want something which is out of one's control. Learning to not care-- to ""zen out""-- or to accept it and be proactive with an acceptable solution-- the real meaning of stoicism-- is kind of how I approach it.

Being interested in romance stuff and gothic stuff, though, I admit I \*do\* get melodramatic like either Angel or Dracula over my lack of a partner. Haha.

That's me for now, however.

4024,projectnaixad,1633673451,1,"I left her in another state after getting back together to try and fix our 5 1/2 year relationship because I needed to make sure my parents wouldn't lose their minds, but because I thought I no longer had any idea of the concept to what this commitment entailed. I knew I would be lonely returning to my parent's house, but it isn't the same after you try to make a future with someone. There are plenty of friends here, but it seems no one wants to try and make new connections so I feel like no one is available for certain desires, except her.
She would immediately take me back in a heartbeat, but that same beat breaks my own heart because I would not take her back because of our history. I knew what I was getting into when I decided to drive across the U.S. to start a new life with her 6 years ago, but I never imagined meeting another man she had previous relations with to approve letting her have sex with him when I was too busy with work to satisfy her. I recently realized it's still a fresh wound regardless that it was 3 years ago because I set one rule: not in our bed. She broke that rule almost a month after my approval. I immediately cut her off.
I don't really understand at that time why I didn't just retreat to my parent's home, but now I do. When one person is guaranteeing their unwavering love for the rest of their life it is difficult to be on the receiving end especially given the circumstances. It's hard to not look at where I am now and imagine what I could have being with her again.

We instantly became best friends, and since we lived half a mile away from each other, practically every weekend for years was filled with visits to the others house. In middle school I didn't have many friends, I didn't fit in anywhere. As a result, I followed around Joe and his friends for a few years. Joe hung out with the other ""popular"" kids, who I didn't click with, but I always clicked with Joe, and Joe always treated me well. Going into 8th grade, the last year before high school, I started to click with some people, and I had a small friend group for the first time ever between Joe and a few others. Now, being that these people were the ""popular"" kids, they started smoking and doing drugs around this time. I have no care for trying that, but my mindset is that as long as people treat me/others nicely, I don't mind if you smoke. Then came freshman year, where I met a decent amount of new friends from different schools in my classes, and it was awesome. For the first time ever I felt like people cared about me, and I cared about a lot of my friends. However, Covid would cut my freshman year short, leading to online school. For my sophomore year, the school district gave each student the option to either continue virtual instruction, or we could switch to in person. Many people, including a lot of my friends, switched to in person, but I stayed virtual. This meant that I went an entire year without seeing anyone else from school, and if you think about it, it was actually around a year and a half.

and the salt on the wound is knowing there’s nothing you can do about it - you cannot force feelings that aren’t there, you just have to accept that they don’t feel the same anymore and move on, which is difficult in its own right especially if you think about what it was like when they were interested and dating you, or even interested in general.

Not once, but 5 times, all of them. Mind you I'd try to back off at that point if we're still together, but then it turns into ""I don't think I'm the person for you, or I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" either which every time.

This last time it was my ex randomly telling me over a year and a half after us breaking up that yesterday, because he woke up to 4 messages from me (1 news article, 2 memes and one was just asking what almond milk he buys) that it was overwhelming for him, and of course it brought up all this past defeat, and burned me worse than before because I thought he was THE ONE who would never say it.

He said it. I'm 5/5 at this point. What am I doing so wrong? One second it's why do you message me so much, I go quiet ""What's wrong? Somethings off?""

I can't win, and it's normal to send content/memes where you find it no? (INSTA, Twitter, Facebook, snap, etc.. so that's why it was 4 seperate over the span of """"2 hours"" he quoted.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like partying all night, but not the parties most people have, for me a party would be music, karaoke, some board games and maybe some games on retro Pie, nice food and some fruit juices, all night long, maybe go out to see the sunrise at a high places that feels special.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like board games, table top rpgs, poetry and much more!

&amp;#x200B;

\-I speak English, Spanish and Italian.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I don't like dark humor, or videos where people get hurt, or stuff like that, I don't like people suffering.

\-I have depression and a couple more mental illnesses.

4093,codecrunchie,1633631054,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

So lets start: when I got into university I used to live in a dorm alone. Used to eat alone in the cafeteria and I remember one day I cut my hand very badly and had to have it converted.

I would eat with a painful hand while listening to music and completely alone. No people to the right, none to the left nor front nor back, in a room filled with hundreds I was alone.

I would smoke alone, drink alone, give presentations without partners.

Never in my 3 years did I ever get approached, but I also I'll admit I never wanted to be approached so I probably gave out those vibes.

I was top of my class and the presentations used to go well, just ne giving a 2 hour presentation while other required 2-3 people within a group to keep up.

2 years ago, I thought that the reason no one likes me must be because I was fat, so I hit the gym and went down from being about 95kilograms to being 77kilograms at the time of writing this. Even though, now I ain't fat, nothing has kinda changed.

I dunno what is wrong with me and I'm in the middle of thinking about what is wrong with me. I am a bit awkward in public and at times clumsy which lays off a bad impression and I'm trying to change it, but IDK I dont see much progress in that sector.

4118,futurebipolardoctor,1633621110,1,"Leave at door delivery. Emails instead of phone calls. Zoom sessions for in-person meetings. Running errands hidden in the darkness of the night. 

Every single day, I convince myself that I’ve got the perfect life, removed from the unreasonably demanding social world. I’m so sure that I boast about my comfort with being alone to family, friends and acquaintances. Regularly, I scoff at the thought of feeling loneliness when I have enough going on in school, at work and with friends.

And yet, there is at least one night a week that I tidy up my apartment two hours earlier than usual, turn off all the lights, curl into a ball under my thickest blankets and suffer in the existential loneliness that threatens to shatter my psyche. 

Why? 

Why would I be lonely when I feel like I can barely keep up with the social demands of friends, family and work?

How? 

How could I be lonely when my social battery drains to 5% by the end of the first hour of the day?

No matter how many times I ask myself those questions, I fail to come up with the correct answer. It doesn’t make sense, and I feel like I’m trapped on a high-speed rollercoaster with no emergency stop button in sight. 

Minutes pass and pretty soon, I succumb to that powerlessness. I ache and yearn for a closeness that feels all too unattainable, for the detached intimacy within the uncomplicated and undemanding relationships conjured up in my imagination.

I suffer until the acuteness of the pain begins to fade, and I drift back into the soothing sensation of my sheets. The anxiety relents, and my mind slips back into the safety of my comfort zone. Just like the time before, there is no deviation from the routine. I plug in my phone, rest my head on my pillow and convince myself that it is just a passing paranoia. 

The next day, I laugh and shake my head, reading the sloppily written note I left myself before deleting and dismissing its contents as nothing more than the ramblings of the madman living inside my head. 

I will laugh until the next night when I close my eyes and find myself once again caught in a cyclical ritual that feels more perpetual than the orbit of the planets.",lonely,"I lie to everyone, including myself, about being okay with being alone",2021-10-08 02:38:30

I haven't made a new friend in a good while, and I miss being &amp; having one more than there's words.

Some backstory, I guess; spent 5+ years traveling the US for work with my incredible wife, but was forced home at the start of this year by COVID and my own degrading mental health. Didn't really want to come back, but psyched myself up for the return thinking about all my friends here and the good times we'd have ahead.

Fast forward ten months and virtually all of those friends have proven my worst fears from the road a reality in some way or another. Turns out ""out of sight, out of mind"" can so pervade a relationship that even once the other person is square in front of your face again they either can't or won't see you anymore. That hardly sums up the ways in which some of those people have hurt me this year, but it's the gist.

Tack on my psych of many years prior my cross country days retiring the week before I got back &amp; six major deaths of varying origin across every facet of my adult life in the last 15 months and I am...fragile, these days, to put it lightly.

But, it just always feels like a one way street. The second I stop initiating, it’s crickets on their end. And every time I make new friends, they’ll tell me that they’ll be different, but then they do the exact same thing.

And even when I put in the effort, it’s still minimal on their end. Every time, it’s always “sorry can’t talk I’m busy with school or work” and then next time you talk to them, they tell you about all the fun stuff they did when they said they were “busy at work or school”.

I’ve been actively not initiating conversations for a while because sometimes it makes me feel more in control of my loneliness, but it’s also just so depressing how few conversations I have because of it. In this last stretch of doing this, I’ve had three people “initiate” a conversation: one to flex their new computer, one to flex the hockey game they were at, and the other to ask me a question about a committee we were in a few years ago.

Every single day, I convince myself that I’ve got the perfect life, removed from the unreasonably demanding social world. I’m so sure that I boast about my comfort with being alone to family, friends and acquaintances. Regularly, I scoff at the thought of feeling loneliness when I have enough going on in school, at work and with friends.

And yet, there is at least one night a week that I tidy up my apartment two hours earlier than usual, turn off all the lights, curl into a ball under my thickest blankets and suffer in the existential loneliness that threatens to shatter my psyche. 

Why? 

Why would I be lonely when I feel like I can barely keep up with the social demands of friends, family and work?

How? 

How could I be lonely when my social battery drains to 5% by the end of the first hour of the day?

No matter how many times I ask myself those questions, I fail to come up with the correct answer. It doesn’t make sense, and I feel like I’m trapped on a high-speed rollercoaster with no emergency stop button in sight. 

Minutes pass and pretty soon, I succumb to that powerlessness. I ache and yearn for a closeness that feels all too unattainable, for the detached intimacy within the uncomplicated and undemanding relationships conjured up in my imagination.

I suffer until the acuteness of the pain begins to fade, and I drift back into the soothing sensation of my sheets. The anxiety relents, and my mind slips back into the safety of my comfort zone. Just like the time before, there is no deviation from the routine. I plug in my phone, rest my head on my pillow and convince myself that it is just a passing paranoia. 

The next day, I laugh and shake my head, reading the sloppily written note I left myself before deleting and dismissing its contents as nothing more than the ramblings of the madman living inside my head.

4162,tratrae,1633592116,1,"Hi I’m really sad. I like a girl and I know 100% she doesn’t like me back. I’ve liked her for 3 years now knowing fully well she won’t reciprocate. Now she’s distancing herself and I can sense she’s getting tired of me and doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I can’t bring myself to accept that she doesn’t like me back because I can’t handle another rejection. Every time I force myself to stop thinking about her and start to accept that she won’t like me I get profoundly sad. I can handle it for a few days and might be in a good mood knowing I won’t be chasing after  her anymore. But as the days pass I get sadder and sadder until I break down and start hurting all over. It’s like my brain and my body shut down and I stop doing things and functioning. I stay in bed all day and I over eat until I have to forget about the rejection, and convince myself that I still have a chance with her. That’s the only way I can get up from bed and get my life going again.

I’ve dealt with rejection my entire life, I got bullied since I was 8, all through middle school, and a bit into high school. I’m in 2nd year of University and things got better but I’m tired. My heart is tired and my soul is tired and I can’t handle another person rejecting me. The last girl that I liked to this level rejected me really bad. I confessed to her and she never said another word to me. I didn’t approach her after the confession at all but she still avoided me like the plague. She would just turn around and walk away if we were in the same space, she wouldn’t make eye contact with me, and it was like she couldn’t handle breathing the same air as me.

Long story short she ended up blocking me on all social media and I never heard from her again. Like I said things got better lately, I cleaned up my appearance and I don’t think I look that bad anymore, I lost some weight, I shower everyday (I didn’t before because I was severely depressed), I bought nicer clothes, I’m not hot or anything but I look clean and cute.

It took me so much effort to do all that, to get that little bit of confidence, but the fact that I’m the same position again makes me feel like it wasn’t enough and that I’m still faulty somehow. 

I know it’s a stupid thing to get depressed about, because relationships aren’t everything and I probably don’t even need one right now. But it’s just the rejection that hurts me, and that I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone. Or like romance just wasn’t made for me.

I’ve tried to forget about her and crushes in general but I don’t have anything else that makes me happier than that. She’s the most beautiful thing in the world to me and if she’s out of my life I feel like I won’t have anything good in my life anymore. Everything else looks so ugly and horrible. I can’t find anything else that brings me the same amount of joy. I’m so sad and I’m tired of pretending like I’m not. I’m so sad and it hurts so much. I just want to feel special too.

TL;DR I’m 19 years old, I’ve dealt with rejection all my life. I got bullied, rejected by every girl I’ve ever liked, and I can’t find joy in anything else. Now I’m getting rejected again and I can’t accept it, it hurts too much and I don’t know if I can live like this anymore.",lonely,I can’t handle another rejection,2021-10-07 18:35:16

4169,Mindless_Drawer_3419,1633588489,1,"So, I (17 M) have been practically in lockdown since COVID started spreading worldwide. My family has become very cautious literally with everything and we stay home most of the time. Basically, the only ones that go out are my parents but just if it is extremely necessary. In my own case I’ve gone out less than 10 times maybe (even though I’m already vaccinated, as well as my entire family).

Sometimes I really do feel confused about myself and how I am holding up. After COVID started, my school went online and continued like that for a year, I also went from middle school to high school in this time frame. I just started a new school year two months ago and my school decided to implement a hybrid class system. My family chose online, as well as the majority of other students. However, more people have started to choose going to school (at my school you can decide whether if you are taking online or not each month). Additionally, during the last year or so I have made myself very perfectionist and I must admit I put a lot more effort when it comes to be about school, so it turns into effort and time consuming. Sometimes I have even thought this is my way of coping with the circumstances, and that subconsciously I want to be busy doing something to keep myself away of “reality”.

Also, I haven’t been able to see any of my friends in “real-life” for almost a year and a half, which sometimes makes me feel somewhat lonely and a bit sad. There is also this girl I like a lot, and I think I could even like her. Unfortunately, she moved to a different country than mine, but she may return in a couple of months. The bad thing is that I may not even see her. As mentioned previously my parents are kinda overprotective (of course I really appreciate them caring for my health and well-being), so it is very unlikely that they will let me see basically anyone. There have been lots of occasions in which friends have invited me to hangout and do something, and I really do want to go out with them but I know that my parents will just say no and it is very frustrating. For example, on one occasion one of my closest friends went to study abroad and there was this farewell-party I was invited to, and while mostly everyone was already vaccinated I wasn’t able to attend. 

So, this has been very frustrating for myself and I really feel very lonely deep inside. I’m not the type of person that expresses true feelings frequently and I’m not that emotional as well. Still, I feel desperate, unmotivated and I feel like my life has turned into a boring and monotonous routine(in a sense it has definitely turned like this). I’m afraid that I’ll be having the same reality during 2022. I have 1.5 high school years left and I’m also really afraid I missed out/will miss out all this period of my life.

4184,black-oasis,1633574878,3,"It's me again from yesterday and a few days before. I spoke to my father today over text and he could tell I was deeply unhappy here and becoming increasingly isolated. He agreed to let me begin the transfer process to another university closer to home and in a smaller town, as long as I made it through this quarter with decent grades. I am excited at the prospect of leaving this place.

I'm aware this is the pussy way out, but I don't really care about it, honestly. People in LA come and go like a revolving door. I got off the phone with my 3 best friends from home today and began to cry because I realized I will never find anyone who loves and cares about me here like they do. Here most friendships are superficial and very surface level, and people here do not understand my energy like my friends from home do. I'd rather study somewhere else. My parents think suffering builds character development but I don't think that that is fair. They've always treated me this way, not getting me therapy after my self harm episodes back in middle school due to bullying, and making me ""tough it out"". I shouldn't always have to suffer to learn another lesson about the cruelty of life. I already understand it plenty. If I have an opportunity out of here, I will take it happily.

I went to a club meeting for my last commitment today to quit. The members were supportive and I am grateful. My new guitar amp arrives soon and I am excited to get back into playing my guitar. I am swamped with schoolwork but I'm trying to get caught up. 

And I also found out yesterday randomly in the middle of class that I can't live alone in a double anymore and that I'll be receiving a random roommate. She moves in Friday. I hope I'll be able to fall asleep at night because I'm a light sleeper and it's hard when someone else is in the room. I'll probably go back to insomnia and just downing melatonin it will put me to sleep.

I am numb to it all. I hope to quickly learn to turn off my emotions and function like a robot essentially, just getting my tasks done with indifference. If I don't learn to, I'll be forced to pretty fast. I just wish someone would hold me at night and tell me it's going to be alright.

So what if we made a Discord server where people have a weekday role (like ""Tuesday"" or something) and it's the responsibility of that smaller group of Tuesday people to keep the chat active on Tuesdays?

They would keep in mind on their weekday to try:

* tagging new people and saying hello
* trying to include people who don't know how to join in the conversation
* meeting new people they haven't talked to themselves
* interacting in both text and voice channels if they're up for voice chatting but that's not required if they're not comfortable
* maybe people could even host some events if they're feeling up to the bonus challenge, like a Jackbox game night or something
* and if they see a fellow weekday member not interacting, checking up on them to see if they're alright

This would be like their dedicated ""alright, let's get up and interact and make an effort!"" day, and then they'd be able to let others take over on other days.

This is probably a better idea with only a few people per weekday, so once people got comfortable with the server and feel like they don't need that extra responsibility motivation, they can step down from having a weekday and just be a general member. :)

My friend has been acting weird lately and it really stressed me out cos she’s all I have.
When I confronted her about it she told me she was having a conflict of ‘reevaluating what (she) expects from this friendship’ because she initially thought she had a crush on me but it turned out she didn’t.

I never once had a girlfriend, let alone even received any attention from one no matter how hard I tried. I’ve never even kissed a girl.

So here I am at 20 years old, waking up every morning in a King size bed all alone. I spend my days sleeping, playing video games, or making crappy ass digital art that somehow makes me a living.

I keep trying to make myself happier by buying things that I never even really use all that much. My PS5 at this point is just a Netflix machine. 

I’ve tried dating apps. I’ll sometimes get lucky and get a match with someone and every single time, they’ll just stop responding and ghost me after the first few messages.

I’ve showed friends and family the messages and asked what I’m doing wrong and they all say that I do a great job at communication but the other person just doesn’t seem interested in me for some reason.

I don’t even know if I’m ugly or not. I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t hate myself, but I also don’t love myself either. I’m just content I guess…

I’m not tall but also not super short. I’m not skinny but also not obese.

I’m just average.

People tell me that I’m such a wonderful person and that I’m the type of guy that a girl would wanna marry… but I feel like it’s all bias.

I question myself if a girlfriend would even make me happy or if it would just create more problems. I drive myself crazy at night with this.

06.10.2021
I haven't met her in 4 years. I saw her a couple of times, sometimes with her husband. But I tried not looking at her face. It's hard for me you know.
I do miss her everyday. We broke up 6 years ago after a 4 year relationship, a high school relationship.
Today I had a dream. In that dream someone close to both of us was on death bed. (Don't know him in real life) And we encountered each other there. The dying old guy seemed to know everything about us. Me and her were sitting together on the bed trying to talk and comfort the dying guy. We gazed in each other's eyes and held each other's hands impulsively without saying a single word to each other after all these years. We held on to each other's hands the whole time, knowing that after this event we probably won't meet for years, if not ever. I felt so emotional but tried to contain it. After it was over She went away. I was the last to go. Upon exiting the old man's house I discovered myself in a breath-taking Landscape. An endless green field with a curve path leading to the horizon towards the drowning sun.
The breeze was light to breath in, flocks of birds going to the east back Home. As the sun was going down, slowly the light was shifting away from me and continued to go far ahead. I felt a little insecure in this growing darkness around me and thought I should run and try to stay into the light part of the field. As soon as I started running I started to feel the air becoming heavier and heavier until it was hard enough to breathe, the speed of the light going ahead was increasing exponentially as well as the speed of the darkness following me. I panicked and started to run with all my energy. But couldn't outrun the darkness. The trees and grass and birds started Deflating like  balloons and everything looked lifeless much like in the painting ""The Persistence of Memory"" by Salvador Dali.
I woke up. I was practically drenched in sweat.
The experience was so surreal, unlike any dream I've experienced so far in my life.
The dream wasn't the end of this weird day. I went out to get a smoke, and was randomly passing by a restaurant. My eyes caught something and I instantly froze seeing HER and my other ex girlfriend together drinking coffee. XD
I wasn't even sure if I was awake, Lol.
Anyway, I don't know why am I writing this. I never do this kind of posts. Actually I never post.
If you came upto this, then Thank you so much for listening to my bullshit. I'm truly sorry for wasting your time.

It’s not like I haven’t tried to make any attempts, but all of them failed. I tried my best to get the attention of girls that I did like for the past few years. I usually am a good sport about it and I know when to stop. As soon as a girl says no, I will back off. I think I have tried around 10 times and it affected my self-confidence. Even the people I went to school with managed to get into at least one relationship between middle school and present day. My friends tell me that I’m somehow charismatic while also being socially awkward. It’s a weird mix and I am socially awkward due to Asperger’s syndrome. 

Slowly I have become less social and less confident. I still have friends, but we can never find the time to hang out due to everyone having school or full-time jobs. Nowadays smoking pot and music fills that void a little bit. I guess you can say I just kinda gave up. I’m most likely going to be alone and my mindset doesn’t seem like it’s gonna change.

However, every moment of being in a group is miserable. I can put up an act as a friendly confident guy but that takes more energy than the most intense exercise and soon I just am the guy walking quietly behind everyone. I get no enjoyment from socializing and only think about what excuse I can make to go back to my dorm. I like talking to people, like being with family or going on dates with one other person, but the type of socializing that would give me a consistent group of friends is just so exhausting that I actively avoid these situations. For example, last night while I was drawing,  a girl from this group knocked on my door and said they were going to get ice cream and some guys were saying it's weird they never see me studying in the lounge or going out with them. Immediately I felt like someone hit my head and just the thought of going downstairs with them gave me physical pain. I told her I didn't feel good this evening but it's obvious she didn't believe me. It's unfortunate how socially unacceptable being alone and not having many friends is.

I have a mom that I'm close with, my dad is there but he doesn't like me. I was supposed to be a boy, but instead I've turned out to be an overweight girl (which he likes to joke about, and about much more). My mom never stood up for me in front of him, which hurt me a lot, but she would try to consol me with words (christianity) when we were alone saying I have a dad in heaven (didn't work). My parents didn't know how to raise kids emotionally. They thought that taking care of us physically was good enough.

I'm currently in my first year of actual college, although in highschool I got my associates degree through a community college (my current college took 65 of my 78 credits). I have always fell back on my achievements, and who I have made myself to be. I'm pessimistic, but I try to find the good side of things. With my dad situation I have always seen the side that my dad hurt me emotionally so much so that I cannot be hurt more by anyone else in this world. I finally have come to the realization that my achievments can never and will never fill the emptiness I feel. I want to be cared for, and hugged. It's hard to see everyone around me in college have happy relationships, and to have to be alone. A guy here lead me on. I really liked him. Turns out he has a gf. I'm glad nothing happened before he told me, but it has made my emotions a lot worse. It's shoved in my face every time someone asks me if we are dating because we (still) hang out a lot (he's a good guy as a friend, but clearly not as loyal as I thought). 

It's just hard. I have been told that it's better to feel slight pain now then to date a guy for a long time just to break up. I cannot believe that. I want to feel cared for. Even if it ends I will have been cared about and loved for a period of time. I'm sick and tired of waiting. I'm lonely.

I thought I met my best friend a short while ago. We had a lot in common, had fun stuff to talk about, and just always had a jolly ol' time. But recently they randomly started ignoring me, which really hurts. I've always had trouble making and keeping friends (except in high school, where for the last 2.5 years I felt like there was a small group that I belonged to and could always lean on-- but we fell apart after high school) and this time I thought things would be different, and that I'd potentially found a life-long friend. Guess not. Now they only text me if they need something, and if I ever need something they're dismissive about my problems. Overall because of their behavior lately I've been feeling like a burden, like an interloper that no one really wants to be around and is forcing their way into things. I don't think I deserve this but I'm also terrible at making and keeping friends. I've tried reaching out to old friends, and even though they're nice, we just don't have anything in common or anything to talk about anymore.

Sometimes I wish I could start college over again, and this time maybe I'd put more effort into being social. I've tried bumble bff but everyone I meet on there either just wants to gain instagram followers or rope me into their pyramid scheme..

My family's also going through a fuckload of shit right now. My dad's refusing to work and my mom is always depressed and excessively crying and worrying about money, which in turn makes me super anxious and prevents me from focusing on schoolwork. (this is just the tip of the iceberg but just in case someone i know is on here, i can't say more)

I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff and it's really weighing on me. It's become incredibly difficult for me to find any motivation to be productive. I used to have a good head on my shoulders; I would dedicate hours on end to learning something new or something that pertained to my future career, I was able to just sit down, get shit done, and then some. Now I just sit and mope all day, worrying about stuff that I have no control over. I used to cut a few years ago but I stopped. Recently I had a fleeting moment where I thought about doing that again and that in turn progressed into some suicidal thoughts (which have recently become more frequent).

4276,throwawaytwoquestion,1633529023,6,"This is mainly IRL

1. Talk to them. If you can make the first move that's the best alternative. Find something they're interested in and talk about it.
2. Listen more and speak less. I'd say listening 80% and talking 20% of the time while in a conversation is the best. In the beginning it's harder since the other person might be shy. When this happens you need to talk a lot with the goal of making them talk. Best way to make them talk in my experience is to ask them questions.
3. Seem genuinely interested in what they have to say. Listen to what they say and ask them questions. Most important thing is to always seem like you're interested in what they have to say.
4. When you see them somewhere else than wherever you usually meet like work or school you need to greet them. This reinforces friendliness and makes them feel like the connection between you two is safe. You can also start a conversation if you think that'd work better but I think it's safer to just say hi in the beginning.
5. When it doesn't work and the person really doesn't want to talk to you see this as learning. Think about what you could've done differently and do better next time.

I'm also going to be honest and say it may be that people don't actually like you a lot. In my case for example people don't like me. I haven't found out the problem though I think it's related to my personality which is very out there. Also that I've got a very unattractive face, that I'm skinny fat, that I look like I belong to an ethnic group that is looked down upon in western society, that I usually walk alone because no one wants to be with me, that I may have a lot of mental health problems which is making me unable to connect to people in fear of rejection (which happens anyways), that I'm stupid, that I'm not talented, that I'm not reliable in any way, and finally that people notice the infection of loneliness and desperation I carry in my head and just talk to me cause they feel bad for me.",lonely,How to get friends by a loner,2021-10-07 01:03:43

I told her that I understood and that I’ll respect her choice. But honestly, that really hurt. She was the first person I felt could understand me and I just wanted to get to know her more but she clearly did not. I wasn’t asking her out on a date, I truly just wanted to talk.

I found two people on instagram who I got very close to during a time where I had no friends in school. A couple months later and I ended the contact all of a sudden because I gained some IRL friends in school who I valued more and thought it was ""embarrassing"" to have Internet friends no matter how awesome these two people were that I talked to. I regretted my choices a couple weeks later and messaged them again. One blocked me for almost a year and the other I could never find the account of ever again (I think he deleted it or blocked me). And fuck, if I had the choice to ge back in time and undo my mistakes I would do so immediately. I was such an asshole for breaking up the contact like that and lie. Now, I'm here, 3 years later (for the first contact) and 1 year later (for the second contact) and I just feel empty and miserable and sorry. How do I stop this? Do I even deserve redemption?

My “parents” gave me up for adoption to abusive people and well that right there just ruined my whole life.  I’ve had friends before but as I did inner work and pursued goals they fell away.  Cause of my trauma I despise people who use others to get ahead, and that’s a good chunk of people out there.  Now, cause of my age, the other chunk are married with kids and busy or they are weird as hell or have problems.   And, I have a almost non existent family support structure because it’s better for my mental health.  It hurts but I’ve had to come to terms with it (other peoples capacity, or lack thereof, to care about your life and very existence) and embrace the good in life.  However fostering relationships has completely left my life and it just hurts.  Dating just feels like a band aid for loneliness.  The holidays are the worst and approaching fast.   Major milestones in my life like graduating, preparing to buy my first home and a major birthday all go unacknowledged.   Just hurts and I don’t have the will to satiate empty ego fed superficial relationships.  But I just wish one person fucking cared about me on a daily basis.

4318,throwaway839507935,1633494102,3," I'm going to be 24 in a little over a week and I have never been in a relationship and I see no means by which I could have one at this point. I never learned how to properly talk to and meaningfully connect with people. I've moved to a new town, don't know anybody here, and am not capable of ""meeting"" people in the way most people are. I am an offputting presence to anyone who doesn't already know me.

My few friends, all from high school, all live hours (at least) away. I stopped attempting to talk to any of them about my loneliness years ago after it resulted in the loss of, or negative reactions from, a few old friends. I would tell them I felt like a ghost who was already dead, who had lost whatever minuscule ability I ever had to connect with people. I no longer speak to any of those few to whom I opened up. I don't blame them for reacting as they did. But I do not talk to anyone about my emotions any more. I sit with them on lonely nights and drink.

I have given up on any possibility that I can have a significant other but I cannot stop thinking about my desire for a significant other. I like to hike and drive to lonely and interesting places and I want very badly to share these enjoyments with a stable life partner. But I cannot talk to women. I live in a duplex and my neighbor is an attractive woman. I have no interest in her but I cannot even say hi to her. I said hi to her once as we crossed paths and I was shaking for 10 minutes afterward. Apparently in order to meet women you are supposed to simply walk up and start talking to them, which strikes me as absolutely insane. I know if I did this, my strange speech patterns that give me away as someone who very rarely talks to other human beings would set off alarm bells, and she would try to quickly excuse herself from the situation.

I cannot do online dating. I have tried. I matched with one person once who almost immediately unmatched me when an attempt I made at a joke fell flat. That's it. If I had the photos I might be able to craft a profile that would attract likes, but I don't have the sorts of photos that men are supposed to use, the kind that ""show and don't tell"" about your hobbies. I don't know anyone here so I can't get them taken. Even if I did I wouldn't want to ask them to take them, because it would be embarrassing. And even if I had them, I still wouldn't want to engage in online dating, because the whole enterprise disgusts me. I can't stomach putting myself up in a marketplace and presenting myself as an advertisement on a billboard. And when I look through the profiles, I don't even recognize the entities who are using these apps as belonging to the same species as me. I simply cannot relate to people, except the few friends from high school, scattered about the country, who I still occasionally spend time with a few times a year.

I have rationally known for several years that I am going to have to accept an entirely solitary life, but I have been all the while emotionally searching for a way to escape this fact. I hate that I have to accept living like this when I see couples together everywhere, who, if asked how they got together, would often say something along the lines of ""it just happened."" Finding romantic partners is something that simply comes naturally to most people but there is something fundamentally wrong with me and I cannot. For the same reason, I cannot make new friends.

I'm tired of sitting alone with these thoughts and drinking (I don't always. I have things I like to do, reading, hiking, etc. But nothing can provide a permanent distraction from having essentially no permanent human connections). As I said, I don't talk to the few people I know about these sorts of things anymore. So I have nowhere else to say these things. But all this rambling is really just the death throes of whatever emotional force is trying to get me to fight the inevitable decades of solitude that are ahead.

They don't really recognise me as a friend anymore. I have known some of these guys for 10 years, and I am questioning my worth and have anxieties about some of the things they might do to make me feel as lonely as possible. My friend group has done this to others, practically systematically bullying them out of the group (I was regrettably a bystander in these situations), and I never expected for it to happen to me. I always perceived myself to be, as another post mentioned- a ""backburner friend,"" who's just sorta there and I can safely say that I have no close friends within the group. It's also extremely nice of them (/s) to do all of this in my final and most important year of high school, just when you need that support and friendship to fall back on whilst undergoing academic stress, they've deserted. I've felt really dejected, stupid, scared and anxious lately, and this is by far the loneliest I have ever been. At the moment, I don't just feel lonely, I feel practically unsafe, around my ""friends"" on social media and at school.

I need someone to talk with who genuinely wants to listen however, I encounter another roadblock here. My parents are extremely emotionally conservative- they are super religious and tell me to pray or sleep when dealing with feelings like this, ignoring how I truly feel, not allowing me to process any of these emotions. I feel like I need a therapist to do this, but I have no idea how to ask my parents for it.

I've lost 30 lbs since the beginning of the year. Got fit. Went vegetarian. Got promoted at my job. Started going out more on my own and just going out in the world. I was feeling good about myself despite the break up. But since about 2 weeks ago I've been falling back into depression and general loneliness. No sex life anymore. Barely any friends. I went out to a bar solo and drank and played pool all night by myself. Didn't interact with anyone the 5 hours I was there. It was honestly so sad. My job is getting more stressful since the promotion and I have no one to confide in or talk to about anything really.

4356,Sola_Calamity,1633477558,8,"Loneliness to me feels a lot like sinking, slowly. Like sitting in a dark pit, alone, unable to see any source of light. Like slowly succumbing to the cold numbing your bones, spreading through you. Like running out of air, a vice grip on your lungs. A pain in your heart so fierce it is debilitating, a weight on top of you that feels like it is slowly crushing you.

The daily grind of trying to pretend to be fine, to keep going, to struggle through life alone, has gotten to a point that is now unbearable. I have to admit I haven't been okay for what feels like an eternity. I long for the presence of another human being in my life. Family, love, friends. I have neither. Haven't had anything resembling genuine human contact outside of work and superficial banter for years and years. I .. am so goddamn lonely.

I long for human presence in my life.  It feels like a dream that is far away. To share the small and big things, to have someone to immediately want to run to with exciting news, someone you are eager to talk to everyday but when you do not, it feels like no time has passed. Someone who, when around me, doesn't feel the need to wear that daily mask that is required of us, but who can feel free to be exactly the way they are because we get each other. Someone to share even those things with that you need to feel you have to hide from the rest of the world. Someone you want to have by your side no matter what shit life throws at you. Someone you are eager to greet in the mornings or to call after a long day to ask about their day. To laugh about the silly things together, to share all the random little memes and pictures and insignificant things that happen, to rent and vent and to cry together when things get rough.

I have so much love to give, care so deeply for the people close to my heart, but I cannot seem to find anyone that is for me. That stays.

The harsh reality is getting ghosted. Being replaced. People seemingly losing interest. A phone that is deadly silent day in, day out. The continued pain when hearing the phone go off, that hopeful second of a racing heart only to discover it's just yet another Domino's ad. Nights that seem neverending. Why?

All these hurtful attempts at trying to reach out to people, to establish a connection, have almost made me give up so many times, only to pick myself back up again and again to keep trying. Honestly, I am .. tired. I've seen numerous similar posts to mine, read comments of people desperate, feeling like giving up. Yet even when contacting them, most of the time I can't seem to even get a reply. I don't understand. Is it really just me?

If there's the slight possibility you can relate to any of this and feel we could maybe get along and chat, please do reach out to me. Would you like to try and see if we can be friends? I understand the struggle is hard and that sometimes the only solution seems to be giving up because you already know it will just end up like all the other times, but please stay hopeful. So many lonely souls on this subreddit, it simply can't be that we cannot find each other. Keep your head up, let's see if maybe we can be that light that will brighten each other's days, that our smiles next time will not have to be forced :)

(If you feel I'm not your kind of person, that is perfectly fine, why not consider reaching out to someone else? :) )

How does loneliness feel for you? What are your circumstances, what brings you here? What are your passions, your dreams? Was there something that made you smile today? Anything you want to vent about? Please, I'm so eager to hear from you, make yourself at home and never hesitate to try and fight for what it is you wish for in life, I still believe loneliness is something we do not simply have to accept.",lonely,Can you .. and I .. be friends?,2021-10-06 10:45:58

But lately I’ve come to a realization I’ve been not forming deep relationships/friendships for a while. Or what I thought were good friendships weren’t so. Distance and lack of communication due to health, and mental issues has also added to that. 

I’m in Florida, not too many folks from my background around me. I don’t have anyone to check on me in the same city or state. Live by myself, and have a friend who seems quiet aloof/unattached. Not been in a relationship since past few years because I couldn’t find a good match, been low, had health issues was skinnky. Now all of the health issues are gone, and visiting family in India. But dreading going back to Florida and being alone again.  

I used to be Jovial, and a friendly person who didn’t have issues making friends until 25. But a few bad breakups and living alone seems to have changed me. Always been a sort of an introvert, but not have lost confidence and get this over whelming feeling no one cares. I don’t know how to make friends anymore, it feels like it. I don’t know what to do to have a social life and cannot seem to find anyone I like to date me. I myself feel lack of enthusiasm and smartness, feel boring. I didn’t think I was this way.

So we were both from the north east Delaware area. Dating/living together off and on for the last 2  years or so. Something always Seems to mess things up. We always would reconnect after a few weeks or at the longest a couple months almost like we were destined to be for each other. We both had some drug problems she had a bit of a cheating on me problem a few times which in some cases I could say it was my fault for not paying her enough attention. This last time I can honestly say that was not the case I came to live with her for a few weeks in that time I managed to sober up was ready to do things the right way unfortunately she started using behind my back at work lying to me about it and we relapsed pretty hard . I started to get really paranoid, depressed, scared she was going to start cheating and leave me again after I spent all my savings on hotel rooms and our habbit. My fears became quite real when she quit her job had me pick her up and couldn't look me in the eye after. 
I know I should have called it there walked away with my head up but if you love someone enough you just want them to be satisfied even if it means allowing them to have a fling from time to time. I dont mind swinging if my partners honest with me and the person respects our relationship and doesn't go blasting her phone up. 
Long story short she takes me over her cute girlfriends apartment where I was very polite and didn't insinuate anything of any nature. However she decides to walk away telling me to stay with her friend i didnt want to do anything with her friend she had no ride nothing just walks out of the apt and starts walking away i eventually drove by and scooped her up took her to her dads apartment she says to me good luck with the book there wont be a movie and just walks away into the complex not answering my texts or anything drugs may have caused her some dilusions or possibly the lack of sleep from partying like every day since she lost her job in hotel rooms. Later that night I left my phone on the dash of my car while I was booking a hotel room come back out and its gone. Now I don't have her number to find out anything. Here's where it gets fucked up.

I get sick while I'm at the hotel and end up stuck there quarantined for a week with no phone praying that I wrote her number down somewhere  but my car was so ransacked I couldn't find a 100 dollar bill spray painted neon orange in it. After quarantineing I decide to get some help with my drug issue and check myself into a detox. I detox out over 12days then make the next step to go to rehab having no insurance active yet I only really had one option which was gardencia place is a shit hole but I tried to make due with the people there everyone was pretty nice I overhear someone talking about a Jenna in there and I asked if they knew her last name ... it was my ex who checked herself out 1 day before i got there. I attempted suicide that night failed then got combative with the manager of the facility after he gripped me up for calling my emergency contact. I end up in hand cuffs in a cop car shoulder out of socket and at Wilmington hospital in the capes unit. I just finished 15 days of detox and I'm now staying with my grandfather until my insurance kicks in and I can go to banyan.

4378,CarolinaReaperCurry,1633466177,3,"Where do I begin.

I'm a 30 year old man working as a carer currently so do not get much in the way of social interaction.

During the lockdowns I struggled immensely with alcoholism and went into a downward spiral, I was struggling badly.

It came to a point where I subconsciously reached out to my neighbours, I stayed far away from the door naturally. 

I was greeted by a smiling woman who patiently listened to my inebriated nonsense, I was bedazzled by her beauty.

I became obsessed with her, like she was my ticket out of dodge, finally an interesting person who could uplift me and reintroduce me to the wonderful world of social interaction. 

I tried to message her on Facebook once and was promptly blocked, I was quite sad but figured OK she isn't it, I moved on.

Weeks rolled by and she started appearing physically  I mean literally walking up to me in a supermarket locking eyes, I was shocked, she slowly approached me looking me in the eyes happily, I didn't know how to respond so I walked away, huge mistake.

There have been other encounters but I always avoided and ignored her, ghosting is the phrase I think.

She eventually stopped, the times I see her now she looks very unimpressed, angry even.

In a drunken stupor I recently tried contacting her again asking why she behaved like that, blocked.

Clearly this will never go anywhere, it's a dead end, her change of heart clearly went away and she doesn't care, how do I move past this?

I regret ghosting her she seemed really nice but my social anxiety is crippling and I was in a very bad place back then.

4382,Meepasour,1633465523,10,"Not sure if this belongs here but here we go.

Being open with how I feel has never been a strong point of mine. I normally keep any unsightly emotion hidden and to myself, never letting anyone see me cry, and honestly I feel like I've become isolated from everyone around me. I know the solution to this problem is to be more open but the problem is that I feel like no one will care or they leave me or think less of me in a way. 

I guess the main reason i think this is because I have no self worth. I find the whole idea of people just liking me for just being me unimaginable, even with the one close friend I do have there is a part of me that sometimes thinks they might be hanging out with me out of pity since I won't have anyone else if they left me. I know that's not true but I can't help but feel that way sometimes.

I sometimes cry myself to sleep wishing that someone would hold me and tell me they love me but feel like no one would.

I constantly feel touch starved but at the same time afraid of it, afraid that if I let someone hold me lovingly that I might breakdown and show the more vulnerable side of me, the side of me that's a complete mess, the side of me I'm afraid people won't love.

I’m 23 years old and I don’t have any friends. I’m getting my masters, I work, I try to work out, pay my own bills, and people would consider me as attractive. I still live with my parents. When I do make friends I try my hardest to be a good friend. I listen to them, I pay for them, I drive them everywhere, I ask them when they need help, i always meet their parents, etc. I self reflect critically when I see them pushing away. Trying to asses what I could do different so they don’t hate me or find me boring. But ultimately they end up leaving. I’m just confused because partially I know it’s not my fault because I’ve tried hard to be their friend when they didn’t try to be my friend. I had a couple best friends from college. But my boyfriend told me that they were taking of advantage of me. They never wanted to come over my parents house or meet my parents when I asked them to do me a favor they never seemed to want to do it. We would only hang out on their terms and I was the only one that was listening to their problems. But if  i had nothing to do with them leaving then why do I keep loosing friends?

4399,HumanityRelinquished,1633459073,4,"I'm 23 and have literally zero friends and have no idea how to make any.

I'm a sociable guy, wouldn't consider myself introverted or shy but used to be in middleschool and highschool. 

I've been through college 2 times (dropped out the first) and the best I can do is acquaintances, either people I worked with for group assignments or my roommates. I got along decently well with everyone I interacted with, but it never seemed to get anywhere. 

When it comes to online friendships, it's the same. I can talk to tons of people on discord, no problem in voicechatting strangers, but no one is open to forming bonds. I joined hundreds of random servers and they're either full of kids, people who already formed their own groups, or people that simply don't care for socializing. 

I don't really like multiplayer games much but tried playing a few to see if something would come of it, though it's the same situation. People are already playing with their friends, and adding strangers won't do much, at best it's another acquaintance that might share some messages back and forth once a week. 

My hobbies don't include anything sociable and I have no time to pick up a sport or anything like that. 

Though somehow, I never had problem with dating and relationships. I've had multiple girlfriends and a few boyfriends (I'm bi), which I end up investing too much into and becoming somewhat codependant due to my lack of friendships. 

The only time I had friends was when I was 17 and it only lasted a year or so. I was a mess at the time, going through severe depression, very shy, and could barely talk to anyone, as well as overweight. I was accepted into a group because one guy started speaking to me on the first day.

I'm guessing my problem is I never had social media, so I can't follow people I talk to and create a social circle. I remember on the first day of one of the colleges I attended some students wanted to add me on facebook, and when I told them I didn't have it they lost interest.

I can't fix this either since you need a social life to have social media. Or at least I should have made some friends in highschool, and went to the same college as them

Am I permanently screwed for not being able to go back in time, beat my introverted self up and force him to create a healthy social circle? The more effort I put in the more I believe this.

Whenever I sit down for a lecture I can't help but notice the space that people always leave between me and them(this is true even before covid). People get together in groups at classes and bond, and I'm left alone, and I'm getting tired of nothing changing. I'm just tired of the stress that comes with this idea that the only way I can make more friends or connections is by me reaching out. This is the same frustration I experience having to always be the one to confirm meetups with friends lest I end up somewhere alone. The worst feeling I get though, is when I'm surrounded by friends, and everyone is having fun, I get this moment of disconnection, where I'm left looking at the ground wondering what the fuck I'm even doing here, what could I possibly add? I'm sure it is a shared sentiment, but no matter what I do it seems nothing ever changes. Honestly even writing this makes me afraid I look entitled. 
I'm not sure what I've accomplished writing this, but I guess the least I can hope for is that someone resonated with what I've said and feels a little less alone for it.

Can someone let me know how it makes you feel? If it feels like a attack, or wordy or complicated.

I am open to suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why do you suddenly care about my personal life now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Please this cycle we have together is unhealthy.  
While we are at work we catch up, grow, help each other, bond. But when we are not at work I'm left to be ignored, felt expendable with no closure as to why.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The expectation was that we would at least be BFFs, but I suppose that was naïve of me.   
Seeing our track history of asking you to hang out was simply ignored.  
Then anytime the subject change a response would be swift along with a apology.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s gotten to a point where your apologies to me are simply a epimone of semantic satiation.  
&gt;  
&gt;You have raised me up from my darkness and shown me what is truly important in life. Friends and Family.  
I have always had it as a afterthought, but now it’s a part of me worth protecting. Only for me to realize that I have missed out on so much. I concentrated on what isn’t important.  
&gt;  
&gt;You were there when I needed cheering up, or calming down, but when I need you the most or when you need me you aren't there, I want to help you in your time of need, to lift up your spirits as good friends do.  
But how can I even call us friends when you don’t even what to talk or get coffee or something mundane?   
Even with friends. I have always had hope that you just needed space and when I extend an olive branch to you, that too gets ignored.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I've already had four emotional breakdowns in the past month. Because I genuinely miss your company, and my slow sad realization that I have no one. Not even to talk to.   
&gt;  
&gt;It’s too much for me to handle. My mental health is deteriorating as a result.  
Where I grew up from, being ignored is one of the most gravest of insults.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you need me to be at your side I will be there I will drop whatever I'm doing and come to you, no questions asked, no judgements. Because that’s what good friends do.  
&gt;  
&gt;But please never talk to me about anything that isn’t work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hence to we are strictly co-workers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s what you wanted right?

I also live with two couples for roommates. One of them aren't so bad, but the other are always being affectionate to each other, like always giving little kisses and hugging every single day. I try not to let it bother me, it's their home too and they should be free to do what they want, but I absolutely HATE it when they do it in front of me, as it just reminds me of how pathetic and lonely my life is.

All I want is human touch. I go through a depressive state almost everyday now. One roommate (the girl from the couple that aren't that bad) is kind and always says if I need someone to talk to that she's there. But I feel she wouldn't understand. 
I FEEL LIKE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

Most of my friends are in relationships, and those that are single are just as happy as those who are in relationships. And I'm partly happy to be single, I like the freedom, but sometimes it's so damn hard, especially when you look at those who live with you who remind you every single day about what you don't have.

I wanted to stay single so that I could get involved with other people on a one night stand basis and explore myself before allowing myself to start dating again. But I can't even do that right as I haven't had sex in 5 fucking years.

I've lost so much hope. And I know I have friends, but there's still this empty, lonely feeling inside of me.

4471,cheesecakeonastick,1633405859,1,"I’m an only child (F29) and was raised by a single mother, grandparents, few aunts and uncles plus cousins. A lot of my relatives have passed on, including my dad. 

My parents immigrated from Europe to the US but my mother moved back aboard. I only have one aunt, one uncle and one cousin here, that live 2 hours away. 

Living throughout the pandemic by myself has been incredibly lonely. I mean, at first I kinda liked being at home, not having to go to work, I still saw my relatives a couple of times in the summer of 2020. And then my aunt got sick, had to undergo treatments and I wasn’t allowed to visit anymore as I posed a risk. She was immuno-compromised and terrified of covid. Don’t get my wrong I am too, but I’ve been super careful all this time and knock on wood, haven’t caught it. 

I had a friend invite me over for Thanksgiving last year but I spent Christmas alone :( Then a few months passed, I felt so numb, I isolated myself from some friends. When I reached out and apologized for my lack of communication they turned their backs and wanted nothing to do with me. So I lost a couple friends :(

Fast forward to now, my aunt still refuses to have me over. She said I’m not allowed to come over and stay, if anything she might be willing to hang out with me outside…
The last conversation I had with her just left me in tears. I couldn’t control my anger and sadness. 

Throughout this pandemic, I have completely lost a sense of family. I haven’t celebrated any holidays with anyone in 2 years now. My friends left me, I still have a few other friends but they all have their busy lives, with families, nieces, nephews, partners. I legit have no one. 

It hurts so bad, especially because I’m very family oriented. I always longed to have my own family and become part of a future partner’s family. There’s still time for that I guess, but in the meantime, I’ve lost my will to live. I hate my life now, especially the part where I’m unable to celebrate events with family. I see my mother, celebrating the birth of her stepsons baby but I’m so far away , I can’t be there. Plus travel still makes me nervous during covid.

The only time I get to catch up with them is when I bring up how my life is going. They plan things together and don’t invite me. When I bring up wanting to go, they say “next time,” but next time doesn’t happen either. I feel so isolated from people I thought loved me and cared about me. But none of them care to see me. None of them are ever the first to reach out. It’s genuinely always me putting in the effort. 

My trivia team will consistently ignore my (correct) answers, interrupt me when I’m contributing to a conversation, and talk down about my likes and hobbies to me. (I’m sorry liking the Bachelorette isn’t cool, I guess.) It’s getting to the point that being on my team is so draining to what used to be my favourite hobby, that I don’t want to go anymore. I get purposefully excluded from plans made directly in front of me and I can’t complain, because I feel like they’d treat me worse for doing it. 

The new friend groups I get introduced to always seem to end up neutral towards me at first and then do the same thing. They talk over me, ignore my input in conversations, or ignore me in settings where they don’t have to associate with me. I feel invisible in new situations/with those people, even though I’m an extrovert. 

If I’m an asshole, why can’t I just be likeable to other assholes at least? I’ve been to therapy over this. I feel like the biggest dick whenever someone stops me mid sentence to change a subject. I have to be, right? I don’t think I’m being problematic at all, but for some reason my friends make me feel so lesser. I’m never a priority to them. 

I’m so alone. It never feels like anyone in my friend groups care. Even when I tell the person I call a best friend how I’m feeling, I end up getting shrugged off and overlooked. I’m drowning in loneliness, despite being surrounded by friends. 

If I knew how I was being such an awful person or being so annoying or what about me was such a terrible thing that makes people act like that around me, I’d fix it. I’d do anything to fix it. I want to be likeable. I want to make friends and feel like they appreciate me too.

I was actually a bit nervous to post because of the subject matter and worried that my post would just get passed over....Anyways, I was married for 12 years, we had an amazing daughter, and then we divorced 6 years ago.  She re-married quickly and I remained single (not for lack of trying).  I feel broken and unwanted.  I tried all the ""quick fix rebound"" apps and even paid services.  Nothing.  NOTHING.  I was paying for a daily reminder that I am unwanted.  This really pissed me off and I cancelled everything.  I haven't had the company of a woman (even just as friends) or the gentle touch of a woman in 6 years....agonizing.  Up to the point of graduating college, I always had girlfriends, so this wasn't a chronic issue....these days however, it feels like a living hell (there are other issues, but loneliness is the big chief of the tribe).  Every girl that I've been with I've met in a natural, fluid way, and they've all been multi year relationships....the apps and paid services seem akin to 'hunting' down a relationship and that just seems forced and kinda gross.  My best friend's girlfriends have all been from apps and not a single one has made it past 6-8 months.  God, I can't adequately express how much pain this is causing me.  It's to the point that if I see a happy couple, I feel rage inside, because they have the very thing that I want most in my life.

4500,RimaH54,1633389865,1,"My parents were divorced since I was 3, now im 17 and in the past year I have been tortured with heartbreak, abusive relationships, loneliness, failure, depression, anxiety, stress and the worse part is I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

The heartbreak I had to endure a few months ago also came with the loss of my best friend who I talked to on and off ever since I was ~8, I said some stupid, untrue things that I regret saying and it led to her not wanting anything to do with me, I honestly think its for the best because we cant make it work, we tried.

She was the first and only person I ever cried and opened to, at one point I truly felt like I found someone I could spend the rest of my life with, you can imagine how I felt when I realized she's never coming back, I still think about her everyday.

The abusive relationships are my mom and brother, bothI truly hate from the bottom of my heart.

my mom is the most manipulative and heartless person I know, last time we talked she shouted at me and told me to pack my things, I said nothing but as I was getting ready I started crying, not because I care about her but more of like coming to understand how fast my life is going downhill, she noticed and started crying herself and told me not to go, I left and went to my dad's.

As I was walking home, my brother sent me messages like ""you always ruin everything"", ""you are a shit brother"" and it was very painful for me so I turned off my phone.

My brother lives with my dad and has a room here but since my mom ""has custody"" my dad couldn't spend money on a bigger house with a room for me so I sleep in the living room, play on my pc most of the day there which basically means 0 privacy, I have had a few breakdowns because of it in the past but I tried to overlook it this time.

Now my brother hated me from the point I arrived because basically he believes and sides with anything my mom does and wont listen to anything else so as I got there he screamed at me and my dad when we were having dinner, I just didn't reply

The following week I tried to small talk with him to see if he calmed down and it kinda seemed like it but then came today, today I was playing with my friends on my pc at 6pm and as I said before im in the living room and I raised my voice because I didn't know anyone was home, then my brother screams at me to shut up and that he is trying to sleep, I told him that I didn't know and he screamed shut up when I tried to say anything, I got mad and told him that hes an idiot and he came and hit me on my head, I got very angry and he made fun of me and told me a lot of hurtful things.

I went outside to breathe and relax and 10 minutes later my dad comes and I tell him what happens and basically my brother denies it and screams and it led to another fight, at this point it reminded me of my mom and I couldn't hold the pain back so I started crying and went to my computer and blasted music because I didn't want to deal with this shit anymore.

This has been going for the past year and I just cant do this anymore I want to find a job and save money so I can live by myself finally as soon as possible.

4503,heartmorgue,1633389367,1,"Trigger Warning(s): self harm via isolation, starving, suicidal ideation

Before I get into the main post I would like to provide some background information. I am a 22 year old female that normally works 2 part time jobs, and is also a full time student. I have a roommate and we both normally work about 35+ hours a week to maintain our small apart because we have both moved out to escape toxic family situations. Since moving out I wanted to believe that my mental health would magically improve since my family was a major part of my issues. Spoiler alert: it didn't.  The past 1 has proven it. Nearly 7-8 months ago things were looking up before crashing down. 

I started having intense mental health issues that nearly sent me to the psychiatric ward once and has caused panic attacks, emotional episodes, and disassociation. I went to multiple  medical professionals and was given a proper diagnoses that were linked to my problems. It turns out that my toxic family trauma has done far more than I was willing to upset. 

I have a therapist, take daily medication, and will soon be having a psychiatrist as well as needed to help with the severity of my mental health. My first therapist left due to receiving another position and while I was crushed I accepted it because I wanted/still want the best for her as she is an amazing woman. She has been a significant part of my mental health journey and accepting trauma. I left my first customer service job due to the harassment of the customers and lost pretty much more work/friends I have had. I started another job in which my manager degraded me in every way shape or form. I was told I was useless and a waste. But I had no choice but to keep working and I made some what friends there. Things there took a severely negative turn. I ended up leaving that job to another employer that ended up firing me for something seemingly race related but it is not enough to actually build a case over.

 I was jobless/still am jobless to this day and due to an error I made on my unemployment I was denied and now have to continue to wait to fix it. Which is even more frightening because I have no money for food, medication, bills after selling/pawning most things I have that are of value. Even with all this happening the only thing that delivers the most hurt is the fact that I am alone. I do not fear death but rather the possibility that no one will know I was gone. I would rather have nothing and be someone's everything. Then just have everything and be nothing to anyone. 

And with all that I have no friends, near or close to me. I stay in my room and I cry softly to not disturb my roommate. I don't go anywhere, I have little to no food in my home outside of food for my cats. After nearly attempting suicide my family has tried to be supportive but ultimately has seemed to push me as an afterthought until they decide to drag me into their drama or want something from me. The few friends I had have either ignored me or more or less diverted their attention to their life. I can honestly say that I have no reason to live. I am so used to making sure everyone else around is taken care of that I no longer know how to really care or do things for myself. 

I go to therapy, I have tried positive thinking, crafting, I take my medications and have even tried to force myself into exercising and going down a route to become healthy in some sort of hope that it will make me want to continue to be here. I cook and clean, I care. I vent I try to do everything to somehow pull myself out of this dark space and I do for a while just to fall down again.  I have given up on trying for myself, it is wasted effort if I don't know what I want or how to obtain it. But one thing I can always say is that while I may not have much I enjoy friendship. Having someone to care for or to talk too. So if this is my last chance at happiness  I would rather spend it being useful but also something that I can enjoy as well. 

My life has been misery and while I may not be able to stop or control at the moment I can control one factor. Which is to not shut everything out. So if I only have this chance can I be your friend? It doesn't matter what we talk about, experience, or go through I'm more than happy to sit and be friends with any or anyone that way. The loneliness will fade and no matter what happens or what is done. No one deserves to be alone by default.

As i grow up i learned that the idea of having best friends shouldn't be forced and whenever i have a best friend it always goes to an ending, also the idea of having a girlfriend for the intent of feeling loved and wanted, i find myself numb to feel love because i had a bad experience that was very bad emotionally and got me off at the time with the lessons that led me to believe that i could never trust woman or being truly loved, but now i feel much more relaxed and i've tried to talk to girls by dm's and it was a good experience that got me off of feeling terrible for not having the confidence to talk to a woman, i can't date because i'm in a bad life situation, finished my studies and there's no jobs and im in a poor country, it's the single most painful thing it's like having no life and you're stuck, i'm trynna find a way to leave its extremely hard to be able to leave my country people are drowning in the sea and risking thier live in little boats just to have a better living, and the idea of leaving gives me the little energy to keep up (sorry this id out of context but it still important to mention). I've always been depressed and stressed, stuck in daydreaming and very frustrated, and i had no support or care from anyone, it was just me all along and now i got used to be me, and i look at the entourage of people surrounding me and i feel good that i'm lonely, i see a lot of hypocrisy and negative energy and envy in these people, i run for 20min  everyday and i do little bit of home exercise with so little,(i can't afford a gym membership), i listen to music, i read pdfs, i'm a fan of the UFC...

4507,MinnieTea,1633388003,1,"Yeah, we get it, majority of us are probably friendless, touched starved, or in a relationship but perpetually feeling alone type of people here. 

Just because you found one “friend” or someone to talk to in years doesn't mean you won't be alone anymore in the future. 

Just because you got a gf/bf now doesn't mean you'll be in a happy relationship for years to come. 

You need to not only lower your expectations but to raise your standards to realistic levels. Not only that but it's important to not place your happiness on that person/group of people. Because what are you gonna do if they aren't around anymore? Sit around in a sad state until someone comes around to make you happy for a few months or years and goes away just like the other friends/lover? 

I'm not telling you to act like some edgelord or tsundere pretending to not want to be friends with people but you want to be friends with those people but you hope that they can indirectly pass your emotional walls. I'm telling you not to expect much or anything. Because expecting one person to be your BFF or lifetime soulmate causes shallow relationships to happen because that person isn't filling that void you've been feeling.

I realize that loneliness makes most (not all) people desperate so they'll latch onto anyone who shows them the bare minimum of kindness and basic decency. But this also ends up attracting toxic relationships. Build up your self-worth. If no one respects you, start respecting yourself. Don't settle yourself for less but don't expect much. If you think this is some motivational I ripped from a TED talk or even a motivation post, think again.

But now that the summer is over, i'm starting to feel how that constant happiness that I had felt before is slowly fading away from me. I'd most likely be very depressed at this point if it weren't for my  friends.

One thing that I learned while I was constantly happy was that being alone felt better than being together with someone, that being alone ment that there is nothing that I have to think about other than myself. I told myself that I'd rather live alone with my thoughts and use the time to find myself. 

But now.. Now I don't know anymore. I'm still trying to tell myself that living alone would feel better but I don't know if it would. 

I am afraid to catch feelings for someone I have known for a couple of weeks now because of the fear that I'm going to feel as down as I did when I fell in love the first time.

Here’s a link to my pictures. Now let’s look at the facts. I am 26. My whole life I’ve struggled with making friends. Not one friend I had ever lasted. Not one. I never had a girlfriend. I feel like I’m the one who is always more interested in other people than they are in me. Now look at the average person my age. The average person my age has been in multiple relationships by 26 and many have had friendships for years.

As a matter of fact I have tried for years to get with a girl I liked and she never accepted me. Another guy became her boyfriend only after 3 months of knowing her. It implies that there is a problem with me. Other people have something I don’t or they are doing something right that I’m not doing.

People usually don’t *seem* interested in me but my perception/interpretation could be wrong. Can you look at the pictures and tell me if you notice anything or get any vibes from me that could be causing these problems?

4518,skygreen255,1633384165,1," So in June I had my first girlfriend. She was my first kiss, too. We got separated and unfortunately had to break up like 9 days into the relationship because we were both busy with our lives and we lived super far away from each other. She ended up breaking up with me and at first I thought I was alright. I was kinda relieved because I didn't take the separation very well because my love language is physical touch. I felt all of the stress coming off me when she broke up with me, but about 2 days later I started to feel lonely again. Every time I see her on social media, how much fun she's having since the break-up, I feel a rush of emotions pumping through me. I feel like I can't breathe and feel very light-headed, like I'm gonna pass out. I feel so lonely. It's been 3 months since the break-up and the loneliness is just not stopping. I see all of my friends changing girlfriends like socks and I still can't get over a 9 day relationship.

  
I've been watching a lot of romance films, especially films by Hayao Miyazaki, since the break up and they make me cry every time. I don't even go hang out with my friends that much anymore. I feel so ostracized by my peers when they talk about how they ''found a new girlfriend in the subway while going to a hockey match'' and how they ''love her so much'' even tho they end up dumping her 2 weeks ago because she ''didn't send enough nudes''. I feel like I can't relate to any of my peers.

  
I know that this is only the start of my love life, but I had this brewing in me and I just had to somehow  vent these emotions I have somewhere.

Improve on what you want to improve in life for your own satisfaction &amp; your own satisfaction only.


 I used to go to college, get a good job in programming, go to social gatherings with  expectations of finding a great partner to settle with &amp; good close friends who'd be great to hangout with. None of that happened and I was distraught for a few years. I let all that despair flow instead of bottling and ignoring it. While none of that stuff (going to college, getting a well paid programming job etc) helped me to get into a committed relationship or have close friendships, they sure did help me live a good life for myself. And now, I do a lot of things as I have a lot of free time on my hand. Just get the thought of improving yourself for another individual out of your head. Do it for your own satisfaction, or don't do it at all.

Enjoy the small things in life, have minimal expectations in your life, take vacations and go crazy somewhere because you don't have obligations in your personal life to any person as you are not in a relationship. Whatever you do, make sure you don't carry a heavy baggage ( both literally &amp; figuratively).  This has helped me to focus my mind elsewhere than on this shortcoming of mine. I'm preparing myself to die peacefully with no incomplete obligations. 

Life's got a plenty of other things to enjoy if you focus on them. You don't need perfect ambitions for a great life. A man spending his entire life in a prison cell can be happy with the right mindset ( though it is hard to be that way).  I hope my perspective helped you in some way. Good luck to everyone here.

Every now and then, your face might break water, giving you the smallest shred of hope - just enough to keep the struggle going.

But eventually your muscles tire. Your spasmodic flailing proves futile. No one is coming to help you and you now understand that you're too weak to help yourself. You start to sink, and panic turns into existential dread. Why you? What's going to happen? Who's going to care?

And finally a part of yourself - the truest part - gives in. You stop struggling. You stop resisting. You lose all will and strength as you dip beneath the water's surface, submerged by cold, only nothingness.

And there's a sudden wave of peace washing over you as you realise that this is it. The worst part is over. Your fate is sealed. All that remains is to close your eyes and wait until it all slips away. Peace at last.",lonely,Loneliness is like drowning,2021-10-05 03:31:34

it was kind of a let down since i had been fighting to get professional help for 7 months before that. But anyways, I got prescribed with Prozac for my low moods (idk if it’s normal for psychiatrists to do that, she didnt say anything about depression)

1. I’ve been behind on school work. I cant get myself to do it at all, and I feel terrible.
2. I haven’t been attending most of my classes (i’m anxious about my teachers confronting me about my missing work, i had a traumatic experience with a terror teacher once, so this is why).
3. my body dysmorphia has gotten worse, mainly cause of my mom’s comments on my body.
4. empty. Brain fog
5. Have had two major meltdowns these past few weeks, one of them I almost relapsed into self harm
6. Withdrawing/isolating myself from my peers. I can feel them getting worried, including my teachers. I can’t open up with them, I don’t want to because what help can they give me that I haven’t already tried myself?

So there's this girl i know and she's said quite a few harsh stuff to me and it really got into my head and made me question my self-worth (it wasn't just what she said but a combination of what she and others said that did). She's said these stuff before to my face:

\- ""XYZ is pretty, not you""

\- ""XYZ can sing, you can't""

\- When someone was complimenting me saying that I looked good, the person who complimented me asked this girl whether she agreed and she didn't really agree with it and I was standing right there!!!

\- She neverrrr compliments me but compliments everyone else

\- She always laughs so hard and gets excited when people put me down and she adds to it - it's like she's waiting for that moment.

I for a fact know that (not bragging), I objectively do look better than her even though that doesn't mean much. But do you guys think she keeeeeeeeps putting me down because she is insecure of herself? It hurts me so much when someone outrightly says stuff like that to my face and i take it to heart even though im learning not to.

if all these comments are coming from a place of insecurity or jealousy, this is really pushing me harder to work on my appearance (like i feel motivated lol)

I think she likes me personality because we used to get on quite well until she started putting me down for my looks.

I feel like I’m falling apart and I haven’t talked to no one since - no work just me in my home snorting stuff and crying all day.

I know I could get a lot of hate for this, but it is my genuine opinion because it seems like some of you guys think that you won’t be lonely anymore as soon as you get a gf/bf or whatever. I honestly was convinced that I wouldn‘t feel lonely anymore as soon as I and my gf met for the first time 9 months ago. But let me tell you, I do still feel lonely from time to time because there are problems that not even my gf can help me with and they do make me feel lonely even if she‘s right next to me. Yes there is the better emotional support because I can talk to her about a lot of stuff, but that is not what solves the problem nor does it make one feel less lonely. All I‘m trying to say here is, do not focus on finding a partner thinking that it will fix EVERY problem and issue with loneliness. I certainly can‘t tell you what to do, but keep in mind that a partner can‘t and won‘t fix all your anxieties. It‘s a lot of weight some of you try to push on another person for them to carry.

Sure the message is nice and all, but it does literally nothing for me -- **especially** when it's coming from a complete stranger that's just addressing the masses reading it. Kind of like how you are right now

I don't believe I need someone to tell me they're proud of me, or that they care about me... How could they when even I don't even care about myself? All I do in my free time is play video games and shitpost on reddit to fill the empty void in my black, lonely heart. 

I have one ""friend"" and even she agrees I'm ugly. She won't outright say it - but she doesn't disagree with me if I ever make an off-color remark about the way I look. Just yesterday I showed her a picture that my work took with my coworkers and I in it... She proceeded to list off which ones she thought were cute for no reason. Guess who wasn't on that list? Me, as fucking usual. 

Places like Photofeeler, they've never rated me anymore than a 3 at best, no matter how I take the picture or how I angle it. Acne scars don't help, then again neither does having what one girl described as ""fat cow lips."" I'm sure a lot of my physical imperfections could have easily been forgiven too - if I was taller. I SHOULD be 5'8"", and while that's not by any means tall it's a hell of a lot better than 5'3"". Thanks, chemo! 

Life's so fuckin unfair. Y'know what I need to hear? (Also the **TL;DR**)

""I think you're cute."" I've purposefully went out of my way to let other people know that my whole life -- even the girls that I genuinely didn't think actually were. But I knew they needed to hear that and that was the right thing to do, in my heart. Nobody will do that for me, though. 

Nope. I'm just supposed to sack up and move on with my life-- only to die from a stress-related coronary in my early 30s from having all these fuckin feelings multiplied by my loneliness and nowhere to let these feelings out except an internet forum that MIGHT be seen by MAYBE 10 people at best.

4645,wokeupdead13,1633316696,1,"The last post I made in this sub back in February led to an amazing person reaching out to me. We started to talk casually and eventually got to know more about each other. We kept talking and eventually it led to a long distance relationship. I've never really been one for those but with her it was different. I've never connected to someone so much before not to mention someone I've never met in person (no she wasn't a catfish either thankfully lmao). Unfortunately we lived on opposite sides of the US from each other.

 The downside other than the distance factor was that she was also battling cancer. I promised her that I would be here for her through it all and kept every bit of my word. We were waiting on her health to improve before I flew out so we could meet for the first time. I hadn't heard from her in 3 weeks now and this morning I woke up to the terrible news from her cousin that she had passed away. I feel so numb I can't even begin to describe it.

4660,cherrimushroom,1633312548,1,"I (20F) have realised that in the past couple of years I have rarely left the house by myself unless people are expecting me somewhere, ie work or meeting friends socially. 

It feels like there is a huge mental block stopping me from going outside by myself. I have been really wanting to go for a walk outside my apartment building (there is a river and nice walking tracks close by) for months but my housemate doesn’t want to come with me so I haven’t gone. It makes me so sad to see how beautiful it is outside but I am stuck inside all the time, especially since I am now unemployed and not studying. We order our groceries online so the last time I left the house was over a month ago to get my vaccine. 

In the months after high school finished but uni hadn’t started yet I used to take myself out to the shops or parks just to get out of the house and be around people since I was so isolated. My family was abusive and most of my friends from school had drifted, except for a couple who I am now close to again. I was desperately lonely at that time which I guess is why I was able to overcome the issue of not going out by myself. 

I remember once I was drinking a slushie alone in the shopping centre food court and one of my high school friends was with her sisters when she saw me, she was so awkward and later said that her sisters felt sorry for me because I was alone. I was so excited to see my friend but she didn’t want to hang out because she was always busy with her family. That is the only time period I remember going out by myself for anything non-essential. 

As a kid I only really went places with family if it was a pre-planned thing or just grocery shopping. I didn’t have any friends or pocket money to go out with (my friends didn’t really want to hang out outside of school). 

I have moved out of home this year which is amazing, thankfully I live with my best friend so I am not alone when I am at home. 

It’s really depressing for me because I am naturally someone who loves to go out to different places, before lockdown I was so excited whenever I managed to convince my friends to go out with me. My best friend and current housemate is a homebody and is content to not leave the apartment for months on end, he only ever wants to go out for specific things like seeing a certain show or going to a convention. In contrast I love to see different places, go to restaurants/cafes/venues and be outdoors. 

Before lockdown, I practically had to beg my 2 friends to hang out with me. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to be around me, they were happy to chat on the phone every day. They just didn’t want to go out of their houses. They have very low social needs and I guess mine is much higher. 

I got to go clubbing for the first time earlier this year with my old housemates and it was so much fun,  I loved it so much. Now I don’t have anyone to go clubbing with and most likely never will again. That makes me really sad because I felt alive and like myself for the first time when I was at the club. I also had my first kiss there and since online dating sucks, that may be my only kiss. 

I see people on social media going places with their friends and it makes me so sad and jealous. On the occasions I have convinced my friends to come out with me it feels like I am dragging them along all day. I just want to do normal things like hang out at the shops, go to the the beach, go to cafes etc.

My parents, especially my dad, used to make fun of people who went out by themselves. They would call them losers who had no friends etc. it’s ironic since my parents have barely and friends and rarely go out.

I know that I will have to learn to go to these places by myself or nothing will change. It just makes me so sad that I can’t experience those things with friends or a significant other. It won’t be the same and I will always be seeing friends and couples when I am there alone. Often that just makes it more depressing so I’d rather stay at home and avoid seeing that.",lonely,Loneliness + difficulty leaving the house by myself,2021-10-04 12:55:48

4676,WilSteele,1633309320,1,"Sometimes I know I'm falling apart. Lately I feel like I'm really going to break. It's like being in a deep black pit, one so deep I can't even see if there is light at the top, and all I can do is walk around bumping into solid walls. I feel there must be a door somewhere, but I can't find it.

I've always felt things deeply. I'm aware of that. Sometimes too deeply, and sometimes things were much more important to me than they were to others. But lately everything, everyone, seems different. It's like every relationship is shallow, or those who are your friends are selfish friends. Either no one wants to truly talk about anything important, like your problems, or they only want you to talk about their own problems. 

I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure last winter, any time I even mention anything about it with my supposed best friend you can tell he's either tuning it out, or he finds a way to end the conversation. Yet he'll go one and on to me about his problems which is just work drama he's talked at length about on a dozen occasions, nothing new at all. And you have to think his problems are the biggest, or you're the one who's being selfish.

The last person I knew truly cared for me was an ex-girlfriend, one of my earliest loves, and possibly one of only two true loves I ever had. She'd hurt me, and I just needed time, but she wouldn't give it to me, she needed us to be friends. I tried to tell her I couldn't, then to push her away, she wouldn't listen and kept trying. And for that, I knew she cared, so as much as it hurt to even think about her, let alone talk to her or be around her, I gave in and put in the effort to be her friend anyway. And because of her, I never felt lonely.

I knew her since she was a happy but shy little nine year old hanging out with one of my cousins. We went out once briefly in our early teens, later in my mid teens. Neither was a major relationship, we hardly saw each other, but it was enough to create in us the feelings for each other that brought us back together when I was eighteen for one of the most significant relationships of my life. So she'd been in my life for a very long time, about 30 years to be precise. Even after we moved to different places, opposite ends of the country, we kept in touch, she kept contacting me, and we'd have long conversations of blocks of text on Facebook or over the phone. And now, for five years, nothing.

She'd kept the pain going for so long, to be honest, kept me from really getting over her, kept me hanging on. But I'd known she'd cared all that time. And all for what? Just to finally ghost me. She was in the city, wanted to see me, we made arrangements and she didn't show only to text me hours later and say she'd run out of time... and then nothing. I messaged her more recently, and rather than the usual happy energetic and humorous responses of the past, it was emotionless and short. All that time... and now nothing.

But, I had always known she'd truly cared. Now, I have no one. Because of her even when alone I'd never felt lonely. Now, I am alone, and I am lonely.",lonely,Though I'd been alone I'd never been lonely... till now.,2021-10-04 12:02:00

4682,just_some_toast,1633306930,1,"So the other night, a girl I've been talking to on snapchat asked if I wanted to go on a late night walk with her. Keep in mind that this was at 10PM so most parks were closed. Now I really like this girl so I obviously said yes and drove both of us to a park I found that was open 24hrs. We walked and talked and eventually she suggested that we lay down in the grass and look at the stars. I thought that sounded nice so I went with it. We just stared at the sky for a good 20 minutes until I saw that she was slowly getting closer to me and started moving her hand towards mine. I worked up the nerve to do the same and our hands met. So there I was lying in the grass and holding hands with the girl I liked. At this point I was kinda freaking out on the inside because I've never gotten this intimate with a girl before. After a few minutes she snuggled up next to me and rested her head on my shoulder. We laid like that for a while and then I noticed that she was tilting her head up to look at me. I met her gaze and after looking into each other's eyes for a bit, we kissed and then just laid there in the grass together. No words were spoken until around 2AM when I asked if she was getting tired after she kept yawning. She said she was, so I drove her home and then went home myself. The next day I texted her saying that I really enjoyed spending time with her last night and she said she felt the same. It was the best night of my life and the first time in years that I was actually happy. The only problem is that she works 40 hours a week so trying to find time to hang out is gonna be really difficult.",lonely,Just had my first kiss and it was amazing,2021-10-04 11:22:10

In the group chat, it seems like everyone just ignores me and they have someone to click with. I’m introverted and shy but I try my best to crack jokes and make conversation. This past Friday, I met up with all of them since it had been 2 weeks since I last saw them all (I couldn’t attend the last two gaming club meetings) and they didn’t seem excited to see me, except for maybe 3. We were just walking on campus and everyone already seemed to get along very well with each other while I’m trying to get to know everyone still. Everytime I talk, no one pays attention. I worried that they’ll most likely make a separate group chat eventually and then I have no group of friends to mess around with. Also, I’m the oldest (22) while most of them are 19-20 with one being 18 and the other being 21.

Every relationship I've ever had has been ruined by my own insecurities, worrying they'll leave me, or they were insane in their own way, and made it their mission to make me suffer. All I've ever wanted is to be held by someone who cares about me, I've had it before, but that bridge is ashes, and no woman who doesn't know me already would give me the time of day. The only girls that ever show interest are ones that I do not find attractive, physically or attitude-wise. I want to provide for someone. I want to buy food and cook for a woman, drive her to appointments, build a life together, experience monotony with someone else rather than do it alone. But it feels like I will always be alone. I've changed my style, I've changed my hobbies,  I eat better, I exercise, I have a good job and a car, and no debt. And yet all this stress keeps building and building, and I have to endure it by myself. 

I see my friends with girlfriends who will be wives someday buying their first homes/entering careers and starting their futures already, and all I can think when I'm around those couples is that everything would be easier and I would be happier if I wasn't so alone.

About 3 months ago I started feeling weird. Until then I was happy with my life but it’s like everything from the past year with the pandemic and stuff just caught up with me and it manifested as the most soul crushing loneliness. 

The stupid thing is that I have so many people around me who love me. People who saw changes in me without me even having to say anything and tried to reach out. But it’s like I was suddenly in a place they couldn’t reach, they became just white noise.

I began doing silly, impulsive things. I began forming toxic relationships with people I met online who don’t know or care about me. Speaking to them felt like breathing space, but ultimately it just made things worse. They do not know me or care about me. They left me more empty than before.

Right now I feel like I’m going through the motions. This weekend my friends took me out to a bar and I spent the whole time trying to act ‘normal’ but inside wishing that things didn’t feel so wrong.

Lost in the parallels of identity
All trapped under a life of sorrow 
Getting nothing but the occasional pity
Discarded, left on the side, is myself 

Alone

I don’t know myself 
The epitome of alone in a room full of friends 
They don’t know myself 

I welcome emptiness 
I welcome pain 
I welcome depression 
Because that is alll I know 

Flurry of emotions as frequent as daylight 
Yet emotionless
Gives all myself has
Yet only makes a loss 

So I put on a mask
A mask that shows the paradox
A mask that is liked
A mask, that is mask
A mask that shows happiness, kindness
But a shattered mask beneath

Watering dead plants
Is something I enjoy
Something that breaks me
But that I keep as a symbol of hope
Of what life could be 
If that plant started to grow again

“Oh sorry, money was tight so I couldn’t invite you to the party”
I’m used to that
I’m used to isolation
Loneliness
Discarded
And the pictures tell the story that I was never missed 

No one cares about me 
Left for dead, but already dead

4708,Peter_Gilveet573,1633296792,1,"I'm not sure if that's the right place, or the right time, or whatever. There's just something stuck in my throat that I think maybe somebody here can identify with (or no, I really don't know), I'm not even sure how to put in words, what I know is that have lot to do with sex and the idea of humiliation. I watch people and everybody, even myself, we are humiliating people all the time. Sometimes we don't even know, but we are, judging every fucking time. I'm feeling like I hardly could trust anyone, and even if I could, something about people disgust me so much. Like, we're always seeking something to us, even when we're not. When we think we're helping others, in some way, is primarily to make ourselves feel better, I know that shit cause I developed some weirdass superhero complex which is the most selfish thing ever. I've been fetishising the idea of a loner, I freaking know I do, and I've been quite hating happy people in some way, like there's something wrong with being happy, I feel selfish when I'm happy.
I'm just crazy because I've seen people being humiliated ans it's making me feel sick, cause I can't stand it, I can't understand it and I can't do any fucking thing about it, sometimes I even worsen things. I can't stop thinking about sex in association with the idea of humiliation, cheating makes me want to vomit in ways I can't even explain. I can't stop seing sex as a way to cheating and to superficiality, and I know it makes no single sense, but I can't stop seing sex and intimacy as a gigantic open road to humiliation, to vulnerability; I desire and hate sex so much sometimes I wish I could be asexual, it would be way easier. I can't stop thinking that's why there are so many fucking loners here, loners in every fucking way. Loners because everybody wants power and there are people with no power. To be the hottest, with most control, most money, most sex, most happiness. Like, we're animals. Animals do that, have pleasure and survive. This is so hollow to me is like I lost any meaning I could perceive about life. If everybody works that way, is damn easy to be lonely. You're lonely cause you're boring, toxic, hateful, uninteresting, ugly, without attitude, any shit. Why can't everybody be happy? Why it had to be the loner and the one full of friends? The poor and the rich? The happy one and the guy who wants to end his life every single day? My coworkers are always judging people's appearances, this make me sick, it's like all my fears come together. Somebody out there -- maybe lots of people -- think I'm disgusting, and then I find myself weak for not standing, because the strongest survives and the weaker perishes. The science books explain me the world that way, but I can't fucking stand it, it's so fucking unfair, maybe that's why religion is a thing. Sex is almost the embodiment of all that. 
So I've been romanticizing the idea of loneliness, unhealthy as hell. I have a suicidal friend, instead of helping is like I'm giving him motives. I'm not sure where I'm getting, I'm frustrated and depressed with a lot of stories here and in other places and even IRL. I don't even drink to use that as excuse, I'm just weird.

I’ve never had friends. I’ve never been able to party and I spent my 18th party alone. That’s also because I had invited my classmates to my 17th party. But nobody came.

And, worst of all, I never felt good enough for a relationship, as i said above. Never been able to attract a girl’s interest. Absolute nothing, even if i go to the gym and feel good with my body. I got my own interests too. 

Love is just something I don’t see in my future. It might sound a stupid reason why to cut my veins, but I’ve always dreamt about it, but it never came, and I don’t know how ( and if ) it might come.

I can’t even do that.  The only people willing to give me a chance are those I don’t find attractive.  I settle because experience has taught me there is no point in doing anything else. 

Wishful thinking (eg. you’re a catch, etc) is worthless and only makes the person saying it feel better.  It doesn’t matter if you can’t find a partner who brings you joy and you bring joy too.

But that didn't help change the fact that those two years were the worst years of my life, so far. I was overloaded with work, procrastination issues due to my stress, and horrible sleep issues. What's astonishing is that when the pandemic hit and my state went into lock-down, I actually felt a bit better. The next school year (2020-2021) was similar. In May, I heard about a summer program I could join. Thirty-six days of travelling through other states with 40 or so other teenagers + counselors. Initially, I was reluctant to join, but I eventually did. When the trip started two days after summer vacation did, I was prepared to go through the same isolation. And that's exactly what happened, at least for the first twelve days. Then I began to notice this girl I found to be very attractive. The trip continued on for another 3 weeks or so. A few days before it ended, I spoke to one of my friends about my emotional problems. But on the last day, I decided to tell her that I really liked her. We ended up hugging after that. And I think it was then that I began to realize that I really needed to stop being so isolated. But the next day, the trip ended. A few weeks after, I briefly re-established contact with that girl. We talked a few times, but as of mid-September, we haven't. I'm afraid that I pushed her away because I talked to her about my issues. But whilst I was doing so, I didn't care. I hadn't been able to talk to anybody else about these issues and feel relieved. But we've lost contact due to our lives going onwards. And I still have that feeling I shouldn't have spoken to her about my issues. And with that, I've lost contact with almost everyone from that trip. 

I'm tired of hearing stupid shit like ""just move on and/or find something to fix your anxiety."" How am I supposed to fix it? I've tried numerous therapists, numerous medications, etc. It hasn't helped a bit. ""Just change your view on life!"" and ""Step out of your comfort zone!"" is what they say. People who say that need to go ram this nonsense right up there, because it doesn't help. They'll say ""I know it's hard!"" and other things that don't help.

I just turned 26 the other day and I just don't know what to do anymore. Out of my like four friends, I feel like a pathetic extra, just kept around out of pity. I know it's not true, but it hurts nonetheless. Two of them are making pretty good money, and all four of them are better adjusted for society than me, mostly because I was diagnosed as a child with Asperger's Syndrome. They all make more money than me, have better jobs and are able to work more hours than me, have each had relationships... I feel like a child compared to them, a stupid, useless child.

Despite my Asperger's, I recently have been cripplingly lonely. It never bothered me growing up, but now I don't get the same satisfaction that I used to from watching movies or playing video games by myself. It's like there's no point in doing the things I like if I'm all alone while doing them. But it doesn't matter, no one's ever had an interest in me aside from one woman, but... I can't be with them because they're in a relationship with someone else because I fucked up a couple years ago and withdrew from them. I don't even really care about being the only person I know who's still a virgin, I just want someone to give me a hug, hold me and tell me I'm not the worthless, pathetic loser I feel like I am. But that won't happen, I don't deserve to be cared about, and so I silently march on until I just can't take it anymore and become just another statistic about depressed adults with autism.

When it came to my work I didn't tell my family or anyone close to me because I wanted to keep it close to my heart (which later I found out I should). Sorry I'll get to the point, anyways I was having a conversation with my brother thirty minutes ago and we started talking about things I wanted to  do. So I thought this was the perfect time to bring up the podcast, so I said ""well actually I have a podcast that I would like to pursue"", he proceeded to laugh in my face and say ""who will listen to it?, no one cares about you?, your a bum, you're a nobody, you will never be anything"" etc. My anxiety and heart went through the roof, it led to us screaming at each other for like a good 45 minutes before I just walked away and started crying.

My gf, who I genuinely loved with all my heart left me so she could go out and party. We always discussed the matter of going out and partying.

My plan in life was to go to school and join the military then after service finish school. Unfortunately, that wasn’t allowed in my family, instead I had a mother that enjoyed burying her kids/make someone look bad and everyone to feel powerful. My father is a G.C that told me going to school would be useless, since he said I’d never make it that far (I was a teen at the time). The reason he didn’t want me to go to school is so I can be controlled easier with the lack of education at the time; like corporations/LLC don’t like education at the bottom of the of the corporate ladder, due to bigger numbers.

Honestly, I thought it would stop there with the level of depressing family drama just to turn to a friend over 8 years, that kept building an army of rumors with friends/exes and, his only example of a parent is a person that only used the lovers for money, sex, &amp; drugs. To grow to become a opportunist networking &amp; manipulating people with money to achieve fame, security, &amp; possibly a business that my family built up to watch it fail due to lack of education (Ironic), but the licensing is there which is the key asset.

As I joined the military it’s was insinuated by surrounding people that my old job was telling people that I might be “Schizophrenic” or “Paranoid”, which I think it was a prepped slanderous tool to make me fail as I obtained a license, while I was servicing, and was going to use it while I finish up school (People became jealous &amp; use the mental decline to aid them, covid).

Let’s talk about a change of colors in people, and I’m not lying about everything that happen within a years time. Before joining the military, my ex-girlfriend was caught cheating, as a result of her guilt she decided to try to bury me, because her cheating was my fault? She kept in contact with my step mother, joined a stagehand company to work and use as a tool to bury me, which isn’t good for business, and my old friend that she stated that sexually harassed her are friends for networking reasons, then tried to put a restraining order against me, which didn’t work because no grounds. After we broke up all my friends took her side because of sexual attraction. Then my old friend tried using Starbucks employees to bury me by his friendship with some of them then contacted my new friends which had friends in Starbucks/worked there.

Again, this wouldn’t be an issue, but now I’m being puppy guarded by neighbors to find out what my next plans are in hopes that I don’t start a business, unless I become friends with them......... I don’t trust that. So to make things even more fun the people I helped get a jobs in the past all want to make sure I don’t use my license, and want me to become a bum....not far off. Again, this all shot up because I have a license, which I can’t use due to being national guard, one unstable officer or SGT could destroy any service members business, plus people don’t think you should own a business till after service but again part-time soldier.

Here is the summary/rumors to jealous people that don’t want me to succeed, Step mother girlfriend works for Edison energy company/ revenue over 13 million and their markets reach is over 200 miles. The Icee company, I asked my service manager did they put something out about me because their accounts such as taco bell knew who I was and I didn’t service those accounts receivable make friends, he said no. That companies reach is thought the United States with 8 accounts that they service that reach through the United States as well, which included Starbucks, Target, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, 7-Elevens, Chevrons, Shell gas, &amp; Arco. My ex might have been in contact with my step mom to join a swingers club called iaste local 122 (stage hand),which spans over my state and seen in marvel movies and more. All that drama jumped over to my military service which is the National Guard, which cops &amp; other law enforcement is apart of, double dipping in cash. 

I have no one to stand up for me because of the intimidation factor of these companies, and it feels like I have a gun to my head with the phrase of, “do as I say or else.” Just because I got license and people got jealous. I’m still a service member &amp; now my jobs are being affected but I’m not locked up? Feels like my entire military career will be me being buried &amp; people taunting me to get me to hit them, and I’ve already had a SSG touch me and say I’m a federal agent &amp; a other SSG if I wanted to have sex with me with witness, also told stop going to school as well later down the road (fuck these people).",lonely,"Blacked mailed &amp; buried by family, friends, then joined the military, only to be used against me.",2021-10-04 02:21:52
4761,This_Life_Sux,1633273993,1,"First let me say that i know that i'm obviously NOT the loneliest person in the world. However does it help anyone to know that other people are doing worse than yourself? It never helped me.  I'm not trying to make a competition out of it and don't want to hurt others with that statement.  
This is just how i feel constantly. 

If you'd tell me other people have it worse all it does is making me want to meet those 'like minded' people. I wish i could meet someone that is as lonely as me so that at least someone could understand me a bit.

Even writing this costs me a lot of energy and i don't even know where to begin.

Maybe say something about myself?   
I'm 32 and i live in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.  
I don't even know how anyone has ever met another person in this shithole. 

Friends are nonexistent. I never had anyone that understood me. Connecting with people is super hard for me because my hobbies are just videogames, movies, books and art - stuff i can do alone. Nothing that can help me socialize with people.

The only people i talk to are coworkers and i don't like any of them and i'm sure they feel the same about me too.   
I hate work and yet i feel even more alone when i'm not working. Every minute i'm awake i feel depressed af and have to do various things to make my mind shut up.  
For example i cannot bear silence, i have to constantly either listen to music or something like podcasts in the background. 

Therapy did not help me. It didn't help me cure my loneliness one bit.  
Now someone surely is gonna throw 'you gotta love yourself first yadayada...' at me and i do agree. However how is this ever supposed to work?  
I don't hate myself but if no one is ever giving you any positive attention in your whole life how is that supposed to work? I've been bullied my whole school life because i was the shortest one in class and that has left some serious scars.

I'm ugly and short. So i've been ruled out by natural selection from the start. Just how do people cope with that? The realization that someday i will rot away alone in my room is haunting me.  
Romantic love is out of the question for me but i cannot even get love for money. In the city where i live there are no prostitutes and i don't think that would help me much anyway. I'd prefer to pay a woman just to lie in bed with me and talk.

I could go on for so much longer. This is not even half of it... but who is gonna read such a wall of text anyway.

After that came jumping from group to group, when playing video games or discovering a new interest. No more long lasting friendships, only a people who stayed for a few months until they just lost interest in me and stopped responding to me.

Or there was just too much drama and my mental health forced me out of those groups.

When it comes to friends irl.. never had any after middle school. I don't get how people people even make friends, if the ones they made in childhood  happened to disappear. 

I feel like it all boils down to the fact that I was really quiet as a kid and never learned how to properly socialize  Was selectively mute even. My father got angry at me for not making friends, while my mother coddled me and thought I'd grow out of it and become a people person like she did..

4791,notmuon,1633252514,1,"im 14. i have always been not the most talkative or outgoing person in my childhood, but i still had a small, but tight-knit group of close friends + some friends/accquiantances. one of my close friends lived in the same apartment complex 1 floor below mine place and we would visit eachother almost daily. we would play videogames and stuff and enjoy ourselves.

that changed when i was in the 5th-6th grade. that close friend who lived next to me moved out and lived in a different part of town. i still saw my other close friend in school, but he was mostly socializing with his own friend group, while i was talking with other classmates. i still didnt feel lonely, as i socialized with half of the class, even making some friends there.

then everything changed again, but for the worse. i soon went to a different private school with a way better education system, meals and etc. (public schools in russia are really bad, maybe even worse than american schools) once again, im not the most outgoing person and making friends, especially at school, isnt fast for me, but i managed to talk with some classmates, sometimes hanging out with them after school.

then everyone, whom i had talked to, left the school due to various reasons. one of my classmates liked programming at that time and so did i. we couldve been close friends, hadnt he left to a more programming/math centered school. bcus of that i stopped programming entirely, realizing it might not be the thing for me. it was after christmas and after that everything felt... empty. i didnt know who to talk to bcus i didnt think that anyone would want to talk to me (i dont think they want to now).

now in school everyone sees me as ""the quiet kid"". everyone in school arent even accquiantances to me, theyre more like strangers. i feel like im a background character, not even an npc, because an npc at least talks. i dont even want to talk to anyone there, basically self-isolating myself.

now the only friends i have are the few online friends i have. i enjoy being in their company, but it doesent feel the same as having an irl one, because it feels more real having someone you like being with being with you rn in the same spot and timezone as you. you feel a more deeper connection than with an internet friend, so i feel like my online friends are a bit insincere and dont care as much about me as i do about them.

i feel like this has to do with the online world. it has given me a lot of benefits (learning the english language, knowing a lot about history, geography, making me find people with similar interests) but it has made me antisocial and lazy. i heavily procrastinate and it might be because videogames and other stuff. sometimes i just cant stop being at the computer all the time, despite my parents being worried about me and trying to make me stop.

idek at this point what should i do. im uncertain about my future. will i make friends or will i continue to suffer in my own antisocial behaviour? i just want someone to talk to me irl, to find someone who has the same interests as me.

4792,insecure_alt-,1633248782,1,"I'm almost 21 years old. As a kid I was bullied and treated unfairly by everyone at my first school, I think that's what messed me up socially. After that I switched schools and made some friends, but most of people still picked on me for reasons unknown. All the girls I knew in highschool despised me, and really just threw so many insults at me for no apparent reason. I was a nice guy, so I never really pushed back, so I was just an easy target I guess. In my 8th grade I had enough and basically went silent up until my senior year. The couple friends I had wondered why I didn't talk to girls, or anyone for that matter. I just told them I wasn't interested in a relationship or anything like that, because that was easier than talking about my past. They bought it so I've just stuck with that reason ever since. I've always wanted a relationship though. In my 10th grade I liked this one girl. That year I decided to go to our schools homecoming dance, just to try and hang out and be social. This girl I liked approached my friend, I was right next to him. She starts talking about how she wants to have a dance with someone, but she doesn't know who. My friend suggests me, but she says she can't because I'm ""ugly"". Looking back I'm glad she didn't want to dance with me because I have no clue how to dance, and would have probably made a fool of myself, but it hurt a bit how the one time I try and go out and be social another female has to reinforce the idea in my head that they all hate me. After that I no longer liked her for obvious reasons. (Nobody knew I liked her to begin with by the way).

In 11th grade I got my first job at a local restaurant. It really helped me just talk to people in general because I was a host. 11th grade ended and this girl from school, who I recognized but never interacted with her started working there for a summer job. Since it was basically me and her working host together all the time we got to know each other a bit. This was first experience talking to a girl that was being friendly. I liked her alot, probably because she was the only girl to talk to me, but I still liked her and I know she liked me back. It was then senior year, and everything fell apart. Covid hit my town and everything shut down, school went all online. Nobody knew when school was going to shut down, but this happened on the last day we had in person, me and a friend were walking back to class to pickup some stuff. She was in the room we were going to and we ran into each other. Me and her talked a bit, my friend was in on the conversation a little. When we were done talking we said bye to each other, and said we'd see each other on Monday. Me and my friend walked out and he told me I should ask her out to prom because he thought she liked me. I said I was already thinking about it. 

But after that day I never saw her again. This was 2020, so covid was on a rampage, so school shut down and we didn't have a prom or graduation. The thing that sucks is I had mentally prepared myself to ask her to prom, I know she would have said yes because I know we were at that stage in a developing relationship. I hate looking back because I wish I would have just asked her out sooner. Now it's been a year later. She has a boyfriend now. I'm pretty much over her because it's not hard to just accept things and move on by now. 

Right after my ""graduation"" I tried going to college for a semester. It was all online and I hated it. I pushed through and finished out that semester, though I took the next semester off and worked a terrible 80 hour work week factory job for 6 months after that. I'm back to college now that's in person, and I feel so left out. I commute so it's hard enough to meet people. I haven't talked to anyone yet. I just feel so lonely and I'm back to worrying that no matter how hard I try nothing will work out with a girl. I hate it so much because I've always wanted a relationship but I cant even get to a point where I find someone that might be interested in me. I don't understand because I don't think I'm unattractive, I really have my life together, but still nobody likes me. Im so frustrated and about ready to just give up again just like I did in the 8th grade. Like my friends have told me they can't even see me with a girl, I know it sounds harsh and rude, but I can't either at this point. Everyone I know has had many relationships and has no problem finding girls to be with. Like we are just sitting in a restaurant and these girls come up and ask for everyone's snap but mine. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I don't know why someone can't just give me a chance. I feel like I don't even have enough experience for a relationship, like I've only talked to one or two girls in my whole life. I want to believe there's hope, but I've wanted to believe that for years and years. I see all these people so happy together and I just want that so much but I feel like it will actually never happen. I don't know why I can't talk to my friends about this, I just feel like it would be weird talking to them about it because they think I just don't care about relationships. I'm so frustrated and tired of it, I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know what I did to deserve this life.",lonely,Why,2021-10-03 19:13:02

I'm new around here and I just wanted to share this. I'm 27, due to my religion when I was younger I never had a girlfriend even though I could. In recent years I've had two sex partners, however I never saw them as possible girlfriends, and every single time that I'm interested in someone they are either in a relationship or are dating someone. For example, the last person I asked out said yes but she never confirmed me a date and never gave me an update, and just recently I saw some photos that apparently someone is courting her. Also, I see that my friends are in a relationship and they are happy and that really bummed me out because I would like the same. I know that I'm not good looking or with a great body, but I'm funny and nice, and I know that I would be a great partner to someone. I'm just tired of being alone, sometimes I wanna cry because I feel so powerless. I know that I have myself and I'm in peace with myself, but I see years passing by and I'm just still, wanting to love someone, just alone.

4794,MamaRabbit4,1633246009,1,"This is something I’ve given up trying to answer to those who have never experienced debilitating loneliness. 

I love my children (four teens). I will not overly burden them with my own struggles or loneliness. 

I crave adult conversation and connection. Having my person when at events. To sleep next to. To talk about my day. Have intimacy. 

Kids don’t fulfill those needs. Not at all. 

I share 50/50 custody with their dad. And when the kids aren’t with me I just work my ass off or watch Netflix until really late. Trying to fill that hole of loneliness with distraction. Go to bed so late that I exhausted and fall asleep immediately instead of laying there sobbing.

4800,Unlucky_Ad7732,1633241145,1,"i cant take it anymore. its eating me up on the inside. i cant fucking live like this.

i have pratically no friends. i had a few in high school but we’ve pretty much stopped talking. i have one childhood friend but we rarely talk. so basically, i have no friends.

i am a month and a few weeks into college and i am still unbearably lonely. joined a club but i keep on missing the meetings, which are infrequent as is. hopefully i will meet people through it.

but basically, i have nobody. people pass me by, completely unaware of how utterly sad and hopeless i feel. i just walk by without saying a thing, like everyone else.

nobody knows. nobody knows the utter desolation inside of me. nobody knows how lonely i feel. nobody knows how existential my thoughts are, how i feel as if i will never find what it is i truly want to do with my life.

i dont even know who i am, because i never have the time to think about it. just constantly stressed and depressed.

lonely. so fucking lonely. so alone. so isolated.

what is it like, what is it like to have an irl friend whom you truly love? who you truly care about? who you dont just like, but feel a genuine emotional connection to?

what is it like to visit a friend’s house on a late saturday night and hang out, talk, watch a movie, wrestle, go to the park, visit the mall, and interact with? a friend who you just dont like, but genuinely love?? who you feel as if you could talk about anything with?

i… have never experienced this feeling before. in all of my 18 years of life.

and it eats me up inside. it makes me want to cry.

all of my friendships have felt incredibly superficial. we just talked about either school or video games all the time. i shouldve opened up to my previous friends emotionally, so i am not trying to cast blame. they are good people. i was an idiot who had and has no self-worth or initiative.

i dont wanna consume the latest piece of entertainment just to relate to other people. i hate how all of my friendships were only founded based off the shit we liked. i may as well not have a friendship at all if we can only relate to each other through school, youtube videos, or video games.

THIS SHIT DOESNT MATTER. none of it does!! people matter. i hate how i feel as if i have to “work” for friendship. like i have to custom tailor myself for people to like me, because i just dont really care about anything. i have dreams but my depression overrides my autonomy. so i cant do anything.

im so fucking uninteresting. i have no personality. i hate my life and i hate myself. i am inhuman.

I was definitely introverted growing up and was never a part of the social kids in school. It just kind of seems like people just pretended I didn't exist or wasn't worth their time. I rarely tried to get into social situations outside of track and cross country in high school, but that's also because I just felt like I couldn't.

I'm now a senior in college and I think I've greatly improved with talking to people and being social. However, I'm still usually alone. I always feel like the ""backup friend"" in most of the groups I've been in and I just feel like people don't care about me as much.

And of course, I still haven't dated. I'm not ugly, I am decently muscular, and I'm 5'11 (because that matters to many people apparently), and I can also now say that I'm pretty good at socializing. But I just don't know what to do or how to start. My university is around 60% female, so there's definitely no shortage of women. But I just don't know how to meet them. And me not trying, like in high school, is no longer a valid reason because I am a part of several clubs and student leadership organizations. I just don't know why it's like this for me.

I just feel like I don't have the key to that door, like I'm cursed, like I speak a different language or I'm just not a human. Tinder doesn't do anything for me either, as I don't get matches.

Feel free to ignore if if you do choose to read this Im sorry if nothing I say makes sense or is confusing, I probably won’t include much context for the things I mention being as this post is more for me to vent into the void.

Im honestly not really sure how to start, I just feel worthless, pathetic, and like a disappointment. I hate everything about myself from my non existent personality to my lack of talent and purpose, my looks, my past, and I hate the fact that I am getting worse at pushing down my emotions. My entire life has been dedicated to not being a failure yet here I am, feeling like I’m failing everyone around me. I can’t talk for the life of me or express my thoughts as you’ll be able to see for yourself through this pathetic novel. speaking is incredibly difficult for me and therefore even though people try to talk to me I end up making the other person feel awkward. I’m an awful friend, older sister, and an even worse daughter. I’m never good enough, I suck at everything, I don’t deserve my friends or anything good that comes my way. I recently found out Im on pace to become my schools valedictorian and instead of being happy I feel worse than ever. I’m no one special, there are so many people who deserve the title much more than me, Im a fraud. I’m a fucking fraud. If I do become Valedictorian Im sure everyone will hate me and I’ll feel undeserving of the title but if I don’t get it I’ll disappoint everyone and myself. The way I feel is the complete opposite of how I present myself. Everyone thinks I’m collected, like I’m a ray of sunshine, always happy, always smiling, respectful, shy, this perfect person incapable of every doing anything wrong, but that’s not me at all. I can’t do anything right, i let down everyone that’s important to me, there isn’t a single day where I don’t feel like garbage or where I don’t wish that life would just end. how I act in public or online is the furthest thing from an accurate reflection of me. Im so tired, Im tired of everything, I’m exhausted, and i can’t even stick to just facing my own problems, it seems like there’s a giant banner of my head that says “free therapy” or “unload all of your problems into here”, I’m glad people see me as a happy person who has everything figured out but Im tired of people using me as some sort of therapist.  I of course still give everyone a listening ear and unconditional support because I’m super afraid of having people dislike me. I can’t even help myself, how am i supposed to help others. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m falling apart I can’t even form clear sentences I’m just overwhelmed by everything, I haven’t slept in 3 days thinking about school, my future, and everything that’s wrong with me, my brain just won’t shut up i feel like I’m losing it. I’ve developed the ability to act completely different than how I feel. You wouldn’t be able to see a hint of sadness in person, and through text even less! It’s so easy to act ok through the screen. Just add exclamation points and a smile at the end of everything, maybe a few emojis, and you’re the happiest person in the world! 🥳 anyone can do it, I just don’t know how long I can keep up this act. The only reason I haven’t done anything to end things is because I’m a coward and it would be selfish to die, I know it would break my moms and my sisters’ hearts and I couldn’t do that to them. I have no intention of harming myself but I really don’t want to keep going. Im so afraid of the future, I have no aspirations or goals, my existence is meaning less, and as a senior in hs I feel like I’m running out of time to get my shit together and decide what I plan to do for the rest of my life. I’m so full of fear and hatred, specifically towards myself and my shit father who has been able to continue to ruin my life without even being in it. I can’t sleep due to me reliving events he has caused and I can’t even hear the sound of a phone ringing without getting anxious and feeling my heart sink. I despise him, I feel like everything that’s wrong with me is somehow his fault. I often get compared to him by family on his side in an attempt to connect us since I’ve refused to see or speak to him for several years, and it’s just so fantastic being compared to the person you hate the most, doesn’t make me feel like shit at all being compared to a manipulative, emotionally abusive, misogynistic, and narcissistic parent. I get criticized for not forgiving my father and I feel like no one is on my side. The only thing that makes me feel ok is validation from father figures and I feel pathetic for admitting it. There isn’t a single person in my life who has seen me break and I intend on keeping it that way, Im worried that if I ever share how I feel the people who I don’t even deserve to have will leave me. They’ll think Im crazy, I’ve been putting on this act for way too long now, it’s too late to pretend to be anything other than ok. Thank you for listening to the pathetic ramblings of a sleep deprived teen and sorry my thoughts are so scattered, as I mentioned speaking and just expressing myself in general is not my forte.

Even if i work out i will still be a poor frame, short dude. As i was lubing up my fleshlight and getting ready to pull up another video, i stopped. I tried to keep up with what i wanted to do. I told myself, ""you have to, you arent human but you have human desires, this is the only way you can control yourself completely"" i still didnt move. ""youre not a man, this is what you have to do, women want to be with men"" I thought about the hundreds of couples i saw at my job today. I remembered how they touched each other, how the women looked looking at their men. The men were so much better looking than me, taller, stronger. It made me wish i could be born with the genetics to be like them. I will never have a woman look at me like that. I looked at all the men who were better than me all day. To go home after such abuse and screw a rubber toy felt..humiliating. I cant keep living like this but i dont see an escape in sight. I wish i was never born. Or if i was, at least be born as a normal man so id at least have something to work with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work hard i try to tell myself, yet no woman wants me. I try to tell myself i am worth something but i am extremely touch starved and have gotten reassurance i am ugly. I am only useful for what i can do, if i can no longer do the work i do, i get tossed to the side, not valued as any more than an object. And its been this way my entire life. Girls might one day want me for my money but i will not be a woman's fantasy. I will just be good enough for the time being. Tell better comes along. And in that time i cant be imperfect. I will be competing with so many dudes.

I am an introvert and shy, but I truly care about people that are a part of my life (I am a cancer after all) and can count on one hand how many true friends I have. I will be the first to admit that I am awkward in social settings as well. I was bullied in high school and don’t have a lot of confidence in myself. Because of this, meeting new people is very intimidating and it takes me a long time to warm up to people. 

I’ve been at my current job for about 3 years and I have a handful of coworkers that I consider my work family. One of them was supposed to get married last year, but then had to move her wedding twice due to COVID. In the summer of 2020, we had gotten to know each other more and became friends. One day on our break last year, she had told me that if I wanted, I could come to her wedding reception, after the dinner to celebrate. I was so excited and couldn’t wait! I didn’t mind that I wasn’t invited to the entire thing, I figured that the guest list was already made prior to her having to move her date. And I know how expensive a wedding is, since I’m currently planning my own. Since then, I would say that we have became pretty good friends and have spent time together outside of work with other coworkers.

Fast forward to the day of the wedding. I confirmed with her what time to be there after dinner. I’m about to start getting ready and I see a post from a coworker. There is about 10 other coworkers and they are all at her wedding ceremony. I instantly feel my eyes well up with tears and I can’t control how upset I feel. I had only known of 3 coworkers that she was very close with that were invited, but I didn’t think that so many others were invited and I wasn’t. Two of the coworkers pictured have only been working with us for about 6 months, so the whole idea of the guest list being set last year was complete crap in my mind. I told my fiancé that I did not want to go anymore because of how upset I was and I ended up spending the evening on the couch watching movies. I still texted her, apologizing for not being able to make it, and wished her congratulations, as I was sitting there crying. 

I don’t mean to sound petty in this post, but this just has me feeling so down on myself, that I’m not good enough to be included in things. I don’t know what I expect to come of this.

I started thinking about how my childhood experiences, of not being able to go out, of being criticized all the time, and yes of having anxiety or my personal personality characteristic caused all of my problems in connecting with people. And I also thought of how I kept going back to my parents now I was able to understand the grey area of my parents were really there for me in some ways, but in being unconditional and developing love they failed miserably so having that distinction instead of black and white thinking helped me calm down.

 I thought of how people directly took advantage of that, people who took advantage that I had no support to fall back on like they did. That I had to fight for my independence while they had it handed to them as teenagers, could go out, etc. It only bites at me now because every potential friend I meet has those things to fall back upon. 'remember when i was 14 and having a sleep over' When I have no such experiences to talk about, no I didn't hang out with buddies younger though I wish I got to. Trying to relate with normal people. There are so many damn people why do they all fall back on this?

I also thought of how I directly paid my dues in therapy, and volunteering, the countless times I joined groups, tried to meet people, directly talked to them. All the work I put in to love myself and not hate myself. 

It's all about taking actions to help yourself be better but it gets to a point when you Have actually done *all of it*, and the reason is you can no longer do it anymore. You can no longer go out alone anymore or join groups and pretend you don't hate yourself when you talk because you know you do and you are tired of fighting your own battle. And then try to pretend you are interested in the subject, of trying to talk to people my age, and then connecting with people in their 60s. Meet people and try to not blurt out that actually you'd be happy if you had one friend but you can't seem to just accept yourself. The pain I go through when I force myself: 'you're going alone again. they can tell you hate yourself. why are you doing this, for other people? why are you still trying so hard. All those people from college are working good jobs and have their relationships. why am I the only again? What the fuck exactly happened to me again. Why do I still feel like this like I was 10 years old. If I don't go, sitting at home isn't helping. I get so angry.'

I just hope there are people who could see me and pray for me. The past therapists I had. Those friendly people in the past. I'm just hoping that not all of it was malicious and they could actually see that they got things I never did and I was actively trying to work around it, instead of taking advantage of me.

4878,codecrunchie,1633202514,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions!

One day I am depressed and can’t do anything or have the desire to do anything and then the other day I want to do everything all at once and in a few days or hours I am back at the same old slump. It’s the fact that this keeps on repeating that makes me mad. It’s either I have to do everything or I can’t do anything. I don’t know when I will fall out of this cycle.

I truly appreciate my parents trying their best to support me in getting my mental health back in order and providing me with resources to fix me. But the thing is, with the sudden outpour of help and understanding I feel like everything I have felt in the past two years have dissipated, I’m not even sure if I was depressed. Every feeling of sorrow, desperation, hopelessness and worthlessness I felt seems like it never existed to begin with.

I still don’t feel happy. Honestly, I feel nothing but I am not sad. Yet it is frustrating when what you have felt disappears in an instant and now you come to question whether all this was a façade that you created. But it was so real. All the emotions feel distant now.

I don’t know how to explain how I’ve been feeling when the doctor asks. I haven’t met the doctor yet but I feel like when I would meet them I would be completely blank. Like everything I have felt was a lie.

Right now, I want to get out of my bed and do something. I have been creating playlists on how to photoshop pictures, sketching lessons, and various other things. The thing is I want to do it all now and the thought that if that's the case then I would never be completing anything is overburdening.

A couple of days ago was my birthday and I felt very loved by a lot of people, but I feel that I am not close to anyone, and probably that I would never be. My strongest points of sadness are in the weekends, during the week I feel mostly fine, because I feel accompanied by my classmates and some friends, but just when the weekend arrives my sadness increases, everyone plans where they will go, What they will do, and I have never been part of these plans. I ask them what they would do on the weekend, to see if that way I can receive an invitation, but no, they tell me about their plans, without even thinking about me (which they shouldn't, but I would like them to). Usually I get tired of people, I don't like many of them and I tend to walk away, but at the same time I have this desire and necessity, to go out with them. The more I know someone, the more disappointed I am, and I know that probably when I get this thing I desire so much, I will end up disappointed. I am alone, and I think I always will be. I don't see any hope of getting better anytime soon, but I see my adult life even worse. I have been to two psychologists and a few talks at school with some teachers, they have all told me that I am not well and that I need to do something to be better. Everyone has also told me that many of the things I feel are not ""normal"" for my age. Right now, I’m not going to any psychologist, and I haven’t talked to no one of my problems for more than a year. I haven’t done anything for a month, no activity whatsoever, my favorite activities have bored and disinterested me. I do not have something that motivates me at the moment and I doubt very much that I will in the future. I went to two friends asking if they would like to go out; Mainly what I wanted is to be invited to one of the meetings or parties to which they go….

The other person I asked was yesterday, I still haven't received an answer ... I don't know if I will. I have said this to both of them at an emergency point when I feel like I can no longer handle this painful feeling inside of me. I don't like how my actual situation is, but I think that if I continue like this, my future will be worse. I don't know what to do, I feel like every day I am drowning more and more, until there will be a point where I will make a decision, which probably a year ago I said I would never make ... every day I think more and more about making that decision.

I have more loving and caring friends than I can count, some of which have done things for me I can never repay. I have a plethora of good friends, acquaintances, educational colleagues, ect. who I have met and appreciate here at college. I’ve single handedly connected a web of hundreds  of people at my college who now have friends they’d never meet without me. I am invited constantly out every social event you could imagine. If your still reading this, you must be asking yourself “why is this idiot posting here then?” 

Well the reason is that even though I am a master socializer on a platonic level, I am the worst people on earth at attracting anyone romantically. I’ve tried and tried but in the end I get shut down. I have all the friends in the world but not a single kiss to show for it. I’m a kiss-less short fat virgin loser whose only good at making friends with people who are all objectively much more attractive and valuable than me. It’s like I’m cursed. It’s like the sheep who made friend with the sheepdogs. They love me, appreciate me, help me, but at the end of the day were just not the same people. Imagine going to a bar and seeing 10 6’ 3” handsome dudes all hanging out and having a good time, and at the end of the table is their 5’5” fat and ugly friend that’s out of place. That’s me. All the women I know have never even showed a morsel of romantic affection towards me. I have introduced countless couples, one night stands, lovers, ect. but none of its for me. 

The attention me and the close friends attracts at parties is palpable. Every woman in there wants to fuck every single one of my friends, but not me. Not to be mean, but not even the unattractive girls like me. You know how many times I’ve walked up to a few of my friends at a party while their talking to strangers, and my friends literally have to spell out the fact that we came together? Doesn’t happen to anyone else We know. Attractive people and ugly people tend to not mix in friend groups, but I’m the sorry piece of shit who was born in the wrong body I guess. 

I’m making this post and asking if anyone here is in the same boat as me? How do I get away from this curse???? Please. I’ll take any advice.

Ugh I just want to fucking cry for eternity, it really hurts what he did to me, I’ve gave him everything, love, care, attention, staying by his side no matter what and I do anything to make him happy, I even stay up at nights for him and I’ve skipped classes for him when he felt really down, I got in so many troubles for him, I save up money for him to pay money for his uni stuff, why do I do that? Well my bf he’s the only person I have who I would go to when the whole world is against me, back then he used to love me a lot, he used to call me cute names, he used to calm me down and he also was always by my side then all the sudden he have changed and we went through so many arguments because of his change, he stopped loving me, he stopped caring about me, he talks so cold to me and idk why he started to be like that towards me, he says he loves me but where? His friends says he loves me as well but I don’t see it anymore, I tried to talk to him asking him why he changed and why he talks so cold to me and he said ""I’m always like that’s"" or he says that he feel stressed, and I was like ok sure I understand that but even in summer vacation he barely loves me, just rarely, we used to sleep on calls with our camera on then we stopped.. we used to talk to each other on the call with microphones on and that also stopped, so many things have stopped and I always ask my self did I do something wrong? 
Then this week he said something that hurts me more then that one time when we argued with me and called me ""bitch"" or says ""fuck u"" to me, i mean it hurt but we were really angry and I said some back as well cuz I was really angry as well, but this time it crossed the line, it went too fucking far, I went through so much for him, I loved him at good times and bad times, my PayPal balance is at 0 because I gave it all to him (and no he never asks for money, I give him when he needs it because I fucking care for him and because of covid he doesn’t have a job) I am working really hard at my uni so I can see him and live with him, I’ve did all my best for him, and you know what he said about me this week? That i am not special.. that im like everyone else in his life.. u know why he says that?

I wasn’t mad at him I just asked where did he go cuz I waited 3 hours for him and he said ""I live a lone life and ur not special ur like any other person to me I forget that u exists"" and that day it really hurts me, it felt all my love efforts just went away, like it’s nothing to him, I got upset and I’ve told him it hurts me what he said and then he said ""ur stressing me out don’t speak to me"" and I asked him if he fucking cares about my feelings.. he said no. 
U know, I don’t have much friends I don’t have friends who are free to talk to me and hes the only person I have in my life who used to stand by my side all the time, now idk how I feel about this, I feel lonely In this relationship,I feel so lonely all the time cuz he never pays attention to me.. it hurts, I just wanted love I just wanted him to fucking communicate with me properly instead of acting that way, but I can’t change him, I’m a dumbass for even trying too for a while, all the love I’ve gave him, ment nothing to him, I’m not special to him, I’m nothing to him, I can’t stop crying, I love him so much even now but, I love the old him more and deep down I always believe he will change but I was so fucking wrong.. I’ve poured my heart to this man, now I feel stupid, I don’t wanna speak to him again until he realise what he said is the most horrible thing ever, for now, I feel really lonely, I need a friend to talk too or anyone, I don’t wanna break u- with him, I’ve dated him for 5 years now, but honestly if he wants to leave me then he can.. but I cannot love anyone else, I can’t love someone else who isn’t him, he changed me and he knows who I really am, it’s so hard to just start over and love another man, it’s impossible, he’s all over my heart even tho he treats me like shit.. I need a new friend right now, that’s why I’m here, if anyone wants to talk to me, the dms are open.

(F 28) I met this man at work in november. (Yea, don’t date your coworkers, whatever) We both have kids the same age, worked at the same place, have similar interests. Our friends at the work place noticed we both are single for a substantial amount of time. I made the first move to talk to him, and he reciprocated and we got on pretty well. He didn’t want a relationship (said that he would try to be in a relationship with me) and i was aware. I’m the type to be like whatever my feelings/heart is gonna do it, it’ll just happen. Well, by end of december we were telling each other i love you. I didn’t think it was too soon, as things like that happen… until..

Fast forward 10 months later, our kids have met, we’ve went on trips together etc etc. and six months before today he stopped saying i love you. We went though some rough patches, never defined what kind of relationship it was, we were exclusive to each other. I was okay going with whatever we were doing. Last night he told me he’s been mean to me on purpose to get me to leave him alone, now he just wants to be friends and yea i’m heartbroken because typical woman caught feelings, i’m still in love. I’m more upset at the fact that i wasted time trying to get someone to want a relationship with me and letting him drag me along. Why couldn’t i have been stronger and left it at a one night stand.

Today, October 2, 2021, is the day I rid myself of that lie. I am 31, unmarried, living with my parents, and lonely.

I have many friends to talk to and hang out with, but apparently you can also be lonely even when surrounded by a million people. That's because loneliness is not a physical issue, but a social one. When you are not high up on someone's priority list, you are lonely.

It's time to admit that once you reach a certain age, you just need a long-term companion. At some point, you have to suck up all the flaws and negative aspects of a relationship, and accept that it's just the way life is. The alternative, being lonely, is a cold barren wasteland, devoid of any life and is no way of living life. It is a prison in the middle of an isolated island in the harsh winter.

Ironically I don't miss her as a person anymore. Her image in my mind had dissolved in to some non-specific idolized person and it's the memories and feelings that I miss. Feelings of emotional warm, of belonging, of being someone's significant other, memories about those short moments of genuine happines...

Even with it, it’s exhausting, and it’s something I just do by default around them. I don’t think that I *have* to do it, it just kinda happens. And I think it’s because back in school, I had to play up this big personality since I noticed it was the only way to avoid getting bullied. 

I think I even kinda play it up a bit when talking to my family, who I still live with.

I’m just tired of being the odd man out in my “friend” group. Everyone in my group is in a happy relationship except me, and tbh it bothers me. They’re always doing group dates and things that you need a plus one for, and because I don’t have that I’m never invited. I am starting to hate being around them because they all have significant others, and I don’t.
I truly am happy for them, but I’m also jealous. I’ve never been in a real relationship, and I don’t have much confidence when it comes to talking with girls. I grew up without any real female role models and I think that’s a major reason why I have a hard time even just carrying a conversation with a female. 
I just wish I could find someone who would give me a chance. All I want is someone to talk too, someone to do cute couple things with.

Hey everyone.

I am a 22m from Northern California.  I was born and a raised here to a family of middle eastern immigrants.  My father moved here when he was 12 and my mother when she was 18.  I have 7 siblings, me being the second youngest.

My father has worked hard for what we have.  We aren’t crazy rich but we are well off.  I’ve lived in the suburbs my whole life and never had to struggle for anything.  I now own my own successful business that I started with my own money.  I did receive the knowledge and mentor ship on how to open up a business from my father.

I am very grateful for what I have.  I would not be in the position I am in right now without my family.


Now that being said

Due to the circumstances of my childhood being very easy and clean, I find myself feeling very guilty being depressed.  What do you guys feel about this?

A great deal of my depression comes from the toxicity of my family/parents/and dysfunctional upbringing.

My father is very toxic and our relationship has gone to shit in this last year.  Our family is pretty dysfunctional.  None of my siblings talk to each other.  My parents relationship with each other is pretty trash as well. 

The reason I’m so sad is because I’m so exhausted here.  I am currently working on moving out as we speak.  Im so exhausted at my parents house.  It’s so unhealthy for me here. (Obviously the answer is leave, im working on it). One small thing happens here and we get into a fight.  It’s so toxic, my dad is honestly a peice of shit.  The stories I’ve heard about him are terrible.

Anyways, am I wrong for being depressed and feeling like this from my family and what not.  Im just so exhausted

Thank you for reading.  My dms are open btw &lt;3",lonely,Toxic upbringing,2021-10-02 18:00:38

Well after many many years and rejections later I have learned to love myself. And I really like to love myself. I am just horny all the time and when I couldn't fuck someone I would fuck the next best thing that would not cause a divorce, I learned to fuck my ass. It took a while to work up to a dildo size but now that I have mastered that and leaned how to give myself prostate O's I really enjoy it but I tried to bring it up and she made a gay comment but I am anything but gay and by the way she created this sexy beast. We have a beautiful Vaca home in the mountains. Its got an amazing view a hot tub and now that the kids are grown I thought it would finally happen. She could finally relax. Still nothing extra, plus she sleeps even better at 8500 feet. LOL

So couple things.

Since she doesn't give it to me except once every 2 weeks sometimes 3, Now with 2nd home I go to the mountains and have my way with myself with my toys and then go home every 2 weeks to satisfy her. Stay for a while and then boogie back up the hill. It works out great till something needs to be fixed at home and I do miss her. But it is getting harder and harder to try and not make some friends. They have lots of things to do up here.

2.Do any of you ladies like to chase the rabbit when you tickle the trunk? or is that just like a never, no way thang that just never enter in to a girls mind?

3.Do any Ladies think it's hot and sexy, want a man like that or just think that it could be fun?

We did all the things we were supposed to do, kinda more apparent now without kids we are on separate paths. Is just the lack of Libido in one's partner worthy enough of a reason to get a divorce.

I recently moved to my university campus and my depression and loneliness have only worsened. I'm surrounded by many people daily but I have never felt more alone, even more than before. Social events make me weary and I've spent the last few days in my room, only leaving to get food. I've been crying nearly every day the past few weeks because of how depressed I am.

Today a friend from home texted me to let me know he now had a girlfriend and the manner I was texting him was inappropriate. It cemented the feeling of emptiness again. He only ever liked me because he wanted my body and he always said he wasn't looking for a relationship.  He was my best friend for 4 years. Now, I haven't seen him in less than a month and he already has a girlfriend. It makes me feel more worthless than I already do because I know that he was able to develop feelings for another girl so quickly... so it was never an ""in general"" thing. I just wasn't good enough.

I have much love to give but nobody who would like to accept it. I just yearn to cuddle with someone, I even think about cuddling with my mother like I did as a child, before bed so I can comfort myself to sleep. I am so alone. I've lost interest in most passions and my antidepressants do nothing. I wish I could touch someone and hug them over and over...I would definitely be the last person to let go. But nobody sees any worth in me or would want that from me. I miss my family terribly. 

I need to accept that I probably won't ever be happy here in this new city and that no matter where I go, I'll never be comfortable or fit in with anyone. I'm just hoping the numbness will go away and I can accept what my state is.

I was kicked out of my house on 18 August for telling my mom that I wanted to do community college and transfer to a larger University, but she wanted me to go to a 4 year school. I already applied and got accepted to one earlier without any of her help. Seriously she made me do all the fafsa forms and I had to guess on some of the questions. I didn’t want to do this again so I told her my plan’s. She kicked me I that day and I grabbed my documents, and everything that could fit in a suitcase. I had nowhere to go.

I couch surfed for a while until someone I use to go to church with agreed to pay for a motel for me to stay at until my 18th birthday.

Now I’m 18 and I’ve managed to rent a room in the town I live in. Since my first night here I’ve been lonely as hell.

It’s not a new normal, it’s been like this the whole time. And when it goes it’s not even like a “light shines through”. It simply thins out before dropping back down. 
I wish I had something good to believe in. That I won’t become every stereotype of misery. I’m already leaning into it as hair falls and strength leaves me.

4991,New_Introduction_933,1633144484,1,"Does anyone cope like this?  
Every meal I eat with a screen, because the alternative has become tiring and sad. My breaks, I grab my phone and reply to friends' ig stories, or see if they tweeted anything. And now I do that with strangers, get excited when people I sort of fangirl (my fave workout influencer or digital artist) reply and chat with me a bit. For fun, I watch something. To unwind, I watch something. 

But, when I was in my college town this time spaces during the day were filled with short talks, updates on their mood or life. Sometimes all the roomates had lunch together. I miss people. 

I dont find it hard to have friends to go out drinking or partying with. The thing is I miss having close people, people to do nothing with, to stay in with. To order pizza and laugh, play games and have warm drinks.

I'm scared of dating because I fear if I like someone they'll become the only person I'm close with, and I'll become codependent. I just don't feel ready for it. 

And on friday nights, like today, it all just comes rushing in.   


But then again, I'm writing all of this on a screen, hoping to interact with someone, instead of putting it on a journal. When I need a basic level of comfort, I come to a screen for aid. I used to have comfort movies, shows, podcasts, fatetime buddies, but I'm just so tired of it.   


I'm just so desperately lonely sometimes, and idk if it's just life's circumstances right now, or if there's something wrong with me.

This world can be cruel. But not everyone will misjudge you. When people choose to listen to other’s heads instead of their own hearts? It’s ok. Cease all fires. Release all anger.

A few weeks ago, a close friend of mine was going through a difficult time. I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.

The way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people ""hold hands"" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.

It's available for both Android and iOS, and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.

I realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.

But just maybe two people will hold hands for a while and feel a little less lonely. &lt;3

I've posted about my current situation before under r/caregiver. But to make things short...I've been the primary caregiver for my mom who has stage 4 cancer for the last 4 years and its the loneliest existence I've ever experienced. Its such a full time job that i haven't had much time to dedicate to my dream career which now seems irrelevant and a waste of time anyways. 

 My sister has five kids under 7 yrs old. I help/primarily run her household every single day since she deals with depression and i do that while still caring for my mom. Im tired but im also incredibly lonely. 

 Today was her and her husbands anniversary (16 years!). I stood back and took care of the kids, made sure the house was perfect so they could celebrate together. I cooked a 3 course meal so it would be special for them and i just watched them be all lovey dovey to each other, read heartfelt cards and exchange cute gifts. It just made my loneliness feel even worse. I feel like my whole existence is me, having this out of body experience where im standing in the background making sure everyone elses lives run smoothly while mine is non existent and running away from me before my eyes. Im 25 and though i know that isnt old, I feel like my life has already been wasted. I've spent my 20s inside 4 walls, always running and always caring for someone and trying my best to dehumanize myself so that way this loneliness and the feeling of being totally irrelevant wont take me to a dark and depressing place. I've been to that place many times and I've learned to turn myself off. I try to fashion myself as some kind of protocol driod (yes i love star wars) i do everything for everyone but since i try to not be a human it shouldn't bother me when none of my efforts are ever reciprocated.

Due to the drastic increase in physical activity, combined with the weightlifting I have been doing with my cousin, I am shedding fat and building muscle, albeit slowly. I have also started growing a full beard so I actually look my age.

Compared to high school, I have a large legion of friends of many different majors, and surprisingly few enemies. I even went on a date, and though the chemistry wasn’t mutual, we remained friends. Overall, I am happier and healthier now than back in high school, and it has only been a few months. 

However, I still feel lonely, because at the end of my day, as I sit in my room contemplating life before I go to sleep, I realize that nobody has been there to say that everything is alright. Nobody has been there to be my canary, to watch over me and let me know if I am pushing myself too hard. My oxytocin’s been zilch for quite some time. 

I will continue to wake up, day in, day out, and pull myself where I want to go, as I always have.

I'm that guy in the friend group that says a little too much, but yet, doesn't have much to say of any value or substance *at all*. I've made myself the class clown in the lives of those around me since Elementary School. and if you were assuming those manic highs of comedic outbursts would be equally matched with manic lows of depression and low energy, you would be correct. 

Even walking the streets, I question myself everyday. Say a car almost hits me while crossing the road. Doesn't matter if it's my fault or not, I question my own perspective. I blame myself. I question existence. I wonder if I would be happy with my legacy if I died today. I wonder if I'm taking full advantage of life. My life feels hollow, filled with only materialistic objects, that I was told my whole life would fulfill me, yet ironically, instead just remind me everyday how meaningless it all ultimately is. My overthinking is a curse. I know everyone isn't like this. Some people are actually happy and I really wonder how they do it. Or maybe it's just how it seems on the outside, but I swear people have things figured out way better than I do.

I can have all the money in the world, but I find there's only so many things to buy. I can surround myself with all these interesting people, but I still feel alone... It feels almost like I don't connect on a real level with anyone. Sure, I can connect with someone, 1 on 1, to a degree. I feel as if we often act as projections of our own perceptions of what our personalities are, so it's not usually 100% genuine and from the heart, but I can usually relate to other people's struggles. 

But when we're in a group? forget about an intelligent conversation, because we're young, dumb, and supposed to be having fun 24/7 (I guess?). Instead of talking about deeper things, we're too busy trying to be tough and showing off. oh, and also, forgetting about our problems. I wish I connected with someone on a deeper level.

When I was 20, I was incredibly lonely because I was in a very abusive relationship and was getting pretty sober (ish) from 18-20. I had a friend from high school repeatedly try to reconnect with me, and I took the chance and did, and he and another guy became my 2 best friends in the entire world and helped me space my relationship and saved my life (literally).

5045,ImprisonedintheVoid,1633118421,1,"Im sorry for the long post. In a week i will be 22 years old. I've been dreading this day for 2 months now since it's a reminder of how much of a failure i am. I've been doing a lot of self reflecting lately and i wanted to finally share my story somewhere.

I was born in a family of immigrants in a country in europe. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister but all of them are much older than me. I grew up in an area of a small town that is very much isolated from the rest of the city. 

I had no other children near my house and my family never gave me attention growing up. So from as long as i can remember my self, i was alone. Playing alone and being alone. My father wasn't present in my upbringing and i only had my mother. My sister was a very toxic individual, abusing my mother verbally and psychologically. She neglected her school work constantly only for her to be out with friends and drink constantly. My mother having little to no money kept supporting her, even though it was a wasted cause. My sister completely used my mother and didn't care for her. My 2 older brothers were already having their own lives and working etc. So growing up in this enviroment was rough. I was a good student and my mother kept saying to me how i was the only one who made her happy (since i was getting good grades and all). As a child, i saw how much sadness my sister gave to my mother by only focusing on her friends and clubbing and also seeing how happy i made my mother by being a good student, so i made the connection in my brain that i should only focus on studying and not on friends. How stupid i was. Even in middle school i would reject invitations from classmates to hangout, so i can make my mother happy. Fast forward to high school where i realised my mistake in the past but it was already too late. I was never invited to anything ever since everyone knew i would decline any invitation. Through ups and downs, fighting my social anxiety and depression, i managed to get to a university at the capital of my country. Having very little money i had to rent an apartment in a distant area from my uni. The first few days i had some hope that i could finally make friends but very quickly everything was shot down. Almost 90% of people attending at my uni were already from the city ( the capital). So most of them already had friends outside of uni and didn't much care about making new ones. Also the few people that i did manage to connect at first were living nearby each other. Every day while i was getting the bus alone to go home, i watched all my classmates get in a different bus all together, then hearing how great of a time they spent together the day after. Again i was completely alone. 

While having some motivation to at least get my degree and move on with my life at least, the university decided to completely reform and change pretty much everything about it. So suddenly i was stuck in a university trying to get a vague as fuck degree, 2 years worth of progress wasted and i had to restart again. Soon after that covid hit and i was completely isolated at my apartment doing nothing. Having absolutely no motivation to do anything, i became fat and i started failing my uni.

People will say im still young. Life will turn around, i just have to wait. I completely disagree. Im too old for my life to turn around now. Im brown Male in a country that is somewhat racist. I have no social media presence at all. I don't listen to music, I don't drink coffee, alcohol or smoke. I don't even go outside anymore. I have nothing in common with anyone anymore. Even if i meet people they will quickly find out that im a nobody. If that doesn't scream ""RED FLAG"" i don't know what is.

The few times where i've talked to people and had a conversation i've made them laugh, i was a good listener, i kept the conversation flowing, i helped them and tried to befriend them. But nothing ever works.

Everytime i think about my future i get even more depressed. I still have 2 more years of studying, then i have to go to the military ( It's mandatory to have 1 year of training in my country) and then i will have to find a place to live and work. I will be 25 at that point. Other people have already started their lives at my age now, but i have to endure all of this for much more.

All my life i thought i was miserable and unlucky to be in this situation, but i was wrong. Everything i've done in my life that brought me to this point of misery has been of my own free will. I was just too stupid. I don't want to live my life thinking ""oh i just didn't know better"". I was and still am too afraid to live. Always crawling back to my safe space of loneliness, thinking that one day everything will get better. Well now im pretty sure that it will never happen. I lost all my chances of living a normal life. I lost all my chances of making memories. I just have to accept that i will be alone for the rest of my life.

I haven't talked to anyone about my life. Even though i get to share a small part of it online and just knowing that even a single person read it, has brought me a little happiness. So thank you.",lonely,Accepting solitude,2021-10-02 06:00:21

5050,teenonasaturdaynight,1633116748,1," I don’t understand it. It keeps on repeating the same patterns. One day I am depressed and can’t do anything or have the desire to do anything and then the other day I want to do everything all at once and in a few days or hours I am back at the same old slump. It’s the fact that this keeps on repeating that makes me mad. It’s either I have to do everything or I can’t do anything. I don’t know when I will fall out of this cycle.

I truly appreciate my parents trying their best to support me in getting my mental health back in order and providing me with resources to fix me. But the thing is, with the sudden outpour of help and understanding I feel like everything I have felt in the past two years have dissipated, I’m not even sure if I was depressed. Every feeling of sorrow, desperation, hopelessness and worthlessness I felt seems like it never existed to begin with.

I still don’t feel happy. Honestly, I feel nothing but I am not sad. Yet it is frustrating when what you have felt disappears in an instant and now you come to question whether all this was a façade that you created. But it was so real. All the emotions feel distant now.

I don’t know how to explain how I’ve been feeling when the doctor asks. I haven’t met the doctor yet but I feel like when I would meet them I would be completely blank. Like everything I have felt was a lie.

Right now, I want to get out of my bed and do something. I have been creating playlists on how to photoshop pictures, sketching lessons, and various other things. The thing is I want to do it all now and the thought that if that's the case then I would never be completing anything is overburdening.

But then this guy started talking to me and I've tried to make conversation with him and it's been mostly fine but sometimes I just have no idea what to say to him. He says something to me and I just do not know what to respond. It's normal stuff but I never learned how to talk with people, idk small talk, I always feel like what I say is the wrong thing. And usually my comments stop the conversation for some reason. My doctor thinks I might have autism so maybe that's why I just don't understand people and the normal way of talking to them.

I’m also an alcoholic who’s been diagnosed with clinical depression for some time. After a failed suicide attempt I knew I had to get back on my combination of anti-depressants. If any of you know much about those meds, you under NO circumstances can drink with them. 

So I quit, for the betterment of my mental health. I haven’t received ONE text message from the people I considered my closest friend group. The people I spent 40 hours a week for two years around. And it hurts, damnit it hurts like a mutha.

5070,Additional-Cat-5735,1633099422,1,"Long story short I met a girl last year we dated then for some study related reasons had to move into long distance. I asked her multiple times if she'd be comfortable with that and she said that the only thing she wanted was to spend the ""rest of her life"" with me, ngl I did too. The starting two-three months went like a dream. We would text/call/arrange meets and we would do almost everything we needed to do to make it work. After a few months though she started to act estranged. She wouldnt pick up calls, she stopped sharing things with me like she used to. Whenever I decided to make plans she'd come up with dumb excuses, like one time I said lets watch a movie together and she said I dont have earphones while I could literally see it on her status she was listening to music (she never listened to music without headphones, Im embarassed I still remember these details about her). So I talked to a couple of my friends about this and they told me to just simply ask her what she felt about us at that point in time. She ignored the question but after a few days she confessed that her feelings for me were dying down and instead of talking to me about it she blocked me after that. I went to her house after a few days and she said she didnt want to talk to me anymore because it was awkward. The reason why I said I have nothing now is that I was dumb enough to invest all of my time into her. After my studies the only thing I did was give her time, talk to her or do something with her. I lost soo many opportunities to make friends with people because of her. I still have everything I had before her, I may have more or less but the thing is it doesnt matter anymore. The kind of grief this has left in me cannot be filled up by anything that I know of. It might be my fault for putting in all my effort into her but I cant do anything now other than be sad about it..",lonely,I have nothing now.,2021-10-02 00:43:42

We had messaged each other back and forth until fairly recently, when I had decided to stop it; the talks of liking each other coming up every now and then, but it wouldn’t have been a healthy relationship.

Still, the idea of what she meant to me has manifested in my dreams recently - by idea, I mean her personality and likeness coming through in different bodies; it is an underlying desire of mine that who she was to me will come up in reality one day, but I feel like such a chance has passed since I am beyond high school now.

5143,limeflavoredroses,1633053808,1,"Ever since I could remember, I was always more or less of a loner. In early elementary school, I would try and talk to the other girls in my classes and hopefully make friends, because that's what my dad told me to do. Soon enough, however, I found that that advice didn't really work. I would always have to initiate conversations, I would always say ""hi"", I would always do everything. And yet, I never got anything in return. I was alone during lunch periods and was never really invited anywhere. I made a few friends in the fourth grade, but they all moved, and didn't bother trying to keep in contact with me. I wasn't even very close with those few friends that I managed to make. Apparently, according to my dad, I cried almost every night because of how lonely I felt.

The same story repeats itself throughout my life in middle school. In sixth grade, I made 4 friends. Four friends, who, for the first time ever, made me feel like I wasn't lonely. And so the crying stopped. For a little while, I felt pretty happy. *For a little while*. 

The next year, they weren't the same. We had all moved to the Jr/Sr high school, where we would be with *high schoolers*. They became snotty, and just plain cruel without even realizing it. They never changed, no matter how much I convinced myself that they would. They made me feel like shit. My friends, the people who I thought were my best friends, constantly made fun of me ""as a joke"" without even considering my feelings for a second. They don't even remember when I tell them about it to this day.

I only consider them my friends because I have no one else to go to. No one else to call ""my friend"". And, ever since I moved away from that town a year ago, my relationship with them drifted even further.

I remember two-three years ago, I had attended a field trip for band, to perform at a festival. I had no friends who did band, so I was all alone. The best part of it was really just playing/performing. It was really the only reason I went. We had a period of 3-4 hours to just enjoy the festival with our friends before the performance, but I had no friends, and I just felt embarrassed to walk around by myself, trying to navigate a giant building that I had never been in before. I sat on a bench pretending to be busy on my phone (because really, what can I do with no friends to text and no internet to watch shows), hoping that maybe, *just maybe*, someone nice would sit with me and, *I don't know*, talk to me. Acknowledge me. Accept me. For three hours, I waited. I saw people I knew look at me and just walk right past me. Of all the hundreds of people who were there, not a single one was interested in speaking to me. That hurt.

Now, at my new high school, I'm completely alone. I always heard stories about loners making friends in their junior/senior years of high school. I sit by myself at lunch, and I no longer sit longingly, hoping that someone would randomly start talking to me. I've pretty much accepted it. I've pretty much believed that I would be like this forever.

&amp;#x200B;

But, then, two days ago, my faded dream came true. Someone randomly came up to me, and genuinely wanted to get to know me, sat with me at lunch, and I had a fun conversation with this person. I was able to be myself for the first time in a while when I talked to this person, and it was pretty refreshing, since it seemed like this person like me for who I am, and not a personality that I try and force in order to seem more sociable. With my past experiences, though, I believed that it was a one-time thing; that, when that person realized I was boring, or not worthy of being their friend, they would leave me be, alone again. *Just like always*.

I was surprised to find out that this person came up to me the next day, asked me to exchange phone numbers, and we are apparently now going to sit together at lunch again on Monday.

I still believe that soon, this newfound friendship is just going to fade away like all the others, and I'll be all alone again. Maybe it's true, and maybe I'm being delusional. But I'll enjoy this while it lasts.

At the very least, this one day restored my hope that maybe I won't be lonely forever, and that someday, I might feel confident that I have people who love me for who I am, and that I don't need to change who I am to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so much to type but can't put anything in words, everything hurts? I feel clueless to my own well being almost like I'm working against it, it's so frustrating. Why does everyone i meet hang out with me once and leave, am i doing something wrong? I had two people i worked with previously hang out with me about a month or two back. That day seemed bad to me but they said they had fun, but I haven't heard from them since. I just wish someone on this forsaken world was honest to me. Can't forget that I'm ultra stubborn and shame myself the second i feel good about anything, don't know how to stop that. I've tried therapy to no avail, I don't want to talk to someone who only listen bc I pay them. The main point to all of it is that I'm lonely, I've had no friends who will listen since 2016. Even when i do find someone who listens they inevitably leave because I dump all of this and more on them constantly. The temporary satisfaction from typing this is really nice!

Something years ago stuck to me that is unshakeable, and it’s only gotten worse. I feel emotions deeply, but at the same they’re clouded as if I dissociate from them. Deep down I’m indifferent about most people in my life. Friends or people I date will fade and come and go. They will live their own lives. Something inhibits me from really feeling people’s energy and connecting with them. Most people over the years I have passed by and didn’t maintain connection with. I just find other people to spend very finite time with, and I don’t really care if I see them again. Regardless of any social circles I’m in I can’t help but feel terrible loneliness.

I, early 20s, have no one to talk to and when I don't want to just talk to someone because I'm afraid what I say will be used against me. I've been through so much therapy and even they can't/don't understand so it's starting to feel hopeless. 

I've done so much, probably more than anyone in my situation, I've joined groups, met people, held conversations, taken leadership, worked out, everything. 

But I have to keep reaching out. I have to keep taking in everyone's shit. If someone teases me about something I know I shouldn't get that mad which I don't but sometimes it pissed me off because I think they can never relate to the work I put into being a better me. If I don't reach out no one is there for me. The world ruined everything. I'm already brave enough to face what I never had growing up, and to solve it, and the *world* handed all the problems, plus all the negative results from the problems, and wanted me to handle it alone even after I reached out to help multiple times over again. 

I have to be the one who keeps reaching out, even after I tell them what's going on, they don't seem to be able to understand the magnitude of my feelings, how intense this is for me, the depth of the hurt. I didn't even know if I was hurt I just assumed I was if I felt so negatively.

I know the standard advice is “meet someone through your hobbies” but all of my hobbies are solo activities or activities that are probably 95%+ men, and I’m very passionate about my interests without much time to take up anything new.

I think I’m at least moderately attractive, 6’0” (183cm), am very physically active in weight lifting, have a great career (own a biotech company), and have a good education (Ivy League). As a partner I always took care of my ex, and even though we are no longer together we still get along well since it was a mature breakup; so no baggage. I don’t smoke and I rarely, if ever, drink.

But for the life of me, I can’t meet anyone even remotely similar. I don’t get any matches via online dating (Bumble, Hinge, Tinder) and any likes I get are from people I have absolutely zero interest in. If I was getting matches but not dates or not second dates then I could chalk it up to a lack of connection or personality mismatch, but I’m not even getting to that step.

People always say to work on yourself first but I don’t know what else I can do and I’m
beginning to feel quite lonely since I’d really like to settle down and start a family in the next few years.

Actually got an appointment and had my first session with a psychologist this week, but with the internships the next 2 weeks I will only meet her in 3 weeks again. Talking about such stuff felt pretty good and I am kinda sad that I won't be able to talk someone outside my little circle about this topic. 

Idk I just kinda wish I also had this group of people who you have consistent contact/meetups and can share such things.

It doesn't help that I belong to a very linguistically diverse country. Neither does it help that I speak a rare dialect of a language, because language is one of the things that fosters community spirit where I live. I was also bullied in both physical and verbal ways and I lashed out in response or was destructive as a child. So I burnt more bridges than built them. I was never entirely friendless, though.

Then came college. I pretty much kept busy by immersing myself in extracurriculars. I also fooled around on dating sites. I was never deprived of contact with humans, but I didn't really make friends. Thankfully, I didn't make enemies either.

I worked for a couple of years after college, and I enjoyed the collegiality of my workplace. I also continued using dating apps. I was often lonely after work but could drown myself in the crowds and sights and sounds of the big bad city. 

Throughout college and those two years of work, I engaged in quite a few hookups, a fair bit of sexual activity. But I attracted jerks and weirdos like a magnet. As far as the few nice ones are concerned, either I didn't stick around or they didn't stick around. 

I went back to college after working for a bit to improve my prospects. Again, it was like work in that I enjoyed camaraderie with my classmates. I was also surrounded by interesting and driven people. But then COVID struck. Everything moved online. I went back to live with my parents in a completely unfamiliar city where I don't speak the language.

i’m a trans guy, i’m 19 and i have no friends. that’s not shocking based of my personality and the fact that i constantly blame and second guess myself for everything that i do. my life is one big cycle. wake up, lay in bed for hours, get up, go back to bed. i can’t drive so i can’t go anywhere and when i do try to make friends i get ignored or we end up having nothing in common and the friendship ends up fizzing out. i prefer to be alone but i don’t like to be lonely if that makes sense, within the last month my best friend of 7-8 years ended our friendship after him telling me that he was only my friend cause he felt bad for me in school and he didn’t want it to become anything like this, not only that but he would only call me to complain and rant and that’s fine i don’t care but whenever i needed someone to talk to it was always a “bad time” with him. so like what i do is i would constantly tell myself i’m fine and nothing is wrong it’s just my brain hating me which would sometimes work and other times i’d have to distract myself in order to feel better. none of my friendships workout because i push everyone away out of fear of being hurt or being taken advantage of which in all honesty i hate it cause I have no one and i have tried over and over again it’s just that i’m so afraid that everyone is going to take advantage of my kindness then kick me to the curb. but lately i’ve been jealous of people in relationships like it’s kind of unfair that everyone is happy with others while i have to be lonely and accept that fact that i’m going to be alone forever. but overall i’m just tired of being everyone’s therapist or be led on to be their punching bag. i wish i really had like someone and i didn’t feel like my whole purpose is to be a doormat.",lonely,i wish i had friends,2021-10-01 02:44:19

""If you would just lose weight, or wear makeup, or girly clothes, or smiled more, or stopped being depressed, I'd totally hang out with you"". I get it, I'm no good. I'm always going to be lonely, because I'm such a difficult person to be around with. I make everyone around me sad, and tbh I wouldn't be my friend either. 

But it still hurts. I know I'm the most kindest, most helping person you can find, someone you can trust 100&amp;, but no one is willing to put any effort in uncovering that version of me from under all the layers of protection I wrapped myself into. I have been betrayed and thrown away like trash by every single person I have ever met. I don't blame them, but it has caused me major trust issues. And since there are so many much easier and stable people out there, no one is willing to put in the effort to gain my trust.


Do I just accept my fate and die alone, with no one holding my hand in the end?
