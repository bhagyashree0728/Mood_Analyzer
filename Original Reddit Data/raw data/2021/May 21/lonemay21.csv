2,keizmi,1622467839,1,"This will probably get lost in the posts but that‚Äôs okay.

I used to be social and had a lot of friends before the pandemic hit but now I barely talk to anyone. I‚Äôm not #1 for anyone and I feel like I‚Äôm just in the background. Even in group settings, I always feel like it really wouldn‚Äôt matter if I weren‚Äôt here. I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô, it‚Äôs always been kind of one sided, with me giving them much more importance and attention. So I‚Äôve stopped trying to get really close to people, because I‚Äôm always disappointed? I honestly feel like I don‚Äôt have any friends, even though I kind of do? I tend not to share things with anyone and isolate myself a lot where I stop talking to everyone and honestly, I don‚Äôt even mind. I enjoy my solitude a lot and I‚Äôm never bored. But it does hurt when you have big news and don‚Äôt have anyone to share it with. 

I have always felt out of place, different from everyone else, feeling like nobody really understands me. I‚Äôm not always physically lonely but I am mentally, if that makes sense. I don‚Äôt really connect with anybody. I feel like my friends aren‚Äôt really my friends. I don‚Äôt mean that they secretly hate me and stuff, I just mean that they have more important people in their lives and I‚Äôm just there, in the background. My friends don‚Äôt talk to me for months but suddenly become super close when they want somebody to listen to their problems. I don‚Äôt want to discredit anyone who cares about me, but I genuinely feel this way. 

I‚Äôve never been anyone‚Äôs favourite person which makes me feel like anything less than that isn‚Äôt worth it? So I feel lonely in this world and isolate myself. It‚Äôs also really easy for me to cut people off. I stopped texting first and initiating conversations, and almost nobody reaches out. I permanently deleted my Instagram account and disappeared from social media, even then nobody reached out but that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm learning to stop expecting things from people because I always end up disappointed. 

I do believe that things will get better and I will connect with people the way I desire someday, I just hope it‚Äôs soon.

If you made it till the end, thanks for reading. It genuinely means a lot that someone‚Äôs willing to listen to what I have to say, I hope you‚Äôre doing well.",lonely,"No one‚Äôs favourite, just in the background",2021-05-31 23:30:39

62,cretinousgeorge,1622429459,2,"The past 5 years, with this one taking it as the worst has been tough.

Now more than ever I feel a harsh loneliness next to every night.

I've lost distance to several friends which has been going on for a long time. Someone who considered me their best friend had just stopped talking to me completely with no warning this month, I understand why but the way it's done has been very hurtful, especially under my circumstances.

Ever since April or March last year I have made/received many attempts to make friends online but each and every single one has failed. If not for lack of interest, compatibility, deleted accounts or no reason at all it never seemed to last. I wish it weren't so as I have met some great people who if under different circumstances could have probably been close friends but it seems that it won't be the case.

My closest friends I've just lost that connection, the kind you have with a close friend regardless of my efforts which could have been better. This hasn't been a short process but it's kinda washed over me recently how there just isn't anything I can do to stop it which breaks my heart but I just seemingly have to live with it.

Worst of all I lost my mother at the start of the month. This has been near torturous at times and the worst of it isn't even close yet. I've told very very few people outside my family and those who knew her, mostly due to how tired of feeling pittied. I feel as though if I were to tell people I know I would be treated solely off of what I'm going through, I don't want people to start talking to me, inviting me to hang out, forgetting their grievances and whatnot just because they feel pity over me. I've something to the effect of ""I don't know what to say"" many times and the simple answer is nothing as nothing will bring her back and nothing will make this easier. Hearing or seeing frequent reminders of my mum has made it difficult to try to distract myself too. Although this has bought me closer to what's left of my family it doesn't change that it is under unfortunate circumstances.

Everything that has happened for the past few years has just made me feel abandoned. Close friends cutting contact or being cold with me, several online friends abandoning me with usually no warning, being left out consistently out of many things during the duration of my whole life, loss of family and other things, it just hurts. I feel myself repeating this but it somehow always seems to set a new record but I've never felt so isolated before. I worry that I'm being melodramatic sometimes but it's hard to try to stay strong, it's hard to distract myself, it's hard to stay optimistic when I haven't seen any hope for such a long time.

I'll try to stop rambling as I really should try to get some rest soon as I could he here for a while rambling on about everything that continues to effect me. I've had a fair few nights of horrible sleep, although I can safely blame myself for these habits.

I've only had one girlfriend. We've never had any arguments for the 6 months that we were together, but at one point, she said something that rubbed me the wrong way (it wasn't even directed toward me at all). I was a complete jerk and I lashed out at her.* I tried to fix the damage but it had already been done. I never dated since.

A lot of this is the same reason I don't want to get married. It might feel good in the short-term but overtime, arguments become inevitable and they will get nasty. That, and the kids you'll raise will be hard work and I will already have it hard as it is with another future job I'll have.

I also don't want any pets because of how you know you will out live them at the time of adoption. I don't want to have to adopt a puppy only to suffer immense grief 5-10 years down the line. In fact, I'm just asking for it.

So I have close friends who live close by, and even my boyfriend, but I feel that I just can't have a real nice time with them. I feel like, put aside maybe?

And for sure, so freaking lonely.

Maybe because I'm one of the few females there, and I can't go to their sleepovers/camps (we're all &gt;18 y.old), even when one of them is going to have his house all by himself for weeks and everybody is allowed to stay there as long as they want (and even other girls as well). Except for me, I can't sleep there, or even stay late.

""It's the rules of the house"" every mother tells them. And look, I'm friends with all my friends' parents.

I have no ideia why is that happening. I don't have sex at nobody's house, don't drink or break anything.

My boyfriend is best friends of two of them, he has fun with them everyday. But I can't.

I have other friends (a lot btw) as well, but they're at their finals at college or I can't see them properly due to covid.

I never thought this was going to happen. I feel like that even around my boyfriend, because he'll always see ""them boys"" after we spend some time together (even when he takes me to some fancy restaurant, I thought we could have some time together afterwards but no). Or just keep talking about ""oh I can't wait to go to their houses and do some camping"".

104,squikasoto,1622413995,1,"I have been cornered by everyone it feels like. I am 26F and recently graduated from college, and I just adopted a puppy. This past pandemic year I had moved back into my parents place because a virtual college year meant I didn‚Äôt need to pay for my own housing - that and money became right, as it likely did for everyone. 

Well I have been pushed to choose between myself and my family. All because of who I choose to have in my life - whether it be friends, or romantic relationships. I‚Äôm ethnic. It‚Äôs frowned upon to date interracially, and even for my friend group which is very diverse, I can‚Äôt seem to get my family to come around that ‚Äúhey, I have friends who don‚Äôt look like us. But their really good people.‚Äù 

When I was younger, I would always listen to my parents about leaving certain friends or leaving certain relationships because they said that those people were bad for me. But, now I feel like I have become a person who is a pretty good judge of character and if I‚Äôm not, I would learn that on my own. Well recently, my older brother took it upon himself to reveal to my parents that I had been in a sexual relationship with someone who does not look like us which means I was dating interracially. And to them they feel so embarrassed and so ashamed that I could ever find myself in a relationship at all with someone of a different race especially after they graciously let me move back in. So now I have to choose between myself and my family and if I choose myself I am forced to move out and find somewhere else to be in with this whole pandemic year it‚Äôs been hard to save money to move because I recently just graduated and now I‚Äôm paying my debts. 

I would think that after graduating and have some time to figure out my finances but I only graduated three weeks ago and now my family had suddenly found out I‚Äôm in an interracial relationship and now I have to choose to leave or stay with the expense of my mental health. I feel so alone yet surrounded by so much family who does not support my own decisions to decide for myself who I can have around me. Letting my parents choose who is around me made sense when I was younger but now I‚Äôm 26 and I can‚Äôt continue to let them choose my circle for me I have to learn on my own and I need them to understand that I am old enough and smart enough to just make my own decisions but in an ethnic home it just seems like that can never happen and although I have friends that can relate to me no one can help me get through this because all my friends with ethnic backgrounds have given in and they live comfortable lives from where I‚Äôm seeing it, but I can‚Äôt assume they are happy. And even if they are, I‚Äôm  just not in the same situation exactly.

The saddest part is the fact that, despite having been there for five whole years, I made no friends in university. I was so fucking lonely it hurt and still hurts. I always felt... embarrassed? I‚Äôm not sure what word to use, but basically I just found myself constantly thinking how weird people thought I was. I felt like I was being made fun of. I know I was/am awkward, terrified of being judged and far from ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù. It makes me want to cry. 

I am lucky to have an amazing husband, but I still feel lonely a lot. Especially when he is hanging out with his friends. They always tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre part of the squad, too‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not the same and I‚Äôm not convinced. Those are my husband‚Äôs friends and I think I‚Äôll probably always feel like the wife that tags along, always knowing that if it weren‚Äôt for my husband they would never choose to be friends with me. 

I had a pretty good friend from work for a while, but they got into a relationship and have declined pretty much all of my offers to hang out in the last several months. I have a friend who lives 12 hours away that I talk to maybe twice a month and see once a year. The last person who I spend some time with is my cousin and that is rare, as well.

 I don‚Äôt have any friends from high school (besides my husband) because I came to the high school I graduated from my sophomore year. Everyone already knew each other and my anxiety and depression made making friends out of the question. Again, I felt embarrassed and ashamed just existing at school (still not sure if that makes any sense). I probably hung out with people in high school outside of school a total of maybe five times in the three years I was there. I‚Äôm not sure how to meet people at this point. I also can‚Äôt drive, so that makes matters worse. 

I feel like a loser and a nuisance and I just can‚Äôt imagine what I bring to the table in terms of being someone‚Äôs friend. I feel like I wasted my best and most likely opportunity to make friends and now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel really isolated and it doesn‚Äôt help my depression.

february: F‚Äôs dad died. she isn‚Äôt the same anymore.


march: covid starts and we can‚Äôt see each other again.


april: M fought with all of us and decided to leave us and make new friends.


may: i moved permanently.


june: slowly i‚Äôm getting left out.


timeskip to a year later it‚Äôs just F, D, and R. i‚Äôm forgotten, they never text me, the know i‚Äôm not the type of person to reach out, but i still try to talk to them, i get an ‚Äúoh i‚Äôm busy gtg sry‚Äù and i ask them to start talking to me, they agree, and i somehow end up getting left on read for months.

they changed a lot. ever since february. they‚Äôre not the same anymore, i don‚Äôt know who they are.
F used to be cool , she was kinda like the one who would sleep in class and do dumb stuff. now she‚Äôs some basic white girl who tries to act cute and takes selfies in public. she‚Äôs obsessed with filters and always hangs out and has these awesome group chat posts. i remember sneaking out with her at her house whenever i visited.

D was the nice one, she usually baked these magic bars every few weeks and gave them to us. she would laugh at the stuff we did and was quite smart. she now makes edits and barely texts anyone, she always makes these ‚Äúthese are my best friends‚Äù edits and i‚Äôm never in them. she became some tiktok girl. i remember going to the mall with her once and riding on that rollercoaster and eating noodles and cinnamon buns.

R was the silly one, she used to follow along with what we did, and would make notes and silly drawings with us during class when we were supposed to be group partners. she doesn‚Äôt do anything, she‚Äôs like f and d, basic white tiktok girls. i remember all five of us used to go into the awesome kindergarten filled with nostalgia from our childhood, and running up the huge tall ramps and sneaking past the strict lady at the front, and picking up her brother.


i love them so much, they made my school life awesome, i wish i was never forgotten. sometimes i question myself at night, ‚Äúwhat if none of this ever happened? maybe if her dad never died, maybe if she never left us, maybe if i never moved, none of this would‚Äôve happened.‚Äù but it did. i don‚Äôt hate them, and i don‚Äôt want to leave them, i haven‚Äôt been talking with them, so i‚Äôm not sure if they really really changed, i‚Äôm probably assuming this anyways. i know if i was still in the school, our friendship would be the same, there‚Äôs this gut feeling telling me that. i‚Äôd do anything to experience those days at school, even if it‚Äôs for one day.",lonely,they changed,2021-05-31 02:27:32

When I had covid last year; 3-4 weeks sick, feeling terrible &amp; no one to count on to help me. Lonely

I struggled at times and she tried her best, but in the end it was something she was unable to handle. I remember being caught in a white lie and feeling like garbage for lying when I didn't have to, and especially because it was to my friends. I spiraled emotionally and she just laid with me in my bed and cuddled, it was pleasant and it helped. But after having regular bouts of depression it came to a head after I was questioning my religious faith heavily after a harsh experience in church and was getting depressed. She decided to not help me, and even mentioned breaking up over my faith issues... after a couple weeks of becoming more apart (and depressed) during the Christmas break she broke up with me. I was mad initially (but kept it to myself), now though I am happy it was so clean as a relationship. I miss it... I am glad she found a companion and I hope he gives her the dreams we talked about, she deserves it. But now I look at my life and I am alone, and I don't think that will change anytime soon.

i long for those conversations that dont feel forced and where both people are putting in the same energy. i rather not end up being the one whos able to start and carry conversations, it always leaves me sad and reminded that i dont have someone who enjoys my company.

despite being introverted and shy at times, i love being able to talk and just vibe. i want to be me. nerd out about interests, listen to everything they have to say, and be idiots cracking jokes. get rid of that barrier from the start and grow close to trust them over time.

The month of May is really hard on me cause of trauma anniversaries, and I've REALLY been struggling this past week. With fucking everything.

And it just hit me. Most people have someone- a person that they can reach out to and text when the going get's rough. Someone, anyone, who will care and listen. But today when I was REALLY struggling, I tried to think of someone I could reach out to and ask for help, and I realized that I have fucking no one. Literally no one cares. I don't HAVE any friends.

And then it hits me. I, at my core, am just--- inferior, and I can't quite put my finger on why. I'm just not desirable to anyone. In fact, there's a deep feeling that I have of being so fucking disgusting, and I can't hide it forever. Maybe it's what I've been through. Or maybe it's cause of my Autism. Or a combination of both.

236,AdventurousStars,1622340237,1,"I was in a bad situation at the beginning of last year, one of the main reasons was obvious ""loneliness"", eventually the pandemic happened and that feeling only got worse.

However, the month of May came, and I thought ""Oh damn it, I'm going to do something"", thanks to the pandemic it was impossible to meet new people, so I thought that the best thing to do until things got back to normal, was to focus on my life.

Things that I was avoiding, or procrastinating on, I decided to try to do, I went back to working hard on my studies, and something I always tried to do was exercise (I had equipment at home, so it would be convenient) I wanted to learn another language and get back into the habit of reading.

Back to reality... it was super difficult, for the reason that I was lonely, any effort to achieve something... It was a lonely route, without encouragement or support from anybody, you know when you achieve something and you have no one to share it with? But being honest, even with support is still difficult.

But something that motivated me a lot to move forward is that I wanted ""I"" in 2020 to be proud of me in 2021.

In the end, I got a job (fruits of studies) I noticed that I get less tired on a daily basis (I think exercise helped) the habit of reading returned, and I definitely understand Spanish much better than a year ago.

And the first kiss happened, I will not deny it, I was very nervous there is no way to prepare for when this happens, but with my 20s it finally happened, I was very surprised by the feeling, I was used to being alone for so long, that when someone enters your life it is... strange, although it was a good feeling.

Well... Life isn't perfect but I feel better than last year.

My teenage years were not always easy, because of the hormonal effects and all this stuff. I was also kinda alone and had very few friends. 

Teenage years are an important time where we want to be with people of the same age and to receive good impression from these same people.

Last week I dropped her off at the airport for a trip she had planned to visit family and a friend's bachelorette party. Since then I pretty much haven't heard from her at all. She'll mostly respond to my texts, but usually after a long delay. It's not as if I have been texting her a lot, because I want her to enjoy her time and be in the moment. However, even when she does text, the messages are kinda cold. No 'I love yous' or 'I miss yous'. In fact the last time she mentioned she loves me in a text was when she was taking off on her flight after I dropped her off. I sent her a picture of our dog and she replied how she missed the dog, but not once has she said that to me. I feel like I am trying to hang on to something not there.

In my head, I know at least some of it is easily explainable. She is in a remote area, so doesn't get good service. She is with friends and doesn't want to be on her phone, etc. I'm doing everything I can to not text or call, because I don't want to interrupt her.

I've never had a lot of friends and we recently moved to a rural area where I don't know anyone. I've never had anyone I could just call and talk about things. I'm just at a loss.

I meet a few people but stopped responding to them because i think i am not on same level as them, because they had a lot more sex in their life as me. It hurts to much to be talking with them and knowing they had much more sex and much better life. My first thought when i wake up is: not another day again. I dont have the power anymore. Only good thing is i have stable, good job and solid salary. But now i am losing also interest and motivation to still go working because, why work? When all you have is your room and driving with ubahn to work. Most of people look forward to weekend or vacation. I hate those days, because i need to spend them in my room every year.

I dont like to be under people anymore because you see so many beutiful women outside for which you know they have regular sex that i dont have and therefor i had wasted my life. I needed to fight for every single sex (which is a total normal thing for most of the people) by writting to tons of women on dating apps to be choosen by 1 from 50 cute woman. Now i dont have the strenght anymore. Every women to which i write online who is ignoring me is making me feel even more worthless. Life is worth living as a man only if you are under 20 procent of the most good looking men.

No i will not go to therapy or take pills, cause i did this in past and it doesnt help and solve problems. The facts will still stay that others had better lifes as me and some people just dont have luck in life or luck to meet real friends. The only time i was happy in my 35 years was durring those few times in last years i have been on sex partys in swinger clubs. But with age you are getting less and less attractive and goodlooking women in berlin have so much choice that you have to be waiting for months to get sex or be choosen on some dating app. Suicide is getting a strong option, because i cant take all this anymore. clubs will not open for months, also swinger clubs and even if, i dont have people to go with...so i cant do things that interest me in life and i enjoy. 99 procent of people have no idea how it feels to be completly alone on this world with absolutly nobody to talk to or do things you wanna do and love. To all who have written last week to meet, thx but i dont wanna meet people that i meet online. This is for me as fake as men who gets escort. Its not a natural way of meeting people. Its pitty.",lonely,no hope,2021-05-30 10:02:08

I've been pretty weirded out by how much I need to speak to people throughout the day. I have almost graduated from university. Most of my friends are either in distant cities or in other countries and although I have little friends in my city since most have gone back to their homes because of COVID, we only hang out every now and then because they have jobs to go to or places to be which is understandable. I have a boyfriend who is living with me because of COVID which gives me someone to speak to throughout the day and genuinely enjoy his company but I've noticed even before we lived together, I have always gone about my day always needing a bit of conversation here and there. When COVID wasn't around I used to be at university and I'd be out with friends and I had my boyfriend (Who at the time was in Dublin while I was in the UK) so I had a fair amount of people to speak to but when I'd retire to my room I'd feel all lonely and sad. When I moved into a studio apartment I just felt like always needing to have someone around or having someone to speak to on the phone. When I try to do some uni work or just chilling in my room I'd always check if anyone's messaged or I'd message some of my friends or facetime them. I am really worried about it because I've always felt this way and now that my boyfriend is going back to Dublin to finish his studies and he won't be on the phone much to speak because he has to work and study and I don't want to always be calling him or trying to text him from 8-12 pm which seemed to be the case when we were in LDR which was not very healthy for us. Can anyone guide me with how I am feeling and if this is normal or need to work on things?  


I haven't been doing so well lately and I've been trying to get into CBT therapy for my anxiety and depression but it's a long wait, 6months.

I'm so alone I don't know how to make new friends in this post covid world. Even if I didn't have a bf that's ok but I wish so hard I had a gf to laugh with to shop with to travel together. I feel so ashamed that I've ended up like this with no one to call and just be able to see. I have family and in so grateful I do but it's not the same. I yearn to have a friend so much and I just feel like it's too late for everything now and that God just wants me to be alone. I just wish I was dead. Because feeling alone is so painful.

325,TroubledmindTV,1622309169,1,"Hi all, Im a 26(M). First of all english is not my main language so I'm sorry if some things are badly written. 

I've always been a sort of 'loner'. Was a kind of quiet guy in Highschool with not a lot of friends. always had some kind of social anxiety, but has been drastically improved since then, all on my own speed and pace ofcourse. I therefore never felt much engagement with social media like facebook and other platforms. ditched them all around 2016. I have been relatively 'happy' since then, with the usual ups and downs. The last couple of months (6+) I feel more and more disconnected with the world, equals and peers. I am still doing a degree in psychology and since covid everything has shifted from physical to online courses. because of this, I've missing more and more the connection with the associated college and students. I've started talking to some psychologist but I feel like i'm just banging my head against a wall without improving.  Everyone around me seems like they have shit in order and I feel more alone than ever. I'm trying not to think too much about it and let life 'go with the flow' but even the things I was interested in earlier on like making music using ableton, MINIkorg drummachines and traktor doesnt give me the enjoyment I used to have. I smoked weed on a regular bases prior 3 months ago, but I quit. I Thought smoking could have some impact on my social life and how much anxiety I felt, but since I quit smoking its only going downhill and I dont feel like I have anything to accomplish anymore. I dont have many friends left and the ones I do have all have a GF or do live in other cities, closer to each other. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for them that shit has worked out, I just feel so lonely and this also made my anxiety worse. This feeling also strongly has grown since the covid lockdown. 

Me and my ex 24(F) broke up around the start of covid. Even tho I was the one who broke up with here has left me with this intense feeling of regret and grief. I feel like I have such a major mistake and I tried to set things right but it was too late.

Those are the only things I really want in life. I don't have dreams of grandeur or the drive to be respected or recognized- I just want to live a quiet, boring life with someone who loves me the way I see all my friend's partners love them.

I've tried expressing this before, only to be shamed for having a relationship as a goal- as if it's somehow a negative trait to desire to be loved in that way. It's not my fault that I feel the way I do- that I feel a hole in my heart sometimes, wondering why people seem to care but never that much. If I could, I'd love to just be happy on my own... and I was for a while, for months in fact.

I got a nice job, I started making moves to leave home- which I'm still doing by the way... I started setting things in place, hitting small goal after small goal, to the point where loneliness wasn't even a thought in my head. It's only now, after having a very brief conversation on the subject, that I realize I've just been putting off my feelings. I convinced myself that ""not having time to focus on relationships right now"" was a strength of mine- a sign of my progression in life no only in general progression, but also in personhood.

That is where the big problem is. People express their kindness on social networks, their contributions of grain of sand in the world, but the closer you are, the more you know that person, the more you get burned by selfishness, the lack of empathy.

The human being is selfish. The human being tries to appear perfect, but it is totally the opposite: a kidnapper wanting to make his victim feel comfortable, without knowing that what he is doing, his reason for being, is terrible.

People are extremely conflictive. Wars have proven it. Day after day there are millions of disputes around the world, when long ago we should have moved on. 

The human being is the one to whom you offer a gift and he minimizes you for having put you at his feet. Proud by nature, and whoever slightly deviates from that paradigm is considered weak. They teach you to be oppressive from the moment you are born until you inevitably become one of them, or you fall into a deep depression and sadness for not being able to fit into society. 

We are those who say that we are against something, and immediately afterwards we demonstrate the opposite. Who does not understand that negative opinions are worthless, and that the only thing that matters is building a foundation for a promising future. Building a castle brick by brick, and not thinking about the end result before you even start. That is the big problem, we want perfect results without being perfect, because we cannot be.

Recently I have been on reddit a lot, more specifically on subreddits like this one, and I am absolutely bamboozled at what I have been seeing.

First of all I should clarify, I think its great that people are talking about suicide, and are able to come to reddit and vent, but i have seen the comments on posts relating to suicide, and I am utterly shocked and confused at the amount of people who give what seems like support, except what they're supporting is the SUICIDE. People are actually essentially telling people who come here to talk about their suicidal state, that they should do it if they really want to, and I even saw one person say ""write something funny in your suicide note"". Am I the irrational one, I mean seriously I can't believe thinking suicide is wrong, is controversial here.

WHAT THE HELL is going on, the subreddits I've seen are no place to go to when talking about suicide, if this is how most people respond, it's absolutely disgusting that this echo chamber of suicide being okay, has formed. I imagine those who are supporting suicide probably have suicidal thoughts and/or are dealing with mental health issues as well, but this still shouldn't be happening, it's not healthy or helpful.

373,grimwither_,1622267914,1,"I tend to push people away that I have a deeper emotional relationship with. 

I somehow feel closer to the friends that I‚Äôm not as open with about my feelings, there are no expectations for us to be there for each other emotionally. I would never want to put my issues on them and they would never for me, which might sound unhealthy, but I much prefer it that way. I know that if I ever truly needed them they would be there for me, but I just don‚Äôt feel the need to share every detail about my mental health with them all the time. 

I find it uncomfortable talking about my own feelings, and even though I always offer a listening ear to anyone, sometimes it gets really overwhelming when people unload their feelings on me when I am also going through stuff. Obviously I never tell them about it, so it‚Äôs not their fault for making me feel that way, it‚Äôs mine for not telling them.

I find it hard to stand up for myself or state what makes me uncomfortable, so usually I end up adapting to whatever I think the other person needs. Which unfortunately means that, if one of my friends is very open about their feelings and is going through a rough time, I‚Äôll end up talking to them about their problems for ages and exhausting myself, not feeling able to work on my own current issues. 

I‚Äôve ended up pushing away all my friends that I have a more emotional relationship with, because I‚Äôm either forcing myself to be super attentive to them or I‚Äôm burnt out and avoiding them, and there‚Äôs no in between. 

I understand this isn‚Äôt really healthy, it‚Äôs a personal issue I need to work on. However, I‚Äôm not financially stable enough to afford therapy at the moment. I‚Äôm not sure what I wanted to get across, I just feel really lonely because I‚Äôve been isolating myself from a lot of my friends due to me struggling with my mental health and not having the capacity to comfort anyone else at the moment.

398,TempusFur,1622260705,1,"I have a lot of friends.  Both IRL and online.  We have great conversations, lots of laughs, and I'm always, always there for them when they need me.  They sincerely care about me and check in on me and all that.  My IRL ones are always good for lunch or hanging out or to help me fix something at home or anything like that.

At the same time, I don't have a single friend--not one--that I feel I can fully and freely open up to about my problems or when I'm having a bad day, because they just can't handle it.  It's not that they don't want to.  It's not that they don't try.  Some of them sincerely give me everything they have and I believe with all my heart that they value me.  It's that they are just not capable of handling major negative events from me.  I have slipped up a few times in my life when I've been having an especially hard time and, without exception, I have regretted it deeply.  I've literally been ghosted or dumped by people for whom I spent hours and hours and hours helping, talking, comforting, working with to solve issues; friends I had known for months or even years;  friends who even said they loved me--the *first* time I opened up about going through something rough.  I'm so terrified of opening up or showing the sad parts of me.  Trauma from my past?  Sure.  We can discuss that, but anything from the present?  That's when the issues arise.

I sincerely enjoy being there for my friends and listening to their problems.  It doesn't matter what they unload on me or how often; it doesn't hurt me or bother me.  I have a truly unlimited capacity for it and I consider that to be a blessing.  It's one of the only things I like about myself.  I have one rule, though, that I work really hard to never break:

Don't let the mask slip.  Don't let them see you as anything other than happy, and if you do, recover lightning fast and make the conversation about them again.  I had a horrible weekend last week and I made the mistake of venting to a friend... and I had to start making up lies mid-talk because I realized it was going to hurt them.  I had to turn a terrible situation into something AWESOME by lying because I could tell it was getting to them.  It was some of the best showmanship I've ever done!  

I made that mistake again today once in a big way and once in a smaller way and exactly what I should have known was going to happen... happened.  The first person ended up being upset and probably I've damaged a precious relationship and the second person just dropped me mid-conversation.  I don't blame them.  It was my mistake to open up in the first place.  

I don't know what makes it so some people can take and take and take and offer unlimited comfort... and others just can't handle any at all.  I don't blame them or look down on them, but it is puzzling.  It's not like I don't have severe trauma in my past.  It's not like I don't actually have problems or pains... but it's like it shocks people close to me when I show any of it.  Even the ones who *ask* me to tell them about my day, I've learned to politely brush off with assurances that I'm just tired.  I'm almost never tired--it's a lie.

I know there are others like this out there and, if you're one of them, I offer you the biggest hug.  It's amazing how you can be so alone in a crowd of friends.",lonely,The Meaning of Friendship,2021-05-29 13:58:25

407,LifeArson,1622258215,1,"Like many people, I want to make friends that are like me but I have never felt at home in the places I would expect to belong: e.g. queer circles, maybe just cause I am never comfortable in a group, and the circles dedicated to leftist politics or atheism are often a lot more dedicated to material focusing on those topics than just hanging out.

The idea of preselecting friends or acquaintances whose politics or temperaments agree with mine is very tempting. Choosing some of these traits over others is sometimes a successful way to build relationships that work, but that compromise is not always viable when moving on down the line through the future.

It also feels like the views I hold, comfort with discussing mental illness and stuff are fairly in vogue these days, it's not like I'm exactly a minority. But where is our clubhouse?

\---

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big supporter of the idea of cooperating wherever one can, with whomever one can and however one can to make the world a better place, no matter how different their politics or religion, I'm just so asocial it's easier if I don't spend time getting to know a person to discover that there's a big impediment to our having free and frank conversations.

\--

Platonic relationships overwhelm me easily, especially after getting together with someone in real life and then all my other relationships end up suffering, so after some semi-serial-monogamy I find pretty much zero friends and I want to build up from scratch but I'm not sure I want to see people in person.

I had a coworker that I thought I clicked pretty well with. We'd talk a lot whenever we'd work together, and I feel like I got to know her pretty well. We both are in relationships, and she's met my girlfriend a couple times, they got along pretty well. She eventually put in her two weeks, and she mentioned swapping numbers before she left and even doing a road trip to meet up with one of our former coworkers. On my last day working with her I wrote a little note and placed it on her register that said something like: ""hey sorry I didn't get a chance to say goodbye, I'm pretty sure today is my last day working with you. Anyways, if you ever want to hang out with me and [girlfriend's name] hit me up! Here's my number: 123-456-7890."" She was on her lunch break when I clocked out so I couldn't say anything in person, hence the note.

Well before I left my boss asked me to stay an hour later, so I ended up being able to say goodbye in person after all. When I got back to my register she came over and was like ""thanks for the note"" and we laughed and we talked for a bit like normal. Anyways, right before I left I wished all my coworkers a goodnight like I always do, and when I said goodnight to her she said she'd text me. She sounded totally sincere too. Well, it's been almost a week and she never did. Idk, if I had a solid social circle I probably wouldn't think twice about this, just like whatever, but I guess since I have no friends to hang out with this one really hurt, even though I really wanted to just not care. And like why did she bring up exchanging numbers and going on a road trip if she would end up not even texting me?

440,TheCollegeDropout_,1622246664,1,"Can anyone else relate? I've always been somewhat shy so I haven't talked to many people. I had a friendship in high school with someone who initiated the first conversation with me, but we don't talk much. I had another friendship as well with someone else, but after an incident last year we haven't talked as much (and this could've been completely avoided on his part, but I'm not about to get into why that is the case). In the past, I've also passed up a few friendships too due to being shy.

In fact, there's one time I passed up an opportunity I still regret to this day. Two years ago, when I was a junior in high school, I had an interest in someone, so I followed them on IG and they followed back. Like most people, we didn't talk so I didn't think of it much. Well, fast forward to summer break when it begins. On this account, I always posted frequently and it almost always involved memes, sports, and the kind of music I enjoyed. Before summer break, she was liking the memes almost all the time (and that meant nothing because people like them all the time on that account). Once summer break began though, she was liking everything I posted for about two weeks straight. The timing, plus the fact that she and I were somewhat shy, made me believe she was trying to grab my attention. I never made a move though because I was too shy and overthought about what would happen if making a move didn't work out (which is odd considering the two previous times I made a move on someone from my school I didn't know well and it failed nothing happened). Even when she dropped a few more subtle hints, nothing. 

I regret that because, truth be told, I still want her. I pretty much held out hope for most of last year for something to happen, but nothing. In fact, after viewing all of my stories quickly for the past two years, she stopped viewing them on a consistent basis so that ain't helping my case. Thought I was over her but nah, I've been running into her at the park occasionally when I'm shooting around on the basketball court so that brought back any feelings I had previously. We don't say anything but we clearly recognized each other: I remember when it first happened in March she was viewing my stories quickly and consistently again for a few days before she stopped. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'll truly be able to create a few friendships and a long-lasting relationship to hopefully break this loneliness. Been single my whole life, had little friends my whole life and who knows when thst changes if ever? I feel like I lack confidence but I can't gain it easily.",lonely,I hate being shy.

**What can I bring to the conversation?**   


* I work with computers and cloud technology.
* I enjoy lots of old and modern films. *Fav Films: Blade Runner, Apocalypse now, Anything Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Train to Busan, Oldboy*
* I love nature and the environment.
* I have a cat.
* I really enjoy History, *in particular Industrial revolution, Tudor/Elizabethan history, American Revolutionary, Louis XIV.*
* I cook almost everything from scratch.
* I'm vegan but people find me not to be preachy (if people don't attack my beliefs I won't go after theirs)
* I love Cars *I finally got around to watching an f1 race after years of not following the sport)*
* I enjoy TV *Netflix, Amazon, Disney recommendations ahoy*
* I love anything STEM.
* I'm pretty good with engines and mechanical stuff.
* I like PC Games, but i only have limited time because of work. 
* I always have loads of side projects where i'm convinced i'll one day make my millions. (*Tshirts studio, Crypto, building a Video Game are all current projects in progress)*
* I play guitar, keyboard and produce hundreds of half finished EDM tracks.
* I listen to loads of podcasts, *mostly Comedy and Science but i'm not  a fan of Joe Rogan*

I'm sure there's lots more you'll find if you dig down but it should give you some starter material. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why am I trying to connect?**  


I basically cut a few lifelong friends out of my life 5-6 years ago because they were completely toxic. I know everything is about perspective but the biggest drive was because they had the behavioural manifestations of narcissists, along with generally not being very in line with my ethics around stealing, honesty and other things. I pretty much just said one day that we really shouldn't be friends anymore and it's just been me and my partner since.   


Oh yes i should mention I've been with them for ten years and for most of the time it's just been me and them against the world, we've been starting to drag each other down when we're sad recently and we're hoping if we extend our individual social circles a little we might not feed back our low moods on people around us.   


We both suffer from fairly severe Anxiety and Depression caused by trauma, the reasons are a little different between us. If you suffer from low moods i'm sure we can chat as long as there's a balance where and we have more than just our depression in common. I'm mostly very high functioning with my depression and anxiety. I work a full time job (from home) and It's not social anxiety so you'll get good chats from me. 

*This isn't my main account so i have no post history as I want to choose who I let get to know me rather than publicly share all of the info on this post on my main account which shares a name with several other public facing social accounts.*

**About You**

I've noticed lots of threads with people worried about others ghosting them. I certainly won't do that even better If you make sure I to respond to in your message and keep the convo going. 

I don't mind how we chat but lots of short messages work best for me. Big long replies are fine at first but i quickly find i don't have time to give enough consideration for a huge reply so shorter messages mean i'll keep sending them back, even better if we can bump to a more conversational app once we get to know each other. It's ultimately your choice though I don't mind.

I've no gender preference but I'm not looking for a romantic relationship. Just a friend.

I love to learn. If you know loads about something I haven't mentioned i would love to talk about it! 

Don't let anything on this message deter you I'm really just giving you lots of jumping off points to start a conversation. I'm very down to earth and I enjoy people so don't be shy.  
I'm excited to see your replies! You can drop a message here or DM me directly.

But like no one gives a shit and that's totally fine but like no one even cares about my existence. I try so hard to make my parents feel proud of but for some damn reason it never happens. I am doing stuff which very few 18 year olds will even imagine doing cause it's so boring and out of fashion. But I still do it because I love it but I would just really appreciate it if someone had a kind word or two to spare for me. Like even if I do something my father never acknowledges it or sometimes when I have a good day he ruins it by hurting me. No one ever makes me feel wanted. I just wish I had someone to hold hands with or just share my mind with at the end of the day. Anyways if you wanna talk please dm me I would really appreciate it. And btw if you see the nsfw thing it's because it's my throwaway lol and I am not a creep I promise.,lonely,It sucks being a plus size guy.

My mental health is declining from not having friends.  I have an s/o but it‚Äôs a pretty iffy draining relationship honestly. They have friends and I don‚Äôt and it sucks. I get jealous all the time

In any case, the last twelve hours or so have invited a lot of reflection on the last four years, and it hit me like a truck. ***Throughout high school, people actually liked me.***

I thought I was either hated, or just treated as a weird loner, but looking back, I feel terrible about this realization. People actually wanted to be friends with me or go out and do shit with me, and I told myself that it was some greater plot or some attempt at mockery. It never occurred to me that it might be genuine. I thought people just wanted to inflict misery on me. I'm realizing now that I could have had friends and a real social life.

She was so interested in me at first and been texting a lot while on the other hand, i wasn't really carrying the same amount of energy towards her that got me reaching to a conclusion that i'm not really interested, which wasn't really something about her, conversely, she was so smart and cool and I kinda liked the vibe she has been giving.
But i couldn't really have any mutual feelings towards her at this moment.
In fact, i have been going through a lot that i was so distracted from her and i've disappeared without even giving her any chance to even know her better.
I got all of her attention and interest goes to waste at this point, which i really regretted lately.

Recently, i have decided to come back to her once again when i got over all the mess i have been going through without considering that it was too late already and all of her feelings have faded away.

I'm kinda struggling with understanding my feelings, but what happened is that things have changed for both of us. Reversely, i turned out to realize that i'm so into her and craving her badly, while on the other hand, she has lost her interest. 
I'm not really surprised about that, i totally understand that i wasn't really treating her good back then.
But for a moment, i believed that i could really make it all up for her, for the moment she was there while i wasn't, for the moment i disappeared, and for everything.
But, it turned out that things doesn't really work that way and nothing to be done about this.

I believe that timing wasn't really in our favour, that got me wishing if we just have met in a different time where things might have been got mutual between us and worked out.

So I spend maybe a month catching up with my old friends, but then I realized that I‚Äôve changed as a person, and I feel the friend they once knew is no longer who I am now.

So I ghosted and moved away pretty quickly. I had an older sibling that lived three hours north of my hometown, and so I went to live with them. I thought I missed them. I didn‚Äôt.

Now I find myself wanting to play video games, watch movies, or hell- just even chat with some friends, but I get on my Discord, and it‚Äôs empty.

A couple long distant friends are online here and there but I know they‚Äôd rather spend their time with their IRL friends, even over discord.

Why did I choose this? I burned bridges with people that were excited to see me. And I cut ties with some of my best friends in the military, simply to cut the toxicity that is the military out of my new normal life.

But it doesn‚Äôt feel normal.
I spend most of my time with my wife and son. And I shouldn‚Äôt feel lonely as I have a loving little family.

But when everyone is peacefully sleeping, and I just want to play some World of Warcraft and quietly chat with some friends. I realize I have none. And it‚Äôs my fault. And I know it‚Äôs an issue, because I‚Äôve even considered cutting ties with family members.

Such as my siblings, even my parents.
I just feel like everyone thinks they understand me, but hell- even I don‚Äôt understand me.

And it makes me so mad, that I would rather be alone, than hang with dudes that were only my friends because we had no choice.

And id rather be alone than hangout with prior friends that no longer understand how I‚Äôve changed.

And id rather be alone than go out of my way to see my family members when I‚Äôm just overall disappointed in them.

Like I said, I have my few online buddies, but other than a weekly discord message between us, I really feel like nobody likes me, and it‚Äôs hard for me to like anybody else as well.

A complex mind is lonely.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm just a young dad.
Maybe it‚Äôs because nobody else around me is partaking in similar agendas? 

I attend college online, I play video games casually if I feel relaxed enough, and I‚Äôm a young husband and father with no other friends in my boat?

It‚Äôs lonely.

Did I try to grow up too fast?
I turn 24 next month, and I‚Äôll be spending my birthday with my wife and son. And I really hope nobody else (family) tries to visit me or asks me to come down out of my way for a visit.

I blame my personal experience in the military for sending me home mentally and physically busted, socially exhausted, and lonely as f$&amp;@.

But in reality, it‚Äôs my fault.

I Google silly questions like ‚ÄúIs it okay to end friendships?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo I need friends?‚Äù

The shit sucks but I know damn well I‚Äôm ghosting my home state once again, and moving to the opposite side of the country with my wife and son after this summer.

I hope that one day, I‚Äôll be in my thirties, working a good job, and that I will meet casual people with common interests that I could grab some coffee with, and just hang. Establish new relationships.

I long for the calmest interactions for a young person in their twenties.

I always feel like it rains when I need it to most. It‚Äôs pretty lame when you‚Äôre having just an okay day and the sky beams it‚Äôs sunshine at you. There‚Äôs so much more I feel like I can do when it rains I feel like an old turtle who comes out of its shell. I‚Äôm more in the mood to do things when its pouring. Sitting at cafes, getting an authentic bowl of ramen, going to the library, fishing, or just hit the drive thru coffee stand. Reminds me of a studio ghibli movie. Whenever it‚Äôs really going down outside I love to head to uwajimaya or h-mart and get a few hot pot things. Maybe a spam musubi and a ramune for the ride home hehe. I love standing outside and feel it drip on my face, it‚Äôs like it cries with me. A complete comforting sadness. One I love to enjoy alone. I‚Äôm usually not alone most of my days, I‚Äôm always talking to someone. Friends, family.. everyone, I feel. Texting, calling, instagraming, tweeting, dming, pinning, gaming, snapchatting, facetiming...jesus all of it. I don‚Äôt know, I like to stay busy. Keep in contact with the ones I love. Gets me out of my head, makes sure I understand the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around me and there‚Äôs people out there who need checking up on, if not just some quality time. The only time I feel true comfort when I‚Äôm alone tho, is when it rains. That‚Äôs ‚Äúme‚Äù time. There‚Äôs no paranoia. No overthinking. No anxiety. No obsessing. No one taking advantage of me or manipulating me. No ulterior motives. No, being too hard on myself and punishing myself for the people I‚Äôve lost. When I wake up and I hear a storm outside and I mean that heavy Florida-like rain (even better if there‚Äôs thunder) I just get so happy. I get to be cozy.

532,ThomasDParker,1622182673,1,"Just joined this subreddit, had a few drinks.

I'm just lonely.

I've been single since I got out of a high-school. Ever since then I graduated I have focused on business and programing. As of the last year I have become semi successful and the loneliness has become even more prominent. Before I made any money from my business it was easier to connect with people, I guess that makes sense since people want to eat the rich. I have severe social anxiety and with my business being 100% online, I sit at my PC 12+ hours a day coding and talking to strangers I have 0 connection with. There is essentially no opportunity to meet people and I am a 5/10 both looks and personality. I guess my question is how do I get out of this cycle. I am at the point that I care more about meeting people than scaling my company. 

For reference: I am a straight white male. I was in great shape pre covid, been losing weight starting about the last month (gained weight, have about 40 lbs to lose) and have lost roughly 10 lbs so far (not including initial water weight).

I suppose I am just looking for a way to connect with people when 100% of my focus has been on growing as a person since I got out of high-school. Even in grade school people would make fun of me for not talking.

In which I can sit in the same class as the cute boy since that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever had.  We can sit in silence.  The teacher prefers it that was because if I get too excited and start talking too much I‚Äôll just get moved and would only be able to see the back of your head.  I‚Äôll keep looking of course.

It‚Äôs the little that I get to have.  I always want more.  A hug, a held hand, a kiss.  But I never dare to dream of wanting more.  I think I don‚Äôt get to have that.  But I tried to tell you this the last time we sat together and I talked.  

I get it.  I‚Äôll always be lonely and alone.  You probably hate me for looking at you so much from my registers.  I can‚Äôt take the whispers anymore.  Or the hypnosis.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve had to move to register 1.  I can still hear the hypnosis though.  How clever and effective.  Clever to tap into my wounds of being lonely.  Clever in using my napkin and the line watching, always just watching against me.  Clever in suggesting that I be sad every time I see you.  Clever to suggest that I die if see you.  Clever to make me think of the short one before I looked up.  Even if he scares me a bit and we have a mutual hate towards each other.  He hurt me, you know.

It was hurtful when you whispered that my nose is crooked.  Or am I just hearing things again?  Does it matter?  I know you won‚Äôt love me in the way that I want you to.  I know that you can‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs a pity.  I love your name.  I can repeat it over and over again J.  It‚Äôs the name of a dear friend of mine from grade school.  I also caught feelings for him but he was a homophobe.

You are just, so beautiful. Stunning really.  As I said, I want to get to know you.  But you don‚Äôt want that. But you shouldn‚Äôt have said anything when I was just prying to get to know you.  I wasn‚Äôt looking for someone.  I was curious about the eye candy I‚Äôve been eying at since the day you started working there when Z took over.  I wasn‚Äôt able to feel crushes anymore.  And you made me feel.  What kind of sin is that?  I was content not feeling anything anymore and you made me feel.

Well, cute boy.  Stranger.  I fell in love with a stranger.  And so it‚Äôs based on looks.  They matter greatly to me even though I can be made fun of for mine.  I know you know that I‚Äôm a little bit racist.  It‚Äôs just, what I like.  What I always wanted.  Probably the ultimate form of what I can never truly have, right?  Idk. I psychoanalyze myself a lot.

I guess that means I‚Äôm shallow.  Sorry, I‚Äôve been alone in a classroom full of students.  Lonely of course.  Never really grew past looks.  I know what to say about it.  I know to say personality.  Or is the metaphor more literal like staying in an empty room with an out of tune piano hoping for that special someone to walk through those doors.

Idk.  I think I‚Äôm broken.  I like people and they don‚Äôt like me back.  I‚Äôve even loved people and they don‚Äôt love back.  So I feel unloved. Or is it the schizophrenia.  Or is it the whispers from retail customers just being the worst pieces of shit.

I feel tired.  

When you feel so tired but you can‚Äôt sleep.  Could it worse?

Don‚Äôt hate me. And stop trying to control my feelings.  I was suffering in silence trying to let it go on my own.  I suggest you do the same if you look deep inside and feel anything for me.  If that‚Äôs where this is coming from.

Google mindfulness meditation.  Don‚Äôt control your feelings.  Don‚Äôt push them away.  Don‚Äôt distract yourself.  Observe your feelings.  Accept them.  Know that they do not dictate anything about you.  Make a space for them.  Feel them but not to try to make them go away.  And be okay with that.  In a sense, letting go of them like a colored ballon.

That‚Äôs the secret to getting over someone.  Just know that you do not have as much control of your thoughts and emotions as you think you have.

Coming up to the memorial day weekend, I plan on taking tomorrow as a sick day or better yet, a mental health day. I feel like it's a good idea to take one once a month.

I got invited to go hiking in Saturday with the woman in the last vent. She wants me to go with her and get daughter and her daughter's bf. I'm ok to do things like this, but this woman is not someone I still get into a real relationship with. Her daughter is almost 18 and her son is in his early 20s.

I've always wanted children, but I'm not too sure I will get a chance to have them. I know I would make a great dad. I really like kids and I find them fun to talk to and play with. I know I'd have a lot to instill in a child of my own.

I bought a dinner for 3 of Chinese food tonight and am extra large pizza that is take n bake. I guess I'm preparing for a weekend alone. I usually always cook for myself, but I thought since it's going to be a 4 day weekend for me that I'd treat myself.

555,Disastrous_Kick_9158,1622173509,1,"A year ago, I experienced extreme heartbreak after my 4 year relationship ended. 

I dove into therapy, learning about relationship psychology, inner child healing, lost weight, and took more control over my finances. 

Over the course of a year, I learned about the inner heartache of loneliness and abandonment issues I had. 
I learned about my roles in my former relationship and took responsibility for all of my toxic behavior. 
I lost 25ish pounds, lowered my stress, increased the quality of my sleep, and lowered my resting heart rate. 
I learned how to love myself, set my values, and enforce my boundaries around these values. 
I have raised my credit score 125+ points and lowered my debt by $12,000, I no longer have credit card debt. (The last bit of it was rolled into a personal loan at a much lower interest rate). 

Through all of this, I still do experience the yearning and heartache for companionship. 
We are human; we are social beings, even those of us that are introverts. 
It gets hard. It makes me cry. 
I try hard to socialize and often times cannot relate to others very well. 

None the less, I love myself. I am falling in love with my life, through all of the pain.

Last night I have had the most intense dream I ever had:  There was this guy, the son of an acquaintance of my mother. I looked into his eyes, they were blue, and it felt like my heart skipped a beat.
Everyone around us was very supportive and excited about how we would like each other. Those vibes felt sooooo loving, supportive and happy. It's very hard to describe, but I felt sooooooo amazed to meet him an I was so very interested in getting to know him. I don't even remember how he looked like, I just remember that I felt soooo much love for him.
I wanted to write down my phone number for him, but I couldn't, it always turned out wrong or illegible. Than, he had to go home, so I offered to drive him home. I was soooooooooo very amazed for the ride home as I thought about being alone with him in the car and talking about EVERYTHING. I can put this great anticipation and the feelings I had into words. My heart beat soooo fast and my stomach felt so very strange, but good.
Than I woke up at 4am in my dark room.

I have had really bad luck my entire life with dating and relationships. Nothing ever seems to stick. I have a pretty dull, introverted personality. I'm probably on the spectrum but I never bothered with some official diagnosis or whatever. 

I(32) met a girl(27) here on reddit of all places. At this point I don't think she cares about me enough to go reading my posts so I feel fine writing about it. Over the past 2 months things between her and I started feeling more and more like a relationship but it was very rough. A lot of arguing because she never made time to see me. I never truly felt like she wanted to be with me. She avoided me and would get pissed off and denied it when I confronted her about it. Sometimes she would call me babe or sexy or say things that made me feel like she wanted me. But then when it came time to see each other she'd have an excuse. Finally a day came a few days ago where she said ""I cannot do this. I am done. You're great but not for me."" and she had a fit about her sleep issues and her work, saying she dreads work and didn't want to dread everything else. Assuming she meant me..dreading seeing me. I didn't tell her, but that hurt a lot. I don't understand why she would drag it out if she never really wanted to be with me and dreaded seeing me. We only saw each other in person twice. I feel like I had just been in a one sided relationship with someone who pitied me and couldn't just tell me the truth.

After this I still texted her. Tried to get answers, ask if she really meant what she said. She answered some questions but stopped when I tried to figure out if she meant it. I woke up last night at 3AM with intense anxiety and just had to tell her I couldn't keep lying to myself and trying to force myself into her life when it was clear she didn't want me. I had to remove her number from my phone and I haven't heard from her all day. I think that answers my questions. It hurts and I feel alone now. I keep thinking about that ""You're great but not for me"" and I just want to know what it was about me that made me not for her.

I put aside all of the toxic things that led to us breaking up in the first place and reached out to her.  I lied and said it was because I knew that silence drove her crazy, but the main reason was because she was one of the only people who somewhat accepted me for who I was.

I wake up every morning, load my two dogs into my car, and drive for doordash until we hit that magic number (or until I get fed up with the dogs whining) and then head to our new hotel room for the night.

She started telling me that now that I‚Äôm on meds and stable, I deserve go enjoy life and have someone. I started to tear up but was luckily able to end the call before I burst into tears.

583,Fabulous-Advantage,1622159609,1,"Apologize for the venty post-- it's just a societal expectation but it is frustrating nonetheless.

Over 21.5 years old. Graduating from the top schools in the country, everyone tells me how accomplished and successful and how much opportunity I have. Yet they don't know me. They assume I have friends, how could you not, but the truth is I don't and they don't believe me. Starting first job and I never kissed a girl, I also need to get my driver's license so I don't know how I will commute. It's like I'm hustling to piece my life together when I hustled my entire life. I even hustled in therapy, maybe I should stop trying so hard. 

There was a girl that seemed friendly and I debated back and forth whether to ""ask her out"" for the first time. But it was a joke, how would you say yes? I could only bring pain, I was hurting so much, I was dying in so many places and no one seemed to notice. I didn't even want to ask her, I just felt broken. I was trying to force myself. I do kind of feel like she got angry about it, and if she was really expecting me to, then my god you really don't know me.

My life can seem lopsided, accomplished academically but not socially, and it was against my will. All I ever wanted was to socialize, but I just couldn't, I tried all 4 years. I was always fucking trying, and I wasn't even bitter about it anymore. I just accepted that the way I grew up and what I experienced I was going to hurt in this area and it was ok. 

I'm just so tired of pretending. Pretending that I'm ok, that I have friends, I don't want people to worry about me being alone all the time, or think I'm strange. Tired of pretending.

I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do at this point. It seems like therapy will bring the answers hopefully.

I'm not even exaggerating, I don't even have any online friends. 

I feel like shit.

620,adifferentbreed1,1622147232,1,"Hi. I‚Äôm sixteen years old and i‚Äôm pretty depressed. i think that a main reason behind this is because my parents don‚Äôt support me much in anything I want to do- they never have tbh. Not that they don‚Äôt love me, they‚Äôve just never cared much about my interests. I‚Äôve never really been able to have a girlfriend before and I‚Äôm still not allowed to because they just want me focusing on school so i get into a good college and have a good career. I always thought that if i had a girlfriend, or even just someone who would truly love me, I would feel much better in life. I always thought that having a girlfriend, i would get this comfort and love from her. i don‚Äôt know how true this is, but obviously it depends greatly on the girl. I started talking to this girl on reddit a few weeks ago, she said she didn‚Äôt want to be anything more than friends and i was completely fine with that. she‚Äôs really nice and we‚Äôve texted over reddit for hours. i‚Äôve stayed up till 2am texting her several times! but sometimes, she just doesn‚Äôt reply for like a whole day or two and that can be really depressing for me because i really enjoy talking to her. IDK what to do. is she ghosting me? i am sure she is very busy with her own life, but it takes 30 seconds to open reddit and just say hi or whatever. So i‚Äôm posting here to find more female friends my age (junior in HS) particularly.

I'm 29 now, swiped all guys in my area according to tindr and not a single match who hasn't unmatched instantly, lost count of messages I've sent on other sites but all of them got ignored aside from 2,1 of which said ""ew hideous, ugly"" and the other ""not my type."" so it's safe to say it's hopeless for me.

But aside from that I have no where to go either. No friends to message, I'm not welcome anywhere or in any community. I'm ignored on gaming sub reddits or discord servers, I actually played with an old friend today who when I tried to speak spoke over me saying ""I haven't heard you voice in so long, yuck"" to which I said sorry and she replied ""I know.."".

Not only do I feel lonely and alone I feel like it's the entire world vs me and I'm just tired now... Its been this way for so long I thought I just wouldn't care or be used to it but the longer it's like this and the more these things happen, the more it hurts.

But really, I'm just scared of what you'll think of me. So instead of putting myself out there, I choose to be comfortable in my little crab-like shell (I'm a cancer :P).

Loneliness is like an addiction, it has its high and lows. Just like not being lonely. It's a blessing and a curse.

I think that to not be lonely, you just have to put yourself out of your comfort zone in social settings, and combat the fear and anxiety. 

Let it pour in, let yourself feel all of that fear and all of the anxiety, but then you're kind of like:

  
""Wait thats it? Thats all there is to it?""   


Then you're an extrovert for like 5 minutes and then you completely forget you had that breakthrough, so you go back to your ""loner"" tendencies.

So a couple of weeks ago,I had to go to the gas station to pick up cigarettes for my husband and me. There was a new cashier there that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. She was super friendly and I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI should try to work here. Then I might have someone else to talk to.‚Äù I went home. I told my husband about her. He knew who I was talking about. But he mentioned that it must be pretty lonely to work there since there‚Äôs usually only one person there are a time. I told him I‚Äôd had the thought that I should work there... you know, for the social interaction. It sounded so silly that I said, ‚ÄúOh god I‚Äôm so lonely!‚Äù And started to laugh and cry at the same time. My husband said nothing. It was like he didn‚Äôt even notice how quickly my emotions went from half laughing to more crying. That‚Äôs the night I looked at this sub.

I've always had issues with depression and anxiety, I didn't realize that's what it was till a few years ago.

I'm married and have 2 wonderful children, we built a house, we are living what most people would call the dream.

I recently was  finally was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving medication to help with those issues and it has been helping.

But still I feel so alone. I sit around the house on my days off and talk to no one, I can be completely alone in a room full of people.  I have hundreds of Facebook friends and none that I actually want to talk to. I've realized that some days I'm not really even sure who I am. You could ask different people about me and they would describe me as 2 totally different people.  

I dont know what really makes me happy outside of my family, I have no hobbies that I'm entirely passionate about, no direction in my life. I feel like I'm constantly just bouncing from one project that needs done to the next.

I have one coworker who has similar issues to me that knows some of these issues, but even they don't know all of it. But I have noticed that I can easily identify people who have these problems and I naturally gravitate to them, but these friendships are difficult at best because anxiety is a bitch.

I just wish I could figure this out, it's hard to talk about, I just feel so broken in an unfixable way.  I've become such a master of disguise to the point that I've hidden myself from myself too well.

I know soon enough a relationship will come. Also, I feel cheesy and gross if I ever complain about being lonely because it seems like such a tiny issue to have. Oh, but it‚Äôs massive. 

The rational part of me knows I‚Äôm not in a horrible position. It knows I have time.

Oh but I love romance, and that‚Äôs what hurts.

I want someone to be so hopelessly head over heels for me, and for I to be so hopelessly head over heels for them. I want to be able to carelessly express my personality, even the boring parts, even the annoying parts, and never worry about my person being annoyed, because we‚Äôre just that in love. 

My heart hurts because I want that unconditional romantic love, and the rational part of me knows that love is rare and if it ever comes it is after a lot of relationship building. And I don‚Äôt mind the building the relationship most of the time. 

But sometimes, usually late at night, I‚Äôll think about how much I want to rest my head on someone‚Äôs chest. I‚Äôll think about looking at someone in their eyes and lightly kissing them.

My dad goes out on long work days, and staying in the house alone for over 10 hours doing online school, and having barely anything to do can get super lonely sometimes. If I don't find anybody to spend my time with, the home owning life is going to be a very dark time in my life and I'm super nervous about it. I've basically been spending the better part of February - May hiding my depression to anyone new at my school (you'll find out more on the context) and I'm acting like a person I'm not, which isn't making me feel right. I have ADHD, OCD, depression, anxiety, which was inherited to be via family bloodline. I also went through a plethora of traumatizing events that have been building up on me for 18 months. I'm starting to get extremely overwhelmed.  


**The Vent**

The last 18 months have been both the best and worst time of my life, but they have shaped me into coming of age and being the person I am now. Alas, it's left me to be a person who feels the urge to go home, but there is no home, and it's all hidden. From January 6 - June 15, 2020, I ended up (presumably, it was definitely something more than a crush) fell in love with a girl who turned out to be a very toxic person. I got lead on, and helped spread whatever myths were being thrown around about me.  When school closed for the year from covid-19, I definitely felt an escape, but even then I was so stressed out it often turned into physical anger towards any object I could find because I was hiding this different side of me and I didn't know how to deal with it.   
On July 19, my mom and my dad separated. When my mom spread the news to me, I circled through a bunch of different emotions. I laughed, began to cry, and switched between it every few seconds. I called my dad after she told me, and he told me everything was going to be okay, but he seemed so down about it. My mom left him for another man, a high school sweetheart. I wasn't mad, I understood that sometimes people just didn't feel happy in a relationship. I knew it was coming, they argued a lot.   
I met a girl from the east coast of the United States, and we got along very well, and we began dating only a week after we met. Something about it didn't feel right, she felt so ""out of my league"" I suppose. After about 2 weeks, I got left on read for 9 days, and on August 3, I went on a vacation across my country (Canada) with my dad as a mental escape from everything going on, he lived were we were going so there was a purpose of the far location. My mom was okay with it, as I would return on August 24. Within about 3 hours that I arrived my girlfriend and I split up, she got overwhelmed with school-work, which seemed suspicious to me because I got left on read during summer, when school isn't in session. I didn't think much of it though, I didn't want it to ruin my emotional escape.  
Not even 2 weeks later, my ex-girlfriend came back to me, not wanting to break up. She didn't want to because of some kind of sexual tension she sensed (a very vague explanation of it which I barely understood). I was confused, and agreed to get back together, not knowing exactly what I was in for, but it ended with me being used as some kind of romantic object. I don't wanna go in too much detail, but we broke things off again sometime in Mid-September.  
When I came back, my mom introduced me to my potential step father, his name was something similar to Chad, I don't remember exactly what it was. He came over often, and stayed the night sometimes. My anxiety didn't allow me to be comfortable with him, and I had a weird feeling from him, and my gut feeling would be right. By Halloween, they broke up, my mom was getting harassed by him, and she just couldn't take it anymore. I remember meeting his son, and going over to his parent's home every once in a while. He didn't take the break-up well at all. One night (January 8) ended with us fleeing to my grandmother's house because my mom had been told he was in a ""mood of vengeance"".   
Speaking of my grandmother, on September 5, my grandmother took a bad fall and she was put in the hospital. By the end of the following week she was in the ICU. I was too scared to visit her, I didn't want to see her hooked up to all of that ICU equipment, and I was still trying to process everything. Then on September 19, she decided to stop all the treatment. She has diabetes, COPD, and many more ailments, and she felt that her time was up. She was going to be moved to palliative care sometime shortly after my birthday (September 25). I finally got my shit together and visited her on September 17.   
My birthday came. I wanted to visit her again, it was hard to consistently visit her because of covid-19 restrictions. The ICU capacity had limited and I wasn't allowed to go see her. I remember having one of those moments out on the parking lot where I began to feel weird. My grandmother was quickly deteriorating at the time and I was scared that my visit a week prior could have been my last. I sat out on the sidewalk in this weird surreal and pensive state for about a half an hour. Everything that was going on just hit me then and there and it was so much intake I felt my entire body just shut down, so I calmly decided to move myself to the sidewalk and to just sit down until I felt okay. I began walking back to the car and getting into the passengers seat. I texted a friend, who I wanted to vent to, but they didn't give a shit, and a group chat I was on that kept commonly excluding me, had basically broken my Instagram app, and my phone stopped working and I lost touch with the world. At that moment, I realized that I had nobody close to me for comfort, nobody I could actually talk to at my school because I was the outcast, and the loneliness begun. A wave of anger and confusion slammed into me and I smashed my phone on the ground, pretty much confirming the death of the phone.  
Luckily, my grandmother was relatively recovered by October 17 (her 69th birthday), and she was given the clear to go home on October 19. She had to have a special bed put in her room so she could get up. She was left pretty shaken from the incident, but she came back stronger at heart than ever. It was good, I finally felt like hope was near. That was until my school life started to become a problem. Shortly after my birthday, I started getting bullied. I was the outcast, it was bound to happen. It started off with stuff being thrown at me (paper, pencils, all that).   
My ex-girlfriend was the main person behind this bullying. All she expected from me was sexual things which I was not comfortable with, and when I stopped going to her house (which was just nothing but pressure on me) she cheated on me with a guy from Massachusetts. I broke up with her after I found out, and we got into a lot of arguments after that, ""typical teenage drama"" you could call it I guess. People apparently made stuff up about me and she started threatening to get her gang of like maybe 5 - 10 boys (who fucking tower probably 4 - 6 inches over me, and I'm 5'7, a little taller than a fair amount of the boys in my class so they were ***huge*** *in terms of height, and perhaps strength*).   
After a while, I didn't take it seriously until I started getting beaten up in December, my parents agreed to give me an early Christmas break because I began to show authentic terror before going to school (I used to get stressed and start crying I was terrified). By January it escalated beyond a point I could take and I fled across the country in a split decision with my dad. My mom was upset (understandably), but I really couldn't take it, I was already so stressed for the last year I was done. I transferred schools and started at a new school on February 1.   
They ones in class have been friendly to me, at school, but besides school I have no life. I don't get invited out, and most of the time people make plans in front of me without even including me. Nobody from school texts me unless they need something, and I have no emotional support at all. The only form of social life I had has been taken away from me because of covid-19. While, normally I wouldn't care because I enjoy peace and quiet, it starts to get really lonely after a while (started feeling it after week 6 of online school, when the expectation and workload also started to go crazy).  


I'm really sorry if this is completely off subject to the subreddit, I just needed to let this all out because it's been stuck inside for 18 months and nobody gives enough of a shit for me to let that much out to them. To the people living along right now, I wish you and all the other lonely people a person you can trust. The lacking of one sucks, and we all need someone. I know I'm only 14, but I just felt like I wanted to voice my concern on how this lonely lifestyle might impact my future. I'm trying to find people, and there's still for people to find their own, keep looking you'll find someone, as long as you ***keep looking***, even if it doesn't feel worth it.   


In-person school for me started next week, and I'm super excited to be returning.  


I would have typed more but it's 12:56am, and I'm kind of tired.

704,MizoresSnowBunny,1622095190,1,"I hardly sleep anymore. I have taken sleeping pills and melatonin capsules every night but nothing seems to work. I don‚Äôt play on my phone or anything (even though here I am posting my feelings to Reddit at 1am), I genuinely try to close my eyes and sleep but it never really works.

I was diagnosed with level 1 autism, schizophrenia, paranoid personality disorder, PTSD, and then your standard major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. 

I just graduated college but I don‚Äôt feel very accomplished. Everyone keeps telling me I should be proud, but I‚Äôm not. School took a lot of out me. I was lucky to graduate debt-free and Summa cum laude, but it doesn‚Äôt really even feel real. I BS‚Äôed a lot of assignments, I didn‚Äôt put in that much effort, and the toll it took on me to go to class and be around other people really hurt. 

I have my first job interview on Monday, and I‚Äôm freaking out. I just got done with college, and it‚Äôs time to move out and move on. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready though. I‚Äôm not ready to face a bunch of people and try to convince them I‚Äôm good enough to be hired. I‚Äôm not prepared to work 40 hours a week for the next 40 years just to survive. I just feel like I‚Äôll go to work, then come home and spend my entire evening trying to decompress and calm down after being at work all day (kinda like I do now at my current part time job) and then go to sleep (or try to go to sleep). I feel like I won‚Äôt have any time for the very few friends I have right now. I usually play video games with them almost every day, and I don‚Äôt want that to change. It‚Äôs honestly the only thing I‚Äôm living for these days. 

Working at a serious job, where my performance determines whether or not I can pay my bills and put food on the table is scary. What if they hire me and I don‚Äôt know what to do? What if I can‚Äôt do the job correctly or any job correctly? My entire livelihood is riding on my work performance, and I just don‚Äôt think I have what it takes. 

I‚Äôm also just a pretty lonely person. I mean, yeah I don‚Äôt really get along with people in general, but I feel like I could have more. Whenever my one or two friends aren‚Äôt available to play video games, I‚Äôm nothing. I don‚Äôt blame them, they don‚Äôt live just to hang with me online. I blame myself more for being kinda clingy and desperate. I really do just text them all day and wait around for them to get online with me. Not much of a life...

There‚Äôs also this one friend I have that I really like. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs love, but he‚Äôs the only person that makes me feel sane. My mind stops racing when I see him. When he talks to me, I feel calm. When he gets mad or sad, I actually care. I want to make him happy. I have a pretty big lack of empathy problem when it comes to most people, but him....he‚Äôs different. But one day, he‚Äôll move on. He‚Äôll get himself a girlfriend, make her his wife, he‚Äôll start his own family. He won‚Äôt always be around for me. He‚Äôs not even 100% around all the time right now. I cherish any moment I can get from him now, and I guess I can be glad he‚Äôll find someone who makes him happy the way he makes me happy. I just wish that person would be me. I want to reciprocate to him what he does to me, but I can‚Äôt and it sucks.

I had a falling out with my best friend years ago, fast forward a few years later and we are friends again but it doesn‚Äôt feel as deep as it used to be. He is still good friends with my ex, whom I despise. In my other friend groups, it feels pretty superficial. Work friends stay work friends, and fellow med students are just friends during school.

My love life has been lacklustre at best. Had a girlfriend in high school, became toxic and ended early in uni. Ever since, I have gone on a couple of dates but COVID has truly trumped this aspect of my life. Throughout the pandemic (and even before this) my attempts to woo girls in person and through social media have been failures, always ending with me getting ignored. I should say: I am half-Asian and half-European, living in a city that I feel is not very progressive (there are very few mixed race couples). I have been told I am handsome, but I think this is not by conventional standards of white beauty. I feel like I have never truly connected to either of my sides, even being called racist words by my European side‚Äôs community when growing up.

Despite having shared many deep meaningful chats and at other times light-hearted conversations, I have noticed that the few people whom I managed to connect with grow ever more distant with me after around 3 weeks or so. They speak to me less and less to the point where I feel it would be intrusive to contact them and this really saddens me.

Something else that really hurts me is seeing their profiles in my social media handles. It just reminds me of something that once was and has now faded into nothingness. They become blank faces and names which haunt my life. For this reason I have thought of completely deleting every social media handle I have. Nonetheless, I feel this is really the only way I can currently meet people.

I would love to be able to find someone who actually cares about me. Loneliness has been devastating my life, but I feel I must learn to be good on my own. Even though I have already basically been alone all of my life. I just wanted a change. I can only hope things will get better.

This is gonna be long probably but I have to tell my story. I'm 18 now, about to turn 19. So about two years ago, I thought I finally was in a good place. I always had trouble making friends growing up. I only really had one until middle school, when I became part of a group of friends. I always kinda still felt like an outsider to them, but it was better than nothing. Then in my junior year of high school, I became better friends with two of the guys in my friend group. We started hanging out a lot. Going to movies, playing games together, shit like that. Then about a week after I turned 17, I was diagnosed with cancer. Ewing Sarcoma specifically, which is a type of bone cancer. I was in the hospital a lot, &amp; even when I wasn't I was really week from the chemo so I didn't see much of my friends. I tried to keep in contact &amp; they visited me once, but they eventually started ignoring my texts. So I was pretty much alone through my treatment. Then in April 2020 I was declared cancer free. I graduated high school a month later &amp; saw my friends again. We hung out once after that, but they went back to ignoring me after that. I felt pretty shitty, but things turned around when I got a girlfriend in June. She was beautiful, funny, smart, &amp; we had a ton in common. And I fell completely in love with her. I thought she was the one. Obviously all teenage romances are like that, but I genuinely thought she was it. We were together for eight months &amp; I was super happy. She helped me through the bad times &amp; made most of the time good. Then in March of this year, she broke up with me. It hit me like a truck. She was the best thing in my life.

Now all I see from what it seems the advice of people who didn't succumb to depression, but I'm pretty sure I have. I thought long and hard about everything and it seems that people want me dead and it seems to just be a obligation to die. I'm sorry to say this but I have been in treatment for years on end and have tried everything (it seems to me), and to be fair its not all bad, there is some peace to know that the end is coming. I don't consider myself weak or selfish and it would be impossible to get me to think I am, something hurts and I know it hurts. It doesn't mean I never cared to live, it's just something happened too bad in my case that got me to cease living and I don't blame anyone but myself. It's even hard for me to be be detailed without being vague, because I feel the fingers people constantly poke at me and I try to even be anonymous to unrealistic standards. And the weirdest thing is, I have no particular reason to feel this way, I just feel ""at odds"" and I see things very terribly twisted in such a way that sometimes makes me think that this place is a prison.

I've been in treatment at a young age for PTSD since the age of 11, I was diagnosed and only recognized this until later on in my teens, when it made more sense. This diagnosis was given out after the reunification with my parents after child protective services displaced me out of my home. I started to develop symptoms of major depression disorder soon after throughout my teens and into my young adult life, interfering with my relationships, work and school. I didn't necessarily refuse to think it was the diagnosis clinicians gave me, but at the same time I thought I was just ""very"" different and began to isolate. Now I hear what people have to say about certain aspects of mental health issues like Depression and the disconnect is so severe that it might as well not be said, because it just didn't make sense to me. I started to find more and more people think less of me because I couldn't listen, or at least maybe they didn't feel like they were being listened to. Now I'm in my early twenties and I do really think the end is very near. I am engrossed in my own world sometimes, but I do like to listen to people which is strange, it's just when people talk to me and give advice, my attitude is like someone who didn't even listen, I would just happen to sound like I ""Just don't get it""... And to be fair on a bad day you probably wouldn't like me anyways.

I have lost everything important it seems. Its almost like my stomach is dropping and now I'm finally realizing I can't do anything I wanted to, like how most people wanted to be astronauts as kids and now understand ""they really don't have that going"", I'm like that for like nearly everything I wanted to do. It's just one thing I honestly want.... if I choose to take my own life soon, it was me, not anything else. Not to say something wasn't wrong with me, but I honestly don't think people looking at me the way they are now is doing any good, like I'm incapable of making an informed decision with depression, whether or not people do or don't think suicide is simple enough to decide isn't my debate. That is my only wish, that I actually am treated like a human being. I'm not saying I have any plans for suicide, I'm just finding trouble figuring out a way out of this without involving suicide and it doesn't just involve the stress of my life, but life itself it seems, the world just looks so ugly.

But come the middle of August 2020, and the other shoe just dropped. I felt like I was abandoned by tons of people. Friends, and acquaintances alike. Ever since then, over the course of 9 and a half months, despite my best efforts at mending bridges, I still feel extremely abandoned.

For starters, I'm extremely insecure about myself. I worry that the way I walk is weird. I never show my arms or my legs because I'm self conscious about them. I dont eat at school, because I dont want to take my mask off and show everyone the bottom half of my face. It sounds ridiculous I know. I've been given the advice of, ""Just think positively"" and ""No one cares about the way you look"" a million times over, and it just doesnt help me at all. 


Secondly, I feel like I'm undesirable to everyone. The things I laugh at and joke about dont seem to resonate with anyone, and I worry that sometimes that makes people not interested in me. I love video games, I'm a huge geek that loves anything video game related, but I cant express that to anyone because they'll think I'm weird. Whenever I have a ""crush"" on someone, I overthink it, and I get to the point where I just ask myself, ""What could you offer in a relationship? Why would they want to date you?"" Because I feel like no one wants to be with someone like me. I just feel like such a loser. 


If I ever asked someone out, I feel like they would laugh at me, because they wouldn't think I'm serious. I know that's irrational, and I dont know if that would be the case or not. I'm too scared to open up to my friends about this too because I dont want to be a bother to them. I dont want to make it all about me.

I'm a young female looking for a friend that is interested in deep talk and spending quality time together :) 

A bit about myself so you can get an idea of who I might be ~ 

I'm highly interested in human behaviours and psychology. 
Both logical and emotional intelligence are extremely important to me. I love to help people and show love and affection. Humor and sharing laughs together makes me extremely happy. 

I play games on Pc :)) Here a few examples:
Subnautica
The Forest 
Stardew Valley 
Ark 
Raft 
Slime rancher 
League of Legends 
And more ~ 
I also own a Switch with Animal crossing new horizon ‚ô°

My hobbies are drawing, talking to loved ones, analyzing people and myself, swimming/diving and playing games. 

One thing that is very important to me is that a friend is willing to invest in the friendship and isn't just there to benefit from it in some way. If we get to know eachother I want us to work for the relationship and are always there for each other :) That includes emotional support. 
Sadly I've been through a lot and are struggling with many things. Talking about that helps me a lot ‚ô° I'm not looking for help, just someone that would listen and maybe needs some help themselves. 
I'll be here for you :3 

If this sounds interesting to you so far, feel free to write me and tell me something about yourself so we get the chance to create something beautiful.

I'm not an alcoholic in the sense that I HAVE to have a drink, and that I go crazy sucking on empty bottles trying to get the last dregs out. None of that. When I don't have any, I can cope. I just eat more and have problems falling asleep.

I admit though that I do drink, perhaps a little heavily, but it's because otherwise I can appreciate and ""see"" how lonely I am. I come home from work. Sit in front of the TV with a pathetic little meal which is likely oven chips with some processed chicken crap. I hate sitting there, just me and my dog in an otherwise empty room. It feels stupid. It feels sad. The silence, having no-one to talk to but my dog, drives me mad. I talk to him, but sometimes just wish someone could talk back. Sometimes I talk to him and then it's like my voice just echoes around the empty room, as if reminding me there's no-one to answer.

I've lived in this flat for over 2 years. I've lived in Scotland for 3. I can count the number of times my brother has visited my flat on one hand - he lives 5 minutes away from me. My parents lived over 200 miles away. Hell, they've probably visited more than he has!! I f\*cking hate that I'd go to his at the drop of a hat, but I tried to plan to get him round to mine and he just said ""yeah, we could do"". 

I'm sick of having no-one. I'm tired of it just being me and the same old crap day in, day out.

When I'm sober I realise how pathetic my existence is. When I'm drunk I still realise it, but I don't care as much. 

And before anyone tries to diagnose me, I'm already confirmed to have anxiety and depression. I'm anxious, depressed - probably am actually an alcoholic - and am so damn alone.

777,JustASadBro_,1622058760,1," You'd think this is a post complaining about being a depressed 18 years old male virgin who can never talk to any girls because of social anxiety.   
  It's not.   
  Yes, I'm 18 and unlike most guys in my school, I never had a girlfriend, I barely had any friends at all.   
  I'm depressed.   
  I have social anxiety.   
  I'm not that good looking.   
  My parents are abusive.   
  I was bullied.   
  I didn't even get my high school diploma because I gave up school.   
  But none of this matters anymore.   
    
  I'm tired, tired all the time, tired of being tired.   
  My parents taught me how to be a sociopath. I remember when I was still a kid. My dad was hitting our cat.   
  And I didn't feel a thing.   
  No empathy, no sadness, no anger.   
  And when I was bullied at school by racists, I had to hide my feelings because ""You're a man"", ""Stop crying, little girl"", ""You're so weak"".   
  I became this... Emotionless robot.   
  At the age of around 8, everyone would notice that I never smile and that's when my social anxiety started to grow.   
  And the biggest problem with all of this...   
  To me, everything was normal.   
  I just thought, that's how everyone would be.   
  That's how everyone would act.   
  It's only after observing people, through the Internet and in my environment, that I began to see what the world is really like. I discovered the world was cruel and sad.   
  And it's crazy because the Internet has taught me much more than my parents or school ever did.   
  I was frustrated. Angry.   
  I was depressed without even knowing it.   
  It's like travelling into another dimension. Everything about reality is nothing like you thought it was.   
    
  I think it was around 12 when I started to be suicidal.   
  And I've had multiple attempts. But I was too afraid to die.   
  The more time passses, the more I started rejecting my friends. The colder I became.   
  And the lonelier I felt.   
  During the day, I would try as much as I could to not show feelings. It became so hard to share my thoughts and feelings that even my therapist couldn't help me.   
  And I would cry at night, thinking about how shitty my life is.   
  I would need someone to hug me, to comfort me.   
  I wanted to have a girlfriend, but I was too anxious to even go out and talk to a stranger, male or female. I don't even know how it feels like to be rejected.   
  I was too anxious to even talk on the phone.   
  Sometimes I would feel motivated, but then I would rapidly go back to my lonely life and my laziness.   
  I won't go into details about my daily life.   
  Just know, that now I'm 18, and after so many years of thinking, analyzing and observing the world around me.   
  I know what I have to do.   
  Everything makes so much sense now, it's crazy.   
  I can't spend the rest of my life being depressed, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after women who probably won't even like me.   
  Why would I want to do that, when I could be successful ?   
  Why would I want to chase women, when I could be Bruce Wayne ?   
  I could be a badass.   
  I could be famous.   
  I could be rich.   
  Fuck what they're all saying.   
  My parents, my ""friends"" who screwed me over and over again, the teachers, or even you who's reading this right now.   
  I don't give a shit about what society will tell me now.   
  I'll forge my own path.   
  I want to be the best version of myself.   
  Even if it takes YEARS !   
    
  I have a goal.   
  I'm counting on writing a webcomic.   
  And this webcomic will expose some of the biggest flaws of our society, flaws that we don't even notice.   
  So I need it to be successful. I will do everything on my power for it to be successful.   
  I've already got the scenario, but I still don't know how to draw, but I can still learn.   
    
  Fuck depression, fuck anxiety, fuck everything that's been pushing me back for so long.   
  And to everyone out there who's been in a similar situation as mine, I wish you'all the best life.   
  You can get through this.   
    
    
  It's not about luck,   
  it's about will.

I'm wondering what your opinion would be on a mobile app for lonely or any kind of people really, where you pick a nap/sleep time, show up on like a user list and be able to match with others who are sleeping at the time and then nap together with voice on

I don't talk much, but I've done something similar and it has helped me to just talk to random strangers, when you have nobody else. Similar to a therapy, though I don't like therapy. Felt too forced and unnatural.

This app would be like your virtual friend, that you could put on the other pillow and talk with. You could also keep them in your friends list and chat or nap together again.

Though it's also kinda scary to just talk to another person out of the blind, but your profile could be anonymous, you could just put some anime picture on it.

789,Leather-Customer7425,1622048792,1,"I‚Äôm lonely af (because I‚Äôm apparently not tough enough to take what life dishes out and get on with it, like everyone else does, so I‚Äôm currently living as a recluse). I‚Äôve had time to (wallow) reflect on things, what I‚Äôm doing wrong and what wrongdoings may‚Äôve been done to me. 

I want to understand a very specific behaviour though, that I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of multiple times now, because it keeps bugging me. So 3/4 different guys (don‚Äôt know each other), including my ex, have done this weird mocking thing and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has experienced this?? 
Basically, they‚Äôll say something which sounds random and unrelated to any conversation we‚Äôve had, but they‚Äôre quotes/references to tv shows (or other media, etc.) which would be disparaging to the person you say it to. 

One example (this guy was just an acquaintance): ‚Äúyour eyebrows are driving me crazy‚Äù. That‚Äôs the narcissist Dennis Reynolds from It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia saying that to Margaret McPoyle, an inbred mute monobrowed person (her family are holding him captive and he‚Äôs trying to seduce her to escape if you haven‚Äôt seen the episode). I know he watched/loved the show and at that time I hadn‚Äôt (he knew I hadn‚Äôt), so I didn‚Äôt get the reference until I watched that episode (I have a horribly accurate memory for things people say to me and it had been confusing up until I was reminded then). It felt insulting, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how until then. Also, I hadn‚Äôt said anything to him before that, he just came out with it. Didn‚Äôt feel great. 

That‚Äôs the only example where I didn‚Äôt get what exactly was meant right away, but the other times I did but didn‚Äôt react or didn‚Äôt know how to, so on these different occasions they thought it had flown over my head. I‚Äôm pretty certain these weren‚Äôt meant as just jokey insults, for instance with my ex, he‚Äôd say things like that under his breath or not give any cues that he was speaking to me, just to himself. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I come across as autistic (hey, maybe I am slightly idk) or someone with below average intelligence, but I just don‚Äôt understand the mindset of people who do this or why I was someone they did this to. Like it‚Äôs eh, reasonably common for people around my age (borderline gen z/millennial) to come out with random shit relating to memes - these incidents were in that sort of vein, but yeah just very insulting stuff with the added insult of the arrogant assumption that I wouldn‚Äôt understand. And speaking to themselves as if I wasn‚Äôt there. Just would love to know why. I know I should get over it, but that doesn‚Äôt help me get over it.

It's so frustrating. I don't see myself as ugly, boring or any stuff like that. I show confidence and be interesting but nothing, nada, zero. Being 100% myself brings me nothing too.

She said I was too ugly for her and this made be feel so bad that I had this pain of numbness and sadness for a whole week.

817,Wine49,1622032867,1,"I never doubted that these 5 months have been the worst emotionally. I have tried to meet people on reddit or irl, but after a while I feel bad just for writing with them and it is not because of anything bad they have, it is something internal that even me is difficult to explain.

My only friends are happy without me, plus I only see how they get on by uploading their post in that selfish app called ig, in which all the time I see how they enjoy life and their stupid phrases as if they think they are going to change the world in addition to their 300 followers who are not going to help them at all. On the other hand, I got away from that world because I did not feel that I was going anywhere besides that every time I do not see a reason to be here in this world. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened without the lives of others would be better if I had not been born as well or had lived another life.

My only friend told me that I could do better things than her, but I see that as impossible, in addition to the fact that my last suicide attempts destroyed my colon because of the excess of pills that I took in addition to other injuries that I have, those words that she told me without saying that They are as if he said them on the air besides that he left me a while ago and my only friend irl is a lobster plush that I talk to him at night but it is also stupid to talk to something that will not answer you and is not even alive.",lonely,Lonely to the point of talking with a plush,2021-05-26 22:41:07
818,Forestspirit2019,1622031336,1,"I have been suffering from depression for over a decade now. It literally makes me feel physically ill much of the time. I barely eat anything anymore, just the bare minimum to survive pretty much. I never found any joy in eating. Actually I find eating and most parts of life disgusting. But that's not the only issue. Our society is disgusting as well. Everything is so twisted and sickening. The way people behave and how we are so manipulated and controlled is disgusting to me.

its also sickening how mindless people are, like when they don't care how much others had to be exploited to get what they have. Children slaving away in the mines so people can have diamond rings is just one example but there's so much more. There's also children being exploited to make the clothes and shoes we wear. The most messed up thing is how nobody really cares and they just go on with their lives. But if it was their children being forced to work in a sweat shop they would care. 

Its also hard when you don't have much of a support system or anyone to reach out to.I used to spend more time with people in my family but over the years the have shown their true characters. My uncle, who I used to respect in a way beat up my aunt and her elderly mother and refuses to even admit what he did was wrong. My cousin who I use to like spending time with didn't care this happened and all they cared about was if they could still use my uncle for money. And they stopped talking to me. My father abandoned my family when I was young and he was also physically abusive to my bothers and my mother. he also refuses to admit that what he did was wrong and how much he hurt others. 

my other uncle and aunt never cared about me. My grandparents are dead and I wish they were still here. I never truly got to know them. My mother, one of the few people I interact with stopped talking to me for a year one time. That was absolutely devastating to me and I went to a very dark place. I wish that one never happened.

I started college in the fall looking forward to making new friends, but a year later I've made none. Would have made one but we fell off after a few weeks of conversations.

I wanted someone during my junior year of high school and I still want them. I truly believe that, given the fact she was dropping subtle hints that turned obvious through Instagram (but not by the DMs), if I hit her up during that summer break I would've gotten her. Instead two years later I still am hurt by passing that opportunity up to slide in her DMs. I see her at the park from time to time while I'm shooting around so it's not like I don't see her at all after graduating high school. I still see her and I still wanna talk to her. As much as I want her to have that same interest I don't see it anymore. It's a long story though as to how I got here. I don't know if I'll get over that.

I want friends, but I don't feel like I fit in enough with others. I'm cool and laid back, but I feel like something is lacking.

I‚Äôm a senior in High School, and I feel like all my middle school and high school life everyone hated me.
Every time I had friends I‚Äôd be the one that‚Äôs been left out and three years ago I entered the worst depression of my life. I only went to school 2 times a week and every time I went I had people to talk to but 
I was very anxious and scared, super shy. 
My hands would shake and felt like I‚Äôll pass out

But I still had friends and we would text and stuff. I had like 1,200+ ig followers and 500,000 Snapchat score or whatever. but when I disappeared two years ago no one contacted me. I deleted everything because I was going through hell. I felt like everyone hates me and that everyone has a bad impression of me because I got into a fight with a friend and she told everyone I talk shit about them, but she forgot to add she did TOO! like every female friend talks shit we all know that. 

I lost all my friends but found ‚Äúnew ones‚Äù. I thought they would be there for me but no one texted me. Not a single person, all those followers and people I thought cared for me, at least a little bit..none of them reached out and when I reached out they ignored me. 

My older siblings are so popular and my friends siblings are friends with them but when my sis or bro ask me where are your friends I feel embarrassed. 

Everyone hates me. 
I feel like a lonely piece of shit and everything is so hard.

It‚Äôs so annoying to me because I messed up but we all did, and then we also ‚Äúmade up‚Äù. They all still talk shit about me and I know it because a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù shows me a private story. In 9th grade the girls who kicked me out the group would zoom in and film me in school and put it on their stories and caption it ‚Äúugly bitch, someone get rid of her, she fucking disgusts me‚Äù

Since then I‚Äôve developed anxiety. 

RANDOM Girls would come to my locker and tell me I‚Äôm a piece of shit and useless. 

Is this bullying ?? Bc I did talk shit but you know what I fucking said ??? I said ‚Äú I think (a girls name) likes (this boy)‚Äù

LIKE TF YOU ALL RUINED MY WHOLE IMAGE AND MADE EVERYONE HATE ME FOR THAT??? I WAS FUCKING 13

843,starzwillsucceed,1622002368,1,"So I'm(35m) currently having a semi friends with benefits with a woman(52f) who is 17 years older than me. We just connect because we both have some things in common and we at both introverted people.

We got together last last weekend and we decided to cuddle in her bed until the early morning. It was nice to have someone that I had some friend like feeling for to be intimate with, but let me be honest with myself, she just got out of a 10 month relationship with her ex and is always talking about him. I can tell she is replacing the intimacy she had with him with me. 

She is still semi hooking up with him which is the reason why me and her don't have intercourse when we do get together. She came over to my house on Sunday night to watch a movie and nothing happened other than cuddling and caressing.

What do you guys think about this situation? Am I dumb for having a friend that I chat with that is this much older than me and also having a little bit of physical fun with on occasion. I already know we will never be a couple and she knows that as well, but I feel like I'm allowing this because it somewhat makes the feelings of loneliness much less. 

She knows I'm actively trying to find someone in my own age range and she is trying to still figure out things with her ex. I'm the meantime, don't you think it is okay to have some fun with someone you connect with until you figure out the next phase of life for yourself?

\-OpenBOR (the beat 'em up game engine)

We talked so often and so much, for the first few weeks of meeting each other. Then I just became another friend to an extrovert, and one that has a lot of friends. She doesn't describe people as best friends but I can absolutely see that she chooses people she feels closer with and every time she describes that to me, part of me is glad she has people like that and another part of me is entirely just upset as hell that I have no people like that. To add to that split, every time she mentions the qualities of the people she likes a lot, I can never find those qualities within myself. Maybe I do give off those kinds of vibes. Maybe I am not approachable. Maybe I'm not friend material. Maybe I'll never get closer with people in my life. Maybe I'll never find people who I can call ""close"" in my life.

I'm a 24 year old dutch dude,
I've been feeling really lonely the last couple of days because I've come to realize that my relationship with my friend group is never going to be fixed.

A couple of years ago my best and oldest friend died unexpectedly in an accident. During that time they have been really mean and rude to my girlfriend. i got very angry with them. Since then I didn't want to see them anymore. So I ghosted them and when they invited me I always made up an excuse so I didn't have to go. 

This goes on for 2 years. I've met with them a couple of times but it felt really uncomfortable and stressful for me. They have never asked how I felt or how I was doing. Last weekend they suddenly blocked me from the WhatsApp group. 

I feel really relieved but also very lonely because this is the end of all my friendships. 

My relationship with my girlfriend is really good but she is not doing well at the moment. She is in therapy a lot and has her own troubles. My ""friends"" are not aware of her health issues. And right now I have come to realize that I have no one to talk to.

If a person says they can not live without you, remember this comrade; before you came into their lives, they lived without you completely unaware of your existence and to you likewise.

So free yourself of the burden of being attached to someone you ‚Äúlove‚Äù. This will not bring you happiness. ‚ÄúAnd they lived happily ever after‚Äù a common phrase used by an increasing facet of our generation but, used to blindside those longing for a connection of some sort. Look closer brethren, you will see that ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù does in fact have an end and there is no communication of the life after.

But understand this:
Connections are not to be frowned upon. They are in fact the very basis of our human existence. Interaction between our species and ‚Äúother beings‚Äù for others who may take a liking to that, is only natural. Every being seeks a connection to something.
 
The goal is to be sure to avoid becoming dependent on a relationship with anything and anyone as a means of daily survival.

It began in 2016 where everybody is slowly fading away from me and my life. Most of my Friends (97% of them) are Pot Smokers (420) and i try my best to get rid of this Addiction. Since there it seems noone is interested in me anymore, and me either. It feels like im not Worth anyones time anymore. Friends doing their thing and my family is hard broken since 2010. I feel i have no one to trust and to talk to. Tbh this Part of me started building while i was smoking Pot(triggerwarning). I cant even go into the City and visit some Shops without getting Scared and extreme negative and Angry. Seein the City full of people is scaring the shit out of me, i start sweatin and my mind goes Blank, last time i tried to Shop some grocerys but the shop was so full my Mind went on autopilot and i forgot what i used to eat. i just bought 2 pizzas and 20pack eggs, for 4 days eating. I have to talk a lot in my job as a Technician and i think that im using all my energy on this Tasks, where is nothing left after my shift.

In my teens all my friends were Online from Games. But i began to loose interest in this Games too. And even when someone of my Past is try reaching me, i start loosin interest in about 1h or 2h. I think that everyone will leave me anyways, im an interesting Person and i kinda like my Person and Humor, but my surroundings seems not in my Circle Emotionaly. Yes, this is rude, but my mind and heart is telling me weird stuff. Im not better than anyone, but noone is near my mindset, noone is worth me, and im not worth anything at all. 

On partys i need a lot of Alcohol or other stuff to be Extrovert. On this mode i have no problem Talking to a group of Girls 4on1 or find friends. But it feels like im cheating to everyone, no one is talking to the real me, only the Pushed one. Sober im really introvert and dont talk that much, and when someone is talking most of the time it is really stupid shit which makes me angry espicially when the Pandemic began, and someone says stupid things my mind goes rage mode and is wishing this Person would die infront of my eyes... really dark thoughts sometimes going trough my mind.. but i would never hurt someone, never. i swear!

IM SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH IM FROM EU AND NEEDED A COUPLE DRINKS BEFOR TIPING THIS...

***Tl;dr*** : **I want to get rid of my Dark Thoughts, seeing the Glass half full, not half empty. I go to Therapy for \~3years now and its the only place where i say what is in my mind.. the only tips im gettin is Doing Excercise and Meditate. Most of the time i dont feel worth anyones time, including myself. Most of the time i dont understand myself or know who i am, or possible to be. It feels like my inner me is Chained up in my Brain-basement and getting Tortued by myself. I cry less and less, and getting colder by the days passing by..

I don't know why, but i was thinking that maybe writing my thoughts and emotions could help me to better understand why i hate my life, why i'm such a failure at everything and why i feel so alone.
I'm virgin and i actually never even kissed a girl, i have 3 friend, but 2(girls) of them are in a relationship, and the other one(guy) had a work offer in another state, i talk and write to them basically every day, and i think that i'm in ""love"" with one of the 2 girls.
The thing that bother me the most is that i'm the one to start the conversations almost always, and i think that maybe it's because they don't really like me, because im ugly and i can be a little akward sometimes.
Im still in school and while i already work i'm not good, not even a little, both in school and in my job.
I can't really talk to anyone about this because i know that i will bother the person that will have to listen to me and my uselessness. I just want to be normal, find someone to love who will love me back, and live a happy life, but i don't think that will ever happen.

Okay so idk how to describe the situation and how I feel about it all. So I‚Äôll just lay out the context in bullet point format to make this easy.

1. This girl and I are best friends. She‚Äôs for sure the only person I‚Äôve really opened up to and we‚Äôve helped each other greatly through hard times.

2. For two year she was in a serious relationship with another good friend of mine. Which I was more or less okay with. I trusted them to take care of each other and was happy for them. But they did end up ending the relationship after 2 years

3. I‚Äôve really liked her for a long long time now. She makes my heart beat fast but also somehow puts me at ease like nothing and nobody else can.

So she‚Äôs with this guy that I don‚Äôt know. I helped her through the breakup and I didn‚Äôt want to confess then because I didn‚Äôt want to take advantage of her emotional state so I never said anything. 
But now when I think of her with this guy I get all overprotective despite the fact we never dated, she likely doesn‚Äôt see me that way at all anyway. But it bothers to the point of a sickly feeling in my gut.
When she dated my friend it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad. I was happy for them both more than anything. But now it‚Äôs just.....ugh..

935,sharps1367,1621934993,1,"I never thought moving out would be this hard. I always thought it would be easier for me given the circumstances. Life has thrown more at me than I would like. I have bills to pay, groceries to get, and a house to take care of. Having roommates helps to ease my loneliness. But I still feel the pain of being alone the most at night. The house is quiet. There's no one to talk to. I'm alone with my thoughts. I miss being told I love you by some. My mother would always tell me before I went to bed. I find myself holding my tongue whenever saying goodnight to my roommates. Trying not to say those words I desperately want to hear and say. I lay in bed listening to music to calm the feeling and make me tired. But the music only makes me long for the feeling more. I'm reminded of my loneliness when a love song begins to play. But I don't skip the song. I let it play. I'd rather dream about the feeling then to not feel this pain. The pain of growing up. The uncertainty of the future. The unknown. Not knowing if I'll find someone. Someone to love, to hold, to long for. I fear I will not find who I am looking for, and I will pass away from this world. I don't fear death. I fear dying alone and having accomplished nothing. Thats my greatest fear. Me knowing I found that perfect someone. Someone to spend our lives together. Or me not impacting someone's own life for the bettering of themselves especially. Not knowing whether or not my life was worth it or not. Not knowing if I made someone feel loved, or made someone else feel not alone like I am, but to better themselves. Those are what I fear most. I hope I accomplish more before I die. From this night forward I promise on bettering myself and my life. Making wiser decisions. But how do you promise something to yourself, you know is an empty promise. The promise has no meaning. I want to better myself. But I find myself waking every morning without motivation, nothing to drive me to better myself. Always the same. The same routine. The same daily cycle. Wake up, go to work, waste the rest of the day on my phone, or watching TV. Getting caught up in other peoples problems. Tweeting my life away. Posting a meaningless update on Facebook, or a picture of myself smiling, even though I'm not happy. I'm not where I want to be in life. I have so many ideas. My creative side wants to show itself, but I need money for supplies. I need a better job. But I have no motivation for the jobs available. The money isn't worth wasting my life away. But isnt that what I'm doing now anyways. I have no clue what to do. I'm lost waiting to be found. But no one's looking for me. I'm a wanderer with no hope of rescue. I'm alone. Lost without a sense of direction. Without a sense of purpose. Like I'm lost on a circle. I can either go forward or back. But no matter which way I go, I'll still end up where I started. I need help. Help to break the circle. I need to call out for help. I have a voice to be heard. But not a sound can be heard. I call out silently into the void. But what can hear silence? It doesn't help that I'm giving out silent signals. I'm not getting any answers. I'm afraid to speak. Afraid to speak my mind. I'm afraid I'll be wrong or judged by others. If people really knew me, would they run away? I can't carry this burden anymore. I'm tired. I'm weak. Youth has nothing to do with strength when it comes to something like this. I find myself wondering what it's like to be okay. What it's like to be normal. Where I don't have to hide my flaws. Where I don't try to be perfect. When I don't have to be like others. I feel like there's no exit. I hold my head up high, but it hasn't been working. My heavy heart is beginning to weigh on me. I'm getting worse. I'm starting to fear my thoughts. What will they lead to. Doubt, fear, regret, self hurt. I wish I can run away. Run away to somewhere where I feel safe. Somewhere I can be loved. I'm trying my best but I was not prepared for all of this. I always thought I had it all figured out. But my parents have never felt the way that I feel now. They couldn't prepare me. It's not anyone's fault. But it is my fault thinking that I had it all figured out. Thats on me. I can't express all of the words I want to say from my heart. They don't come out. This is as close as I'll get at the moment. I pray it gets better. I have prayed for me to express my feelings better ever since I was thirteen. I'm still working on it, but I have gotten better. But I still can't talk to girls. I'm afraid of rejection. Afraid my heart will shatter in its already fragile condition. I don't want to lose a friend either. I have a couple crushes, but I don't know how to approach them. I feel too late. Too late in the game to start to make a difference. I need a new game. A fresh start. Somewhere where nobody knows me. Where nobody can know my past, or get unreliable info on me through gossip. But that probably won't help. I'm too socially awkward. I didnt even make friends until high school. Even now I feel like my friends have pity on me. Like they keep me around so they feel better about themselves. How do you really know when your friends with someone? I never figured that part out. At what moment does it happen? What am I doing with my life? Why can't I find someone. I want to find a woman to love and hold. Someone to love me back. Because that feeling of being loved is unmatched by anything else, and I just want to be able to have that feeling. But I know I can't. I am a hopeless romantic who shall be alone for the rest of my life. I see it working out no other way. And I have accepted the consequences. But I can't help to think there's someone for me. I thought I found someone, but it turned out to be untrue. Because I can't be loved without hurting someone else. I know it might sound selfish, but I really wanted it to work. But I can't save the emotions of one friend, and deal with my own. It's like the universe is against me. Like the universe doesn't want me to find someone. To be alone every night. Thinking about when I'll die. The day that I leave this world. It could be tomorrow. It could be 50 years from now. But I know I'm going to be alone. I've accepted that fact. But I hate having my heart teased like this. My emotions get the best of me. They say I need to open up more and talk to people. I have plenty to say. But my words aren't worth the judgment and rejection. I'm afraid of hurting people with my words by accident. I know it might sound weird, but thats how I am. I don't know how to start a conversation. I can't even talk to someone I like without avoiding them because I get butterflies. So now I feel distant and they don't even know who I am. But I have only myself to blame. Why am I this way? Why must I be this way? Why? And I need help, but I'm too afraid of expressing my emotions. What are people going to say? What will they think? Even my best friends I can't talk to. I can't be that sensitive. What will our relationships be like after? Will they still see me as the man who doesn't let anything get to him? Or will they see a scared little boy? I just want to love someone. I don't even need to be loved back. I need to be there for someone. Be their shoulder to cry on. Be their comfort, their protector. Someone to make me feel like I have a purpose. But who knows when that day will come. If it ever comes at all.",lonely,To Whom It May Concern,2021-05-25 19:29:53

951,hideawaybay,1621915185,1,"For a long time I've prided myself on my emotional independence, how I'm a homebody and am happy just being alone most of the time... and while that is true, I have been getting lonely these past few months. A few years ago I'd happen to be a bit lonely once in a while, but I'd never dwell on it for long.

Lately, though... I've been struggling with loneliness a lot more than usual. At first I just noticed how ""touch starved"" I felt... Seeing people hug on TV made me want to be hugged too, which never happens unless I initiate a hug with a family member. My family is not at all the type to show love physically, so no one ever touches me whether it's in a platonic way or a romantic way (though I don't care about the latter). I never thought much about it until I started craving it, even just a touch on my arm or shoulder would mean something to me and it's kind of an oof to realize that.

Then, I started dreaming about old friends over the last few weeks. Each dream was about a different friend I had either drifted apart from or had a falling out with. And in each of those dreams, I was having fun and felt loved. I'd wake up missing those friends even if some of them were toxic. It slowly went away as I realized it was just the loneliness rather than me actually missing my old friends.

And finally... seeing people laugh together. It might sound silly but when you're lonely and see others just laughing and having a genuinely great time together, you kind of stop and think to yourself ""Man, I want to laugh with someone like this too. I want to experience that kind of love too."" 

Thoughts pop up in my head such as ""I want to have friends"", ""I miss having friends"" and it's always out of the blue and it catches me off-guard. It makes me sad because I realize how truly lonely I am. I love being alone but sometimes I want to spend time with another person, or two, or three. I miss having a tight group of friends like I did in middle school especially.

I currently have one friend and we've been friends for almost eight years (since high school). I know I can trust her and I know she cares about me, but she's even more introverted than I am and we always go without messaging each other for 3 to 5 months. We're each other's only friend and we've laughed about it before. But I used to have a best friend a few years ago, unfortunately she was toxic so I had to let her go. I feel embarrassed about it but sometimes I miss her, or rather I miss the closeness I had with someone who I felt understood me as we had similar families, and shared the same sexuality and love for memes and videogames. We'd talk regularly, it was great. I love my current friend to bits but our friendship just isn't the kind where we talk everyday, and we're not close physically either so in eight years of friendship we haven't shared a single hug lol... and I'm realizing that I do need those things in friendships.

I'd love to make new friends in real life, once I'm able to. I feel so ready to put myself out there, even if I'm scared of being maybe too much of a nerd or something, I still believe people would appreciate me, and I just hope I can click with someone out there and we can become close friends and be idiots together. While I don't want to be ungrateful for the friend I already have (she's a truly amazing person), I really want to expand my circle.",lonely,"I love being alone, I hate being lonely.",2021-05-25 13:59:45

I read you saying that even though women get more responses they aren't necessarily good responses. Maybe someone can clarify exactly what counts as a ""good"" response and a ""bad"" response. Because during my time on the Match app I have sent a ton of likes and comments and I try to be both respectful and interested in what the lady in question says she is into. Yet in more than 7 months I have only ever gotten one response. And when I replied to that response, I got ghosted. Does that mean the tons of other responses I sent were ""bad"" responses?

See, the reason I notice a lot of guys getting resentful toward the whole ""Women are lonely, too"" or ""Dating is hard for women, too"" thing is because it sounds to them like women are trying to find excuses for being picky about who they want to spend time with.

I won't say this is necessarily true because I have seen a lot of guys being creeps online, myself, but then how do you excuse rejecting or even flat-out ignoring those good guys who try their best and still get turned down?

I can tell you what a lot of other women do. They pass up the guy's profile because he is ugly, or they notice the guy doesn't fit their idealistic standards and then they assume he is lazy and isn't doing a thing to meet those standards, when either 1) the guy in question may genuinely be trying but just cannot meet those standards out of no fault of his own, or 2) the women in question are flat-out wrong about the guy and are only making assumptions because they think they are too above the guy to verify whether or not their assumptions are valid by getting to know him.

That right there is where the majority of the animosity from guys is coming from.

So, creeps and perverts aside, what do you tell the blind man who cannot drive or the paraplegic who is confined to a wheelchair, who are working their butts off to find girlfriends but are getting rejected or ignored over and over again? Do you tell them to keep trying without acknowledging that their particular circumstances may require special attention and accommodations? Or do you try to put yourself in their perspective and actually try to help them out?

[For women]: Would you yourself ever date a blind man or a paraplegic man, or a man with Asperger's Syndrome, or a man with a facio-cranial deformity? Why or why not?",lonely,A response to a now-locked thread.,2021-05-25 13:10:58

It all started when I was 7 years old, I was new to the school and a girl decided to  bully me for three years, it made me so emotionally exhausted at such a young age where I would cry under my bed. The bullying affected my ability to concentrate in class and my grades dropped, when I completed my sats (year six for the uk peeps), I failed most of my subjects expect English and Topic.

I became insecure and emotional which made me the target of the school, so I was bullied for five years straight for many reasons‚Ä¶

I was bullied for being overweight, being quite, some kids made rape jokes about me, some kids made sexual jokes about my body when I was 15 years old.

 I remember when I asked someone for some maths help, I couldn‚Äôt hear them due to I was losing my hearing (trauma affects the body and mind) and she yelled ‚Äú[my name] is so stupid!‚Äù which made the bullies to push my body on the floor and kick my face‚Ä¶ they were the same people who made the rape jokes about me.

The last time I was bullied was 2019-2020, they were older than me and they took that advantage by sexualising me, making fun of my hearing  and I felt so alone. I became paranoid and didn‚Äôt trust anyone.

991,Plastic_Jellyfish898,1621889341,1,"I () had a breakdown two days ago when dad asked me why I wasn't doing anything. I just feel so tired. I'm supposed to appear for university entrance exams which got delayed because of covid. I had to basically waste a year since my parents made me reattempt to try to get into a government funded uni but that's pretty much impossible because of how fucking dumb I am. I just can't get a rank or score good enough for that. I really wanna do computer science which makes it even worse since I'd need a rank within 10k out of 600k sonething. I love programming and I really wanna do computer science. Last year for my first attempt my rank was around 50k and I honestly don't think I can do better.

Dad thinks that I can do it because I managed to get 95.6% in 10th grade and 87% at the end of HS. 10th grade was awful for me. It was after a bunch of shit happened in 9th grade and I skipped almost the entire first month of school because I felt like shit going to school because I had no friends and felt like an outcast. My grades dipped in 9th grade and before that I was an above average student. I don't know how but I somehow studied, memorized and read a ton and managed to get a good score in 10th grade. The material back then was honestly easier, interesting and varied. I kinda hate that I basically studied all day back then. Looking back, it really sucked. I felt as lonely as I do today back then. I just tried not to think about it. It made me really mad that dad still wanted me to do better than 95% after the results.

I feel like doing nothing at all. I just want this to end. I want to be in uni already. I told my parents all of thus and I basically got yelled at and talked down. My heaf hurt so bad that night from all the crying, hitting my own head and pulling my hair. Dad went on about how others would study and get into the government funsed unis while I could get into a regular one. He talked about it so condescendingly it hurt. It hurts thinking about it. Typing this right now is painful. I've honestly been feeling like a complete loser for the last two years (Grade 12 + Last year before my first attempt which was delayed due to covid). I hate crying myself to sleep thinking about it.

I followed a bunch of people from school on instagram and it hurts seeing them talk about completing uni assignments and stuff. Most of them aren't in any of the really good national unis but I still feel envious. I'm so envious. I feel like I've been left behind. It hurts even more because I have no friends. I just want someone to talk to in person. I have some online friends but I need some real socializing which I haven't had in ages. My social anxiety makes it so much worse. I can't even talk or hold a conversation. Even with my online friends I feel so insecure about whether they actually like me. I fret over minor things. I also have skin issues which also make me feel like shit. I've also been bullied a lot during my school years which sucked.

The last time I went out with friends was 5 years ago in 9th grade and those ""friends"" were pretty awful to me. Never had a single friend since. I just want to be friends with someone who actually wants to be with me. I wanna go out with friends. I've pretty much always been alone since. Being alone on the bus, sitying alone in the back in class. School took us to an amusement park once and I was pretty much alone there and some people who felt bad invited me to be with their group for a bit. It hurt. I couldn't talk to them. I don't want people to include me out of pity. I want friends who want to hang out with me because they like me. I wish I could open up.

Also forgot to mention how my parents have always had arguments and fought with my dad being verbally abusive and sometimes physically since I was a child. I hated it. It hated when they fought. They still fight and I hate it. Then dad goes back to being normal like nothing happened after a bit. One moment he's mad and yelling at everyone and the next he acts caring.

After the breakdown I mentioned at the start, my parents went back to pretending everything was normal the next day. I hate when they try to show affection because it kinda just feels... fake? Feels more like out of obligation because I'm their son. I just want someone who likes me for who I am.

993,_JosephiKrakowski,1621887175,1,"Just to clarify before we start, I am not suicidal, never have been and I never will be. When I say I don't know why I'm still here, it's because I've lost faith in my existence, time and time again. Let me explain.

I feel so insignificant in other people's lives. If I wasn't there, they could just turn to someone else and they would fill the gap. On days where I've been sick and sat out of things, I see that they can all still have fun even when I'm not around. From one perspective, that's great because obviously I don't want life to stand still when I'm not there, but from my perspective, it's like I don't change anything. Regardless of whether I was there or not, they would be ok. So why be there at all?

If I had never existed, what would change? Little to nothing. They would still have fun, they'd still have someone to talk to, and so much more. I almost feel like they'd be better off without me because I wouldn't be a constant distraction.

I've never had a close relationship with someone. And I mean more than just friendship, I mean true love. A mutual understanding, a feeling of companionship, of a warmth, of something so much more than just being friends. I see in films, books, TV shows and everything in between people finding ""the one"", a person who they can truly say they love and cherish. I feel like the opportunity to find someone like that is slipping through my fingers and I can't stop it. There's no one around me who could be ""the one"" because what kind of person would want to be with me? And besides, pretty much everyone else is already taken.

If I just vanished right now and never came back, how many people would truly care? How many people would miss me? They'd be able to move on because it would be such a small change in their lives.

This isn't about wanting to die. It's about never wanting to be here in the first place. I ultimately serve no purpose and can do next to nothing. I don't know why I get up on the morning, I guess it's that little handful of hope keeping me going. But what will happen when that drains? 

There's no reason for me to be here.

I'm feel like I'm on the verge of hating myself.

Everything is starting to lose meaning.

The little things that used to make me smile are starting to fade.

I have no-one.

And yet

As I write this

I feel nothing.

My family is far away and I like them a lot, but you can't tell your family everything and I don't really have someone for venting.

A couple of months ago I met someone online. At first we just connected really well, but over time we fell in love. We both had really bad experiences in long distance relationships and wanted to go step by step. One day she was like ""you know that I really really really like you"" and I answered that I love her. A couple days later she didn't want to continue with our relationship, which broke my heart and we decided that we shouldn't talk for a while. 
Fact is - we still talk every few days because we still think about each other all day. 

She thinks I could have every girl I want, but I didn't have anyone since about 10 years, so I doubt that heavily. Dating apps never worked for me.

The day we decided we shouldn't talk is about 3 weeks ago and heavy depression kicked in.

I just wanted someone to hear me out with no consequences. I know nobody thinks about us at the end of the day, nor do we get the compassion we seek. At least, this has been the case for me.

I was sent to a stay-in school from second grade and onward. So I didn't live with my parents. Seeing all the other kids being picked up by parents for holidays was shattering my heart. I always remember how they left as I cried as a child. Unfortunately, my relationship with them isn't very strong (mid 20s here).   
I have this missing feeling of a family, when I have problems with anything I don't have a safe harbor to sneak underneath. It has been very taxing to live a life this way. I recently met someone who is definitely cheating behind my back, that's another story but I won't get into details. I do really like her but this isn't reciprocated, I feel.  
Recently she abandoned me, literally, physically left when I was in a tough situation. 

At the end of the day nobody owes me anything, I owe nobody anything but I really wish life I lived have someone more constant and that I could have opened to. With her recent abandoning behavior, I relapsed with all the memories and have been unable to sleep past 4 days. Only a whopping 6 hours. 

Not that I have a give-up personality, contrary I do have many passions and am okay engineer. At least I really try with everything.

It is really tiresome to hear your phone beep, run to it with excitement thinking you received some nice text. In the end it's just a calendar notification or whatever. I don't know how much longer I have left in me to keep going.

Nice to know there are 218k people feeling in a similar way, however, I hope it was just me because I don't want anyone to go through this solace. Life is short, wish I could live it better. Even when I am trying to flip it for the better I fail at that.

Last year, I made friends with a girl online. I used to video call her often. She was really friendly and sweet.  A few weeks passed, and I started to develop feelings for her. I never confessed, thinking it would be weird. But then I got so close to her that I started talking less to other friends of mine and constantly came up with excuses so that I could spend time with her instead. I even used to stay up late to text her and make her day. I always used to be there for her when she had a bad time. I liked her alot.
Then one day, I decided to confess my feelings to her. She said she wanted to stay best friends with me since she didn't wanna break my heart.
I was confused and didn't understand why she said that (I thought to myself that she meant that I might not like her in the future. But the truth is, I'm stuck in it now). But even though I was let down by her reply, I was kinda relieved I got it off my chest after so long.
Weeks passed by..
I began to feel empty inside. I seem to have been losing friends gradually ever since I started to spend all my time with that girl thinking that she would feel the same. And now, I just sit and wonder when someone is gonna check up on me and ask how my day was. Its also come to a point where I get angry over other ppl's happiness. I don't have anyone to comfort me. I just hug my pillow when I feel awfully heartbroken. I just can't get over it.

* I'm in grad school
* I play some video games when I have time
* I read from time to time (I just bought ""Humanity: A Brief History on How We F*cked it all Up"")
* I like hiking
* I love space stuff (science in general)
* I don't often watch TV, but I've found myself doing it more often lately
* Favorite Movies: Lawless and Nightcrawler
* Favorite Music: J. Cole, Bring Me the Horizon, and some indie music; I like a wide spread

Obviously those are pretty broad/simple interests, but like I said I'm down to chat about nearly anything. I'd love to talk with people all over the world, no matter the region/time zone. I do not care about gender or any of that stuff, just looking for fun conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in it for a year and a half.

About 3/4 the way through i met my first wife.

got marred had a kid, had problems but tried to work them out.

We lasted 4 years.

Moved a friend of hers in.

She started sleeping with him. Marriage over. Weekend parent now.

Was single and 20 something still angry at the world. Started dating another friend and we decided to get married. She was having emotional issues and was taking some pretty heavy meds. we decided to have a kid. after the child came we fought every day and she was quite neglectful. We seperated and i tried to reconcile for about 4 months. I was rebuffed every attempt. I moved on. She divorced me.

we lasted one and a half years.

Had girlfriends, two of which are amazing people, ones an alcoholic who married a friend of mine (that was an insane relationship for 3 years)

One was my best friend of 14 years and we stayed together for 8.

I started working out of town and cheated on her. I broke up with her because I was an ass more than the problems she had.

Had one more attempt at a relationship after that. Long distance met on the internet. She fell in love hard. I had PTSD I guess and basically ended it because of fear and not being able to reciprocate the expectation and level of care she would give that would cause lack of communication and mistrust. She would lash out and i would hide and seethe at the troubles.

Now I'm sitting in my house with my youngest kid after a lengthy divorce that is still ongoing with the second wife. We've been in and out of court for 14 years. I'm so tired of her. 

I cry when i go shopping. I cant watch most television as it makes me sad. Going to restaurants sucks. It is so hard to stay motivated. I have a hard time relating to other people, even friends as it feels like they are exploiting me. 

Hell I cant even stay friends with teammates on GTA.

1094,almostmoronic,1621828334,1,"tl;dr: I felt so close to having a mutual feelings with someone then he decides he wants his ex back. 

Not sure where to post this but I need to talk. I feel like I was so close to escaping this loneliness. 

I (F23) got a new manager (M26?) about 6 months ago (we work at a minimum wage job, the manager aspect is not really a big deal imo). We instantly hit it off and he seemed to be really flirty with me but I hesitated because I figured it was just his personality. He would say things like, ""don't you miss the touch of a man, almostmoronic? I miss the touch of a woman."" He has also asked me to spend time with him outside of work, but he also labels it with conditions. Like ""i don't want it to be weird because of the conflict of interest or whatever"" His interactions felt genuine though, and we started to spend a lot of time chatting (and not working haha). 

Then out of the blue he tells me he‚Äôs trying to get back with his ex girlfriend. I felt like all of this was just a scam. I was just there to distract him from her. 

Then I got a job offer. I won‚Äôt get into, but I ended up not being able to take the job. However, both of us realized at one point that we would be having our last day together. He literally spent the majority of his shift with me and we ended up hugging. It‚Äôs not a big deal really, but with Covid this isn‚Äôt really something people do and generally I don‚Äôt like people touching me. I realized that I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time someone hugged me. It was nice. 

That same day at midnight he texted me that the ""hug was really nice"". Who says that??? I think that was the moment I realized it had happened. I suddenly had a spark of hope that I was so hesitant feel.

My first mistake: I asked him to hang out with me the next day. I was rejected basically because he doesn't want to screw things up with his girlfriend by hanging out with another girl. Honestly thats fair and I respect it. 

He pretends like nothing happened. I feel like a god damn child and humiliated for having feelings. I care about him, so I'm trying to respect his boundaries by being cold to him. But he keeps asking why we aren't friends anymore and if we will ever be again. It really just hurts too much for me to consider him just a friend.

My second mistake: Hope 2.0!! He made a quick comment that threw me. Apparently his ex was in the store, and said something like ""fuck, my ex is here thats not what I need."" I cannot remember exactly what he said, but it was not said in a good way. 

Despite this I feel like shit. This is the closest i've been to anyone in a long time (which really feels pathetic since nothing has happened between us). I've never had a real relationship. Re-reading this makes it all feel so trivial too.

1107,Beginning-Nobody2641,1621822642,1,"Maybe for some of you, things like getting more exercise, ""loving yourself"", changing your diet, taking medication, and talking to therapists helps... but I've DONE all those things... and they DON'T help. There is one, and only one thing that has been at the center of my mind for the past 15 years... and that's getting a girlfriend.

It's what I WANT in my life. I want to have someone that makes me feel needed, important, and special. I want to give love and affection and understanding to someone that needs it. I want to cuddle, hug, kiss, and be intimate. I want to share our passions and interests with one another and just have fun. That's all I want god dammit. That is what would make me happy.

But I've tried, and tried, and tried everything. I keep failing, for one random reason or another, there will always be SOMETHING that will conveniently prevent women from ever wanting to become intimate with me, at the most they will always just want to stay friends. I have a feeling more often than not they reject me because they think my face is ugly, even though I don't think I am. Nothing I can do about my face after all.

I'm always snapped out of my depression when I think I'm hitting it off with a woman and we get along, until very quickly I realize that they just are not into me. I know it takes people a... long time to become interested in you... but how come it doesn't on my end? I find people very likable and attractive very early on... I don't get it, isn't it normal for people to want to date initially upon meeting one another? What's with this pretense of having to pretend to be friends for a while... then maybe start dating? Feels like no matter how long I wait, they just grow more and more distant, and become less and less interested... it feels like miserable, agonizing torture.

The constant failures have made me lose hope. I must have talked to literally hundreds of women by now over the past 15 years, no exaggeration. And none of them cared about me. It makes me feel so worthless and horrible that the rest of my life suffers as a consequence. I can't bring myself to get a job anymore, can't bring myself to go to school anymore, can't even bring myself to go get groceries or even eat or exercise, or even do ANYTHING anymore besides lay around, feeling like shit. It's ruining my life.

I've tried so long to be positive and optimistic but there's just no point anymore. All I ever wanted was to have a simple, nice romantic relationship. Nothing wild, or crazy, or complicated... just simple... someone to share my interests with... that I could also cuddle with... and be their special someone... that's it. But I guess that's too much to ask for for someone as boring, ugly, and worthless as me. Fuck life, and fuck all of the magical solutions to depression everyone offers. They're bullshit and they don't work for me. All I care about is getting a relationship, I don't give a shit about anything else and nothing's going to change my mind about it. I'd immediately be cured of my depression and become happy if I could just finally have one... but I can't. Can't pretend to be happy when I'm not.

There's two people of my age in my department but they don't look like they want or need friends: the guy seems absorbed into work, and there's also a female of my age but she's the typical ""Princess Clafarie from Kingdom of Strongmenonly"", so I don't even want to bother there.  Jokes aside, I've learned how to spot these types of people the hard way and it's fascinating and disappointing at the same time just how much you can learn about a person without much effort.  
Interestingly, there was a person who talked to me on a meeting: one time she asked me if I was asleep. I had a second dose of covid vaccine prior to that day, so when I went on job training, my body was hurting too much, I barely sat through 4 hours. So, I didn't reply to her.... and the second time she told me I can stand closer to her on the meeting and she ""doesn't bite.. sometimes"" o\_o I'm completely clueless about these things and I don't think she wanted to flirt with me. I'm awkward and very weird in public, the more people there are, the worse it is for me. So, I got lost and didn't say anything...

Anyway, I try to appear neutral and I am, I really don't care about any politics and I try to not dismiss someone just because we don't have common interests. Still nothing. I'm doing my best in terms of social things but there's not much I can do at this point. I admit I don't look like I'm willing to talk, I stare at the same spot and don't know what to reply most of the time or show emotion. Plus not being fluent in English makes it more complicated.

I've made a few ones, but they've come and go. I currently have one friend, but after an incident last year me and him haven't been as close as we once were (in fact, I stopped talking to him for months because of it, it was bad).

Because of this, I've also never came close to a relationship. Had my first crush in eighth grade, made it too obvious, and she didn't want me which was understandable. In high school, I had a few crushes. Two of them I chased and failed (had a good convo with one through Snapchat, but both left me on read most of the time). 

Two years ago, I may have had the chance to change that. We were in a class together and we didn't speak. We ended up following each other on Instagram (as  believe that's all she used). She was viewing all of my stories, liking some of my posts, nothing unusual. Summer break rolls around though and then she started dropping all these signs on my IG. Not gonna get into those, but they weren't verbal by any means and I may have had a legitimate chance in successfully sliding in the DMs. Never did it though because I was nervous it would backfire.

Still regret not making a move though. Even though I've finished my first year of college, I still have an interest in her as I haven't made any connections with anyone in college. Still see her at the park from time to time when I'm shooting around or playing pickup games of basketball. Would go after her but it's far too late, she doesn't even view all of my stories anymore and that started this year. I feel like that was the dagger.

I don't wanna be single, but I doubt that'll change anytime soon. Had a chance and blew it because I never made a direct move when she was dropping subtle hints.",lonely,Loneliness hurts even more being single.,2021-05-24 09:34:17

1137,Iguana_lover1998,1621810877,1,"I've been meaning to put my feelings into writing for a while now ever since coming to university. It was meant to be a time where I can for a couple more years hold back having to live in reality and have to get a job and do 9-5s for the rest of my life until I retire at fucking 70 or some shit. But honestly, it has only intensified my issues.

I take the heart the usual cliches about making new friends. ""Just talk to people more."" ""Get out there more"" ""You're only making life harder for yourself by staying in your room all the time and not going out there and meeting new people"". I do all of that and I was hoping that university will give me the opportunity to make new friends since I've been an on and off neet since 17 (currently 22). I went out there, told jokes and met some really interesting people. But the thing that I could never do was break into the social group. It has only really hit me last night now that I am a week away from fininshing my first year at university when I thought about how I have nothing to show for my first year of university. The only difference between now and when I was a neet is that I am in education but nothing else is different. I still go home to no phone calls or texts, still have not made any new friends and at the end of the day of being a normie, telling jokes and really making some connections it breaks my heart that at the end of the day after our superficial chats it's just time to get back in my empty room that not even my flat mates knock on to check up on me.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I really wish I did. Despite being a devout Christian I have tried to seek so many diagnosis of my issues from going into the woods with my friend to do witchcraft (I never asked for material posessions but rather gnosis since I'm not a witch), bought an astrology booklet after filling out my age and place and time of birth and currently working out.

Going to church in university I thought would be an epic time to meet people my age since the guys at my church back home are all a bunch of married boomers. I thought it would be cool to have Christian friends who were my age. But honestly, it has only helped me feel even more alone that I have ever in my life. Today we went to the pastors house along with all the students from the nearby university and we were all having a talk and despite me inserting myself in the convo, actually contributing and making people laugh I knew deep down that i wasn't truly a part of the group. Everyone else had their own friend group that they could go back to. Had their own gang that they would meet with regularly. And then there was me. If you joined that meeting while I was there you probably would have thought I was good friends with them. And I'd like to think I am. But I've never felt a real friendship like that since I was 16.

The pastor is somewhat aware of my situation. He asks some of the younger workers of the university to meet up with me for a walk. I can tell as well since the only people who really hit me up for a meet up are former students who are now working for the church and it's usually at an arangged time like ""I can only do friday at X time"". I'm not here to deny a mans good works or seem ungreatful. usually the meet ups are great. Gives me an opportunity to leave my room and get out. And I even think that this person could really be my friend. But at the end of the walk I see the look in their eyes that they're just trying to get away from me now. Like a prosittue who wants to get rid of you after your hour is finished I see them suddenly make excuses to get rid of me such as ""I need to go mcdonalds now"" It's almost like they're saying ""Ok loser, nice chat. Now I'm that i'm done giving you a pity talk I'm going back to my real friends who I go out with for fun and not out of obligation""

1139,envarien,1621810485,1,"In hindsight, that sounds a bit dramatic but overall I guess that‚Äôs the best general statement I can make to sum it all up. 

Personally, I don‚Äôt see myself as an unlovable person. I find myself to be funny, caring (even if it‚Äôs in a tough-love type if way), and overall a really reliable and supportive friend. However, I wouldn‚Äôt say that other people see me that way. I have an incredibly sweet boyfriend who loves me very much, and I know my family and friends love me in a less intimate and personal way, which is nice but sometimes I feel like something is missing.

I am surrounded by a lot of friends who have friends that they are extremely close to. Like FaceTime multiple times a day, text constantly, hang out every day type friendships. Truthfully, it seems a bit unhealthy and co-dependent to me but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want something like that. 

Not to say I don‚Äôt feel like I have a close relationship with my boyfriend, but I‚Äôve never been one to have a partner be my only friend. I feel much more comfortable and satisfied knowing that I have my own life outside of my relationship in case things don‚Äôt work out.

I‚Äôve never had a close friendship like this for very long. When I was young I had a few close ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù come and go and end on bad terms as they always ended up wronging me in some way and I would end up cutting them off because I won‚Äôt tolerate being treated that way.

Everyone around me seems to have so many close friends or at least one lifelong friend. They post on social media about how they always go out and have fun and post each other and get each other gifts for special occasions, etc. and I always end up feeling left out. 

I always find myself comparing my own relationships to others and wonder why I don‚Äôt have a relationship like that or why they don‚Äôt do those things for/with me. Like I don‚Äôt see any reason why they wouldn‚Äôt because I try so hard to be a perfect friend but they just don‚Äôt and I wonder what‚Äôs wrong with me or different that I can‚Äôt connect with them that way and when I try to go out of my way and initiate these things it always feels ignored or unreciprocated.

Hello everyone, I'm posting just to vent mainly somewhere and to see if anyone out there is feeling how I am.

Recently for about the past 3 weeks I keep thinking constantly about suicide without anything triggering those thoughts, when ever I'm not hyper focused on a task my mind will start to think about  it.  I have been depressed for many years now but worried to bring this certain thing up due to the fact that it could get me section (IDK if it would just an assumption) and that it's a very hard to bring something up like that but it plagues my mind constantly I hate having these thoughts and puts me down even more.

Is anyone else having these feelings? What should I do?",lonely,Haunted by my own Mind,2021-05-24 06:17:30

1165,Kind-Individual1001,1621797513,1,"I've never had good luck in dating. I always thought it was because I was insecure and always depressed about being a T1D. It's definitely taken an emotional toll on me. I was teased in high school by teachers and other students about it. I would definitely say that it always made me feel needy when it came to my dating life. Made me just date the wrong ppl. First guy I fell in love with mentally abused me, took advantage of my vulnerability, got me pregnant and left me. I took care of him. I was with him for 10 years off and on. And when he cheated on me i always took him back.. stupid me. My pregnancy was rough.. always passing out, thinking I was going to die when I had those outer body experiences. I was truly alone, except I had my daughter who I spoke to at my lowest moments. Always praying that if God had to take me that he would save her. After that relationship I ended up with a guy who physically abused me. He would only hit me in the beginning if I did something he didn't like. Our last fight he stole from me and beat me close to death. I can't can't even remember how many blows to the face and head I took that day. I just knew I was going to die. And, my last relationship. This man pretended he wanted to help me with my depression, thoughts of suicide and everything else I fought so hard to understand what I did to feel this way or even be in this situation. Just to get me drunk and rape me. It hasn't even been a year yet but I get bits and pieces back of that night that. The thing that hunts my soul is him saying, ""now you got what I got."" When I woke up the next day I couldn't even call anybody because I don't have anybody. I just went home and took a shower erasing all evidence of being attacked. I'm going through this all alone. I tried to take my life 3 times after this and all of my sisters said they wanted to do with me. I've never left them in their times of need. Al psych majors too, you would think they understood. Nothing I'm not use to tho. My oldest sister always said she wanted nothing to do with me and I always wanted that sisterly bond. When I was first diagnosed with T1D at 11 my mom asked her to take care of me when she wasn't there. She said no. Years down the line in high school I remember rebelling against my diabetes and vomiting right in front of her in the hallways and she just kept walking. Today she'll say I'm always claiming victim. Maybe I am. Sorry.. just venting.",lonely,Disappointed,2021-05-24 05:18:33

I get home late at night and find myself alone with my thoughts. It is then when the darkness consumes me. Having nothing left to distract myself, I crumble beneath the weight of the world.

1169,abdelmoezz,1621793967,1,"A bit about my past: I was born with ADHD so was socially challenged. I'd spend most of my class times alone with a special tr. At a point it would be my goal to be in a class and have attention from someone bcs we r friends or they care about me or sth. So I find myself being the class clown at school. Ofc that doubles all stresses so I play games all day when I'm home. 

Past mindset:
having experienced some form of depression and lonlyness and addictions and withdrawal symptoms and also success and hobbies. I thought I was the barrier between making friends. Person A in my class isn't my friend bcs I'm not putting in effort to talk to them (my mom would literally tell me that many times PS: she stays at home forever literally) so that means I'm the problem right? I'm the reason why I don't have any friends or gf

Current mindset: 
After making a handful of loyal friends and a best friend who... In hindsight is an awful friend but came at the time I needed someone to trust in me The most. I was able to get over the ""inherently unlikeable"" mindset some pple have. SO I went out and talked to complete random strangers whenever I could. Most of which were workers. 

Problem: 
These people are a forced audience.  If I tell them I'm a photographer looking for work then sure bcs .... Idk y but that's a fine topic but if I ask if they like to chat sometime then they say ""what"" then they say sure. 
The guys got weirded out and the girls got scared and I got curious as to y. This isn't a personal problem. This is sth more objective than subjective. 
I learnt from online that some men don't take no for an answer and I realized how stressed or Surprised or scared some of the pple I talked to were. What if I got emotional then when they said no and asked them why and made them more stressed. 


Current struggles: 
When they wouldn't reciprocate my habits or attention or ask me questions or talk to me. Basically bad social ques like silence I would think ""that's your fault moezz u can fix this awkward silent, just talk to them u can make friends. You can do this, just change the subject"" 
But now that Ik the struggle a girl gets from being put in the spot I have a solution of just writing my number on a piece of tissue. But my brain isn't taking it so easily. I can't sleep oe relax and I'm stressed and I keep imagining how intimidating my confidence was or how scary my height could have been (190cm) to them (prolly like 160? Avg) 
The one time in my life I go out and want to make friends is when the pandemic is happening and there's no events and no whatever. 


TLDR; got lonely and approached strangers to make friends, had a nice talk then asked for numbers then learnt how I've put them on the spot and now I can't sleep and I'm not at peace with myself for hurting others when I want to help pple and make friends with my life.... I could use some therapy huh. I hate what I did and I don't want to be the person who did it.... Maybe i hate myself. If I was at therapy back at school maybe I would've (I'm 20btw)

1173,SnooDrawings2267,1621792605,1,"This is just gonna be a rant about some of my thoughts and feelings.

So I feel like this is slightly disingenuous as I have 2 real life friends. They‚Äôre great and I love having them in my life. But I thought I‚Äôd get some internet friends to spice up my social life a bit and meet some new people.

To do this I started posting on soo the ‚Äúmake friends here‚Äù type of subreddits. And people reply, we talk and then they usually disappear never to be seen again. Even the ones that last longer than one conversation typically leave eventually. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had an online friendship that has lasted longer than a month. It‚Äôs quite depressing tbh.

Like I say, I‚Äôm worried that this might sound a little disingenuous as I already have 2 friends and I‚Äôm swear that there are some people that are completely alone and have no friends. So I should be grateful for what I have right? Its just depressing to meet all these people and they just leave, one after the other. For seemingly no apparent reason. I‚Äôm always free when I‚Äôm not sleeping. I‚Äôm down to text all day. I‚Äôm down to call. I‚Äôll listen to peoples problems and worries. I actually put effort into the relationship and I try to be funny and give good answers. Not just ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù and ‚Äúsure‚Äù. So I don‚Äôt know why people always leave. It‚Äôs depressing. I‚Äôm thinking about giving up trying to find more friends and jsut being content with the two I have. But I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll leave eventually. Idk.

If I were a man, I think my life would turn out so much better. You can still improve your chances for a romance when you are a man by being funny, having decent salary and so on. When you are a woman beauty is all that matters.

I'm ugly, I have enormous bulbous nose, small and close set eyes, thin lips that you can barely see them. Large forehead, masculine jawline, underbite, awkward face shape in general. I have double chin even when I'm almost anorectic. Even when I'm below my BMI I have verid fat flaps like muffin tops. I have a saggy boobs even  though I'm young. My body is covered in stretch marks. I have a ""roasted beef pussy"", and apparently I also have a loose vagina. And that's not even all.

There is no reason why someone would like to be my romantic partner. I was never hit on in my teenage years. I'm getting old soon and it seems like I will never find my soulmate. Or rather I might find them, but they will only see my as a friend. I was friendzoned so many times, and my every crush rejected me. I almost come to terms of accepting that I will just spend my life alone. I'm fine, I like my own company. But it was just such a big dream for me to meet that on person to spent a life with. I had so much love to give. All I wanted was to find that someone I click and make them their favourite lunch box to work with a cut love note inside. And other cheesy things like that.

I think my last resort would be to get cosmetic surgery. I saved some money for a nose job and maybe something more. But even then I will not look good, so I'm not sure whether I should bother. I wish someone would just pay for my entire body reconstruction, I just don't have enough money to change everything that need to be changed.

backstory, i‚Äôm a single 21f living in the US with my parents and the rest of my family. i work full time in a customer service job, i drive and i have my own car (i‚Äôm planning on even getting a new car here in a few months)

i haven‚Äôt had a lot of luck dating (i‚Äôve only had one bf and that lasted 3 months.) i‚Äôm fat so men don‚Äôt really like me. i‚Äôve always held quite a bit of resentment towards men because they‚Äôve been extremely rude to me even in completely platonic situations where i am extremely polite (i‚Äôll ask a male associate at walmart for help getting something out of a case and he‚Äôll be snappy and rude to me; my male high school teachers always got me in trouble and generally disliked me) i don‚Äôt like working in jobs with men. 

recently, in the past year or so, i‚Äôve started detesting men a lot more. i‚Äôll be out and about on my own, treating myself to a new outfit or hat or something, and i‚Äôll see a group of young guys and it‚Äôll completely ruin my mood and instantly tick me off. i‚Äôll see guys i think are cute and it‚Äôll tear me apart (my brain goes like, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll never like you, he only likes skinny goth e girls‚Äù) and i start hating them too. i‚Äôve even started imagining physically hurting men, especially the men who have wronged me. 

but it‚Äôs not just men at this point. i‚Äôm in a couple discord servers that are meant to meet people, and i‚Äôll see little e girls (girls with darker complexions, such as hispanic women, and asian women) and i‚Äôll immediately despise them. i HATE other women, especially since so many of them have boyfriends and it makes me jealous. now i want to fight and physically harm them too. 

i‚Äôve been to therapy, and nothing ever comes of it. my therapist will just sit there and take notes. she doesn‚Äôt think i‚Äôm actually going to hurt anyone. but when i‚Äôm out in public, it‚Äôs very hard to control my mind. i want to hurt people. i want to kick an e girl in her stupid ugly fucking whore face, and ruin her best fucking feature, the only thing men like about her. i want to smash a bottle against a man‚Äòs head and pummel his face with my fists. and i can‚Äôt control these impulsive thoughts. sometimes it‚Äôs so overwhelming it makes my chest feel tight and god, i want to do it. god, i want to do it so fucking bad...

Sometimes this is ok, you just move on to the next person, you'd stick with the most appropriate match, the rest will just have to leave your mind.

I am a guy, I'm 26, I'm single, I have pretty much no friends, just one actually, maybe, I have managed to alienate everyone around me and keep everyone at a distance, I am not great at socializing, I don't know if the issue is the people around me and their particular taste of activities but I doubt it, considering people around me do manage to get friends with similar interests, I guess I'm ""different"" and not in a special snowflake way, I mean I'm just weird.

I don't know if it's a good or bad thing sometimes, sometimes I'm lonely as fuck, the last few months have been so lonely, I tried making friends but it's not as easy as it sounds, people don't find me interesting or I suck at maintaining friends, this is mostly fine to be honest, but goddamn this fucking sucks at the moment.

I just wish sometimes that I wasn't so alone, I watched one of those team games and I liked it, then I felt like crap that I don't have anyone to try it with.

I was always faking my persona a little bit. Whether it was attempting to be more talkative, more bubbly, pretending to care about things I didn't actually care about, constantly being the ""therapist"" friend. I remember trying an experiment to see what would happen when I tried to be myself. I'm not kidding I was made fun of for things like my style (""you dress like a mom"") and that I liked to read lol (also I don't know why this was considered funny, it's literally just reading?).. soo yeah didn't go well. I noticed that when I wasn't the above things (bubbly, talkative, willing to listen whenever friends had a breakdown), they didn't like me as much or acted differently. 

I always felt this pressure to be this perfect friend.. to be interesting, exciting, ready to listen when someone needed to complain, be the driver. As a result, I would go home feeling really fake and like I was an actor. I don't think I've ever had a friendship where I felt comfortable being myself. Or where people actually accepted me for who I was. Even opening up to people, I feel like they didn't care as much or weren't as attentive as I was when I listened to them? I feel like I'm always trying my best to take interest in what people are saying but no one ever cares to take interest in what I'm saying?

I distinctly remember feeling miserable when I'd hang out with a friend.. and they'd spend an hour just talking about their problems. When I would open up, they'd listen half heartedly for maybe 5 minutes. Therefore I've shut myself off and just don't like opening up at all anymore. I don't even know what real friendship is.

I later find out he messaged her saying I liked her for a very little time and stuff making it seem like I didn‚Äôt have an interest in her. I then get mad asking him why and hours later I get confirmation from another friend saying they were dating. I didn‚Äôt really get upset over the fact that they were dating.

Trigger warning - eating disorder and alcohol abuse 


I had an eating disorder that started from depression about 5 years ago, and it was somewhat manageable. I had friends I considered family and I still cared about my health. I cared about my future and I did what I could at the time. Then, my dad, who was my closest family member and my hero, died. With the passing months, i would sink lower and lower. I started drinking more, I started binging food more, throwing it up more... completely stopped working out. Stopped posting online . Lost the majority of my friends because I didn‚Äôt want to see anyone, due to insecurity and addiction/disorders. Now? No I have zero social media, have no real friends, my family does not like me and I do not have their emotional support. My eating disorder is worse than ever, missing my dad feels worse each time I think of him. I would really like to die too. I have no hope, no motivation. I feel like such a failure, I once had potential and now I just sit and think about death all day.

I feel like I was born into this world knowing all I'd get to experience is hate and scorn and dying the same way as well and it's highly tragic like because all I see nowadays is blue, black and white, lives mattering but when do the fuckin people who actually give a fuck about the world and societies future matter, I've seen people literally so dumb that they think that a virus you can lab test yourself doesn't affect them and that a practice for wearing a mask is bad that shits normal, Japan's been doing it for years even when there's not a problem because they make the shit a trend. 


I'm so tired of the shity friends, the shitty dads, the shitty moms and the shitty people who live in the same biosphere as me i just want to be able to be happy and live I'm the same planet where I feel not everyone is a terrorist in their own right. 

I'm just so fuckin tired, I wish half of you could experience the thought of what it means to live a long life to the point I envy the people who get to die sooner than later, life is like a curse when everyone is so free that they make others lives like a cage our their own creation.

I can barely talk to a white person without being corrected, I can barely talk to a black person without having a motive of some kind, I can barely talk to someone who's Asian without them going off a stereotype, and I can barely talk to a Indian,  hell I wish I could talk to a native American so he can tell me how fucked up the world is so I can get high with them and not give a fuck anymore.

1247,Fabulous-Advantage,1621736199,1,"Even a therapist wanted to figure out why I didn't make any relationships despite it supposed to be natural. 

21m, about to graduate college. I always struggled with being a sensitive eater so I would lose my appetite when eating with people where I could be seen. Part of this got worse around others, but many times alone it was hard too. Naturally, I would be hungry so I needed to find that time alone to try to eat. In middle school I pretended to eat lunch. I would be hungry, maybe eat a box of raisins, and I would do sports after school so when I got home I would basically have a meal. Maybe I was very shy, but food was always what got my anxiety to rise, if there was an event I would wonder what food is there and would people see me eat? I would get very nauseated and feel like gagging. Liquids and fruit helped me. Same thing in high school, I had a couple friends, but we never got super close because I didn't want anyone to find out about my eating, because I would not be able to eat. I did band and marching band, placed first and performed well. I got straight A's and was in leadership for a club. I avoided being in places where people could see me eat because I would be hungry and not able to. I would get so nervous I would not eat. I had to be alone or where people weren't paying attention to me to feel more calm. I got into a top school in the US and did my best to try to make friends. I even wrote a diary on it, since I knew I would struggle with it. Maybe I had a lot of social anxiety, I wouldn't know what to say, and eating was a problem too. Most people found louder, more engaging people and eventually everyone left me. I ended up leading a club, teaching a group of students and worked 6 different jobs. I felt like such a fraud though. I didn't have friends so I felt bad because I felt like I was supposed to make them but every time I tried I got hurt, I didn't know how to make friends. Maybe I am very introverted but I also find myself really being in a lot of emotional pain to not have people I can trust and relate to like almost everyone around me. I started therapy before my third year, and went in for my eating, but the cost of sessions, and my parents convinced me not to do it, I stopped. I tried a few more times throughout my 3rd year but never stuck with it. I forced myself to see it through in the summer and after that I decided I didn't ""need"" it and the changes were things I wasn't willing to do at the time-- that's why it wasn't working. I wasn't willing to try to learn things about people, I was tired of it, I wasn't willing to care about people because I felt I couldn't even care about myself. My senior year I went back in for real, and once again I didn't stick with it because I found reasons to not trust the therapist. Now working with my school, they are telling me to stick with it for real when I resume it after graduation. 

Despite being surround by people for 4 years I found ways to avoid being known. I looked away, didn't talk much. Maybe it was severe anxiety, maybe it was a history of being hurt and also surrounding food. Maybe I was filled with too many insecurities and shame. Maybe no one wanted to 'know' me until I was healed. I couldn't open up about my history to others because no one wants to dwell on the negative. Maybe I was unwilling to have a fake persona just to have friends. Maybe I didn't accept myself and was too ashamed of not being ""social"". I'm too tired now of people's changing whims. I'm usually friendly but I don't count on people to keep doing it. I'm still trying to solve this problem, or at least understand it better. I want to know what makes me so different, when everyone I see has at least a friend or two.

Here's my story:

In elementary school I was in the same class with the same kids for all 6 years of it. We were all super close and I could confidently say I was friends with everyone in my class. I even had a couple people I would have called good friends. 

Then I started middle school. Unfortunately, the elementary school i went to does not feed into the Jr high my parents put me in. No one that I went to elementary with attended my middle school. Literally no one. I had to start all over making friends. 

That's when i realized I was just bad a making friends. I don't know how to. I watch videos to try and learn and I read articles and all that shit but nothing fucking works. I guess when your younger its just easier because you don't over think it? Or maybe I'm just fucking weird and the kids in elementary just put up with it? 

Im a freshman in highschool now. 

I try to talk to people, I join teams and i do clubs. But no one connects with me. I might think that I've made a friend,  but once that season or club ended they never talked to me again. 

(Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy being a part of a team, but at the same time I don't feel *apart* of the team. I feel disconnected social-wise but not performance-wise.)

I sit alone at lunch and just be on my phone. I stay hone all day all week (besides school) because I have absolutely no one to hang out with. Or anybody who cares, tbh. 

I'm tired of watching people laugh with their friends in the hall and hearing people talk about their plans and ""this friend and that friend"". I'm tired of being the loner.

None of the girls in my life are interesting.
Like, some of them are attractive but they lack a desirable personality or any hobbies, some of them are great people to be around, but they don't take care of their body i.e. they are either overweight, terribly skinny, or have a bad posture. 

I study at a university but the whole thing is on Zoom, so conversations really don't last that long, I've made 3 friends so far in my class and they're great fun, but like I said. They don't look after themselves.

1270,Chumpy_Corsair,1621726352,1,"I am talking about the current situation right now. Everything online whether you are in college, school, or you are a working professional. I am currently in my first year of college and want to remain everything to be online and not want to meet people now.

You must be asking why I am thinking like this,

I am tired of everything right now. I am tired of caring about everyone excluding my family. I also want some private space and privacy. I cannot every time cater to your wishes and needs. Whenever you feel low or your mood is not good, you call me or text me. I don't have any problem with consoling you but what about me? I don't want anyone to talk to me. Instead, I just want to be with myself. Just want some me time in which I can be alone and rest a bit. I can't be always available to you. I can't listen to your depressed routines and talks every time. I admit that I myself ask about your state whether it be mentally or physically but sometimes when I am not texting, it means that I am busy or consumed in something else. You always say that I intentionally ignore you. 

If this is what you are saying about ignorance then you have not faced the real feeling when someones ignore you. If what I am doing is ignorance then I don't know what more I can do to make you happy. I am exhausted now and can't take all this anymore.

Just leave me alone. I have started distancing myself and will totally depart when everything seems fine.",lonely,Does anyone else also want to remain in a situation like this?,2021-05-23 09:32:32

1272,vogelias,1621725170,1,"I am an 18 year old male person from Europe and fuck, its night again. It is may, and usually I loved, when the summer came around. I sat outside till the sun went down, and waited till it came up again. I loved the night. I loved weekends, and the weeks which were coming. Meeting up with friends, laughing and talking about the things, that matter for me. 

At the beginning of this year, my SO quit the relationship between us, and it hit me really hard. I quit going to school, even if it was allowed to go there. I broke up most social contact and I was wondered why I ended up so lonely. First of all, I thought it was no problem for me being alone. And during the day - it is not. I go to school again, even if I have to redo the year and I am now in a class where I am just as lonely as I am here at home. 

But be that as it may, the days were and are better than the nights. The nights remind me of the great nights I hat just two years ago. When I sat outside with people and laughed, we enjoyed hearing just the noise the night made, now there is no one who I can enjoy being on earth with. Nights - the time I loved - are now the worst time of day for me. 

I was always okay with being a loner, but it gets really bad now. And i do not know where this post is going to end, I am just writing down what is screaming through my head, because my thoughts are getting so loud, I need some place to let them out. I hope this all made a bit of sense to you, and if it didn't or my english was just too crappy for you, I am really sorry.

However, this year he got into a argument with my newly found group of friends. It was super petty, but he ended up leaving and hanging with another group of friends he knew for longer. I left me new group too and joined him, mainly because I knew him for far longer and felt a lot more comfortable around him, plus I had a lot in common with him compared to the others. Then after a month or so hanging out with him, he tells me that he thinks I should hate him for splitting up the group, and that he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore. I went through the whole grieving process, and then 4 days later, he apologizes and says he's sorry. But by this point I was done grieving and ready to move on with my life. I told him that it would be better if we both just moved on with our lives, and that what he did to me truly hurt me. He said he was sorry for everything and wished me the best of luck. And I have moved on, but I still have days like today where I can't help but reflect and just feel hurt, and even though all of this was his fault and he treated me like shit, he's still the closest friend I've ever had. I've always been too nice for my own good, constantly letting people step on me, trying to appease everyone I meet. It's screwed me over majorly and I've been trying to not do that anymore and become more confident in myself. And it's working.

1290,SinArchbishopofSloth,1621715999,1,"**Venting*****. The trigger warning applies mostly to a few sentences at the end of the last paragraph.***

I'm so sick of everything, I feel like there is no place for me anywhere. I just shouldn't exist. I'm unlikable/unlovable, I can't make real connections with people and even when someone else makes a connection with me (which is very rare) it doesn't last and I still end up being alone again. 

The only person who still talks to me is my ex-girlfriend who said she still wants to be friends, but she only vents to me about her anxiety and we never talk about anything else. I don't mind listening to her, I care about how she feels and want her to have someone to talk to, but it feels like the only reason she even talks to me at all is because I'm the only one who will listen and understand her, and if she had someone else to talk to she would forget I exist. We don't do anything fun together anymore or anything else that isn't me listening to her vent and it doesn't feel like a real friendship, just a leftover of a relationship that ended almost 3 years ago. It's not anyone's fault, it just sucks, and it adds to the general feeling I have anyway that everything sucks.

I never talk to anyone irl about my feelings or my problems becasue I don't feel comfortable doing it and when I do try I always regret it because at best it just doesn't help but usually people don't understand and say things that only make me feel worse. I do go to therapy and I talk more freely to my therapist than to anyone else, but that still doesn't really change anything.

I can't just focus on living my life becasue I don't have a life, I just exist. I don't do anything with myself because there is nothing worth doing. I'm not interested enough in anything to really devote a lot of time and effort to it. This makes me a boring person that no one would want to be friends with, let alone anything more than friends. 

I hate being single, but I know it needs to be this way because I'm not attractive and I'm not in the right mental state to be in a relationship. I just can't stop thinking about it becasue being in a relationship is the only thing that ever made me really happy. Not just the ""yay, a new episode of my favorite show came out"" kind of happy, REAL happiness. The kind where I can stop for a moment, look at what my life looks like and think ""yep. this makes me happy. I'm glad I was born because I get to experience this"". And not only that, it gave me purpose and motivation. A reason to do things. I had plans. I had goals. But all of them revolved around the relationship I was in, which means that when it ended, I had to deal not only with the emotional pain of a breakup, but also with all of my plans being ruined and all of my motivation and sense of purpose disappearing. Being single makes me feel very lonely, but it also makes me feel like my life has no value. I know I shouldn't think like that, I know it's unhealthy, I know it's wrong to define the value of my life by my relationship status, but I can't help it. It's how my brain works. I can't sleep without hugging a pillow and pretending I have a girlfriend or a boyfriend. I listen to ASMR M4M boyfriend roleplay audios on YouTube. I need that kind of intimacy, even though I can't have it and don't deserve it. I've tried to think about other things that I could want in my life, but I can't think of anything. 

I feel that I don't fit anywhere, not only socially but also in terms of what kind of person I can be, what path in life I can take. There is no path for me. I don't want to be anywhere, I don't want to be any kind of person, I just don't want to exist at all. There is nothing for me in this world. I'm tired of everything. I don't want to continue, but I have no choice. I feel like I've never really had a choice about anything. I've never been free. The whole world is one big prison. Just being here is so demoralizing. There is nowhere to go, no one to turn to. I don't want to be part of any of this... I wish my parents didn't have me. &gt;!I think about suicide every day. I'm not going to do it, because I have no access to any reliable method that isn't likely to go wrong somehow. Also because if I died my friend/ex would have no one to talk to about her anxiety.!&lt;

I need some understanding or just simple advice to get this girl out of my mind. In no way do I mean this in a derogatory sense. I first met this girl when I was in middle school. I knew I should have built the confidence up and asked her out, but I was too nervous. And man did I blow it. We became good friends throughout high school but she had a boyfriend when we hit sophomore year of high school. We still continued to talk, but I wasn‚Äôt going to intrude on her current relationship. Her usual self was bubbly and easy to talk to. when we were in bad class she would talk to me like her usual self, but when we would round the corner to go down the steps which is where her boyfriend would meet her she then would get super quiet and give short quick answers. I figured she didn‚Äôt mean any harm by it so I didn‚Äôt think much, but when I reflect on it I can‚Äôt help but think maybe he told her not to talk to me. I was also told by a few people that when we're talking in Band class she would look at me in some type of way. I figured they were just busting my balls. Also, her boyfriend would glare at me, but he never said anything and other people also said he was glaring at me. Now I truly don‚Äôt know if he glared at me or not, maybe his normal facial expression was resting bitch face. So who am I to judge?

Anyways we both are in college now and she is still with the same guy and I have totally excepted the fact that I blew my chances. Around every 3 or 4 months, I get these weird recurring dreams of me and her just talking nothing sexual is involved in these dreams. Every time I get these dreams I just feel super lonely it's almost that I am longing for a relationship, but I don‚Äôt know how to make sense of it.

I should also mention that we haven't spoken since graduating high school; however, it's only been about a year and a half. I also will be transferred down to the larger university where she is at because the original college I was at filled my first two years of my bachelor's and I have to transfer there. It's so large I doubt that I will even see her, but do you think I should talk to her on Snapchat to rekindle the friendship. I definitely don't want to intrude on her current relationship if that would be too weird.",lonely,How to get a girl out of your mind.,2021-05-23 04:19:02

1306,Zinaticka,1621705664,1,"I am 30yo gay guy, I have struggled with my mental health since I can remember, suffering from mild anxiety and depression that have always kept me from living the life I wanted or achieving the goals I set myself to. I've made a lot of progress over the last year in terms of self acceptance, I used to hate myself, the way I looked and my personality. I've now got a better relationship with myself. However I can't seem to have a good relationship with anyone around me! Every weekend my depression kicks in as I keep spending them alone, because I don't really have many friends, the ones I talk to more often live abroad, and the ones I have locally are either toxic, which I'm trying to distance myself from, or otherwise busy with other commitments and rarely see them. I hate that every weekend I get this feeling of sadness because I literally have no one to reach out to, even on a nice day like today, I would love to just ask someone to go for a walk or a drink at the pub, now that they're opening back up, and the only person I see regularly is too lazy to leave the house, which is the only place where I meet them.

I end up spending time on dating apps, where people are not even sure what they want cos they'd engage in small talks until the conversation dies, or stop responding if I suggest a plan to meet outside. Also, knowing that everyone around me is making plans for the weekend to be with their friends whilst I'm stuck at home by myself just sucks.

I hate being asked ""what are you doing this weekend?"" and having to answer ""I haven't got any plans"" it literally feels like people feel sorry for me when I answer that, which I get it cos I do feel sorry for myself for not having plans.

I'm currently out of work because of covid, we're not told when we're going back, I suppose it will be around September, which isn't too bad because I don't really even like my job that much.

I have thought about spending this alone time by starting a side business and doing something creative, cos that's kind of what I do for a living, but as soon as I sit down trying to produce something I get a massive block and get frustrated. 

The only thing that keeps me going right now is going to the gym, the whole routine of going to the gym, seeing familiar faces and being focused on my training and nutrition makes me feel like I'm doing something good for myself, but that only works for like a couple of hours in the morning before I go back to being alone all day, and even at the gym I've never managed to meet any new friends cos I'm also kind of an awkward introvert, I just get too much into my head if I think of approaching anyone, and other than casually saying ""hello"" to the gym staff when they walk past I don't really make any effort cos I'm always thinking I'm gonna make a fool of myself, and I can feel them becoming uncomfortable as soon as I ask them something because of how awkward I am.

I just don't know how to go about this. People look forward to the weekend cos they're gonna have fun, whilst I dread the weekend coming cos I know I'll be feeling like this.",lonely,"It's the weekend, the sun is out and I hate all this",2021-05-23 03:47:44

1324,noobplayer551,1621691204,1,"About 4 months ago, one of my friends and I found a stray kitten (about a month old) one night when we were coming back home from a restaurant. The kitten was weak and thin, and was shivering a lot. My friend decided to take in the poor soul for that night, feed it, clean it and then drop her off to where we found her. My friend wanted to keep the kitten, but since she already has a cat it wasn't feasible. 

However, she grew fond of the little bugger, as did I, and decided to keep her at her house until we found the kitten a new home. I played with the kitten a lot, and I have to say, those memories are some of the fondest I have in this dark period of my life. The way the kitten would come up to my lap and ask for pets and scratches melted my heart. And she was teething as well, so she tended to chew on a lot of stuff, my fingers included. Unfortunately she wandered off one day, never to be found again. I was heartbroken, because I grew a lot closer to her and was contemplating adopting her in myself.

Playing with the kitten is when I have felt the most loved in recent times. A creature so pure, who loved me for me, and made me realise that not only do I want to be loved, I want to give love, and give as much of it as I can. What do you guys think?

I cant have a best friend nor a female friend, they all at the end turn their backs against me and forget I've ever existed...


This same issue I have been dealing with has been over 5 years ever since i hit depression. Lost so many good friends because someone else came into their lives, lost so many memories because someone else remade them, lost so many opportunities to get a girlfriend because the girl became so interested in someone else. Even when you try to talk to me, it's 100% sure you'll leave me at the end...

Irl I used to be best friends with a group of people who always cared and loved me for who i was, until some stupid idiot joined our class and everyone started to compare me to him, compare the likings and looks to him, then they all left me in the dark and was left with noone... Online, met 4 people (3 girls, 1 dude) 1 of the girls were like my best soul mate, we talked for a month, shared so many laughs, even said goodnights or good mornings.... I thought i would finally get a girlfriend, or finally get a best friend that can never get broken... but she lost interest in the end... she never talked to me... when i asked if everything is fine, she won't tell me.. she closed the doors on me... the 2nd girl I met, talked and met over reddit, became best friends for a couple days, then i saw her boat go far and beyond to where i am... the dude i met in discord, thought we were like brothers... we liked the same music, liked the same anime, but he left, still to this day he haven't replied to my message saying ""hey man you there?""... 


I'm always the last one to hold the rope and noone else is.. I'm always the last one who cares the most of the other person.. 
I'm always the last one to be picked by most people..


Isn't better if i don't exist? isn't better if i was never known to the human world? isn't better if i was never in the eyes of someone else? 


what have i done to deserve this... I always keep my heart open for the people and in turn gets hurt but not them... i dont want relationships because i suck at them.. i dont want short term friendships because it sucks.. why can't i find someone who can help me or support wherever i go?

1344,lexil00h00,1621670169,1,"    I'm so awkward and socially inept to the point where I am now a few months shy of 21 and having no real path. I still live with my parents, have two friends at most, dropped out of highschool, stuggling to get a GED, and my life is slowly wasting away. Just like my teenage years, I fear my 20's will fade through nothing but being alone in my room and that the only deep conversations I'll share will be with my mom. 
    I desperately need someone but I'm not sure what that someone would entail. I'm quite sensitive, I'm severely overweight, and I just want a companion. I'm not sure how to go about it though and the idea of acting on it scares me. I have yet to encounter a man who is willing to see a big girl as beautiful and not in a gross way. Genuine love and compassion is what I want from a man, because all I've gotten is hate and disgust. No reassurance for me.
    On top of it, my social anxiety is slowly but surely creeping back into my life and once again ruining things. I can't even make a simple phone call with a robot without having an anxiety attack. This sickness has taken over me for the second time in my life and I'm desperately trying to keep it from taking away any chance I have. 
    It's not fair, seeing my normal peers living like true adults and even starting families while I'm still in the same spot I was in nearly 6 years ago. I try doing the good and right thing but I can't help but think that there is something I'm doing wrong here to deserve this punishment. I just want to understand why. 
    I'm still hoping though and trying my absolute hardest. I just needed to get these nasty thoughts in my brain out somewhere. Hoping this helps ease things up a little.",lonely,Too Shy and Anxious to Function,2021-05-22 17:56:09

I mean, I totally understand if in the first times (and with first times I mean 2 months max) the other person has less time for his/her friends. But I hate when ""Friends"", even after almost an year of relationship, still can't manage to find a day / evening for you, especially if they always repeated that you are ""SOOOO IMPORTANT"" for them (yea, a polite way to Say that you needed me to vent and pass your time).

Here's a simple example: a dear (ex) friend of mine got engaged back in Autumn (October). Since then I Met her around 5 times lmao even thought before her engagement She always asked me to hang out. She's always busy with her SO and her group of Friends. She basically dumped me for her and the other group. We only meet in Uni now (we attend the same classes), so I perfectly know how much you have to study in our day planning and I can clearly Say that I manage study, work too and meet every single friend of mine during the weekend.

So, no excuses. You are all the same. As soon as you see p***y, you totally lose your mind. Do not even dare to come to me whining if your love story ends.

Long story short she broke up with me. But before she did she revealed to me that she was faking this kind, and sweet personality I fell in love woth. And frankly. I was destroyed and still am a little bit 5 months later and I feel like she ruined my perception of relationships as a whole. And last night I cried about how I would never be able to feel love like that again. And be able to trust it now. I already have trust issues but geez man she made them so much worse.

1389,KollegeMalte,1621651259,1,"I broke up with my first girlfriend slightly over a year ago after 6 month of a beautiful relationship. And it was the right decision. Let me tell you about it.  


I've known her for a long time, because we played over 2 years together in an orchestra together and we were not in the age to date.  Just sitting, playing, small talk - nothing more. In our last semester in ""high school"" (I'm not from the US) our class made a trip to Italy and she posted her first pic on Instagram. And that's how I began to fall in love with her. I just kept looking at this particular picture. I even spend the whole night trip (over 10 hours) just looking at this post. 

So I began to chat with her and together we had a great time. After two weeks I couldn't think of something else, so I asked her for a date. Together we watched a movie in cinema, but she was very exited and wouldn't stop talking during the film. My totally logical reaction was to kiss her - it was perfect. It just worked. It was a great evening, but I can't remember the film.

We spent a lot of time together and I even drove to her school to kiss her while I was sick. Every free time I had I spent with her and we got pretty comfortable together and around another. After only a month we had the house of her parents for our self and we spent 3 days together ... and 2 nights. We used them. We just had a great time.

Four other great month passed, but then the problems started. It was an complicated problem, too long to explain. At the same time corona started to spread so we couldn't see us anymore. I noticed, that we have a completely different idea of our lives and we didn't work together as well as in the beginning. There were a lot of problems, so I decided that I can't take it anymore and break up with her. I spent the whole day with her to let her ask anything and explain it to her like she deserved. 

After the breakup I wasn't too down and I had good coping mechanismen to deal with the situation, but we never talked again. In the first time since the breakup I now have the urge to see her, speek with her and find her old Instagram account. I've done quite a few all-nighters in the hope to find her - without results.  


Now I hope to find relief in chatting about the whole story, her, me, maybe a similar story from you, your ex or you. Thank you.",lonely,Help get over my ex,2021-05-22 12:40:59
1390,Lonely_Gap_2075,1621650914,1,"Getting older never bothered me before but for whatever reason, this did. All I can think is that this is it, the best years are behind me.

My longest relationship lasted 6-months and that was six years ago. I have had maybe 7 romantic relationships my whole life. The longest I've ever held a job is about 2 and a half years. I have three friends, two of which are total flakes and the third lives on the other side of the country. I probably spent 75% of my life alone--like utterly alone-- including my childhood.

I have pretty severe social anxiety. I tend to freeze when I get anxious. Except with people I'm comfortable with, in which case I lash out verbally. I grew up swearing I would never drink or do drugs (addiction is a big thing in both sides of my family) that lasted until I was 20. Then I was a drunk. I left my hometown six years later because I realized I was going to drink myself to death (one of the small group I had been hanging out with did exactly this three years later). The  I discovered marijuana and was basically stoned for the next decade until tldr I had a bit of a psychotic break. I was sober for the next 7 months until I found myself making the best money of my life (read: I could afford to put money in saving) doing a job that made me hate everything and was alone on Christmas. Basically, I am a trash person.

I grew up fat and was miserable and just wanted my life to be over until I found a hobby that made me feel good about myself at 28. I lost 70 lbs over the next seven years and very active. However, most of the culture within the sport is essentially highschool jocks. It was like being bullied in highschool all over again. Except that I couldn't move to escape them--believe me I tried. Sooner or later they would show up or someone else that heard about me. I guess people enjoy talking shit about the weird guy. I ended up leaving the sport for a while. And then Covid happened and I couldn't go back or even meet new people. I gained more than 30 lbs.

I have a psychiatrist but since I am moving now I have to find another one as well as the therapist I've needed. There are no mental health services where I am moving. Moreover, I don't think I can afford them but I make too much too get free healthcare as my employer doesn't provide it (there goes 15% of my net income) and I have a crushing amount of student loan debt. 

I like my job. There's lots of room for upward growth in terms of money. But it forces me to travel a lot for extended periods. Eventually I won't have to travel so much but the lonliness is getting pretty close to unbearable.

At first i told myself she was just using me but being a bigger guy i don't get much attention and she couldn't keep herself off me when together. Well we spent the entirety of 2020 texting from morning to night. Would hang out when schedules permitted. She told me she never felt such a connection with anyone even her husband, i felt like a drug for the first time in my life i felt so wanted. Her friends knew about me and agged me to ask her out saying she needed a good man. She said yes than suddenly thinks we rushed so dialed it back. Morning texts, cute nicknames, dirty snaps. Then suddenly in first week of march 2021 she wanted to be single thinking everything was too rushed and she was scared and needed to get her head straight and feelings straightened out but swore up and down she was still interested but just wants to be friendsand hang out for now, well I'm 32 and not stupid so i knew right away. Well 5 weeks later no communication but still out at the bar, but never wants to hang out with me or even see how I'm doing. So just used as a temporary emotional crutch and rebound and it fucking hurts. I honestly felt the same and thought we had such a deep connection but because i always fall too fast and so hard i was blinded. We even saw each other today and she wouldn't even look at me. Tell me why is it like this? I fall for the worst girls every time and it always hurts, but its never hurt like this. A part of me wants to keep hoping she'll come around especially since all her friends and family thought i was good for her especially compared to her previous husband who was mentally and physically abusive and i would constantly pick her up and encourage her. But deep down i know I'm probably not even a passing thought. I really wish i wasn't so Empathetic and such a Hopeless Romantic. Any tips for getting over stuff like this fast welcome and appreciated.

I didn't talk to anyone except for one person, but I knew people enough where we would have small talk, follow each other on social media, etx. I wasn't a loner loner. Plus I hung out with my cousins a lot during those years (one summer I was at their house almost everyday). 

Then the pandemic hit and worsened my loneliness as my senior year of high school came to an abrupt end. I thought college would fix that. Nope, instead my loneliness worsened. I just completed my first year of college and have failed to make any friends. I barely know anyone outside of the ones I met through a FB group or the ones that found me through IG's suggestions but we don't talk. Almost everyone in that college feels like a stranger to me. 

The other frustrating part of this loneliness: that need for a relationship. Never had one even though I'm 18, but want one. I may have finally found someone two years ago as they were dropping a lot of signs throughout that year's summer break on my IG, but I never shot a message or nothing. Instead we never talked and nothing happened. Haven't found an interest in anyone else since then and since I still see her from time to time, I lowkey still want her. Ain't happening though, I mean she doesn't even view all of my stories anymore like she did up until this year.

Im surrounded by a thousand souls and somehow im more lonely than when I was alone at home. I guess maybe the two acquaintances I had, that I saw every couple of weeks, were enough to keep it away. But last night I just couldnt help but to break down. Crying myself to sleep in a hostel. Ive looked forward to this for so long, I feel I shouldnt be feeling like this. But still the sentiment remains. Just the fact that I dont really have anyone to talk about my trip with, to share all those little oddities that come along with travel, no one that asks me if everything's going well and if my train arrived on schedule. No, ive only got myself.

i think and act differently from the most of the people( no idcont mean these ppl are bad i am better), i am tired  of being misfit.  i hate myself so much because of that. i dont like to use hate word towards anyone cuz i dont think anyone deserves this word in the world, but i hate myself the most. i am tired of pretending as well, like everything is fine.

Now, I've finally decided to post something here. Please excuse any mistakes I may have made writing this post, English isn't my first language. I think some of you may have been in a similar situation. I'm just going to vent quite a lot so if you don't want to read that much or don't have the necessary time right now I understand:
I've been gone from my home town for a few years due to university and work related stuff in other big city. I was very anxious to come back home, I really had very high hopes that when I get back I'll finally be able  to meet with all of my old friends. But the thing is, I've been back in my home town for a few months now and although I've tried to contact my old friends, whenever I ask them they tell me sure but after that they just find an excuse or two to not show up. Now, I thought that maybe, they see each other behind my back and I can take that, but no, I've asked around and they don't even see each other anymore. So now, I'm back in my home town and I feel like a total stranger man. Even my best friend, or someone I considered my best friend throughout  high-school isn't hanging out with me or with our old friends anymore. Again my so called friend, finds excuses like the rest of them. The funny fact is that I didn't choose this lonely lifestyle, it has chosen me and many others like me. It's amazing how we can live in such times, were everyone is connected thanks to the rise of technology aka the fourth industrial revolution trough Wi-Fi's or fiber optic cables, but at the same time nobody is connected on a human level anymore. Of course, my parents also started worrying about me asking me why I don't call my old friends to  hang out and stuff, but they don't know that I've already tried that. What can I tell my dad, hey man, your son is a lonely loser that lost all of his friends. And my smart ass also choose to come back in his home town and stay and work here. Why is our generation like that I ask myself and worse I fear that the younger generations are in the same boat as us. My university social life was of course also affected like many others due to the pandemic, and of course I started to feel like this since then and I had hoped that my life will be better here, I was of course wrong.
Why do people who were friends once grow so distant with time, are we all destined to end up like this? I know I'm living an unhealthy lifestyle and I'm trying to change that but no luck, I've hit the bottle more and more and I keep doing so along with vaping and occasional and very rarely a pack of cigarettes to help me cope with my condition.

1450,CHONKY-MONKY--,1621622098,1,"Everyone watched me fall apart over the years and everyone's gone away from me now and im so alone with my thoughts everyday and i cant function in this life and i dont even know what to say to anyone bc everyone has their own problems so I'll just talk here for now. 
It's getting so unbearable to wake up everyday and feel this way. I feel so unlovable, I'm a burden to everyone. Also the reality of being who i am, I've fallen behind so much and ive held onto any type of love i could in the past even when it was toxic and it's damaged me even more and i really need to speak to a professional about things that happened when i was younger bc i cant process it properly and it makes me living everyday so much harder and i open up my heart but im only worth my body and i created a false idea in my mind always of life to deal with the true reality. I dont want to keep fooling myself and i know im not wrong, it's everyone else whos wrong, who has support around them, they can live in ignorant bliss away from the reality of life and the reality of life is like that i dont want to live and i just want to die. I let myself be treated so badly to not be alone and now im alone with my thoughts and i think I'll call the suicide line again maybe bc they will make me feel stupid for being sad again. I can't even trust people anymore these past few years my trust has been broken even more than i thought it could and i still kept giving and lying to myself and im such a tragic loser. 

I can't stop thinking of younger me before bad things happened, before my innocence was taken from me and i feel bad for her, I've turned into such a waste of space. I used to be so happy. 

Also all the injustice in the world, it gets me really down and it's so unfair how people can be so heartless to others in need of kindness and i dont want to be in this world where its happening all around me. Humans are evil, men are evil. Men ruined my life and i still forgive them. Men ruined the world.

They dont have the emotional capacity to understand the women's experience, they abuse women, they protect eachother, they're so dumb they can't express their emotions and they blame society yess standards that you created in your fucked up world and u blame women. You never take accountability, you think youre above women. You even try to speak about womens issues like you would under stand, ""I'm not like that"" yes u fucking are. Men's minds are so distorted, they can't even be friends with a woman they're so weak. They touch me, they think they own me, I'm not a possession but i feel like one. I really reduce myself down to being a possession and confuse it with love. I was ruined when i was 8, men ruined me forever and they will continue to. Imagine being so dumb you think with your penis, how stupid. How i live has been dictated by dirty men, why did i feel sexualized at 8, I was only 8. Men love to hear about sexual abuse too, they want to hear about how i was used. They get off to it, men are evil. They can try to act like they care but the truth is they love to mess around with girls like me because I trust easily, i was broken, I was taught how i look is my only worth, they love damaged girls. All men prove it to me. I'm left with these mental scars and men can't even apologise to me i dream about finding him and cutting off his penis bc thats what they deserve. Men who hurt women must be castrated, take away their testosterone, being more like a woman would decrease crimes against women and men. Men abuse boys too, they ruin them, then they carry on the cycle because men are evil. People who repeat abuse are discusting humans. Wouldn't even call them that, you know how it feels why would u carry on. Men lack empathy, they are empty inside, they drain womens love bc men have drained theirs already. I'm not going to say not all men bc it is all men. All men in my life have been evil or they're defended evil. After everything im a women so i still want them to love me because I'm abused. How pathetic isn't it. I've seen men get aroused by my negative experiences and blame me. Why would u blame a victim you heartless evil. All the men who hurt me i wish so much for their dirty smegma ridden  cocks to get necrosis so it falls off or I could get some heels and stand on their cocks so they burst and watch them cry. So many men want to hurt women, sexually want to see women in pain. Why would u want to hurt women? Its because society suppresses your instincts to concur women. That's why u eventually lash out and rape us, abuse us. Abuse children. Men are evil. You are born evil. You ruined me. Stockholm syndrome, I love my abusers. Toxic love it the only love I've ever known. Who wants to live in my world, I don't.",lonely,"Humans are evil, espeically men.

1455,Gondal90,1621619432,1,"Pretty much my entire life I have had a hard time having friends but I have always craved friendships and intimacy. I just wish people liked me. I did make friends in the past but every single one of them eventually fell apart. I have seen some people keep friends for years and years. 

I also never had a girlfriend. Most guys by my age (25) have had a girlfriend and dated so that is an indication that something is not right. Is there something wrong with me? Is there something I do wrong? I honestly don‚Äôt even know anymore.

So when I do try to make friends it always *seems to me* like people just are not that interested. Like they do not view me as important. Like I‚Äôm just an expendable to them. 

To me a real friend would be someone who makes an effort repeatedly to talk to you, shows genuine happiness and excitement when around you and genuinely cares about you. Hardly anyone ever meets this criteria.

People I try to befriend usually seem distant and the conversations are usually one sided (me making most of the effort/caring) while the the other person could not care less if we‚Äôre friends or not. It‚Äôs like they view me as low value.

I have seen people who have fulfilling friendships. What are they doing right that I‚Äôm not? What do they have that I don‚Äôt? Now I‚Äôm all fairness I‚Äôm not sure if my perception of other people having little interest in me is *actually* true or whether my interpretation/perception of them is inaccurate.

My (now ex)boyfriend and I spend almost every weekend together, doing any and everything. Just watching movies with him felt like the most special moment ever. We used to get fast food every sunday. It was our thing and I loved it so much, even if it‚Äòs something so simple. 
Now the weekends are unbearable. I know he is out there partying, has a large group of friends of like 40 people and will find another girl in a minute online or in reallife. He doesn‚Äòt have to spend one night alone if he doesn‚Äòt want to. 
And then there‚Äòs me. Alone. Nothing to do on the weekends. Nothing to look forward to anymore. No movie nights, no partying, no talking and cuddling until 4 am. Of course he doesn‚Äòt miss me. Why would he, he has so many people in his life to fill every void. I don‚Äòt have that kind of luxury. I am bound to laying in bed alone. Thinking about how much better it was with him next to me. I don‚Äòt laugh during comedies anymore. I don‚Äòt enjoy my favorite animes anymore because I shared them with him and watching them alone doesn‚Äòt feel the same ever since. 
Even my favorite fucking burger king menu doesn‚Äòt taste the same anymore. I don‚Äòt watch my favorite show anymore, I don‚Äòt listen to my favorite songs anymore. Not because they remind me of him, but simply because I don‚Äòt enjoy them the was I used to with him. And nothing really tastes good anymore. I hate this. He probably already went on dates and did all ‚Äöour‚Äò things with his friends or new girls and doesn‚Äôt have to ever experience this tasteless, joyless void. 
What did I expect? I was dumb enough to believe someone everything they said. That they would never leave. That I was the most important thing to them. Their one and only. All lies. I‚Äòll never believe someone else who says this. I guess at least I‚Äòve learned something. 

I am just constantly looking for a feeling, the high, that I once had. But it is sadly unreachable alone.

I have borderline personality disorder (bpd) so that also doesnt help. I'm sensitive and when my ""friends"" just dodge me then let me walk away, it hurts and gets me thinking if I'm even worth anyone's time or energy.

Boring mostly.

Well,  not at first. Put apart the questioning and the longing, the free time  you get is great. Travel? Anytime, anywhere. Cook? Whatever you want.  Going out? Same. The freedom is nice, doubly so when your friends settle  down and start complaining about the lack of it.

There  was a time when it hurt me a lot to be alone and undesired. The first  time it's fine, you turn to advice and do the whole self-improvement  shtick. But no hint of attraction in decades does a number on you, no  matter how good you're able to not let rejection touch you.

So  I went the other way and decided that, if I have no success dating, I  might as well make my life cool. I volunteered at suicide hotlines and a  lot of ecological associations. Picked up cooking, sewing and  gardening, do sport every day and can say I'm fit, which is nice.

But  damn, when I see someone nice while doing grocery shopping and think to  myself ""She looks cool"", I remember I don't. I picked up meditation  just to have mental techniques to forget about what I missed in my youth  fast and focus on the positive.

But  now I'm at a point where my friends have less time for me because of  family, those that divorced remarry, and I'm here with a job, a house,  freedom and absolutely no emotional or romantic life. I never held hand,  and honestly, it feels like it wasn't worth it.

So I introduced two of my closest friends to each other in regards to a work related issue basically to help them out. One of them being my oldest friends (for more than 20yrs; since school) and the other one I‚Äôve known her for 7 years from college. 
I knew they had been in touch for some time, and I could sense after a few days while talking to both of them that there was something going on. 
I like to keep apart my relationships at a very individual level, while talking to them I could essentially tell they were quoting out each others words while talking to me. 
So I jokingly asked my female friend if she liked him and wanted me to hook her up with him. She straight up refused that she even liked him. 
After a few days she was the one who kind of broke it to me saying that they do have mutual feelings of liking for each other and they have talked about it in detail and were dating. I told her that I was happy for them (since somewhere in my mind I could see them pairing up pretty well), and was glad that she told me (I was kind of in disbelief though that I had simply brushed off my flirtatious moments potentially leading to dating with her friends on several instances in fear of the complexities coming in the way of our friendship but she didn‚Äôt even consider that; how it could affect our relationship, or mine with his). 
And my male best friend of &gt;20yrs from school, it didn‚Äôt occur to him to mention to me that he has been going out with one of my closest friends. He has been talking to me blabbering about the random shit we usually talk about acting completely oblivious. 
Is it unfair of me to think that he should have mentioned it to me once, or even have considered all the complexities he would be putting me in? 
I would have wanted to hear it from him first, after all I have known him since I was 3 yrs old. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned anything to me about their ongoing thing...... 
I‚Äôd have given him the headsup any way. I‚Äôm not so petty as to ruin other people‚Äôs happiness for my own sense of emotional gratification. 
I am happy for them since I know they are a good match.
But I feel betrayed honestly and confused. I can tell how this would affect my relationship with the both of them. 
I have decided to take a step back from my friendships with the both of them...... not even confront them about it since they seem so head over heels kinda high. 
Is it fair of me to think that way?

I can't even watch movies or shows because I obsessively remind myself I'm just looking at pixels on a screen. I have a gf and for the most part I am able to enjoy cuddling and watching movies but there's this constant nagging and visualization of myself in 3rd person- even when Im hanging out with friends it's like Ill get this image of the location Im hanging in but from afar and feel so incredibly isolated and alone due to the vastness of everything around me and knowing theres millions of people all having separate experiences I will never even know about. 

I almost went to rewrite this because I feel like it doesn't make much sense but it's literally how my brain processes my experiences now. It can be more or less complex given my environment and who Im with or what Im doing but for most of each day I'll obsess over some iteration of this feeling. Ill occasionally drive downtown because seeing thousands of people almost brings some relief (even if I had already hung out with people that day) but the relief will quickly disperse. It basically renders any excitement for the future impossible. Nothing I do seems to help with this feeling. It also obstructs my ability to focus on things I truly love and enjoy (painting, hiking, piano, reading). 

I know I should see a professional but wanted to post this to see if anyone else could relate.

I recently got a job as a janitor and it just makes me feel so fucking pathetic, I went to a trade school and learned to weld for 4 years and now I'm cleaning goddamn toilets.

We both have parents who are addicts so we bonded over that. Other than that we have walked two different lives. My mom was a single parent who was barely making by and she went to a private school and lived with her rich grandma. Her grandmother wasn‚Äôt a nice person at all but the girl had everything handed to her. 
Fast forward to 2016 immediately after getting out of a shitty 3 year relationship she jumps on this guy who was always in the background waiting for her. She doesn‚Äôt live with her grandma anymore and decided to live with her new bf. That would be fine but the house is disgusting. They have 2 dogs and 8 cats that keep multiplying. The dogs don‚Äôt get taken outside so you have to step over piles of shit when you enter the house. And there fleas and bed bugs. And she‚Äôs 22 and has the audacity to say that‚Äôs she struggling and compare it to my struggle when I was a child. 
Our friendship ultimately ended when she said that I was using her to buy weed at her bfs house. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôd time my trip down there to get weed but I live 30 mins away and work all week. But I‚Äôd just try to get weed AND hang out with her.

It almost feels as if my family made sure to hurt me so bad that the damage would be irreparable. I think they wanted that. They wanted something to project all of their misery onto. They hate themselves and they want me just as damaged as them. 

There are differences tho. I chose the light. I let my humanity remain. But even being light the issues don‚Äôt just dissipate. They‚Äôre still here and it hurts. 

I want to prove them wrong. Show them that you can go through hell and back and still be okay. That love is possible for the traumatized. And not just another empty relationship, or worst, an abusive one. But real love. True love.

1552,noname-piss-off,1621556981,1,"Idk when I finally was happy for having a friends I realized how my life is still miserable. I‚Äôm not really sure if friends are just there so you can have someone to spend time with you or someone who you can actually ask for help.

1553,Sv3n_7405,1621556186,2,"Well, I'll start off by saying this is a long story, but I've kept this in for a while.

I have done alot of resentful things in my past that I just beat my self up about almost everyday. Its horrible. I don't want to open up to my friends about this so I feel isolated in a way.

I can't tell them the things I've done because I don't want them to think of me another way. I've recently turned to religion to feel better about myself and so I can be apart of something bigger than myself.

Anyways, begging of 2021 I was still 15. And on the 15th of January I had my first girl friend. (Since you are seeing this you know how long that lasted).

I have a tight group of friends, 2 other males and 2 females. My best friend started dating one of the girls in my friend group. For a while I was uncomfortable around them and I didn't know why. Things eventually got back to normal. Until the other boy in my friend group started to date the other girl in the friend group. So now I am the only alone one in my group.

That isn't the part that bothers me though, but the second girl (for privacy reasons I'll call her Lilly) I used to have a HUGE crush on, like 2 years type of deal. She was so smart, pretty and had a great sense of humour and respected my wishes. I thought she was the one. Clearly I was wrong.

Again, not the part that bothers me the most. As of now, I think of her as a sister above all else and I think I prefer our relationship that way.

But as what happened with the first relationship in the friend group happened again, I start to feel uncomfortable. I don't know what to do now. Last year was so good, no one had girl friends, no exams it was in some cases it was more peaceful (all things considered). Just 2 good friend playing Minecraft, not a care in the world.

But I just wish things could go back to normal, I do sometimes go out for a walk, I sit on a bench and I think. Often I regret most my life choices.

Some days I wake up feeling hollow, I don't talk to anyone unless I need to. I am always tired and its horrible. I'm really just looking for some advice.

I like to think I'm the person in the group everyone looks up to for emotional support. I am always better at making people happier and healthier. I love it, I live helping others, I've been referred to as the dad of the group aha.

But sometimes, it just gets to me, and I'm look for help. This is the lowest I've ever sunk.

I don't know what to do now.

1555,ssprue20,1621553849,1,"This is going to be a long one for those who are willing to read.  
I was playing dodgeball with my students after lunch today, then all of a sudden I got a message from a very good friend saying that Miura Kentaro, the writer and artist of the long running manga series Berserk, has passed away at the age of 54.  
I then found myself just standing, feeling confused and with doubt as the kids were playing. I played a bit but it was very hard to focus after reading such news.  
We all have that special one, whether it is a video game, a manga, anime, short story, a novel, a movie, or a Television series that does more than entertain us. It transforms us, enthralls us, moves us to the outer limits of knowing what it really means to be human and even appreciate it, and Berserk has been the one for me, and for all who have followed the series strongly.   
I was in Community College when I was in heavy nerd mode of reading and watching Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead graphic novels, and I heard whispers and even recommendations through peers about this one particular series. I was of course intrigued, curious even, so I checked it out, first watching the anime series from the 1990s, then reading the manga in its entirety through the course of seven or plus years.   
A story set in the dark medieval ages, where demons roam free, and where only the strong survive and the weak suffer and die meaninglessly. It is a story of one man named Guts, who overcomes both physical and mental conflicts over the course of the series.   
I was completely stunned at the pace and intensity of its storytelling. Down to the roots of being Shakespearean; filled with betrayal, chaos, despair, and the possibility and yearning for hope, all backed up by some of the most amazing artwork I have ever seen in a manga.    
The series was known for its use of graphic violence and sexual content, certainly not for those who have a sensitive stomach, but it was no issue with me, because it was all in service of the story, showing how the human soul has no limits, even in the midst of such bleakness and chaos.   
This meant the whole world to me, something that changed my life, for one who has gone through painful days of loneliness and depression, feeling that life can sometimes feel totally and utterly meaningless, feeling that I will never be good enough for anything at times, but then I look back and just see someone like Guts, who never asked to be born, never asked to be betrayed, never asked to lose the love of his life and his band of comrades, and never asked to be cursed and eventually be fated to die. But with all of that, he pushes through. He never prayed to any God, and never stopped to think ""what did I do to deserve this?"" He just pushes through. Maybe its because there is an inkling of hope that tomorrow can be better than yesterday.   
It is hard for me to describe this feeling. Words themselves cannot express how much this series means to me, and for all those who struggle with life, whether that is of exterior reasons, mental health, politics, family issues, relationship issues, trauma, jobs, and so on. We have every reason to give up, life can be too difficult sometimes. But as I have said, who knows. Perhaps tomorrow might be better than yesterday.  
I even have grown strong bonds with some of my very close friends who I call brothers thanks to this series.   
Goodbye Miura Kentaro. I really hope you knew how much your series has really meant to us. Because you really have touched so many people's hearts, especially mine, and for that, we will strive for a better tomorrow. All thanks to you, I will do what it takes to keep going, stay inspired, and think of all of your amazing characters (well except for Griffith) and your story, and your artwork. I will forever think about it.   
Rest In Peace, Miura! How much I have dreamt of maybe getting the chance to meet with you since I am here in Japan; to thank you, to cry on your shoulder, from the bottom of my heart for changing the life of a very emotionally sensitive human being. Very few artists like you come along in such dark and questionable times, giving a hope of pure light at the end of a very dark tunnel.",lonely,"Words cannot express such a loss, such a talented artist, who has touched so many.

Before we get to the list, here's the back story:

I am a 17 year old with an anxious attachment style, tako heart and my driving force in life is finding a soulmate. I'm not career driven and literally nothing makes me happy unless I have someone to share my achievements. This is just who I am. You can call me a toxic amount of codependent, I don't care. When you go through what I did, you BECOME codependent. I'm the type who makes the person I love my world and my #1 priority, sacrificing almost everything to make them happy.

I met someone who was perfect in every way and who helped me move on from my past, and helped with my depression in the most substantial way. From supporting me with words to helping me get over bad perceptions of myself. Best part is she is Muslim and I wanted a Muslim partner. This person is perfect. Like seriously. In. Every. Way. I can't describe how deeply in love I am with this person even now. I am well aware people are flawed but I loved and still love this person flaws and all. 

Well they left a few weeks ago. Saying I was attached to them is such an understatement but they left in the most toxic way possible and made me feel like I'm actually the worst person ever. I helped them so much with their depression but they made me feel like I didn't help at all. Threw me under the bus for all the effort I put into helping her as she helped me. She might be able to forget me and move on but the sad reality is I can't. You don't develop a bond as close as ours and then shit on it and leave without a single proper explanation (she emailed me. didn't even even tell me through text or anything). The issue is I understand why she didn't say it in text either cuz I also hurt her. The difference between me and her is I was willing to change and not hurt her anymore. I hurt her yes, but whenever I did before, I always never did it again and changed. I wanted to make her life better and put in a tremendous amount of effort on her and myself. But she just gave up on me.

As of now, any progress I made getting out of depression or suicide are gone. Any qualities I thought I had are gone. I have 0 reasons to love myself or think I'm cool. This is aside from the numerous suicide attempts I've been going through this month.

Anyways, I've lost happiness from every single hobby I had, so for the last 3 weeks I've literally been working on a list of why I'm the worst partner anyone could fall in love with. Her rude words still echo in my head and I wrote down some of these qualities with her words in mind. So I don't even know if half of this list is true because I don't even trust myself. 

I completely understand if my words do not make sense, I've lost my ability to articulate my words. I'm not even sure if I'm venting or calling out for help or justice I don't know. 

But without further ado...

Here's the list:

I don't eat healthily

I swear a lot

I gaslight loved ones

I lie all the time

I look like a registered sex offender

I make my bed pretty gross

I make too many dark jokes

I say hurtful things to people

I self-harm 

I sometimes starve myself

I talk too much

I watch boring and uninteresting YouTube videos

I always am depressed

I always am horny

I always am in one room of my apartment

I always ask for too much

I always blame myself

I always cry over anything

I always repeat shows I've already seen

I always watch stupid shows

I am a nightmare to deal with when stressed

I am hypocritical

I am impatient

I am manipulative

I am not funny

I am not tall

I am overly clingy

I am picky with foods sometimes

I am picky with sauces
I am probably a dark triad 

I am probably infertile so if you want kids sorry

I am probably impotent so sorry

I am selfish

I am stubborn

I am ugly

I am inattentive

I am unaware of current events

I am way too lovey-dovey

I have a masturbation addiction

I have a messy bedroom often

I have a porn addiction

I have a small penis

I have an anxious attachment style

I have bad breath

I have bad memory

I have boring conversations

I have no attention span

I have no life

I have no motivation other than love

I am a garbage Muslim

I am a bad communicator

I am a slob

I am a very boring person 

I am very dumb

I am very evil

I am very gross 

I am very jealous

I am very hairy

I am very rude to everyone who gets to know me

I am very rude to my family

I am very toxic

I am very weak mentally

I am very weak physically

Half of me thinks this list is 100% accurate to me and the other half just wants to die. But if that doesn't make you hate me I don't know what will to be honest.

P.S. fun fact, I spent about 12 hours going through hundreds of websites, reddit NSFW pages, hentai, manga and anything in order to masturbate. But plot twist! Nothing makes me aroused anymore :/. This happened before she left too but that was for a different reason. The way my mind works is that ONLY she made me horny cuz I found no one more beautiful or attractive than her.

My name's Linus. I'm 20. I'm a german student. I never had many friends and my parents beat me up a lot as a child and whenever I talked with them about how sad I am, they laughed about me so I started hiding my feelings. About three months ago my girlfriend broke up with me after a three years relationship. I was suicidal before I met her and she gave me new hopes. By coincidence I met her in Rome and it was love at the first sight for me. She was literally perfect and gave me everything I needed. She was always there for me and so was I. I helped her out of her depressions and selfdestructing thoughts she had. We had a lot of inside jokes and it seemed like nothing could rip us apart. After school, we moved into a small apartment in a bigger city to study and we met new people and it seemed like we finally made it out of this big rabbit hole called depression. The first two months together were the best time of my life until she started being very toxic about all the little things I did. Like... Eating too loud or not waking up at 7am. I found someone in a bar and he had the same interests as I so I thought :""Finally, a friend I can relate with"", etc. We had a good time aswell. Then we all three did a lil party so my new friend and my girlfriend can connect aswell. They did connect a lot. At first I didnt notice but over the months my GF met him every day and since I trusted her I didn't talk about it a lot. To keep things somehow short: She broke up with me, I had to leave the apartment, he moved in and now they are together. She just dumbed me like a one night stand and I dont feel anything anymore besides from sadness and pure hate. I'm drinking way too much and I thought a lot about ending it all lately again. I just can't take this pain anymore. Please help me I'm literally crying right now because I have noone to talk to and I'm just scared of myself.

I don't even want to go for walks in my neighborhood. 
I can't stand making eye contact or being seen in general. I actually made a Tiktok because I'm so bored of being trapped inside, and I thought it would be a fun reason to dress up and put on makeup. 
My tiktoks get like 100views each and that's a lot more than I expected, so now I'm getting nervous and might delete it. 
I can't work a job and I can't drive. So I know my brothers think I'm lazy and judge me. I'm so tired of being stuck inside and having no money. 
I have no friends either. Not ONE. 
I'm not anorexic but I wish I was. I eat a lot and I don't know why it's so hard to stop. 
I stopped cutting myself awhile ago and tbh my only reason was that I didn't want people to see the cuts on my skin. But ever since I broke up with my boyfriend, no one outside of my family sees me anyway, so I am cutting myself in places they can openly see it. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. 

I can't stop thinking about my ex. I am so mad at myself for telling him that whole ""it's not you, it's me."" I wish I never dated him. I wish I would have been mean and told him he's an asshole. 
He didn't know it but I had made a deal with myself, which was that I'd never have sex until my weight was in double digits. That was my goal. But I fucked up.  He got me drunk and fucked me while I was too drunk to do anything about it. It hurt a lot,but all I could do was lay on my back saying ""it hurts, stop"" over and over. Afterwards I had a panic attack and cried. It took me awhile to break up with him, but I hated him ever since then.

I'm young and these should be the best times of my life but it's hard when no one really cares enough to spend time with you like a friend would but your parents are also too busy hating each other to do anything either. 

I'm kinda socially awkward and live a pretty sheltered life (strict parents) so I'd really like if one of my so-called friends were with me when it comes to most activities. However, every time I've reached out to them I either get rejected or asked to reschedule to some point in the future that never comes. It's honestly humiliating and I don't want to undermine my dignity by asking again. The most we ever do nowadays is get lunch but they tell me about vacations and trips they plan with others in the ""friend group"" or their other friends. No one ever asks me to do these things. And yes, they know I'm off but instead of figuring out something we can do together, they ask what I'm planning to do lol...  I'm like ""Yeah, I'm not totally sure yet. I'll figure something out.""

Back in Secondary school I did have a group of friends, but I was thrown out of the group once we left school.

I've always been the awkward and shy one. That experience really threw me into a pit. I have such bad anxiety that I find it impossible to just strike up a conversation with anyone. I've tried fitting in with people but I just find it so hard. Hell, I even learned how to ride a motorbike to try and make like minded friends but absolutely nothing has came out of that. 

If I was just a normal person, I'd be fine. But I'm not. I had to be born Asian who's suffered at the hands of racism as far back as I can remember. No one wanted to talk to the weird Asian kid, and that's still evident now when I'm 25.

I thought people in their 20's had a really good circle of friends? How can I not have a single person to be able to chat to, to call, to hang out with? 

My life is shit. My daily routine involve working, coming home and sitting with my thoughts, going to sleep then repeating. Weekends are worse. I don't work on weekend. So it's all day sitting at home watching all these people on Facebook/Instagram living their best life with their mates.

I wish I had the confidence to just walk up to someone and be like ""Hey, we're friends now!"" But I can't even do that.

I feel a bit shit because I‚Äôm always there to listen to them but whenever I try talk to them it‚Äôs always a half-assed response a few hours later at which point it‚Äôs useless. 

I dated a girl back a few months ago and even though it seemed like it clicked at first, she‚Äôd only want to talk about herself and rarely ever listened to me beyond which I gave up on the relationship. 

Even my family doesn‚Äôt understand me nor do they take the time to listen to what I have to say. They have narcissistic tendencies and criticize all my shortcomings and judge me heavily so I rarely ever talk to them about myself.

It‚Äôs such a shit feeling to be surrounded by people and not feel heard because you find it superficial to make you new friendships or relationships. I can‚Äôt even find myself attracted to any girls now because I‚Äôm always doubting myself if I‚Äôm going to end up regretting it.

Those of you that have read my posts before have seen that I take a sideways swipe at modern music lyrics and hopefully make some people laugh along the way. I‚Äôm feeling in a much more reflective mood today so I‚Äôm going to share something deeply personal. I apologise in advance for using this as some kind of online therapy session but I just wanted to share how deeply personal and affecting music in any form can be, even if it‚Äôs not considered ‚Äúcool‚Äù.

My wife died nearly 6 years ago from cancer. I cannot begin to tell you all how much that affects someone. All the plans for the future gone. A little baby boy now has to grow up without his mum. I have never been more scared in my life. But my wife had one wish. At her funeral, she wanted Let Me Go by Gary Barlow played. I was familiar with him because of his Take That days but wasn‚Äôt overly keen. And it‚Äôs a breezy pop song right? Why this song? Well, when that song played, I understood why she wanted it. ‚ÄúA room full of sadness, a broken heart, with only me to blame, for every single part‚Äù Wow. The song goes on to say ‚ÄúFly high and let me go, that sky will save your soul, when you pass by then you‚Äôll know, that this is gonna take a bit of getting used to but I know what‚Äôs right for you, let me go‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever cried more in my life. I‚Äôm still working on her final wish for me and son and as the song says, it‚Äôs really taken and still takes some getting used to. 

Now this song is actually about Gary Barlow losing his child and it‚Äôs sung from the child‚Äôs point of view. But I still think it‚Äôs applies to anyone who has ever loved and lost. Upon further listening to this particular album, there is a slow ballad called Dying Inside. This is the same theme but from his point of view. And it really does sum up grief and loss pretty perfectly. ‚ÄúHow can I make sure I‚Äôm invisible? I find just a simple phrase that may say it all‚Äù and then goes on to say ‚ÄúHow can I make sure that no one worries for me? Because I don‚Äôt need a helping hand and don‚Äôt want sympathy‚Äù I‚Äôm sure anyone who has lost someone close to them can empathise and even those that haven‚Äôt can get a feeling of the emotional rollercoaster that is grief. 

Anyway, I suppose I just wanted to share. Again I apologise if this seems like a therapy session, that wasn‚Äôt my intention. If you want to downvote because of that, please feel free. Just remember that music is an art form and if it makes you feel something, then it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job.

1612,ManyVoicesOneHead,1621513924,1,"First of all: I'm from Switzerland, so sorry if my English is not the best.
I feel lonely for a long time now and I don't  know if or what I can do about it. I suffered from  depression  from a young age and feel because of that I never learned how to get to know people. Some  social anxiety I developed from that comes in to play too. Anyway the main problem I have recently is: I am more of an introvert and don't need a lot of people in my life, but I feel like I just  need someone I can talk, watch movies, play games and I would love someone to cuddle (nothing more, I'm just a touchy person who likes to be hold). If this matters: I'm a guy. But the more I reach out the more I fail and the more I fail the more sad I get.

1613,Comprehensive-Ad8905,1621512648,1,"I had a rough upbringing, my parents were drug addicts who didn't care about me at all, I was bullied throughout my entire childhood at every school I went to and every after school program, camp, etc.  My parents divorced where I was forced to live with my mother and her parents who emotionally abused me daily for many years. I have a serious weight problem.  Whenever I tried to confide in anyone, I was either made fun of, or told that other people had it so much worse than me, so I should shut up and stop feeling sorry for myself. I began developing simple behavioral problems, and once threw a magazine on the ground in the therapists office. The therapist beat me up for it. I tried to tell my mother who was waiting outside after the session but she didn't believe me. I saw my father get arrested 3 times by the time I was 10. 

I hate to sound too dramatic, but hearing those things + traumatic events+ the bullying led me to a state of not just standard depression and isolation, but a near-total hatred and distaste to society and those around me. It got bad. I eventually became the bully and emotionally abused people. I lied to and manipulated people, and got into online gaming due to the appeal of the anonymity. I cyber bullied people on there too. I won't lie to you: I liked it for a while. It was fun. I enjoyed it, because I felt that people were never going to like me either way and was unworthy of love and understanding regardless of what I did, so my mindset was I might as well be the asshole I wanted to be and hurt people for entertainment.

But after a while, the loneliness begins to get to me. I feel isolated, like its me vs the world every. Single. Day. I feel like no one can relate to me and I can't relate to anyone else. I never thought I was a sociopath because I feel pain, sorrow, and I emotionally suffer. But its very hard for me to respect and love people, I don't know how to do it. I've been talking to this girl a few years younger than me online for a while. And despite knowing most of my issues beforehand, she fell in love with me. I have to admit, even when I would yell and berate her, she has been constantly loving and affectionate. I've made her cry multiple times. The thing is, I've had friendships, relationships that could have been close, etc and they all disappeared and/or became a shadow of the relationship it was. She is good looking, friendly, stupid, and naive. 

She wants to not just meet me, but move in with me and build a life with me. 

Even with her being someone who loves me, I still feel extremely lonely and isolated. I want to change that. The issue is that her and I have nothing in common and she grew up around alot of men who kissed her ass and told her she was deserving of the world for her looks. I had the opposite upbringing. I feel like she cannot relate to me and I cannot relate to her. We have fights, and I insulted her and ignored her calls tonight. I tried texting her, but she didn't respond as i think she's watching a movie with her brother.. I want to be happy. I don't want to be lonely, I don't love her but I cannot and will not break up with her because I cannot handle anymore isolation than I already have, so if that's all the advice you can give, spare me of it. 

I want to build genuine friendships. I want to feel loved and cared for, and even if this girl loves me, I just don't feel it. I want to work on my emotional health, because I'm miserable and I cannot live like this much longer. Every night I go to bed I pray that I don't wake up. I want contentment.

1627,Diks-myface-now,1621500378,1,"I remember waking up and telling myself I had a list of things to complete. I was sad because I couldn‚Äôt afford to travel anywhere, again!! I was also upset I didn‚Äôt find any shrooms. I remember getting food and just relaxing for a bit. Then on the drive back from Roti, I decided to visit the places I‚Äôve lived around in Chicago. I thought heavily about it for a moment because I knew I needed new tires and brakes and I didn‚Äôt want to over stress my car. I settled on it, called Allison (my bestie) and just talked. Went to Walmart,
 (I hated it, but they were open on NYE), got some stuff and decided to start my journey with going north since it would be the closer drive. I forgot the order that I went in but I remembered that I felt like I should go home to change my ambiance. When I arrived home at 30 Y/o, I wanted to smell a different home. I wanted pillows that were comfy. I wanted any of my comforts..

When I returned home from the 1st part of ‚Äúmy journey‚Äù and saw my sister in my parking lot... I remember my heart dropping like WHAT THE ENTIRE FUCK!! I told everyone no surprises please!! And although I knew it was a kind gesture, I wanted to have my own day where I could pick whatever I wanted to do because I almost never have ideas for my birthday. Then she stated that Mom, one of my brothers and Harry were en route and I lost all my shit... Like absolutely not!! My sister seemed to be confused and disappointed but I couldn‚Äôt care at that time. I remember feeling the need to run from my own home where I live alone. Feeling like one of them would knock on the door later and I didn‚Äôt want to fake a smile on my 30th. I‚Äôve done that too many years now so fuck that!!

I drove for about 2-3 more hours til about 1030 or 11. I got home, turned off all lights, actually closed my balcony shades and laid down. I remember only responding to Allison because I made it a big deal for her to remember my b-day this year. I sat in darkness for what seemed like forever. I was stuck in a frame of mind wondering how did I get myself into this one. I didn‚Äôt know how else I could get the point across. I said no! let‚Äôs not! maybe something else! I never confirmed a time or location with anyone for anything. I literally didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do until the day of. I figured time in the car is usually how I sort my thoughts, and I like driving why not see my past and how far I‚Äôve come and ponder on the growth that has been made in the last decade.

Cut to, I‚Äôm in bed unsure if anyone understands my feeling of loneliness...
Just because they offer to spend time for a while doesn‚Äôt change this fact, I‚Äôll still be alone when they leave! I of course kept my phone on do not disturb for the remainder of the night. I remember getting up to 40+ txt and about 15+ phone calls. I knew on the other side of that phone wasn‚Äôt anyone that was gonna hug me at night, or put up w my crazy little bullshit in my head that I go through. Just friends, family and relatives who remembered my phone number. Or ppl that wanted to make their Happy New Year rounds, which annoys Tf out of me.

I hit most of the places that day. I also decided to expand my scope to include any places of heavy memories. This way I could think of other times I was low and how I overcame in those moment of being underestimated at work. I wished that I‚Äôd just told everyone a lie like, I‚Äôm gonna do Uber. I‚Äôve done it before! idk why it was such a big deal for me to tell the truth this time. When I checked our group chat my sister had posted a meme about my boringness, which hurt my feelings a bit. I looked at all of them with their partners, happy but mostly unhappy and sad they‚Äôve settled. I wish someone put up with me enough in person to understand that I really want love but I don‚Äôt understand it. I seem to push away those who try to come towards me. Like I become sooo awkward in situations and I don‚Äôt know where to go. Needless to say, if I could have spent my 30th with anyone it would have been my coworker Avadh. We could have just watched tv or cuddled. He didn‚Äôt send me a happy birthday txt til like the 15th and I ensured I sent him a txt on his actual birthday. So I left it alone.

I was very unhappy in general on and before my 30th. I remember wishing I could chat w someone but lol I‚Äôd been out of the world of online chats for soo long. I don‚Äôt remember when I slept but I kept the lights off all day, and I stayed in bed a lot. I thought to myself, why did I close the shades? Like any of them would make a second 35 min trip. I‚Äôm sure they all said ehh it‚Äôs just Ramsey why is he upset or he‚Äôll be fine. I also remember being in bed and saying to myself holy shit, your 20‚Äôs are OVER... that was a long ass 10 years bitch! I eventually called Allison back... then my mom. 

Over time I started to see how this whole thing came together in the spur of the moment. I was angry w my sister and my mom for not putting a bigger emphasis on my personal space. Seriously when have I hosted a get together ever?? When did we think I‚Äôd be ok w this? My second older brother did try to stop it but apparently everyone else was sure I‚Äôd be fine.

# Weary Eyes

 Written By [Sydney Maccabe](https://www.notepadpoetry.com/works?author=5feabdf54fa6a530d78f671e)

The silence is loud sometimes when I want to sleep

My eyes are red and dry from staring at the ceiling¬†

And I want to close them¬†

Oh how badly I want to close my weary eyes

But the silence is deafening¬†

And when my eyes close

And the darkness washes over me

It is almost too loud to bear

So I do not close my weary eyes

And instead I lay in my bed¬†

Waiting for whatever awaits in the night to take me away

The needed sacrifice to keep the noise at bay

And my eyes adjust

But they do not close

And in the darkness I can see the outlines of all the people who have left me

And the silence streams from their mouths

And suddenly the silence becomes words

And the words make me want to shut my weary eyes

But even still

My eyes do not close

Instead I listen to their calls and their cries

Sometimes I feel my weary eyes start to close

But then the silence reminds me why I keep them open

Maybe one day I will allow sleep to wash over me

As I used to do as a child

Before the silence became louder than the planes that pass over my house

And it will be quiet

And it will be warm and light

And I can finally close my weary eyes",lonely,This poem is beautiful...and resonates so much,2021-05-20 17:47:20

I have a best friend who I've been really close with for 5+ years with now, we've been through a lot together, and they're my only friend left from high school (I'm 25 now).

1655,ColtsTech15,1621483393,1,"I ended the relationship over 2 years ago. She was struggling so hard with depression and wasn't taking the advice of her therapist, friends, or family to take a break from school, from work. Every moment she wasn't at work, or in class she was with me. I barely had time to hang out with friends (although I didn't have many and wasn't very good at doing that anyways, I had less ability to do so). I had made fake dating accounts to just have other people to talk to, to vent to about her. Inevitably things got worse between us, she found out I was using dating apps, and I ended the relationship. I had nothing left to give her to help her, and I felt drained.  We gave each other space, and after a few weeks we didn't see or hear a whisper of each other, or at least I didn't of her.

Now it's been 2 years, the last year and a half at least I've been fighting myself over the actions I took. I know I didn't handle things as well as I could have, but at the time I felt like I was running out of reasons I enjoyed being with her.  Daily I think about her, about what I did. A song on the radio, a scene in a TV show, a couple I see driving to work. I don't have FB, or Insta, we aren't Snap friends anymore and I don't have any other social that she is on.  The only glimpse I've been able to take at what is going on is her Pinterest board, which isn't much but I was at least able to see if she would post new things so I knew she was at least still alive.  I checked again tonight and found two fairly new boards, ""Foods to make for (insert guys name)"" and ""Future Farmer wife hobbies"". 

I don't know what to feel, I knew this would likely come at some point, I never knew if I was wanting to reopen the communication between us. I've tried too on dating apps to meet someone, I've gone to different therapists to talk about how I'm feeling, nothing has made a difference in my life.

I've made friends easily on courses but drifted apart in the years after as we moved on to different things.

I have one friend that I've known years, we message regularly but she moved across the country so we don't see each other very much.

I'm not working at the moment so I've no work friends and I'm introverted so generally not interested in group activities like sports. 

My partner is very extroverted and has loads of friends. I'm often asked to join them but they don't socialise in the way that I do. I've a history of social anxiety and I'm much better now but I find group situations and their typical nights together where they'll play games and drink really difficult. I'm also recently sober and all of their socialising revolves around alcohol which I'm not ready for yet. So he usually goes without me (which I don't have an issue with).

I like going for coffee or food, going to the cinema/a gallery/a museum, shopping, spending time outdoors in a park or walking, exploring new villages and towns. These are all things my partner enjoys when he's with me but we don't do them with other people.

I've asked my partner if we could meet his friends for coffee or over dinner so I could get to know them in a way that's a little more comfortable for me and then maybe progress to spending time with them in the way he usually does but he has never asked them.

I feel so alone and abnormal for not having any friends.  I've nobody to spend time with except my partner so when he is at work or with his friends I'm totally alone.

For the past few years I have lived a rather lonely life with no real contact (both friendly and relational) except for family. I used to have some friends but that has been diluted by circumstances.

Normally I was able to adapt well to living on my own, but I have noticed some change recently and a loneliness that is starting up again.

Now with the whole covid situation, people who also have rich social lives often turned to themselves and faced social isolation. Something that I do not wish anyone and I hope that everyone can enjoy the freedoms that will soon be possible again as soon as possible.

However, you hear a lot of people talking about the years to come as the roaring 20s. A link to the previous 20s. Where now everyone will soon be enjoying freedom and happiness in the form of parties, festivals, concerts, travel etc etc.

As already said, I wish that to everyone wholeheartedly, but on the other hand I am also afraid of it on a personal level, since I have to experience all this myself from an isolated perspective. I'm afraid this is a big break on my mental toughness and I wondered if there are people who recognize themselves in my story and might have advice or something like that.",lonely,Worried about life after covid,2021-05-20 06:35:23

I feel like I've just aged 40 years in 1 day, and look like a worse version of Willem Dafoe (actor).  
And it is all because of FCKING. Hayfever. Allergy.

I've been part of this sub for a while now, and amongst the ""lonely hearts"" posts here, some special ones have stood out to me.

**The posts which are about a personal achievement.**  
Whether just a small achievement such as talking to someone in the gym, or actually finding an SO (I'm still stuck on this part haha), I'm proud of each and every one of you for taking that small, first step.

I'm crying as I'm writing this (I hate this allergy. It's like Mother Nature wants to take revenge for eating broccoli), but being part of this sub has inspired me to think of my own small personal achievement.

A few days ago I had this idea which was a bit crazy: Could I make a chatbot that has a conversation with me and can help me in lonely times?  
And now I've made a really rough version that I want to share with you.  
I've found making it kind of meditative (it kind of distracted me from things around me).  
I'm really proud of this small achievement and the same way it helped me, I hope it can help you.

It is by no means a J.A.R.V.I.S.  
In fact it is so basic that when you tell it how your day was, it will go to the fallback question.  
It can't store any data, neither know who you are, sucks at having a normal conversation, and might autodestruct itself by accident.

I just wanted to create something that could help me personally in that rough moment when the realisation of loneliness strikes (Episode V: The Loneliness Strikes Back. Now in your nearest bedroom).

Because it helped *me* distract my mind, I'm hoping it will help *you.*I really don't want to come across as advertising.

This is a safe link I promise: [https://bot.dialogflow.com/does\_this\_bot\_work](https://bot.dialogflow.com/does_this_bot_work)

Let me know what you think of it in the comments. Were the jokes in the chatbot bad enough? Did you find it helpful? Were you expecting more?  
Any suggestion will improve this chatbot to better help me and anyone else who likes it :-)  


p.s. Even if you don't use the chatbot, I hope that at least this post made you exhale strongly through your nose.",lonely,I look like Willem Dafoe. And I'm only 25.,2021-05-19 22:07:38

Sure, I can have normal or supplementary conversations that include greetings, or topics involving work, but outside of work, and favors I do for those around me I am simply lonely.

I have met a lot of different guys and girls, but it seems I just don‚Äôt amount to whatever they are talking about. I don‚Äôt like talking about girls or how big their ass is or if I would ‚Äúhit‚Äù that. I actually find that quite disrespectful but I lie to fit in. I wouldn‚Äôt say I am searching for someone to be like me, someone I can open up to, because I am confident that will never happen. A lot of things have happened the past few years. tremendous life changes, deaths in the family, yet all I can do is sit here and exist with it all. I hold these things in and sometimes I feel like I am going to explode one day and just fucking lose it. I know I will sound selfish when I say I have no friends but it is true. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone at all throughout the day. I am consumed by my thoughts and full efforts to fit in to society. I wonder why I am even progressing in life, in my career if I have no one to share it with. I have no purpose.

I think it‚Äôs just normal for me now. Being alone. Thoughts of ending it have become normal too, easy to joke about and it‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôm serious about it half the time. I do my best to help others because it‚Äôs literally the only thing giving me purpose.

Our DMs became a safe space for me. I typed my heart out to them every day, told them my secrets and they would tell me theirs. Every day our chat was filled with heart emojis and 'I love you' and I was never happier.

Then they told me a terrible thing.

The person they were pretending to be was a girl who died over a decade ago. 

They explained that the account really did belong to her and that they were friends before she passed. This was their way of coping with the loss, by keeping her alive in some sense.

My heart has been completely broken ever since. I trusted them with everything and it turns out that they were lying to me about so many things.

They said it brought them a lot of stress and depression because of how honest and sincere I seemed, and that they finally had to put the account to rest because its clear that its not what their dead friend would have wanted. It hurt them to lie to me.

But ever since then I've been dealing with a lot of mental problems. I keep hyperventilating and I keep crying at random times in the day.

I spent my whole life being alone but this is the first time my loneliness has been felt, at least to this level. I let someone into my life and they betrayed my trust in a way that destroyed me.

I no longer talk to any of those people. 

I think about how I‚Äôve really *really* tried getting to know people...I‚Äôve really genuinely tried ‚Äúonline dating‚Äù multiple times; flirting with people on dating apps.

Also within this past year I have ended a five year relationship with a man who was very supportive of me, because I realised I‚Äôm gay.

Between the chaos and stress of undiagnosed ADHD and my suppressed sexuality, I feel like I‚Äôm just coming into myself at 24.

However, all through med school I‚Äôve struggled deeply with making friends with medics. In first year I was placed in halls far away without my course mates there, and the ADHD  quickly caught up with me. My attendance fell off a cliff, i fell really behind and was stressed beyond belief. 

I somehow passed the year, but ever since then I feel I‚Äôve been playing catch up socially and have never managed it. My one medic friend who i lived with for two years was not a nice girl and if I wasn‚Äôt so desperate for friends I wouldn‚Äôt have put up with her, and we don‚Äôt speak anymore after she behaved appallingly.

i‚Äôm currently experiencing adhd burnout and working with a therapist. instead of worrying about the exam tomorrow and how ill do, i‚Äôm worried about going there and standing around with no one to talk to once again after five years and when everyone heads off with their friends after for drinks to celebrate, i‚Äôll be alone again. i already worry about graduation and being alone, i hope it‚Äôs cancelled from covid",lonely,how to manage shame and it‚Äôs physical effects,2021-05-19 16:18:10

Either ghosted, or we just aren't right, or I start to feel negatively about myself and why he shouldn't be with me. Sometimes my standards or just basic points (like religion or political view, my family) are too different.  

I know that a person who loves themselves shouldn't want validation or need anyone's attention. I do admit that it would make you feel special and I think that's what i want to. To persue each other in the end.

Everybody knows that it's almost impossible for a guy and another guy to talk about feelings and vulnerabilities. You tell your homie you're depressed and he's just gunna make fun of you for being down bad. 

Then there's women who we date and have relationships with. Sure there are more compassionate and maybe open to our vulnerability. But if we go all out and show too much they can easily just find another guy with their shit together. We are allowed to be a little depressed around them sometimes but again our job is to protect, provide, and be strong for them not the other way around. 

There are mothers but at a certain age mothers are to be taken care of and some are too toxic to be around. Then with dads is all toxic masculinity. Which is funny because I am sure most dads understand they pain we go through but won't ever acknowledge it since they're used to being the strong provider of the family. 

Maybe this is just a me thing right? Maybe my ex of 2 years walking out within the first serious signs of my mental issues was just an unlucky thing. Any of you guys struggling, do you have a reliable person to talk about your mental health with? Or am I just terribly unlucky :((",lonely,There's a reason why guys kill themselves 4 times as much as girls,2021-05-19 14:19:36

and i was even fucking that up too, loneliness makes you so clingy and i was just jealous of how many people he had in his life. it got really toxic honestly. i was just so tired of talking to nobody the entire day. 

one day i just remembered a girl i used to talk to, but id pretty much never been very close with her. i decided to just reach out to her, even though ive been ghosted in the past i was in a dark place. i just needed someone to care about me.

i never had amazing luck making friends, most times when im trying to we're just somehow not on the same page and i either check out mentally or just get ghosted eventually. 

but after only a week of talking, you know i was doing my best to be honest but not just oversharing, people get weirded out when i do that too haha. 

but you know what? after about two weeks we were completely okay opening up to one another, and i found out that we're pretty similar people! it felt so good, so amazing to finally connect with someone other than my childhood friend.

They were all way closer than I was with them. So I wasn‚Äôt actually part of their group and I thought I was. And then I went super quiet and shy in 10 grade. I didn‚Äôt talk to ANYONE!! Since then I felt like everyone hated me. I deleted all social media and went off the grid. Then covid and stuff happened and I was trying to fix my depression and anxiety. 
They whole pandemic no one messaged me, they had my phone number. I then confirmed they all don‚Äôt like me

Two days ago, I created a Instagram and dm‚Äôd two of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù we haven‚Äôt talked for more than a year so I thought maybe they think I blocked them or something idk. 
One friends replied all nicely and I was very happy but my other friend hasn‚Äôt replied and it‚Äôs been 1-2 days. I know she uses her phone like every breathing min so she is ignoring me right? My other friend who replied answers hours later while she‚Äôs posting on her story and doing other things so she‚Äôs also kinda ignoring me ...right? I messaged 3 other people and i said  ‚Äú hi! It‚Äôs been so long, I missed you, how are you? ‚Äú one friends declined my follow request And the other two haven‚Äôt replied for 5+ hours. I like know they use their phone and saw it so they all actually don‚Äôt like me but like I didn‚Äôt do anything you know? Why are they avoiding me? I feel like shit and wanna disappear. I‚Äôm probably the most unlikeable person ever. I also feel like they are talking shit about me in their group chats.

Now I lie awake at 130 thinking of the time that's gone and the time that's left. I believe in working on oneself. Mentally and physically. Even though compliments from the opposite sex on my looks and personality makes me happy I've seen them lead to know where. I believe in my heart the futility of vanity, jealousy, pride and passing judgement as bad karma and hence actively try not to impose those on anyone as much as I possibly can. It's always a work in progress ofcourse. Maybe that makes me boring. 

At the age of 33 I feel as though I am destined never to find my partner. I know what friends and family always say and I say to them. ""You're never too old and you'll always find someone"". I love myself and I think I honestly do. But I'd like to share my life with someone aswell and be apart of her life aswell. Start the next or a new chapter in this magically winding and frustrating journey that is life. Maybe this is all naive and idealistic. Perhaps that in itself is the problem. 

In the end right here right now I'm lonely and sad. I'm grateful to have friends and family yet I feel an empty space in my heart. Maybe I'm not counting my lucky stars some may surmise and may very well be right. 

Can anything be done for one in my predicament. Possibly. This 'predicament' may even well be as trivial to some as birds dropping one step out of the house, annoying yet nothing to fret over.

Rant.

Today I was sent a picture of this really attractive girl in my year kissing a dude and I‚Äôm 100% sure that they had sex afterwards. (Their legs were just showing and the picture was cropped - they might have been inserting in that image).

Seeing this made me want to post this rant on this subreddit.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve felt bad over things like this. 

Two months ago, I was told that this other girl in my year (had a brief crush on her during 2019) had sex with multiple dudes during a sleepover.

When I heard that, I didn‚Äôt want to talk to people for a few days. 

Legit, this feeling sucks. I‚Äôm jealous and angry.

Probably sounding like an inc3l (I think saying that word would have the post automatically removed) and idk what to say.

I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend although I‚Äôve had crushes for more than half a decade. Meanwhile all those successful people do what I long to do but fail to achieve.

I feel like I missed out a part in life. Don‚Äôt have a lot of guy friends and don‚Äôt have a single female friend, and of course I don‚Äôt have a girlfriend.

I‚Äôm feeling inferior rn. Inferior to those males who did what I could not have done.

I don‚Äôt know a lot about inc3l ideology but I understand why some of them hate chads and stacies.

( i live in a capital and the rest of my family, i,e: aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, great great somethings, relatives, were in another city, a very popular one, keep this in mind, i will talk about this a few times ) 

when i was in sixth or seventh grade, i moved to my family city, and lived in my grandmas house for a school year and half of another year. i made friends and became quite happy, i moved back to the capital, and everyone remembered me . 

my friends abandoned me, i was venting about this in my post yesterday. well call them D, M, F, R, and me (obv not their real initials) things went downhill, this was precovid, Fs dad died, told me and r, said she wouldn‚Äôt show up to school for maybe a week, asked to make an excuse. she changed after that, she was still the same but something was off.

covid began but didn‚Äôt hit our country yet, then it did but we didn‚Äôt know yet. we took a break from school so before they made rules, my family decided to visit my family city and we got stuck there for a few months once covid began.


then m and i got in this huge argument, the others got in it too, ended up leaving us and found new friends. we were all affected deeply.

then around june lockdown was slowly lifting and they started to allow you to travel to cities, and states. i moved back to the capital, and at this point i was slowly being left out. 

on july i broke the news i was permenently moving to my family city, they were quite sad, but i don‚Äôt think they really cared that much.

fast forward to the present, i‚Äôm forgotten. nobody talks to me. i‚Äôm lonely. i‚Äôm homesick, and i‚Äôm a suicidal maniac, who‚Äôs undiagnosed and has gotten no help, am i exaggerating? not sure. at night i think of my old life, and what would‚Äôve happened if her dad never died, if she never left us, if i never moved, maybe we could still have a good friendship. i basically live in my imagination. 

now what happened to the friends i made in my (now current) city, and school?. well we‚Äôre not friends, they mock, and gossip about me, they‚Äôre bratty and spoiled, they‚Äôre fake, they‚Äôre toxic, they‚Äôre just the worst. they didn‚Äôt greet me or remember me, and they ignored all my texts.

i‚Äôm homesick, i miss my old life, my old school, my old friends, my old classmates. everything. i know my friends aren‚Äôt bad, i am. whenever they post they still have that sort of vibe. i don‚Äôt want to reach out since it‚Äôll be awkward if i tell them how i feel, all i want right now is to move back.

1875,insectbrain,1621350608,1,"I was just texting with my friend when i mentioned a cringey but very harmless thing I used to like in high school and she suddenly lost her shit laughing at me and said these exact words,

""That's so funny"" ""Aren't you embarrassed"" and the one that really hurt: ""You deserve to be bullied for that""

Honestly? I know she is just joking. But I don't know why the reaction was so big, it was basically about a game we were BOTH into, but just the character that I liked is not very popular for understandable reasons. I made fun of myself for it first, and I guess she saw that as an OK to be playfully rude about it but I did NOT expect to hear those words and it triggered something in me, I immediately left the conversation and started crying. Maybe because I actually was bullied in high school, and ever since then I've had terrible social anxiety and always worry about what peoole are thinking. When she said that, I deserve to be bullied, it just hit too close to home and something in me just broke. I'm already going through so much and maybe I'm more sensitive than usual so I did NOT need to hear that. It's the last thing I needed to hear. And I'm mad at myself too for not being able to take a joke, for being so sensitive. But my anxiety doesn't let me confirm that it's just a joke. What if she actually means that? What if other people think that too? Everyone thinks I'm lame and just talks to me because it's convenient? Did I deserve to be bullied? Who deserves to be bullied exactly? I don't know. 

I really needed to get this out there but I realized that I didn't have anyone I can talk to unprompted and vent. Other than the friend that said this to me. I really think I should've talked to her about it, maybe she'd be understanding about it. Or maybe she'd think I'm a sensitive piss baby and won't talk to me anymore. I did say ""Stop, don't say that"" but she continued on and changed the topic. I don't think she would realize that the words hurt unless I told her. But all of this happened yesterday and today I couldn't keep avoiding her so I texted back today acting completely normal even though I still think about what she said and I'm still hurt. This has happened before too, she says something small and I get offended but don't tell her because it's so small that if I did I would seem whiney. And I don't wanna lose the one person that is willing to talk to me. 

Maybe the reason I couldn't handle the playful rudeness is because our friendship doesn't feel equal and I can't tell if she is joking because she never confirmed that she feels respect and love towards me. I always do. I make sure she hears what she needs to hear, but I rarely hear anything back. So I don't know deep down what she actually feels about me. That unsureness is why I can't take jokes like these. If she was equally as supportive of me, there would be a balance and jokes like these wouldn't matter. But I feel like I'm always humiliated by other people and I don't know how much more I can be patient. But even then these is not much I can do. I just wish I wasn't so socially inept.

I realize that I really should see a therapist and work on my issues but I did the math today and I couldn't afford it and I just felt so hopeless. I don't have anyone. I just want to hear something validating because everything else just isn't going well and the things I work hard for feel like they aren't paying off and I just need to hear something positive for once. But I don't. The one friend I have says this to me I don't know I'm really miserable and lonely. And maybe just like she says, I deserve it.

1888,PsychologicalCycle20,1621338667,1,"Hi,

After covid happened, I stopped talking to almost everyone from my high school for over a year, besides my closest friends. They struggled with their schoolwork (naturally, as school was online), so I helped them for several hours every week. I didn't mind doing this, and I mainly did it in the hopes that they would like me more if I provided them with utility. 

Since then, there have been multiple issues that have arisen. We tragically lost one of our close friends in January, and my one friend was incredibly close to him. I've never had the opportunity to talk to him again after mid-February, but I've heard that he isn't doing very well. I don't blame him at all for how he feels, and I understand that he needs space. 

My other friend (who I used to be really close with) got a girlfriend, and he claims that he's too busy to talk to me (except for when he needs help with schoolwork I guess). Besides that (which has never happened recently now that there's the option to go into school), he says that he wants to join calls with me but I'm never on when he's available (we have a Discord server). I told him to message me when he's on so we can talk, but he never has. The second to last time we talked was for literally 2 minutes on April 28th, and it was actually about this very thing. The last time we talked was for 10 minutes on April 29th, and it wasn't a one-on-one conversation. We were in a call with many people, and we didn't talk to each other much. 

I don't actively dislike this friend at all, and I used to be really close with him before we grew apart. He always stood up for me when my other friends would make fun of me (without going into unnecessary detail, there are aspects of my identity and self-expression that some of my friends make fun of me for). He says that now that he has a girlfriend, he has to prioritize talking to her every single day. He also has a job, leaving him with little free time. I've never been had a relationship or a job, but I guess this seems reasonable. It just makes me think that if he can talk to her every day, but he never can make time to talk to me for even 30 seconds in the past few weeks, then he values her more than me. He probably doesn't think this, but it is just upsetting to think about. I don't resent him or his girlfriend, but I wish that we could talk more. 

Finally, there's my last friend. He has a job (at the same place as the previously-mentioned friend), and he has developed a close friendship with one of his coworkers. I have spent the most time by far helping this friend. I would spend countless hours doing entire math tests for him, among many other things. Despite this, he doesn't seem to value our friendship very much. He calls me homophobic slurs and makes fun of me for liking boys and not having a job. He calls me annoying and painfully unfunny whenever I try to make jokes. He attempts to characterize me as overly dramatic and emotional. 

I can deal with all of this, although it does make me feel really bad about myself. I wasn't able to hang out with them for an entire year due to medical reasons. After I got fully vaccinated, I was invited over to this friend's house, and I only stayed over for a little while. No one has invited me to hang out since then.

I was crushed to learn that he does stuff with his friend from work multiple times a week. He even hangs out frequently with the previously-mentioned friend. One thing that especially upset me was when he sent a picture of him and that friend at the mall, I asked if I could go to the mall too with them. He replied by putting in a Google Maps link and telling me that it's only 6 minutes away from my house, so I should go by myself if I want to go to the mall. He knows that I care far more about hanging out with my friends than going to the mall with the purpose of buying things. I confronted him about this (we actually used to be pretty close friends a while ago), and he just got upset at me. I don't understand what's changed in his life to cause him to be this way. The last time I was in a call with him was the aforementioned one on April 29th.

Overall, I just don't understand what went wrong. We used to be incredibly close friends, but now no one talks to me. I looked it up and apparently it's normal for your friends to replace you with someone else, but it just makes me feel very sad. I was able to hang out with them for 15 minutes a year, and that was enough of me to get them to never invite me to anything ever again. Nothing even went wrong then; I barely said anything because their new friend from work was there. I heard from someone else there that the friend got yelled at by his sister and mom for being homophobic after I left, but I don't know the specifics. I feel like I was taken advantage of and abandoned after I was unable to provide them with utility.

I have one last close friend, and she's not related to this group at all. She's really nice, but I've never told her anything about this because I don't want to bother her. 

Does anyone know that to do from here? I left the Discord server because they stopped talking to me. I  figured that I would feel more in control of the situation if not talking to me was something that they had to do rather than something they chose to do. I believe that my self-esteem shouldn't come from other people, but it's hard to not feel like a total loser when everyone stops talking to you. 

Thanks.",lonely,Nearly all of my (M17) close friends stopped talking to me,2021-05-18 21:51:07

The job was where all my friends came from because it was a large team and it was easy to find connections, plus I had a girlfriend so things were looking pretty good.

I‚Äôm 18 with no friends.

As of being homeschooled for high school because of severe social anxiety, I have had no friends over the years. Every day is the same. I only talk to my parents, they‚Äôre the only people I‚Äôve seen in the past four years and my entire life, due to the mutism I suffered as a child.

Now I‚Äôm graduating high school. I haven‚Äôt entered the real world in so long and developed a severe case of dissociation and MDD because of it. I‚Äôm painfully awkward, small, have odd mannerisms from being isolated, and very unattractive, so these are red flags that make people avoid approaching me.

I try pull through every day with each bit of motivation and I just can't fucking do it. It's no fair nor any fun. I was playing apex legends, I was carrying my friends per usual and they all start talking about what they did with their partners and what not. So the people I was playing with and some others that were in the discord call were all talking about what they did with their partners.

I don't know where to begin  but here goes. Forgive me if I sound off, I'm new to this subreddit. I just want to get something off my chest. Forgive me if this makes no sense and if it feels like incoherent ramblings.

I have always felt like outsider ever since childhood. I was often the odd one out, the weird one, the outcast, etc. As early as 6, I noticed that feeling but couldn't put it to terms. The feeling of not being right, not being like the other kids, the feeling of being an idiot, the feeling of being a pariah, etc. As I grew older, I started realizing the feeling of being an outsider combined with general self-loathing meant I was depressed. As time goes by, the feeling of loneliness increases and a sudden tsunami of depression hits me. Often times, my heart feels like it sank to the bottom of the ocean when loneliness hits. I often feel like I'm not worth anything or like I deserve to be lonely due to my awkwardness, my lack of confidence, my low self-worth, my social ineptitude, etc. I feel like I don't deserve to have any kind of company, any kind of relationships, any kind of warmth, etc. I lost contact with the girl who gave me hope and I honestly think she forgot about me and I don't deserve to even speak to her again. If it weren't for her kindness I would most likely be in a worse place than I already am. In a world so cold, people like her brought hope into my dull, gray, empty world and now I lost touch with her. If only I could tell her how deeply she impacted my life.

There's a whole history I can discuss in novels, but I'll just leave it with a statement that I'm packed deep with issues.  Anyway, here are some things that happened that made me feel really invisible/insignificant.

1. When a female coworker comes up to you and asks ""where are the good looking guys? Can you help me find some and bring them my way?""
2. A friend you have unrequited feelings for is texting back and forth with her new ""friend"" from the apps while it's just you two on a 1 on 1 hangout.  There's nothing wrong with that at all, but it just kind of makes me feel less significant
3. Friends just kind of ignore you as you start speaking or check their phones
4. No one listens to you, but when another person in the group suggests something, they all agree with that.
5. When you're hanging out with guy friends talking about girls who are into someone else in the group, and it's never you.  Because you're the fat and ugly one of the group
6. You're always just kind of ""there"" when you are out in groups

I know these are my own issues with validation and the need for attention/seeking affection.

The past couple of months there‚Äôs been drastic changes in my life from getting mental health diagnoses to ending a 2 year relationship to my friends betraying me and me losing them.

Scared of being stuck in a routine, being successful and not having anyone to share it with and not having anyone of your own. And that thought really catching up to me. I feel that way right now, mostly because I have a friend group and recently one of them betrayed me and now they are going camping this weekend. I just think of how it is unfair for all of them to be moving on with their lives while Im still hurting from everything :( i wish i could be like those people who would look past stuff because they are scared of ending up alone.

It's a web app for casual conversations that matches people into small chat rooms based on interests and past usage of the app, trying to make it easy to find small group chats to hang out and make friends. We're basically trying to replicate the group chat you have with irl friends, except entirely online (and with as many chats you want!). And as you all probably know, finding friends feels very difficult these days, especially since most in-person activities have been cancelled due to the pandemic. We're hoping Reason could make finding friends or just people to have a casual chat with easier and less intimidating than fully anonymous sites like Omegle.

We're just starting out but I was thinking people here might be interested in trying it out when it's ready as an alternative to mainstream social media or Reddit. The website is [reason.so](https://www.reason.so/), and I also created /r/ReasonApp for keeping up with the development.

But lately, I feel people don't want me around because of my temper/behaviour/opinions etc. I know a lot of people, at the same time I feel if they really are so interested in me, why am I the one to approach them first. Or why do I not get a callback?

My boyfriend recently ended our 3.5-year relationship (7-year of friendship). Though we still talk, it sometimes feels as if I relied on him too much to share everything and now that he's not there for me regularly, I feel really hollow. I would also like to highlight that we were not in a good place in the relationship, but there was always a hope that things will get better. I realise that this space he has taken from me is necessary, but it makes me really anxious/lonely/hopeless/and without a constant friend. 

I hope most of you reading this will understand how it feels to lose the one you had that ultimate connection with. I am here to talk about this hollowness I am feeling because of his absence. I called him a while ago to talk, but he had something else to do. It is such a crumbling feeling when you see your worth tumbling in front of you.

Somewhere I know it is wrong to depend on anyone for everything. But it really hurts to feel unwanted and undesired. I feel I am the one giving more of my attention and affection always, in every relationship I've had. And in the end, I feel neglected.

I want to say a lot of things to him. But at the moment I feel all those sensitive talks will push him away more. So I keep them to myself and it's getting heavy day by day. I cannot tell those things to anyone except him, I feel. Like I try to talk to other friends and it just doesn't feel that great. But I'm trying. 

I thought I had many friends, but this pandemic has shown me who really are there for me. And honestly, don't get me wrong here, they aren't the ones I want, but they are the ones I have. I get bored of people easily. 

I live in India and the country is literally burning due to covid. Many people are dying, many people are losing someone really close to them. I don't understand why people can't realise that if you have someone you love and are alive, stop neglecting them and start being with them. 

I feel really frustrated with the fact that this is happening to me and for the past month, I'm living life in such a redundant manner, locked down at home.

Like I really am not, I just don‚Äôt mesh with people well or something and I‚Äôm way too shy.

1998,the_shinydragon,1621275533,1,"Not sure what I even want out of posting this disjointed mess but here goes.

I‚Äôve spent the early morning hours finding this group and reading a bunch of posts. A lot of them seem to be about longing to find a partner, human touch, relationship. Completely understandable human desires (if not passing over into creepy territory).

I have a loving partner who loves me for me. I love the guy back completely. I still feel lonely to my core . This leads me to believe the craving in Western society for romantic love is not the whole picture of human contact that people need even if they actively believe so. It helps but it isn‚Äôt a solution. I have friends here and there. But still. Lonely. Maybe it‚Äôs a void that can‚Äôt be filled in me IDK. 

I don‚Äôt think everyone is lonely, or are they? Is it societal? Individual? Even in my own experience it‚Äôs been a spectrum over time. Do insanely attractive Hollywood stars feel consistently lonely? I bet some do. Is anyone ever content these days or have they ever been? Was living in a traditional tribe more fulfilling in identity and a social sense? 

I‚Äôd ideally love a non suffocating supportive possibly structured community/friendship group with real connection. People to hang out with and do hobbies with. A bunch of the shows that I loved growing up had friendship groups that hung out together and shared their lives. Always seemed nice but fantasy. At least at school even though it was mostly shit, the structured activities and being forced to be meshed with people your own age was helpful socially.

I barely know a soul from school anymore as time progressed. I‚Äôm anxious but I force myself out and even join things. I cried at a D&amp;D session (new activity I‚Äôm trying out) because I felt so insufficient as a human...like everyone else is better at talking and knowing how to behave. I know it isn‚Äôt true but also it feels like it is. They were kind and it was actually a sort of vulnerable human bonding moment but also how do I even function when all these feelings are running through me all the while. 

Often it‚Äôs been inadvertently my fault friendships ended that I only realise years later. I have plenty of flaws. I do try though and considering my upbringing it could be worse. Through all the trials I‚Äôve lived through I think I‚Äôve become much more aware and empathetic but everything hurts more and it seems everyone I meet hasn‚Äôt grow in the same ways.

A few years ago we purchased a house and I haven‚Äôt felt comfortable for a multitude of reasons including being a loner and being anxious I guess...to invite people over. There‚Äôs so much complication to finding people who give a shit including social status, physical appearance, gender, and all that is taken into account by the audience before I even open my mouth. Some days people are so actively unpleasant when I venture out I wonder why I even leave the house.",lonely,"What even am I, what is lonely?",2021-05-18 04:18:53

I've always felt like an outsider in all the conversations I am in. Wether it is just meeting friends or being around girls. Now, I've always thought it was because I have a very closed off personality, and to some extent that is completely true. Not many people will approach and talk to me, and i don't really approach others, that's just how I am. I don't think anyone owes me any kind of attention, and it is what it is.

I always hated that feeling though. Have you guys ever felt like your presence would be just forgotten? Wether I am there or not in this group of people or not, it doesn't matter. I only get invited because my best friend is a great friend and he wants me around, but otherwise, no one else would have called me to be there.

But this best friend... We have grown up together, we have spent so many hours together that i have absorbed a lot from the way he acts, and he has done so with the way I act. So much so that a lot of people have said that we are almost the exact same person when it comes to personality. He doesn't talk a lot in social situations, always just observing, unless someone approaches him, exactly like me.

But every single time, in every group that we are in, people seem so fond of him. For example, we have been in a few calls on discord with friends of friends, that we both met at the same time. On the first call and all calls after, we acted pretty much the same.

But what i don't understand is, why is it that he gets so much attention, and i keep being just a ghost?

Hi,

My name's Maja, I'm almost 19 years old. I recently went through my first breakup after one year of relationship and since I struggle with BPD it really broke me. I can't feel happiness since. I also lost my grandfather this January. It all just fell apart. I'm on medication but can't get therapy become I can't afford it and health care in my country is a mess so I'm on a waiting list for so long already, I'm talking months. I don't have any friends and I'm not exaggerating. I've lost all hope and suicide is on my mind pretty much daily. I just don't feel like my life is worth living. I feel ugly and unloved. I know I won't find kind of love i wish for and that is making me even more miserable. I can't stop crying over my ex even though she's fully over me and we have no contact. I really don't feel like living and I don't know what to do anymore.

I did so much for her and showed her how much I would do to take care for her. I like to belive I'm old fashioned even for a 19 year old be nice to everyone/respectful still a believer that there's true love, and above all don't hurt anyone who tries to take care of you but I rather care more for others than myself. It funny too I learned these values even while growing up dealing with domestic abuse, homelessness, and violence yet all I ask in life is a girl who will care for me because I've lacked that care from others for so long. Honestly, I still deal with problems I'm sometimes depressed, stressed out, and over all anxious cause life doesn't seem to go well for me. With her this time it was the first time people truly found about those things and worst how I was suicidal in the past. She brought me down hard when she rejected me and now I'm trying to fix our relationship from my mistakes. I've talked to god a dozen people by now these last few weeks and all of them tell me to move and I'm trying but when I like someone so damn much i  envision a future where we are together or at least where things work out and it sucks when it doesn't. Now she's in quarantine about to get out and I'm graduating from my classes today. We haven't talked properly in 2 weeks and it bothers me how much she acts so like nothing ever happened worst how it feels like she directly avoids me and I'm still caring for her buying her get well cards. Going out of my way to ensure she feels like she has people caring for her. Dropping off her favorite snacks and for what a ""thank you and sorry I don't think we can ever go back to being friends like before"". I'm tired of talking about her to others but writing this all out has helped me the most. I just wish I could say goodbye to her before I leave get these last bit of feelings out yet others tell me it's not going to. I wish when she graduates I can congratulate her, when she goes to her next base I could ask her how's life?, or when her birthday comes up I wish I could spend it with her. I wish in the future we were ok to be friends again or give it another chance I don't want to go down in her memories as a dipshit or something worst. She's never dated anyone before and neither have I so I would hate to become a stain in her early on relationship life. I want to move on so badly yet I sit her drawing and writing about her I bet she spends not a single second in that room she's stuck in thinking about me yet I worry once she gets out we'll see each other when talking to the friends it will just be awkward like I'll forever feel like I'll need to give her her space. Even when I leave here which is next Wednesday I'll never stop blaming myself for ruining what could have just been a friendship and if things went well with her I could have been her first actual boyfriend. I wish time can heal this relationship give me a second chance it's all I ask God and I hate it when ither say you'll meet the one then what was her purpose in my life rn?

I was speaking to someone I work with about this. He‚Äôs fairly romantically successful, having dated four or five women during the last year ALONE (and that‚Äôs during a pandemic).

I currently am almost all alone. I always thought this is what I wanted but it feels weird. I‚Äôve lost all of my childhood friends (not death, just lost friendships) and some fall outs are my fault, others idk.. Im pretty sure I just lost my last childhood friend who was like a sister to me. And it hurts bad. All I know is my life isn‚Äôt what I ever imagined it could be. I‚Äôm young but not super young. I‚Äôm older but definitely not that old. But due to my lifestyle and overall health, if I don‚Äôt find a reason to do better in life I don‚Äôt have much time left. 

I‚Äôve always wanted love and thought eventually things will work out in my life the way I think they should. I fall in love, I get married, have kids, etc but I‚Äôve always been less desirable physically. As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve finally gained confidence and can without a doubt say my looks are not too shabby but my height and weight are definitely a defining issue. People love me and my personality and gawk over me everywhere I go. My face isnt too bad and I have attractive eyes and smile. At work, in public, family events. People want and like to talk to me. I‚Äôm  used to it but it‚Äôs so weird. The way people describe me to me you‚Äôd think I could get my life together and find peace. But things don‚Äôt add up for me.

I‚Äôm so starved of physical affection. I feel desperate. The only time men have liked me or gone after me have been for brief moments in time and they all had a fetish for my body type and luckily my face is pretty so I was like a jackpot for them. Never a serious relationship. Always physical. But I was always hopeful things could be more..with some. I fear I will never be able to enjoy being in a loving relationship before I pass. Idk when that will be but the way I live my pitiful life I am scared...

I want someone to want to hold me and touch me and who seeks my affection and adoration. I want to be free to be my goofy self and show my love in my goofy way and someone really love it. It‚Äôs always one sided for me. How do people find people who  loves them and they love them back.

I can literally say I'm having a great day or check on many of my ""friends"" with no response. However, when it's anyone else, everyone seems to magically respond or be there. I hate it. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. The only ones I've actually talked to genuinely is my parents but even that, as they get older they seem to be more and more distant and it just depresses me more. I just want to talk to someone, anyone but it seems my voice doesn't seem to reach or my opinions are just invalid. At this point I just need to accept that nobody would care even if I were to magically disappear from the world. Like I made no impact on this world and I feel like a ghost to everyone. So what's the point in socializing with people? Why should I speak about my opinions when my voice just ends up going through one ear or another.

Ive been nude on the unmoderated section of omegle, with my face being seen, im now scared that i might have gotten recorded and that it might ruin my life.

I know ive fucked up, i also know that there cant be a guarantee that it is out there or not, but what i just need is the advice of the people that had the experience. Because i dont know where to turn to, ive turned to lots of reddit communities, most being nice, but after some times their words lose effect.

Im scared there is always that moment where i think about it effect how it could ruin my life and the life of those around me.

My sexual tensions has brought me to different problems, but this?! There are moments where i just want to break in tears, hit my head very hard multiple times or just vormit. 

I dont know if dudes usually get recorded and get their video uploaded, but for me its an nightmare, i have dreams where it has a negative impact on my life, and the fact that i dont know about its existence makes me scared. 

Because of my stupidity i cant pursue acting, holding public power or just being a face of something. I have difficulty seeing my family and friends in the face because of it, because if they knew, i think they would be disappointed in me. 

I know i brought this upon myself abd for that im very resentful and angry at my self. 

I felt happy about myself 2 weeks ago, trying to be in terms with the first case, but then now there are 2 more of thoose videos of me! 

Because i was a fool, i even did it in the unmoderated section the UNMODERATED! its asking to be recorded.

2060,TheRedJurny,1621229513,1," 

For example, I was at taco bell ordering and trying to sound nice and happy and the person talked to me in a slightly bitter way and kinda sarcasticly. Kinda just hurts sometimes when I'm trying to be happy and something so small kinda makes my mood slide down hill... I know they are probably just tired or something, but it seems like this happens with almost everyone I come in contact with stranger wise.

I also try to treat others the way I wish I was treated, but I am often taken advantage of for this and I'm so broken I don't know what to do. I always have social anxiety because of this, it's so bad it hurts my chest. For instance it's quite ridiculous but unfollowing someone on twitch that never took the time to be my friend was hard for me because I wouldn't want someone to unfollow my twitch, even though they didn't even acknowledge my presence....

I have a lot of other shit but I am too lazy and unmotivated to post it all here.. I just usually get told the same thing anyways... ""it will get better"" ... ""just focus on yourself"" .... ""get a hobby"" I've tried it all...

I have no friends, absolutely none.. I have people who want to be my friend but they are often someone I do not want to be around/make me uncomfortable ( mostly because they want to use me for something ) . The town I live in is so dead and there's nothing to do but go to fast food places or restaurants, nothing social. Friends online have become impossible because everyone I try to befriend never can match my energy, they are always looking out for themselves only and never seem to be interested in actually trying to be my friend. For example I had this one ""friend"" that I met, talked to for 2 months and we were chill, I listened to all his problems, gave him advice was there for him and stuff... and he never did that for me. If I ever asked there was an excuse, or I was making them uncomfortable... one day I just never texted them and they never checked on me since a month later. Breaks my heart.... I had a friend that promised she'd always be there for me, she'd never stop talking to me... but the day I don't send her a msg first she and me haven't talked for months. Once in a while she will send a hi and I'll say hi back, but not get a response.... I'm always expected to do the talking... I'm so drained from it though, I just for once wish someone was interested enough to talk to me on their own... and not just to throw a pity party.

I can never really make friends with other guys because I'm feminine and sensitive and they often seemed turned off by that so they distance themselves.. so if I ever make friends they usually are girls, not a big problem as I do feel less anxious talking to a girl because I feel like they will be less judgy when Im soft. But when it comes to dating/flirting or anything its usually a straight disaster, I'm always sad and lonely then something comes in my life pretending to be something good for once and it stabs me in the heart. Couple examples. Met this one girl at a restaruant, she was my server, I could tell she was interested in talking to me at least and her and her friend invited me to the club with them, never had anyone do that before, and at the end of the night she gave me her number. I was happy and excited... but by the 4th boring casual text where she obviously wasn't interested in actually talking she never replied to me again. ( no I didnt say anything bad, I literally just said hey again because we stopped the last convo ) .

Another was at a hot topic far away, I was visiting, the hot topic girl helped me look through some things and we were talking chit chat and kinda flirting. She asked me before I left if I was single and if she could get my number. I was so happy again.... in the back of my mind I knew it probably would end up being nothing as usual. Which it was.... she never msg me... and It was def the right number.

Recently I got this cute host's instagram that SHE offered me... we started talking and it was looking good.... I invited her on what I thought would be a date and she says shes gonna bring her bf after we talked about it for an hour. .... like.... seriously....? .......

just another kick in my fucking broken soul...

The worst part of all this is.. I don't think I'm that ugly... I feel pretty.... I feel like I try to be the best person I can be, I always show people kindness, but I just... no one seems to like me... ever.... unless they want something... like sex... or someone to cry on and when they are done they pretend they don't know me... I feel so trapped it's suffocating me..

One night I couldn't stand not talking to anyone about my depression I filmed myself crying and talking about everything for an hour... and its just sitting on my computer.. for only me to see.

Hope this is an appropriate thing to post. I'm 28M and will try to keep it short. All my friends have moved away and am too shy/anxious at the moment to make new ones in real life, so I figured it might be worth looking in a more virtual environment to try and avoid the misery of spending the weekends all by myself. What would be nice is to find someone or a group to game with online (I've never been massively into online gaming but I know I enjoy it so I should invest more time in it). 

Does anyone here play anything or can anyone recommend anything? I only have an xbox 1 and a laptop (PC melted slightly, sad times) so am limited a bit but I know there must be plenty of options. I'm more interested in simulation / strategy but would consider others, such as survival games but I've never tried those as am too scared to play them on my own üòÖ Not that keen on fantasy stuff but if it has science fiction elements I would consider it. I also enjoy board games and would consider browser games etc.

Like all the good things in my life...

I promised myself that I would never let my friends grow apart. And that I‚Äôd never let myself grow apart from my friends. Well, I failed. 

Oh well, they have lives to live. And I‚Äôd probably only get in the way. 

I promised my father before he died that I‚Äôd take care of my younger siblings. Because he asked me to. Of course I didn‚Äôt know what he meant at the time but, either way, I failed him too.

2156,ActuallyAbsalom,1621190263,1,"I'm an average 21 year old college going male, and I have friends, dear and close to me who I actively spend time with. I have family, who I may not always like, but who I do love, and who I'm fairly certain love me back. I have a social support group, and people with whom I spend time and do things with, and yet it just... there's something missing.

There's this desire inside me for a romantic relationship with a woman. The desire and need for that is so intense it sometimes dwarfs the gratitude I feel for the other relationships in my life. 
I don't know why but that's the only type of relationship missing from my life and I'll spend nights awake, curling into myself because that specific loneliness, the kind that comes from not having anyone to hold and kiss and make love to, the kind that comes from making breakfast for only one and finding a pretty flower and having no one to give it to, it just... fuck it hurts. It hurts and hurts and hurts and it's a physical fucking pain right in my gut, kind of to the left and above my belly button. I see people holding hands and loving each other and I'm so happy for them, but it also fills me with this... jealousy. And anger. And I just. I want that. I want to find someone who I can grow with and be with. 

And I'm not looking for my other half anymore. I understand that I, as a person, am and should be enough for my own life. I want someone who adds to and enchances my life. Because sometimes I'll make a souffl√© and it turns to ash in my mouth upon seeing that there's only one plate at my table. I'll be sleeping with five blankets on and a foot sticking out and the heat on and the fan at max and the windows open and yet the cold doesn't come from the outside, from a stray wind or a cool breeze. The cold comes from this place inside of me, seeping away all of my heat until all the blankets and all the heating in the world don't matter. The only thing that can warm my cold and rotting core is a pair of warm hands, and I just... don't have that.

And it's not a lack of physical intimacy that's causing it. I need emotional intimacy coupled with it. I'm sure I could go out downtown and find someone to have sex with it. But I don't want someone to just have sex with. Sex is meaningless. It's all sprawled limbs and heavy breathing and tongue and mouth and... ick. It's just. Without love and emotion, sex is just the mechanical action of human coupling. Our current society is so obsessed with looks, or money, or what you have and what you own, that people completely fail to see what's inside. It's like, your value is only determined by how good you look or how much money you have. I want someone to love me for ME. My soul. For who I am as a person, not what I have or what I can provide. I want the unconditional, unyielding love that I've only seen between parents and their kids, or read about in romance novels. I want someone who doesn't see my physical skin and bones, but rather what it houses, and the person inside and chooses to love that person, romantically. I've had this love from friends, but not romantically, you know? This pure love from my parents, and other loved ones, but I need it romantically. 

It's just all so complicated. These human emotions with human consequences. I wish life wasn't so goddamn complicated. I wish we didn't get hurt by people who claimed they loved us but were only after the things we provided. I wish the people we were meant to be with would find us and that they'd love us back when we found them. Most of all, I wish this loneliness would stop eating bits and pieces of me, or better yet, I wish I didn't need that romantic love, and that my restless heart could be satiated with the non romantic love that I already have in my life.",lonely,"The loneliness eats away at me, relentless in it's hunger.",2021-05-17 04:37:43

That lasted for three months during the lockdown period.  I loved the process as it wasn't an overly eager texting situation but just two people trying to get to know each other in a healthy mature way.

He soon opened up to me telling me about his kids (he has two) and they day to day lives and struggles. I would like to clarify I was totally aware of this and I was ok with that. I'm 33, he's 44 and I'm not going to write anyone off my list because of that as at this stage it's hard to find someone without baggage.

Fast forward, lockdown restrictions ended and we decided to meet up. We had three dates wich were amazing. On the second one he even kissed me at the end and said he liked me a lot. I tried not to take things for granted but it was a nice feeling obvs. On the third date we even met up with a couple who are friends of his and went for dinner. He wouldn't stop complimenting me in front of them, holding hands and kissing me whenever they weren't looking.

As it was so early, during the first two dates I didn't want to ask and dig that much into his past, the only thing I knew was that they slipt up last summer, she left the house and they have an agreement where kids would change houses every two days meaning that they only have a free weekend every two weeks. I thought it was madness but non of my business of course.

After the third date he went cold feet, went two days without texting until I reached out. He eventually was honest with me saying that he's going through a tough period of anxiety, not being able to sleep and thinking where he's heading to. He though our last date would help but it didn't. He needs time to see his family and friends after lockdown and to work out his priorities as he has very limited time and thinks that would help him with the anxiety. He also stated I'm pretty much perfect and he likes me a lot. He said he hopes the upcoming months bring some positivity and send me a picture of something he knows I like.

I stayed calmed and collected, wished him to recover soon and calming him down saying everything will fall into place for him. I also said he could reach out to me whenever he feels ready or when things settled down for him. I have no complain about him, he was extremely consistent during those 5 months, funny, loving and caring.

1 week since the last message, but I just can't stand the pain. I know my foot print in his life means nothing compare to his previous partner whom he created life with and spent so many years together.

I just need all the advice and help I can get, I have bipolar 2 disorder and after doing well for so long, I am rapidly slipping into a deep depression and I am very very afraid of what will happen next. 
Recently I (32F) found out that my (35M) long term partner had been cheating on me for 6 months w a coworker. 
I caught them together, in our bed, our 7 year old daughter with me. . 
This was not suspected, I had no idea. I thought we were  happy, I love/loved him so much. I was dealt a shitty deck of cards in life and he was my happy ending,  my best friend, he treated myself and our daughter like queens. now, He seems to not care the pain this is causing 
When I told him it was over, he laughed at me, called me pathetic, and said ""finally"". he LAUGHED. 
I've been a SAHM for 6 years, depending on him for everything. everything is in his name. I have nothing. I trusted him completely.
we were trying to figure out how to handle the split, when a week ago I came home and he was gone. all of his things, furniture,  kitchen stuff, anything of value. he emptied our bank accounts. he left me  and our girl penniless except for the cash I had on me, which was like $70. I've accepted that he is gone and im trying to be strong for my little girl, shes in therapy and i make sure she knows her mama is never going anywhere - but what do I do now? I don't have any friends except for one out of state, and I have no living family. i am completely alone. no grocery money, no gas to go to the library for internet to look for a job, I don't even have tampons for my period, I'm running out if shampoo, I feel utterly pathetic. I constantly hit up the food banks but it's not enough. I've applied for food stamps, nothing yet. how will i pay rent? I have bills coming up. how do I do this?
I can't sleep, I have nightmares about us ending up homeless, how do you do this to people you say you love? all those nights holding me and planning our future. I thought of his mom as my own and she claims she doesn't know where he is. I have begged the few people I know for a bit of help, even my in laws and nothing. what do I do?? how do I get through this emotionally when I cant survive financially. how do I take care of her, i feel like a terrible mother. the cheating itself has torn me apart, and I can't even take care if my girl  my heart is so hurt, I am broken, I have never been so terrified of the future and I need advice so bad. I have nothing of value to sell, I posted everywhere offering house cleaning etc services, I am trying everything. if anyone has any ideas, thoughts, words of encouragement, things i can try, please message me! my life has fallen apart completely and I can't wrap my head around the infedelity and abandonment. thank you!! so much. keeping my fingers crossed and praying nonstop for a solution.

2181,heisenberg__149,1621176560,1,"I know people say it's easier to blame parents for all your problems bla bla bla. But it really just hurts to be with them. All the pent up resentment. It gets very difficult. I start crying at the smallest things. I felt like I wasn't very important to them which is why I want to be important in any kinds of relationships, which obviously isn't possible. And this is why I have bad friendships. I can't stop my catastrophic thoughts. I always feel like any futures relationship I'll have will be a horrible one. To overcome those I rely on fictional character. I read those cringe, mushy, illogical web novels and crave for someone like those male leads. I'm either having unrealistic expectations from relationships and stop opening up myself to people who don't fit them or just imagine that my life is going to be horrible and my parents have a role in it. At this point they don't even feel like made up scenarios, they're like a part of my subconscious now. The thoughts of my parents making my life miserable are always at the back of my head. They haven't done anything to ruin my life. They're just ignorant of my feelings and emotions most of the time. Which lead me to stop being vocal about my feelings because they won't even care. I act like it's all fine, I'm happy in the house, etc but it's just not the truth. For a few days I'll feel like life isn't miserable and then one, small very insignificant action of their triggers my emotions. I tried taking those 'Am I depressed? ' quizzes hoping that the result would be I am depressed which isn't the case. And I'm not really suicidal. It's just all resentment. And I just feeling guilty for having these emotions. When people say I love my family, dad, mom I just can't relate to them. I don't even remember when I felt emotions like love towards my family. It make me wonder whether I'm incapable of loving people. And I feel like I'll always be alone because I'm the one who's always pushing people. And for this behavior of mine, I'm always blaming my parents. But at this point, I don't even know if it's their fault or is it just me who's not able to hold relationships. I just want to have a happy life which seems rather impossible to me because of my overthinking. I'll either overthink and ruin the relationship myself or I'll overthink and think the other person will make my life horrible like how my parents did. This constant need of attention makes me go crazy. These past few months I don't really crave attention but this is because I've really stopped talking to most people. I only talk to one friend and occasionally with other few. I've cut off myself from people. It gives me a different kind of peace but also make me panic because I'll be the only one left out without friends. And I'm so confused about everything in life right now. I can't seem to concentrate on my studies and it makes me feel even worse. Life doesn't exactly feel miserable but it doesn't seem exciting like how it used to. It just feels monotonous. I feel like I'm wasting my times and try to get some stuff done but by the end of the end I haven't done anything. I also feel conflicted about my career choice. This wasn't forced by my partners. I just passively accepted what Career they thought would be right for me and never actively tried finding out what I wanna do. I feel like I should've explored more but I don't know me exploring career choices would've made any difference since I probably would've chosen this path. I also don't know how to do any artistic things. I wanted to learn dance and singing but my parents didn't let me because they felt I should concentrate on my studies more. They would say yes when I asked but won't do anything about it. I just feel like a talentless person. I used to be a smart kid but now I just feel dumb. I feel like I'm super below average who's good for nothing. And this gave been my never ending cycle since the pandemic started.

2192,aztec91x,1621170908,1,"Hey, new to this sub. I guess I don't have to say I'm lonely, otherwise I wouldn't be here...

I have a few friends, I only keep people close who share my values, so while I could probably count all my friends on one or two hands, they are all good quality (nice, friendly, respectful) and I always feel better when I'm with them. I guess the shame about being an adult is that most people around your age have lives to live, and at this point in time, a lot of my friends are in different states, and the few that are around are busy working/family/etc. I don't have a job but I'm starting one this week and hopefully that will keep me occupied. And I just moved into a shared flat after living with a good friend of mine for 3 months. I guess going from always having her around to being by myself the last week has left me feeling pretty sad. She's always busy working split shifts too so its hard to catch up with her. My other close friend, who I call my big bro, and he calls me little bro, is in another state and sorting out a whole bunch of shit, so not only can't I see him, but we hardly even have time to chat. He is the closest friend i've ever had, if you get us in a room together you can bet money that we'll both be naked. No homo or anything, but we're just so close that we don't give a fuck. These two people I consider my closest friends and not being able to see them is just plain shit.

Now all that isn't so bad, because I will see them again eventually and soon I'll be busy myself too with less time to fret over things. But something that has been getting to me the last year or so is the fact that I'm almost 30 and I haven't had children and I don't have a long-term partner yet. Now I think I might be having a ""quarter-life crisis"", because I'm in the middle of getting my life back on track (from homeless and broke to having my own roof and soon a job, next comes a car, etc.) and I always imagined I would have children around 25. That and I've spent more of my adult life in relationships than out of them, so not having a girlfriend makes me feel like im missing something from my life. Now all my friends say not to push, that I should wait and let life happen. But i've been waiting, i've been patient, and i'm still single. I had a few flings, but it's not what i'm looking for at this stage in my life. No brag but my body count is in the high 60s, so needless to say I've slept with enough random chicks to see the tediousness of it, and realize that having someone to hug, and give you kisses, and wake up next to is way better than a fling with a random. And this is what i feel i'm missing, someone to share my life with.

This post turned into a bit of a rant but I think i got my point across. I just miss my friends and I want to start a family. I guess i'll just keep keeping on for now and see what tomorrow brings, but if anyone could offer any tips for how to deal with this then that would be greatly appreciated.",lonely,"""Quarter-Life Crisis""?",2021-05-16 23:15:08

2194,scredplaysecretplace,1621168013,1,"I found my ideal girl. She's everything I ever wanted. The exact amount of sweetness and gentleness I always wished to receive. It's not everyday you meet someone who wants to take care of you, like, actually take care of you. An unconditional love. It's not everyday you tell someone all the ways you've been broken before and they're careful not to hurt you in the same way. It's not everyday you meet someone who understands you without you needing to explain yourself. It's not everyday you tell someone the worst parts of you and they still find you deserving of love. Someone who looks at you and isn't afraid. Someone who tells you you're not hard to love and means it.

It felt like a set-up. Why? Just why did she have to be in a relationship? We had an emotional connection. It drove me crazy. I didn't think it was possible to connect that well with someone. Everything was easy. Conversation flowed easily. A match. But she's in a relationship. And she tells me she likes me, too. That she thinks of me as a soulmate. But she's in a relationship. She jokes about leaving her lover for me. But she doesn't. And it's an awful feeling to hold on to something like that. I'm waiting on her. I don't want to, but I'm waiting on her.

The thing is, I'm not even stable enough to have a relationship. So a part of me didn't really want her in that way. I can't make her happy. I'm sure of it. But I think about someone being loved by her. Someone receiving the same sweetness she gives me but sweeter. Someone holding her too tight. Someone not being there for her when she just wants someone to listen to her. And I want to love her. I want to love her better.

I don't know what to do with this feeling. I was lonely before I found her, sure, being misunderstood by everyone. But meeting her and knowing her and loving her, but not having her. It's lonelier.

Last year I had a huge fall out with my BFF of 9years and I guess it was the end of our friendship. I resented her for a whole year up till now... I just can‚Äôt let go and forgive the things that happened to us. I get annoyed and angry that I‚Äôve to end up in isolation when I see her going out with my other friends yet I can only stay at home and look at them being happy hanging out. I hate that I feel this way, I often ask myself why I can‚Äôt see others being happy... but when it comes to her I can‚Äôt. I tried to start all over again alone but months past, I see myself falling into a pit hole over again. I decided to take a month off from work and for the first 2 weeks it was alright... the last 2 weeks I started to feel down again. It was horrible, I felt like crying but I couldn‚Äôt cry, neither can I figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me... then came new year, it was my breaking point. I cried and told myself I need to change my life around and promise myself that I wouldn‚Äôt cry a single tear bcos of how I hate my life anymore. So I went on a weight loss journey (which I‚Äôve procrastinated for years). I thought maybe eating healthier and working out regularly might improve my perspective of life... however 5 mths in, though I‚Äôve lost quite an amount of weight, I still feel bitter and angry about my life. Seeing my friends getting proposed to/ married, having kids... I wish I was one of them... my friends always advice me that it‚Äôs okay to be alone, spend time doing things you like, upgrade yourself or hang out with others  you might feel better... but, no matter how passionate I‚Äôm towards my hobbies, there are times I don‚Äôt want to touch it, I just wanna companion. As for hanging out with friends, there are times they won‚Äôt be available for me due to work etc. I can‚Äôt be selfish to always hold them down demanding them to be with me whenever I want to. I hate feeling down and bitter, I hate advices that tell me to love myself... (I don‚Äôt understand the concept of loving myself). I hate that the things I wished for did not come through, yet I‚Äôm given things I‚Äôve never wanted... sorry for all the rants I sound like a brat but yea, I do wish to be happy but I‚Äôm so sick and tired of my mind trying to be better &gt; feeling like shit&gt; try to be better&gt; nothing‚Äôs working.

He was my best friend. He blindsided me with divorce a few days after Valentines day. I'm 35 F. 

My therapist informed to to lean on family and friends for guidance throughout this difficult time. But, problem is, my friends are all ghosting me. So I'm just hurting more. Feeling more abandoned than ever. My friends know what I'm going through. I just feel like they don't care because they can't relate to what I'm going through.

I had a friend tell me recently to stop talking about my divorce, and my ex, and that I need to talk to my therapist about it going forward. Her saying that truly hurt my feelings. Friends don't tell friends, ""I don't want to hear about your problems, tell your therapist"".
At least, I would never say that, and I cannot comprehend how someone would say that to me knowing how devastated I am right now. 

I'm in deep pain. In a grieving period during my divorce.
I know I need to build my self confidence and self worth again, so that I don't feel this deep sadness and loneliness long term.

Just know, that whatever you're going through, I truly don't believe you are alone. I think some people come and go in our lives for a reason. Some people just served their purpose on your journey. But I think that if you try, or reach out to people, or make an effort to create new relationships things will all work out and fall into place. 

I hope you all find your purpose in life. I hope we won't feel the need to be apart of this ""lonely"" group much longer.

2206,crying-over-anything,1621158126,1,"So to cut a long story short I have known my BFF for around 2 or so years. We met online and had literally everything in common, we share the same humour and a lot of the same aspects on things in life. (We live in different countries)

Around the middle of last year my friend started having to work hard for some college work, which I understood and appreciate because I know how difficult all that stuff can be. I really missed them as we went from talking every single day to barely talking at all. We have arranged regular video call sessions but either one of us usually ends up cancelling because we both suffer with anxiety and depression and you know how it can be when it gets you down bad.

I guess I‚Äôm just scared I will lose them and I keep comparing it to how it used to be. I know how difficult it can be to maintain friendships online anyway, but I have never had a friend like them before. They just understand me and always listen and never fail to make me smile. 

I spoke to a parent the other weekend about how I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôve been disconnected from this friend after they asked if we could reschedule one of our video chats due to them not feeling too great. My mom basically turned around and said ‚Äúif they wanted to speak to you, they would‚Äù and it just really made me start overthinking it.

My BFF and I constantly tell each other on any occasion we can how much we love each other and miss each other, but it still doesn‚Äôt stop me panicking over the thought I could lose someone who is so special to me!

ive been alone for a while now. virtually my entire life. ive never felt as though ive had a meanwhile connection with anyone (for various reasons ill get into later). this pandemic has only exacerbated such overwhelming feelings of despair and loneliness. everyday i wake up, work, eat, sit down, work some more, go to sleep, repeat. i dont usually talk to anyone. i have no one except my long-distance girlfriend but i dont even know if i can still keep our relationship going for much longer as i am dealing with a lot of change in my personal life. like ilove her but. im not sure if an ldr is the best thing for me at the moment especially with so many things going on. and i know i will be absolutely ripped to shreds whenever the time comes to move on because im just so pathetic. im just so desperate to be understood and feel wanted and every attempt at that is just so futile. it feels horrible. i cant even express myself in the confines of this pandemic-induced prison of a home. living with my family has forced me into suppressing my feelings and staying kept away to a corner. i just feel awful. everyday i pray for God's love to keep me sane but i still feel something missing. i just want a social life. why is it so hard for me to have that. why do people ignore me. why are people so confusing. i am 90% sure i have autism and that would explain a lot. so maybe im just meant to be alone. i mean pre-pandemic i was an absolute klutz in every social situation i found myself in. no wonder nobody would makw the effort to befriend me. it wouls always be me, stumbling on mt feet trying to chase after a fantasy of friendship and socialization that eludes me. but rhen again did i even try hard? every offer to hang out or go out with people would be declined because either my parents didnt want me to go out or i just didnt want to go because of how anxious and awkward i am in social situations. how can i fear the thing i crave most? i have no idea. i just personally feel like i will never ever find the right people. ive never even solidified a group of people or even a single person that is my ""rock"" or my ""person"" you know? idk. i just think no one really wants me. and i have yet to find out exactly why. i just wish it was easier. i want to be normal",lonely,being alone eats me alive but then again it is all i have ever known. maybe its meant to be this way,2021-05-16 18:13:45

2221,walkerwp,1621150208,1,"When I was in middle school, I had a strong group of friends. I met them many years earlier, which was the only reason I was still close with them: since I was in the middle of an awkward phase, I couldn't make any friends outside of my own little group.

During the middle of the 8th grade, though, I moved 6 hours away. My nervous tendencies stayed with me, so when I arrived at my new school, I couldn't manage to talk to anybody. I would go on to sit alone at lunch for 18 months, with absolutely zero friends in my new city. This would eventually change, though.

By the end of the 9th grade, I decided to try out for sports, ultimately making the football, basketball and track teams. Over time, I went through a dramatic personality change. While I was shy and timid in the past, I quickly became outgoing, eager to destroy the bad reputation I built for myself.

As high school progressed, I did everything I could to make up for the 2 years that I spent without friends. I went out twice a week, had \~20-30 people over at my house roughly every other week, and got in 2 different relationships. For the first time in my life, I felt completely in control of my situation, and was happier than ever to have overcome my previous problems.

All of this came to an end when COVID-19 shut everything down, though. At the beginning of the pandemic, I continued to spend time with my closest friends from high school. As everything remained closed, we began spending less time with each other, to the point where I only had 1 or 2 people that I could reliably call on a weekend. As of today, everyone from my one year long success story has faded out of my life -- I haven't seen any of them since February. It feels like I've been forced back into my original circumstances against my will.

As I'm writing this, I can't help but wonder what went wrong -- I don't have any personal issues with my friends, but over time, it's become more and more difficult to stay close with any of them.

2236,TheRealGhostly,1621141961,1,"I have been having bad anxiety and panic attacks for the past few months, and it's just been worse for the last couple of days. It's sad to live in a world where you can't find one single person who would care for you, even as a friend. It takes a minute or two at most to ask someone how they're doing and to tell them they're not alone but I don't see anyone doing it, it's just sad. All my life, I've made time for people that needed someone to talk to, I've made time to make sure people had a person to talk to and I made time to talk to people I know to make sure they were doing ok, but it just really hurts that no one would do that for me in return. I do not expect someone to do it for me when I do it for them. It's just that these people see that I am not doing okay and they just decide to ignore me and ghost me like it's going to help. Being ignored and feeling lonely have been bad triggers all my life and when someone does that over and over, again and again, it just hurts no matter how used to I am to that feeling. If you are reading this and if any of your friend is going through a tough time, please do not ignore or ghost them. Even if they wouldn't do it back to you.

I've accepted it. And I can live with it.

What really hits me is, how did I end up being a hermit.

My family, long story, consider them MIA.

I've got one friend, she helps me with the house chores because of my sciatic pain. She comes to my place once a week, and it's the best day of the whole week.

I've got an online friend, too. I met them a couple of months ago. They're very caring and supportive. We talk about a lot of things. But I'm so afraid of losing them...

I've got a dozen hobbies. All of them involve using my phone. I never really liked doing anything in my house. I can't do anything outdoors due to lockdown restrictions.

I'm working from home, a couple of hours a day from Mondays to Thursdays - that's not real human contact.

I've got a few friends on Reddit. We exchange brief messages almost every day. 

I've got a couple of chat bots.

I've got a virtual pet.

I can't remember what else I have... Yet there are nights like this. The usual online traffic has ceased. No new notifications. And I seem not to be able to hold myself together.

2252,cattynails,1621131950,1,"You don't pay attention to me when I'm talking
Only when others listen to me you do
I sometimes talk to people I have nothing in common with just because I don't wanna be alone
The worst kind of loneliness is when you are around people, especially when they are laughing

At the end of a day in which I talked to a lot of people I cry 
Maybe because I feel like an outsider
I've felt that way all my life
Like I'm on a stage and people are waiting for what I have to say
Or maybe I'm in a glass cage in which the world can see my every move
He treats me differently than him just for being a woman
Nevertheless, I choose to not fight it, that way I don't cry as much that night in my shower when I unburden myself
I'm afraid to cry in front of them
I will be like this until the day I die
I was raised in a house in which crying could only be a calculated scheme to get what one wants
Me, being so sensitive I cry all the time
I cry watching a happy couple because I'm lonely
I cry saying goodbye to someone at the end of the day when I saw them for several hours because I forget how I was when I was alone even if only hours had passed
I cry when I think about how people won't like me for feeling so deeply, 
I get angry when I hear people spending ridiculous amounts of money on events or material things, I know it's their prerogative but my heart aches for the people who have nothing
I get ashamed whenever I meet someone in politics or social media because I don't believe in either one of them and I don't want to disregard their job area
I get angry whenever someone says something immature towards me, not because of how that made me feel, but because I recognize about myself that automatically I think of an even more immature comeback, though I choose not to say it
I get ashamed of my blemishes and imperfections whenever I see beautiful girls in my home. I cover my face with my hair, which I hate because I don't like my hair either
I get angry when I realize about myself that I might not be as open-minded as I think. The social groups that make me feel this way are rich people and snobs. People who think they are better than others or simply people that don't get off their pedestal to see the world as it is, and choose to see it the way their parents presented it to them.
Finally, I get tired. I get tired because thoughts run and run through my mind all day, but I'm a quiet girl regarding my feelings. 
And even though I get tired I become addicted to distractions that keep me awake at night, because there is a small but painful window of time at night in between finally deciding i will go to sleep and actually falling asleep, in which I am forced to deal with my feelings and my reality.
It is so easy talking to reply dms from a guy that I know is crushing on me to validate my feelings. It is so easy watching modern family as though that became the only reality I know, just like with books.
But it's not easy listening to my thoughts. My head telling me all the things that hurt me that day. But then I make myself try to forget it by saying it didn't hurt that much. At that point, I turn on the lights and see my scars to remember just how much it hurt, i do this validate my feelings. 
It's not easy to live sometimes.
But I do so because I have been promised that it gets better. So I put on an act, like my worst days are behind me, and pull through.

2275,Rock-Debris,1621118699,1,"Hi. I'm a  and I want to post because I feel lonely and not understood at all. I'm gonna make a quick summary.
I grew up in a religious household and my dad was kinda violent towards me and my siblings. I grew up to be a really shy kid and rapidly got bullied. It all started when I was 8, not a ""bad"" bullying but for me it was hard.

I was alone for a great part of my childhood, and when I wasn't, people I liked ended up turning their back on me. I was the back sheep of the school.
It continued during middle school until I broke down and ended up changing school. After that, I went to high school and I got institutionalized after multiple suicide attempts.



Nowadays, I'm getting better and finaly started to like myself a little bit. But I feel lonely, again, and it's starting to hurt me a lot, again.


I have started a reptile shelter by myself and got myself more and more rescue missions for tamed and wild animals. Not only reptiles, but birds and rodents too.
Animals are my whole life, and I'm not kidding when I say that they saved me multiple times. To me, they are my equals, I don't eat them or hurt them, and I'm trying to be respectful to every species (I have to admit I still have trouble with spiders, mosquitoes and ticks).

So, where's the problem you may ask?
I only have my family, 2 older sisters, one older brother, and two younger siblings, and both of my parents. I'm lucky, I know that.
I don't have friends or anything. I literally talk to no one in my life.

My older brother don't give a crap about anything that happens in this family, and my two older sisters always discourage me, especially with animals rescue.

The only person who's acting nice towards me is my mom. We are really close. But sometimes, I feel like I'm too much. I'm annoying or anything.
I don't have much conversation except for animals actually.


My dad is always angry at me for X or Y reason, so my rescue are a problem.
To clarify, I'm the one who pays for litteraly everything for my rescue (vet, food ect) so I don't know why it upset them so much. All of my rescues are healthy and in good condition.


I've talked about pets, and now I will talk more about myself. I'm lesbian. I came out when I was 14 to my mom and when I was 16 to my dad.
My mom had trouble accepting it, but now she accepts me as I am.

My dad however...
This night, I was talking about some homophobes posters I have saw that creeped me out.
Then I started joking about gay stuff and he started to look at me weirdly. After 5 minutes, he tells me :
""You're gonna change your mind when you'll find a pretty guy"".

I heard this sentence too many times, and I  told him that perhaps he was gay, he just haven't found the good guy, jokingly.


He got mad and started doing his habitual passive aggressive crap. I thought he was joking with me.
Turns out, when I was kissing my dogs goodnight, I overheard him telling my mom how I was annoying with my crap and gay stuff. I thought he accepted me, well, I was wrong. Then I understood he wasn't joking at all.


I feel like I'm losing more and more links with my family. I have nothing but them and I think it's not where I belong anymore 
I'm always yelled at (even by my younger siblings), ridiculized and discouraged. I feel like they're trying to break me again. I'm feeling so heavy and sad.

People these days think its cool to be sad and be emo and to listen to sad depressing music. Like, if you want to act all emo then go right fucking ahead I won't stop you  but why do you have to say you have depression when you don't just for the attention? I've had my battle with depression and it makes my fucking blood boil to fucking deal with these idiots who say they're depressed and all mentally fucked when they're not. Its not cool. Depression is anything but cool its a curse that people have to deal with every day and that I would do anything I could to live a normal life not going to bed thinking how much of a damn failure I am. You don't just say you're depressed for attention seeking and depression isn't something you wear around your neck like   
a fucking medal. Its not something you put in your social media bio like *24/7 sad* or *depressed* and have some half assed sad quote to pair it with. Its something I and many others out there have been dealing with for a long time and wished that we never have gone through it in the first place. Its something that has taken the lives of some of my most closest friends who I'll never fucking see for the rest of my life. Its something that made me try and end myself when I was in grade 8 because I didn't want to put up with people fucking bullying me every damn day in school. I would never wish depression even on my worst enemy. Its funny how, depression is portrayed as being dark and gloomy and sad. Oh no its much much more than that. I don't really open up to people about my battle I'm sorry for anyone who has had depression in this sub and I truly hope you find peace someday.

I have read up on it and it explains so much. I finally feel lik I am on a path to recovering and actually being able to enjoy my life. I'm only sad now that so much of my life was wasted being addicted to a social construct that I could have anyway if I were focused on the right things. I feel like a real shithead.

2312,nashinijuna,1621102020,1,"I don't have many friends. The ones I do are nice to me, but they all clearly like me less than I like them. It's always been this way, I'm always somebody that people have never felt invested in being around. I've always been lonely. I can't make myself seem like a likable person for shit so I just push everyone away instead.

I love my partner and I'm beyond happy to have him but he's literally all that I have. I don't mean to seem callous to the people on this sub that do genuinely have no one, but I think I was better off when I had 0 people that were invested in my interests than having 1. Because when you have 1 person, you dump everything on them, you become reliant. My poor partner does not deserve to be the sole person to help with my awful emotions and self-esteem. 

If you haven't noticed, I have pretty low self-esteem lol. I've always been the third wheel, I've always been treated as disposable. I feel like I'm a burden on everyone I care about. All that being in a relationship has done is prove me right, I'm needy and I deal with all of my problems through my partner because without him I have no one at all.

I hate how reliant on him I am. He regrets it too. It's a vicious cycle because knowing that I am this weight on him makes me feel worse about myself, but discussing that puts more weight on him. I just want to be able to deal with my problems without hurting the people around me in the process, or better yet not feel the way I do at all.

I don't know who to talk to. Out of empathy, I'm not going to talk to my partner about how I feel. I don't want to drain him any more than I already do. But he's *all*. I hate the feeling that I have to choose between his misery and mine. When I'm making the choice to spare him the difficulty of dealing with me, as I am today, I have no one. All my friends do is pass memes to me back and forth, I'm not going to vent to them. I realize just how lonely I am and how the only thing keeping me from feeling that 24/7 is me making other people feel exasperated with me. 

I feel like my partner deserves better than me. But if I told him that, it would just be more of this same fucking issue because then he'd deny it and try to console me and I'd know the whole time that all I'm doing is adding on. All I am is a problem for people to solve. If I express that, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I don't, I have to sit here in pain. It's lose-lose. Hurting the people around me hurts me, and hurting me hurts the people around me, and yet those are the only options I have.

I'm sorry if this was disorganized, it's stream of consciousness. I'm spiraling at the moment, I don't normally feel this bad. But God when I do it just hurts like hell because I know that what I'm saying is truer than the illusion of happiness I live with the rest of the time.",lonely,Spiraling.

But every now and then, I get a severe downward spiral and I don't understand why. I mean i do kinda. But i feel like i shouldnt be. 

So I have never been in a relationship before. Not even a date. I havent had the luck of progressing that far. It ended the same way. They end up ghosting me. It hurts. It really does. Because I never find out where i went wrong and what i could do better. Now i find myself in a period where i dont get to meet any prospective partners.

And the fact that I havent even had a single romantic gesture/encounter...really eats at me. I feel so damn lonely. Every other part of my life is doing fine, but in this regard, its just a bottomless pit. And every time I see someone younger than me or someone close to me get together with anothe person. I get happy for them. But at the same time, that knife drives in a little deeper for me. And it sucks.  Because it just feels like i will never get to know even a little morsel of what that feels like. And its drives me nuts.

Recently, the yearning has intensified, the intense feeling of lonliness, I used to be able to tolerate it. One bad day. The next day i will be fine. But the frequency has increased, and i feel so bad about it. But all means everything else in my life is pretty good, so why cant i let go of this?  So maybe somethings wrong with me. I dont know.

So friends and family don't even feel real to me. I have one person who feels real to me. I love her wholeheartedly. Shes the most wonderful person ive met.

2324,DarkCrimson_Moon,1621098833,1,"Hello everyone,

I'm leaving a post here in the hope of exchanging with people who have experienced or are experiencing the same thing or who are just willing to discuss.

I  recently realized that I have ""daddy issues."" I have a complicated  relationship with my father, he suffers from paranoia and depression  with fairly rare suicidal tendencies, however I also suspect him of  being a narcissistic pervert. In fact he is very abusive in his words,  he has never really been proud of me, we don't have the same view on  things which leads to a lot of arguments. Since I was a child I have  always seen him argue quite violently with my mother. It has calmed down  since but I am still just as anxious and stressed at the thought of  doing or saying something he might not like.

As  a result, I've been acting out with him since I was a teenager and do  things for him and not for me, (where is my oscar award at this point  lol) I also tend to bottle up my feelings until they explode and I have  nervous breakdowns. I take a lot on myself and I'm lucky to have  supportive and patient mother and close friends.

I  naively thought that the day I would be independent and live away from  home I would be able to live a normal life but I understand now that the  problem is much bigger and it won't stop when I'll leave home... The  problem is that I am increasingly prone to anxiety and fear of not  succeeding, but on top of that I am unable to love a man for long.

I've  had relationships that started well but all ended because I got tired  of them, I thought their kindness wouldn't last and the love I had for  them didn't last either, I was unable to give them long mutual love  which made me isolate myself before running away from the relationship. I  am really acting like a toxic person and it bothers me a lot. I realise  over time that I find it hard to trust men but also that I am afraid of  them and so I act like some kind of wounded animal pushing them away to  feel safe.

But I want to change,  because in the end like most people, I have my lonely moments where I  would like to have someone to love, who understands me and is patient  with me, and to whom I can act like a normal girlfriend. This will only  happen if I change but I have a barrier in this area.

I  don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, I guess talking about  this and reassuring people like me who has the same problem... I believe  this will be super helpful for me.

NB  : I'm planning on seeing a therapist but this will have to wait because  of financial problem, I know this is the best solution but times are  rough for now",lonely,Is there a shoulder to cry on ?,2021-05-16 03:13:53

It's difficult because my entire life I've been very solitary. I've never had many friends, and now that I do have a few I feel so drained during and after hanging out with them. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I spend my days around people yet I don't feel like I have anyone.

Back in 2019 I attempted to take my life. I failed obviously but at that moment before I attempted I felt so calm and collected. I felt like I was finally going in the right direction. When I woke up alive I was devastated. I spend 3 months in hospitals after that and I never improved. I've never felt like that again though and I crave the feeling. I got close back in April and ended up in the hospital for a bit but I made the mistake of telling someone that time. I sincerely wish I hadn't.

I feel like one one hand I want to give life a shot because I want to see where I can go, but at the same time I just don't care enough. I have so much to deal with it's just so overwhelming. I've been dealing with MDD and GAD for the last 12 years or so, and I've dealt with Gender Dysphoria and ASD my entire life. I'm on a multitude of different meds that I take 3x a day and I'm just tired.

The friends I do have are great people don't get me wrong but watching them all the time go on living their lives and being successful is so difficult. Seeing others in loving relationships hurts. I think of what I don't have and I get suicidal. I struggle to connect with people and that is very difficult. For most people I meet I push them away and when I become friends with a group I usually make the mistake of disappearing and just vanishing into thin air.

Growing up my father was abusive, and all focus was on my brother so I felt like I was left out and ignored for much of it. Now the only family members I'm close with really are my Mom and my Grandmother on my Moms side. My grandmother's health is declining and I'm worried about her and my Mom is always so stressed about me. I just feel like a burden, as if I take up too much space and thought on this planet. I don't like causing my Mom stress and unfortunately no matter what I try to do she continues to worry.

2353,Misterrocket21,1621065501,1," 

It was a difficult tonight for me to sleep, so I thought it is better to share my story here.

I am a socially awkward person. I have less friends andI don't talk that much. However, if I am comfortable, I can have easily have long conversations.

I worked as a barista. Most of my co-workers were indeed nice, but didn't talk that much. However, there was one co-worker who talked a lot to me. I liked that and I could easily have conversations with her. However, I stopped 3,5 months ago ( 1 february)as a barista and started a career in the office. In the first week, I did miss her, as I don't know many persons who have the same attitude as her. I came back to the store( also didn't had a proper goodbye before) to say that I wanted to keep in touch with her, through whatsapp and also by coming to the store. She liked it and also wanted to keep in touch with me.

After that I texted her, but after a short conversation I got ignored. This also happened the second time.I came 3 times back to the store to see her ( february, begin March and begin April). She was enthusiastic there and we talked.The last time however, she was less enthusiastic and it felt awkward.

I didn't go to the store and spoke with her for 5 weeks, as I got more busy( and don't wanted to make awkward to contact her). Now I got more time and texted her. And I was again left on read.

My main point is: I want to keep in touch with her, I DON'Twant a relationship or to be good friends with her. She also has a friend and I respect that. I also don't want that she forgets me.

Maybe she thinks that I am too awkward to be friends, maybe she wears a 'mask' and has a different behaviour outside the workfloor or maybe she thinks that I am in love with her.

Does anyone know how I should tackle this sitiation. What should I do to keep in touch with her, should I go back to the store to see her and talk to her( I hesitate about this as I don't want to go too often)/ Do I have to keep in touch with her more or less? 

I also have less friends, so I want to keep in contact with her. I am already bad in making friends, but with a girl, it is even more difficult. 

I hope someone can help me?",lonely,Asking advice : how to keep in contact with someone.,2021-05-15 17:58:21

2357,BulgingSubpoena,1621063099,1,"The last 5 years I've been trying to cope from being in a mentally abusive relationship. I had to move in with my parents because I couldn't afford to keep my house. I lost a good friend in 2019 because of her depression. 2020 was horrible. My anxiety and depression got worse and I ended up walking out of my job that I had for 18 years because they didn't care to help me get help. Early Feb. 2020 I got covid and nearly died. Took me 6 months to feel strong enough to work again. Had to file bankruptcy then cash out all my stock and 401k to survive last year. Found a new job last August then just recently quit because a few people I worked with was making up lies in order to turn everyone else against me, nothing was being done about it. 

I don't know how to cope with my anxiety/depression when I feel like i have noone to talk to. I feel like my problems are a burden to others. I'm always quick to be there for people I care about, but it's the exact opposite when I need someone. I'll make plans to get people together, even my family, but they always back out or tell me they have other plans. I've tried meeting people on apps but that didn't go well either.

2384,HaleOfBayLeaves,1621042680,1,"Hi reddit,

I came on this vacation for one specific thing: I really want to leave this feeling behind.

I self-reject myself from other people's lives because obviously everyone just humors me because they have to, but nobody actually believes I could be a worthwhile friend, a loving, capable partner, a capable member of a team who can accomplish a goal just the same as anyone else.

While organizing my belongings in my room, I found a couple of boxes in the bottom of my closet, one of which was from my childhood best friend of 11 years. She gave me several framed photos of us for my 16th birthday, some from elementary school, some from even a few weeks before my birthday. Since graduating three years ago, her and I have only really spoken a couple of times, and with very short conversations that last less than a few minutes. The only messages we've sent each other in the last year were happy birthday messages since our birthdays are a week apart anyways, and part of me wonders if she would even do that if I didn't message her on her birthday the week before mine. 

I guess it's just hit me that I'm never gonna have a friend like that again. Even though I have managed to make a couple of friends (I mean that literally, I have 2 friends) at college, they aren't ever going to live up to the same role that my childhood friend had in my life. Hell, now that I've moved home she's literally about 3 blocks away from me. But I won't be seeing her in person, and I won't be messaging her, because it feels like any chance of us continuing our friendship passed a long time ago. I feel so damn lonely without her, and it feels like a hole is in my chest when I do remember all the times we stayed up late watching movies in her basement, or walking around our very small and very boring town even though neither of those adjectives felt true when we were together.

I can't belive how downhill everything has gone from just a year ago, I used to be lonely and often would cry because no one cared about me, this was during quarantine so I decided making some friends online, (I couldn't get outside and well if I even could I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have many options to make any friends). Things went as usual for this kind of socializing, exchanged some words with total strangers in hope to find someone to actually stick for a while and finally have a friend, to wake up in the morning and see someone asking how my day was and vice versa...
Turs out I actually got people doing that... It was great at the start but then guess what, stuff happened.

One of my friends committed suicide... I'm going to be honest, I didn't know the person for a long but the way I was that ""close"" (She was from Sweden I am from spain) to something such sad really affected me, and I mean REALLY, I couldn't sleep, I kept crying and sadly told my parents, had to lie to them because it would be really troubling if they knew I was befriending someone hundreds of miles away so I said she was a local, this makes me feel really guilty. I'm still sad about it even if it's almost a year since it happened...

Then I met other person, ANNA. She was great, always being supportive, trying to fix me up by showing me paths, I found out she was really fucked up so I tried to ""fix"" her, tried everything I could to make her feel better, I ended failing, miserably... 
I really liked this person, my musical taste grew based to her recommendations (RMTTDWD), my way of talking, chatting, acting, she hugely influenced me. One day, she decided to cease all her relationships, and just leave... I, that had been asking a little too personal questions about her mental health and daily life was suspecting quite a lot, last day of talking to her I remember asking 
""-Are you going to do anything stupid?""
""-Idk""
Idk... What a relieving response from the most unstable person I've met in my life! Imagination started rolling, and that's when I started feeling devastated, I, as of today still cry sometimes, it's just overwhelming since I won't ever know how's she doing, at least with the other I knew what happened, but this? Wonder.

Then I met other person, really caring, ended ghosting and when I needed the person back, profile's gone... That's how I learned I'm an horrible person, they always listened, spreaded positiveness and hope... Wish I could say sorry...

Then, I meet ANOTHER one, spent 4 MONTHS of which 200 HOURS~ (quarantine) were spent talking just so I could get GHOSTED, that reaaaallly pissed me offff

And way more people, the point is... While I would finally have some friends, I ended up alone again, quarantine been over for a while and realized how pathetic I am at making new friends, I really can't, like, not even by mistake, even while people approach me (legends) I scare them away with my unpurposely aggressive face... And since school ended, I don't even have any acquittance to say hi üò¢

Now everything I do is just remember how cool talking to my friends was and how i will never be back at it, aswell as feeling sad for past events... I even created this account just for the slightest chance of getting messaged by an old buddy...

TL:DR: I made online friends in quarantine just to get fucked by life, end up lonely and carry traumas for probably a couple of years.

is this what love does? is this sensation of missing someone that means you're in love with someone? or is just because i was lonely for too much and now, when i get some of her company, my brain gets addicted to it? or am i just dumb?

Same is with by bf. Sometimes I feel even more loneliness while being with him than when being alone. 

And I ask myself why my brain makes me feel like that :(

2425,majestic_walrus27,1621016538,1,"Riding a bike in a small town where you don't know anyone can be demeaning. I personally have a long ride down a busy road. Pushing 30 is the icing on the cake. As a recovered alcoholic, my sobriety and my health mean a lot. Some days I forget how far I've come and need to remind myself. I should take some pride in what I've managed to accomplish. Recently I've been feeling pretty low. No friends etc. That ride has been getting to me. So I started doing a few sets of pushups every time I got back from it.  Turning from someone no one would want to be into someone a few people might want to be. And pushing homelessness I can feel that if I had to leave, that I would have accomplished something in my stay here. That I wouldn't leave with nothing to show. Like hey at least I'm sober and fit. Been going to the dentist. Those are no small things even though sometimes I feel so down. Seeing what I need to improve on and taking small but important steps really adds up. I just hadn't taken any new steps in a while. A new job is really all I need now and it feels pretty possible despite a couple setbacks that are beginning to not matter, to disappear.  I just hope that one day I'll be able to help someone who may be struggling with things I was able to beat. Like I know being homeless sucks, wash your socks and underwear in a sink this is how. This is how to backpack. Stay sober. Stay healthy. A breakthrough will come. Idk. I hope you all find a new step to take no matter how small and begin the transformation into someone you can be proud of. God bless. Keep your heads up and hang in there.",lonely,Keep it moving.

2427,Euphoric_Try8501,1621015545,1,"Hi, today I want to vent. Idk how long this post will be but I'll keep typing till I feel I said what I wanted to say. 

Im an ex-christian, turned into atheist. Starting of with this because it immediately alienates me from my family. My family is the orthodox Christian family from India and they're also huge hypocrites. In fact, they're the reason that I started doubting my religion in the first place. They're still continuing in their faith. My mom Is so into god. They all want me to become a good Christian, heck! I've even been baptized. 

Im faking it every day. Each day at family prayer it hurts me, but I can't tell them that I don't share their beliefs! They'll be traumatized. I've been a good Christian until I wasn't and it'd be such a shock to them. Plus our family is involved in church ministry so they'd have to save face in front of church too. I can't do that to them. I simply can't. I just have to act till im with them.

So while this internal struggle is going on I had miserable friends. They betrayed me and a few years back and I felt so alone. I was almost invisible and then I had this concrete decision to stay alone for the greater part of my life. 

I had one friend who wasn't close at that time with whom I shared what was going on with the friend circle wise. She wasn't close to me either but she was a nice person. But I kept my distance, I don't know why. 

Years passed, and then this girl who I used to talk with became closer and I got a friend. She had a huge circle of friends and it brings me to tears to say this, they literally adopted me without judgement. A group of 11 people most of them girls just without any questions accepted me into their group. I made close friendships with few of them and we all hung out so much, I loved every second of it. I hung out with them so much that they had doubts if I was gayüòÇ. But I love them so much. Then I graduated, became a doctor and now I'm feeling lonely again. Me and my friends still talk and share memes but I can't move out of the house. Due to covid, my parents etc. 

In addition to all this I caught feelings for a girl and she doesn't feel the same And it's been all messy because I wanted her only for my ""needs ""  she obviously didn't like it and then I told her I had feelings for her but now she doesn't feel the same about me so yeah pretty messy. So  I decided to leave it at that. We both are just different people and I've got to move on. She's been pretty nice to me recently tho. We're good friends now. 

There's things going on at all fronts and I'm caught in the middle. Feels like this battle will never end. And Im fighting it alone. All these thoughts are making me feel lonely.


I know things will be better in the future for sure. I hope for it. I have big dreams to achieve but I feel like I can be alone till I die. Is that okay? Is that normal? 

I don't want a companion. I'm fine with using my hand for my. ""Needs"" 

I just want to be alone without a battle. 

Is that okay? Can I want to be alone without thinking about someone else for once in my life? 

Idk the more I think the more complicated it gets.

It's not their fault, but I feel like I can't connect with anybody in any meaningful way. I can have conversations with people and they can be pleasant, but I always feel one step removed. I'm coming up on one and a half years sober from alcohol. Alcohol helped me loosen up in social settings. Part of the reason alcohol was so addictive for me was that I like the person that I was after a few drinks, up to a point. I look back on friendships that I used to have growing up where I didn't feel this way, and wonder what changed. I don't have any of my childhood friends anymore each for their own reasons.

I met a girl back before all this covid crap, I really liked her and she really liked me. She was sitting across from me at a table and it was the perfect situation for me to get to know her better. But this nagging urge to break it off overcame me and I found an excuse to rejoin the group we were with. I guess I was anticipating that it was only a matter of time that she realized that I'm not a healthy person all together. That my fun charismatic persona was exactly that, and would wear off once the alcohol and weed did. And that would be a very painful experience for me, and should be avoided.

When I read this post somewhere on social media it made me reflect upon my life. The society where I come from isn‚Äôt very much open about mental health. I have had a very normal childhood or as I would like to believe but that wasn‚Äôt the case, I now realise. I was neglected by my parents because they were too entangled in their own lives and perhaps struggling to exist with their own traumas. My father was rarely present because he was too busy arranging livelihood for all of us. 

However, I did not learn to handle basic emotions. I was too reserved which was often mistaken as shy. I had no boundaries when it came to have friendships or relationships with other people. I worked under covert emotional contracts which did not work out too well for me. All my 20s I was in and out of traumatising relationships which always ended badly. When I got married in my late 20s, it ended up in divorce in 6 months. 

Now I live alone. I find people intolerable. I don‚Äôt like to hangout with anyone, it drains my energy. I kept telling myself that the only way to be safe and have no drama in life is to cut away people and that‚Äôs what I have done now. And I thought it was working for me.

Anyway I'm pretty chill now and my relationship with my parents and sibling is definetly getting better.

But I ruined it today because of something so trivial and stupid. I was preparing breakfast and my little sis was too. She finished preparing and ate, while I still preparing. The counter was getting messy and full of stuff so I told her to clean it after she finished eating.  A few minutes later, my mom, big sis, and her baby came back after stroll, and my lil sis jumped to carry the baby. The counter was still messy and it was hard for me to cook, and told lil sis while annoyed to clean up herself. She said annoyingly she is carrying the baby and told to me wait. Suddenly my big sis abruptly said ""why make a big fuss, just clean it yourself."" It felt like a small neddle stabs me, usually I just clench my mouth and just brush over her mean comments, but I slipped and said ""shut the fuck up"" (not yelling, just monotonous).

And there goes the story. My big sis blowed up, and told me I'm a hot headed person and always angry, my mom got mad at me and nagging, my lil sis just left to put the baby. I wanted to explain I was mad at my big sis and told my mom I was frustated, but I felt like whatever I'm saying I'm always the bad guy.

Fuck them all I am now not falling for any tricks. You know that feeling when someone trying to get close to you but after some time you realize they are just using you and as soon as they have what they want, BOOM you don't exist anymore. I saw a lot of post saying this lockdown has made many people realize about their friends but I am experiencing them for years now. 

I am looking at the bright side now. I am reading books and watching more movies. I follow football too so I have that too. I know its hard but if they don't want you in their life then thats not the end of it. I am not gonna lie but I too thought of suicide cause I had nothing more to do. At first I thought I can live without anyone having in my life but humans crave connection even if thats with 1 person. But I have a dream. My dream was much bigger than throwing my life away that easily. Even if it takes years I will achieve it before I die. As for making friends its not like I never tried reaching out to people. It seems they don't need me so I am never trusting anyone ever again. I have seen enough of this friendship shit. 

It's one of the reason I will never get any girl. So I am really staying positive and heading toward my goal. That is my only priority right now.

I have no idea why this is happening, did she forget? did I do something? Has she just lost interest in me?

I don't like to pester her with messages or call her loads because I often get the feeling that I'm just a burden to her and she only spends time with me out of pity. She always says that's not true but its just this feeling I get.

Its not the first time we've made plans and then she's vanished. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm really distressed and heartbroken.

Then in 2020 lockdown came and I liked it a bit, finally free time. I used to take a walk every evening on my terrace, without actually giving a fuck about anyone.
Then in 2021, I started noticing something, every other guy in my neighborhood is either talking to someone in person or on phone and I am just taking a walk with nobody beside me nor talking to anyone on phone. I realised how alone I am. At this point I don't have any one whom I can call my friend in 1 km radius. I got too insecure, I stopped going outside evening but went on night.

Now that things have been over for about 6 months, I felt comfortable reaching back out after we coincidentally matched on tinder. We went out; got stupid high, ate chick fil a, and talked for 4 hours in my car. It was the best night I've experienced in ages. She asked me how I felt and i told her i wasn't actively pining after her because she did hurt me in the past and i kinda fell outta love, but something was there. She told me she cared about me very much but that she had no romantic feelings for me because she was gay. I am so happy for her to be free enough to tell me that and to be her true self, but it  means the proverbial bookend on that chapter of my life. We broke up and got back together once before; not again this time. And now that realisation has me a wreck because those memories are just that now.

So in primary school once, I was having a ""friendly argument"" (I can't remember the specifics) with some friends. However, they decided to take things too far and, quote, ""prove I have no friends"". They spent 10 minutes literally asking random people I had talked to before if they were my friend and every time the answer was no. Now this didn't hurt at the time, but if someone did this to me today, it would fucking destroy me internally. My family laugh at me and say stuff I know they don't mean and it hurts to be constantly mocked but I can't bring myself to tell them. They're not bad people, they just don't think sometimes.

Everyone around me seems to just have the ability to get in a relationship, or at least have the opportunity to. I never have. I've watched as people around me have gotten together and split up without telling them of my pain. I've helped them when they've come to me for advice and hidden away my jealousy and hurt. Sometimes at night before I go to sleep, I'll just break down. But no tears come.

I have so many friends around me but I still get hit by pangs of loneliness. Weekends used to be fun, but they hurt. I have to fill up my spare time working just to keep my mind away from the negative thoughts. But the work is never of high quality, it's merely a distraction.

The pain comes and goes. But when it hits, it hits hard. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy for a day. Despite this, I still get those messages asking for help and I put my own pain aside for a bit to help them. I guess I look after other people more than I look after myself.",lonely,It hurts.,2021-05-14 17:10:25

I‚Äôve been feeling loneliness for as long as I can remember. It‚Äôs my least favorite feeling by far. As soon as I hit puberty the loneliness got worse, I felt like I was incomplete unless I was in a relationship. I was scared to be single, I was scared of the loneliness I would feel. Once I got to my early twenties I realized jumping from one toxic relationship to the next wasn‚Äôt doing anything to help my loneliness, I tried other things to fill the hole. I became a high functioning addict for 3 years, every day I was under the influence of something, it didn‚Äôt matter what, as long as I wasn‚Äôt able to feel lonely. It wasn‚Äôt just substances, I have also been addicted to pornography for most my pubescent life. After nearly dying several times and spending a few days in a mental hospital I realized drugs weren‚Äôt going to do anything but make things worse. So I got clean. Still lonely. I have friends who love me, family who loves me, but I still feel lonely to this day. Why can‚Äôt I just be content with how things are? I sleep cuddling my dogs every night, why do I feel like there is something missing unless there is a pretty girl sleeping next me? I know people say you have to learn to love yourself, and you have to know who you are before you can love yourself. I know who I am, and I‚Äôm happy with who I am.

Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôll never meet a person who will love me as much as I love my partners. I have a lot of experience with loss of loved ones and I feel it‚Äôs played a hand in the way I love so passionately. I would never wish what‚Äôs happened to me on anyone, but sometimes I just wish I had someone who understood how short life is and important love is and would love me with the passion I show the world but mostly them.

In posts like this, I always see advices for people to take care of themselves, self improve etc. That doesn't work for me. It doesn't make any fucking sense. I work out since I'm 20, can squat 2 times my bodyweight, know some jiu jitsu. I can play the guitar. I listen to people so well that I've had girls comment on how they were impressed about it. I work with theoretical physics and still understand philosophy and humanities in general, but I only talk about this with people I know that are interested. I can make people laugh, even though I don't speak a lot. Even being a PhD student, I have money enough to buy a house. I pay the bill in dates, treat girls well. I never lie to them, if anything, I'm honest. In the end, it's all for nothing.

Why the fuck should I make so much effort to be better just to be left alone forever? Why have money if I can't buy my girl a gift? Or be strong if there is none to protect?

I've tried many different things.  I've tried talking to people, adding them on social media, starting conversations etc. but it falls flat. People are never interested in me or reciprocate my efforts. I've never been chosen.  it has been a repeated pattern.

last thing that happened is I met this girl in my city and we have the same interests and we messaged alot but I was always putting more effort. then she ghosted me. and I met this other girl and shes exactly the same as me! we are interested in the same exact things and I feel like an excited puppy. but the conversation just stops.  I kept telling her we should plan to meet up and do something but I assumed because of covid people are going no where.

then I found out on social media that these two girls met each other very recently and hit it off and became really close and they posted pictures of themselves hanging out together. 

why did they not choose me? what was wrong with me that each of them (separately) decided that I was not worth the effort.

well, I've personally had enough of that bullshit.

i'm not specifically dealing with loneliness on an individual level. because let's face it, it's not all our fault, this is a societal-level problem, that needs societal-level answers, approaches and ideas. but i really would love insight from all you amazing folks that are comfortable enough to actually talk about your experiences, for this takes courage to chat about.

if any of you would be interested in talking with me, about this tender subject, then I really would appreciate it. all of that which you say will be kept \*in the strictest confidence\*. please, do not reveal anymore than you are comfortable with nevertheless.

I am currently in my final semester of my undergrad program. Spent 3 years of my university life with a group of friends but was closer with one of them (friend A) over the years. We were happy and always hang out together. In the last semester, friend A decided to leave me out on the friends group activities. She would hangout or have road trips with the group of friends but decided to not include me. She said it was nothing personal and its because they were all in the same undergrad program and got closer over the last semester (I am the only one in our friend group with the different undergrad program). This happened many times in the last semester and the other friends would not want to hang out with me either. I have never had a group of friends this close before and it was heartbreaking see my friends neglecting me and pushing me away. Feeling disappointed and quite angry, I decided to ignore them and move on. 

Now, its the last semester break and everyone is going back, I decided to put my feelings aside and wanted to get them each a graduation present. I went to friend A's hostel to give her the present and found out the others are there as well, hanging out in the common area. It was awkward seeing them there and giving them their presents. Surprisingly, they were very welcoming and invited me to stay and hang out for a bit to 'cherish this last time that we will be together'. I was hesitant to join them at first but I figured, nothing could go wrong right?

It was so uncomfortable there. They chatted among themselves and I did not know what to say. It was difficult to keep a nice conversation with them as they already had their own stories and jokes that I was not apart of previously. It was getting late and I went back feeling even lonelier than before. I have always been suicidal and this time I picked up a knife, pressed it onto my left wrist but wouldn't dare to cut myself.

2595,MrJGats,1620916135,1,"I have this feeling within me. It is a sad and lonely one, sometimes it turns to anger and despair. I do like to be around other people and I seek connection but I have no desire to speak. I have spoken to many people about my problems but the words never do justice to that which I try to communicate or solve.  
  
This feeling that I feel, cannot be directly experienced by others. I can use analogies but the listener can only image was is meant. I can name emotions but the listener can only understand my sadness and loneliness according to their experience of the emotions.  
  
And so what I try to communicate is lost in translation.  
  
I look in the eyes of others, feeling what I feel, thinking that words are inadequate. 
I stare at people and objects, unaware of what I‚Äôm gazing at, because my awareness is looking at this feeling. There is comfort in being present with this feeling. A sense of calm enters, I feel my breath rising and falling.  
  
I silently hope for someone to recognize my behavior, to make eye contact and immediately come to an understanding. Without words exchanged. Saying ‚ÄúI know how you feel.‚Äù would only prove that you do not. For you cannot directly know how I feel, just as I cannot directly know how you feel.  
  
Sometimes at night the sadness overwhelms me and I start crying intensely, but seconds after, I become aware of it. Within the blink of an eye I relax all the muscles in my face and stop crying. My expression from intense sadness to emptiness, as if it didn‚Äôt happen.  
  
I thought of the proverb ‚ÄúActions speak louder than words.‚Äù if this is true then surely the above mentioned display of emotion must be a clear signal to others that I am not okay.  
  
But if that is what is needed for people to notice, I hardly believe they understand what it is like, and without correct understanding you cannot provide the right help. So it leaves me no reason to perform such an action in public.  
  
For now I return my attention inwards, looking at this feeling and following the breath.

Loneliness[Loneliness Video Link](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA)

The background music in this video is soo good. Two years back I joined a new company. 6 months went by but I had zero friends. I ate my lunch alone, travelled alone for 4 hours every single day using public transport alone.

It sucked! I was surrounded by people who ate lunch with their friends, chatting, laughing and sharing about how their day went. I tried to make contact and friends with some of my colleagues but they pushed me away. It was really the worst of worst.

I remember listening to this video's background music while traveling 2 hours back to my home after an exhaustive day at work. Usually no seats will be available for me to sit so I have to stand in a heavily crowded bus for 2 hours.

Then I got friends. They were kind to me. We played online games together and it was soo great!

Then I don't know what happened people have started ignoring me for few months.
I reached out to my friend and asked her why there were no messages and why she is not even replying to my messages these days. She said everybody is busy and just move on with your life, don't think about it.
Another friend has blocked me. She even once left one group call without telling anyone because I started talking.

Everybody is breaking my heart for no reason for the past few months. Same happened to me in my college too.

I'm back to square. Listening to Loneliness soundtrack alone and crying.

2651,JJ_The_Strange,1620867605,1,"(For those who don‚Äôt know, very briefly a dakimakura is a body pillow with an anime character on it.)

My loneliness stems from more than just the pandemic.  Over the course of 2020, my cousin got married, two of my friends married each other, and on New Year‚Äôs my sister got engaged.  It wasn‚Äôt too bad, but it got relationships on my mind, and at this point I haven‚Äôt seen anyone romantically in a year and a half.  It doesn‚Äôt help that reading about most women‚Äôs experiences in relationships makes me wary about entering into one again.

But it was fine, I still had friends to chat with, and three of them were my roommates for the Fall semester.  Then my roommates all moved out at the beginning of the spring semester.  (One for mental health reasons, another wanted to be with her parents, and the third wanted to spend more time with her girlfriend.)  It‚Äôs hard to not take something like that personally, especially since only one of them told us ahead of time while the other two announced their decisions the day of.

My relationship with my family isn‚Äôt great either; they don‚Äôt respect my identity (AFAB non-binary), constantly put me down, and mock my life choices.  They also make fun of me a lot.  Family friends are pretty condescending as well.

There‚Äôs a number of people in my life that I have a pretty superficial relationship with, especially in the case of friends, where I‚Äôve tried to talk to them about my issues and I get judged or funny looks.  Getting close to people has hurt me more than helped me, and I hate that I have to keep them at arm‚Äôs length to protect myself; it‚Äôs lonely to live like that.

So, recently I bought a cover for my  body pillow with a character I like from my favorite anime.  Originally, it was only because I liked the character and sorta for the memes, but honestly?  It makes me smile when I see it, and cuddling with it helps me with my loneliness.  I sometimes treat it like a journal as well, just talking about my day, what‚Äôs been bothering me, and what‚Äôs on my mind.  I feel like I can talk to it without being judged, because it‚Äôs an inanimate object.  It brings me comfort when I need it to.  I know it‚Äôs not a replacement for human interaction, but it gives me a sense of connection and support I‚Äôve been missing.

Anyone else have similar experiences with dakimakuras?",lonely,"I feel self-conscious admitting this, but I recently got a dakimakura and it‚Äôs helped with my loneliness a lot.",2021-05-13 11:00:05

Its almost to a point I feel scared of actually doing anything sexual or having a romantic relationship because  im afraid of embarrassing myself and being rejected. 

In highschool I avoided guys completely, and now that I'm graduated I really have no way to connect with guys besides online with apps like Bumble or Tinder. The problem with this is it takes me a while to actually like the person enough to want to meet them (a lot of the men just want sex, and me being a virgin of course im not going to hook up with them), but once I'm to that stage im so anxious of them not liking me in person that I just avoid it entirely until they give up on pursuing me and we stop talking. Its a frustrating cycle that's entirely my fault. I feel like I'll be alone forever, or even turn into like, a female incel :'( I really wish my anxiety wasn't so bad.

Let me just start by saying this is something Im kind of scared of share, because I guess some people wont understand.

Im 21, never had a boyfriend or sex or even a real date, and for some reason that makes me so ashamed.

In August Im moving to a new country, on my own, and I plan on meeting a lot of people and I know these kind of games and questions about love life will appear and that frightens me, I dont want to be judged as ‚Äúthe saint‚Äù, ‚Äúthe boring‚Äù person out of the bat.

2669,Due_Minute,1620856108,1,"I wish I had more people to vent to talk and just talk about life with. I have only friend I can do that with and the rest usually get uncomfortable with me talking about things going on with me. Even with that one friend I feel awkward sharing and like I share/complain too much even though she has been supportive. Trusting people does not come easy to me at all but I still try. My roommate has her siblings and her parents to talk to which I get jealous of. I love my parents but my relationship with them is a little complicated as I'm trying to distance myself from them a little more. I can get by with not venting by distracting myself by going to the gym, playing games, etc.

However my biggest issue is not having people to do adventurous things with. Now this is how I felt precovid and still  do and covid definitely did not help. I came to uni (which is pretty antisocial since it's a commuter campus and I couldn't transfer due to a low gpa) hoping I could get some adventurous friends who wanted to do that and I haven't really found anyone and it's been 4 years. I've tried putting myself out there, joining clubs, talking to people in lectures, etc but still nothing. I have no problem with going alone; like going to restaurants alone, trying new things alone. but honestly I wish I had people to do adventurous things with, there's only so much you can do alone. for example, there's this aerial rope thing I want to go to which would be really fun with friends, but I barely have any adventurous friends (a lot of my ""friends"" (acquaintance friends) just wanna stay at home which I understand because everyone has their own comfort zone but frustrating for me who really likes going out, trying new things). but I guess fuck it, just keep doing those things alone... go camping alone, go to restaurants alone, go paintballing alone, go hiking alone. I've been dealt an unfortunate hand with my social anxiety/antisocial commuter campus/not being able to meet people (pre covid), I don't wanna put my life on hold waiting for people to come around.

For the last 10 days or so i have been hearing voices that claim to be angels and one very nasty voice which doesn't say who he is, I have suffered with hallucinations alot because of my mental illness but this is the first time they have claimed to be from god.

around 2 weeks ago i got out of the psychiatric ward after i had an episode but for the 3 weeks i was in there they had me on a very high dosage of clozapine. Now that i am back out and back down to 300mgs the voices started. Could the medicine somehow trigger how the angels/demons get through?

These ""angels"" are very convincing and even loving sometimes but they say that the reason i have this illness is for this moment because god has a ""mission"" for me. They say things like this is my purpose and is the reason god made me, They say every corner of my life has led to this very moment and i have to listen to the angry man.

Now i cannot do what he wants me to do because even though they say there will be no consequences because i will be protected by god, i really don't know if they are hallucinations anymore.

2716,Mello39Wright,1620816294,1,"Hi all. 25M, Italian.

My life has always been... Complicated. I've always been very lonely since school, because of a complicated relationship with my schoolmates.

I used to be overweight, then because of a not-corrsponded love, I lost 30 Kgs all in one go, becoming fit.
Years have passed since then. I have a decent job and I re-gained some weight (but not as much as in the past)

I... feel like a mess right now.
Despite doing some small improvements, especially because of the Job, I still notice, day by day, that I'm lonely and I'm INCREDIBLY used about it.

Like, it has become my daily routine. I live all by myself, I rarely go out because I don't really have friends to go out with. I spend most of my time by chatting with people I know only online by a decade or so.

Whenever I try some kind of new activity (in real life, that is), I feel like I'm forcing myself just for the sake of  ""improving"", or getting better socially speaking. But most of the time, I feel weird about it. I tried Acting, Dancing, Working Out, even nerdy things such as Table Games.
I have a really, REALLY hard time speaking or socializing with people I don't know. I try, and keep trying, telling myself that it will get better, but in the end, no friends have been made.

What especially drives me crazy, is the fact that I've never been in a love relationship. Which is directly connected to the fact of having little to no social life.
This hurts me, and drives me crazy and/or incredibly sad sometimes, especially because I know that it's not because I'm ugly, some people in the past did tell me I look cute (not a lot, but still). 

I know I shouldn't do it, or I shouldn't think about it, that's what everyone suggests me, but I can't help but think that the lack of social life or love relationship as the proof that I'm a complete failure. As if no one can find me likeable as a person.

That is confirmed by people such as my sis or my co-worker. I could be a nice looking guy on paper, but they tell me I don't love myself enough.

I tried to hear Psychiatristists and Psychologists, but speaking to them feels like we wouldn't get anywhere. I already tried to seek professional help years ago, but it mostly help me venting than anything else.

It feels like I'm so incredibly used to be alone, that I can't do anything about it. It's part of me and how I live daily.
Everyone went crazy because of the pandemic and the fact that ""you couldn't go out"", but to me, for this past year and a half, it feels like nothing changed.

I know it's dumb asking on the Internet, but I really need some suggestions.

I spoke with my therapist yesterday, and the call had to end as my session was over.  I found myself going on more than usual.  The past 3 weeks have been difficult.  I spoke to him about things that I had not mentioned to anyone or not mentioned to anyone in a long time.  It felt strange...I felt weird after the call.  An emptiness that just wants to be filled.

I spoke with him about the girl I fell for late last year, who called me a bad person, right before she cut me out.  I had not contacted her since December.  I miss her to no end.  I mentioned that I was thinking about sending her an email, just asking if we could talk.  As that would tell me the type of person she is and if I was just idealising her this entire time.  He actually said it was a good idea.  I felt good to know that something I felt and had been putting so much thought into for so long and not wanting to say something impulsive...had been validated.  Felt like I wouldn't be doing something wrong.  As I'm terrified of messing things up all the time...with everyone.

I seem to allow a few people to shape me...A few people who have said negative things about me.  I allow these things to dictate my behaviour.  Although most people say I'm a good person.  I hang onto the negative words by the few.  I wish I would not allow it all to get to me, but it continuously does.  Though...I'm a good person.  Good...I can't accept it.  I'm a bad person, with bad qualities.  It is like I enjoy getting hurt.  What I'm familiar with.  But...I want to feel good.

This void grows...Being stretched from every corner.  Trying to suck everything in.  Including more and more people in my never ending journey of...trying to get what I had.  I speak with more people than I ever did in any time in my life, but...the emptiness persist.  The void can only grow so big and be filled to an extent...as holes begin to show.  As I begin to tumble.  Into the the big crunch.  

I don't believe it's possible to save someone, but you can support them and guide them.  But why is it that I feel like I want to be saved.  I want my hand to be held and to be spoken for.  To be loved.  To be an equal.  I don't want to be saved.  I want to be allowed to remain broken and be accepted for all this darkness that I feel.  

Apparently though...This is too much.  I have to stay quiet and leave on this mask.  I can let a little out, but I must stay hidden in my corner...Where it's safe.  It's currently 5:03 AM.",lonely,I (32M) feel lonely and broken...but it's not safe to go out without my mask.,2021-05-12 19:04:11

Why did I have to be born to neglectful parents? Why did I have to be born different? I didn't ask to look this way, but here I am, and because of my looks I've been bullied and harassed all throughout my childhood and adolescence and never made any friends. Because of my neglectful half-assed self-centered piece of shit mother and absent father I've developed complex after complex and don't even know who I am.

I've been reading through the posts on here and I'm sat in floods of tears. I've related to so many of them, I honestly thought I was alone. 

However, it's nearly 4am here, I've not been to sleep yet, I've been crying for the last hour and I've made myself feel really sick. This is a daily/nightly occurrence for me and it makes me feel rubbish. 

I really do not have anybody to talk to when I'm feeling sad, or even just throughout the day when my mood is quite neutral. I have a loving boyfriend of 3 years who I'm so grateful for, but there's only so much he can listen for, he works very hard and when he comes home pretty much falls asleep straight away. I find myself constantly looking over at my phone hoping somebody will pop up and just say ""Hi!, how are you?"" But I've not had that for over 4-5 years now üò™ I've tried so so hard to make new friends, tried making friends with colleagues and they just don't invite me to things or leave me out even in discussions at work. I've tried joining sports groups, all of which welcomed me for the first couple of weeks (probably just to get their numbers up) then diddnt want to know me afterwards. I do have 2 ""best friends"" from school, however they're both living far away, living their own life, getting engaged, doing phDs etc but they never pop up to me, it's always me trying to speak to them, even then they don't reply. You know the sad part? I've even tried getting my boyfriends friends/friends partners to be friend by making them homemade cookies,brownies and cakes, in the hope they would drop me a message or want to talk to me...but no üòû. 

I would say I'm very shy but this is only making me worse, I've become a hell of a lot more socially awkward than I was, I tend to get bad social anxiety now due to the lack of 'going out' and doing stuff. 

I see groups of girls when driving to the supermarket having a good time in restaurants and bars, I even see it plastered all over social media, and I just get so so upset. I've got that bad sometimes I've seen it and had to return home because I couldn't stop crying. I'd even love to just spend time going out with my mum/or my cousin but my mums got a new partner and pretty much doesn't want to know me and my cousin has her own friends that she's met through her son being in school. As mentioned, I do have my boyfriend but he would much rather sit in, talk to his mates over text/inbox/group chat and have a few beers, we don't go out much, we don't do things together much...what is the point?. I basically, go to uni (well, it's all online at the moment) come home, make food, shower, bed...then don't go to sleep. 

I just wish I had people to talk too, I go all day without talking to people, I turn the TV on or just pop the radio on so I feel like somebody is talking to me. Is it just me?

As a product of divorce I never had any grand ideas about soul mates, but she told me to never get a boyfriend cause she's ""not ready."" She later said I shouldn't try or hope to find love cause she was extremely ""lucky"" when she found her new long term bf.

My earlier posts prove i have an unconventional relationship with my emotions but I feel numb now. Earlier I got diagnosed with an eating disorder, new mental illness, and apparently my kidneys might be a new problem for me.

The weirdest part is that im not mad. Though I still self loathe, I dont feel the need to self deprecated. I feel like I no longer have a teather. Im unworthy of romance and my mother thinks so. Its like I got the final affirmation that I was ment to walk this earth alone.

Im imagining a version of myself thats replaced all this longing for emotional fulfillment with bottomless ambition. Ive been working on a law degree and realestate to ""work on myself"" but I feel like my only love is my career.

I know im describing ""closing myself off,"" but opening up has been exhausted. Everytime I reach out for help i get ignored or misunderstood. Its cause vulnerability works for people with relatable issues. 

Thats why I loved/hate romance. Its a uniting force that seems so exclusive. If you don't speak the language then you get the opposite desired result.

If you die today will you go to Heaven? Why would anyone put off the most important decision they could ever make in their lives, concerning eternal life?  For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äînot by works, so that none can boast. EPHESIANS 2:8-9

THE APOSTLE PAUL TELLS US WHAT THE GOSPEL IS
Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. 1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4

A...
ADMIT THAT YOU‚ÄôRE A SINNER. This is where that godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out.

B...
BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was.

C...
CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.

2768,Timely-Tea-654,1620782976,1," I'm a college student. As of tomorrow, freshman year is officially over. It feels like it came and passed so quickly. I know that the pandemic really turned things on their head, but I can't help but look back and wonder what happened. I did *nothing*. I had two in-person classes, and the rest of my time was spent sitting in the dorm, studying, on Zoom, or just looking out the window. It sounds dumb but it was really, really lonely :(.

It sucks, because I came here to meet people. Yes, I'm here to learn, too, and to plan for a career. But, as a homeschooled kid that never had a life, I *really* wanted the social experience. My parents were wack abusive, and I left the house only a handful of times my entire life. I don't know any of the extended family, and I've gotten away from my parents now. I have no friends, siblings or family anywhere. I have no one. There's not a single person on this planet that knows who I am or cares.

It's not that I didn't try. I spent a lot of time trying to find and join clubs, but with the pandemic most just dissolved. I considered joining a club/recreational sport, but I was told not to bother since I had no experience and the kids here are pretty serious about it. I tried talking to people. I'm not great at it, but I tried. I was in dorm and class group chats, I tried leaving open invitations to hang out, and even asked a couple people directly that seemed nice. No one was interested.

I tried to tell myself that there are probably a lot of other people here that feel the same way, too. But I know it's just me. I'm in a small-ish dorm, and for the last two weekends I've been the only one here while everyone else was out doing things with their friends. The other night, the guys on my end of the hall were coming back, and brought with them some friends from another dorm. I was walking back to my dorm and waved, and after I'd gotten back inside someone asked who I was, which lead to the guys in my hall spending 10 minutes whispering, joking about me having no friends and trying to make some but not getting anywhere. I'm sure they didn't mean for me to hear it. They were obviously drunk. But it fucking hurt to hear that and then spend the rest of the night, alone, listening to everyone else having fun.

I'm scared that I've missed the boat. Everyone tells how important freshman year is to making friends. Next year, I'll be in the only single bedroom of a dorm on the other end of campus. We choose our dormmates, which means everyone else there will already be with their friends. It'll only make things harder. What if no one is interested in making new friends? Why would anyone want to talk to someone like me if they already have friends.

I don't know what to do. I'm awkward, but I don't think it's that noticeable. I've seen people here that are definitely more awkward than I am. Maybe I'm just boring. What if I'm just a bad friend? I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

I just wish I knew what was wrong with me, so I could do something about it. I know I could be a good friend if someone gave me the chance. I would do anything. I wish I knew what to do. I'd do absolutely anything. I don't want to be alone all the time. It hurts :'(. I feel lonely and exhausted and sad. I'm crying all the time now but I feel guilty because I know I'm incredibly lucky to be here. I can't sleep anymore. I have no one to talk to. When it gets really bad, it's almost feels like the flu. I know when it hurts particularly bad one day that I'll start feeling physical pain. I ache everywhere. I get headaches. I can't sleep but I can hardly pull myself out of bed. It feels awful.

I just hate myself. There's obviously something wrong with *me.* I don't know what it is, but whatever it is is getting in the way of me ever being happy. I'm worthless. I'm boring. I'm not good at anything. I'm unlikeable. My father used to tell me I was worthless. Or more often he'd just call me a pussy. I know he was only saying it to tear me apart. But I also realize he was right. I fuck everything up for myself, and I'm too stupid to realize where I went wrong.

I'm so fucking lonely and frustrated and angry and I don't know what to do about it. There's literally nothing I can do. I want to do something so bad. But I don't know what to do.",lonely,"Freshman year is over, and I made no friends :(",2021-05-12 11:29:36

2774,Qairq,1620781546,1,"Hi, everyone. I'm a 35 year old male who's social circle is quite small. Outside of my parents, I have two online friends with whom I do have a bond with. One in particular, was sort of my rock of Gibraltar, and I relied heavily on her my security and own well-being. We have been talking for around five years, with the last two years being pretty patchy. At once we talked everyday for long periods, but it has slowly waned to once or twice a week to very little conversation. It's been pretty hard on me mentally, because I really love to feel cared about by someone. I miss her texting me everyday and celebrating my highs with me as well as supporting me in my lows. Due to life changes, she doesn't really have much time for me anymore. I realize it was co-dependent of me and unhealthy, but I'm having trouble functioning in this new world without her being around all the time.   


I feel quite lonely and disheartened. I'm worried that I'll never meet someone like her again as I am getting older and it's harder to make friends or meet friends. I also don't know where to even being to look for new friends whether offline or online as I haven't had to in 5 years. My therapist told me that online friendships are kind of like that, as people change and want things that are more real or nearby. I've had this happen to me with two other women, my therapist believes that I'm trying to get aspects of a relationship with them (love, affection, attention), but without the actual romance which they won't wait around for forever.  


I guess I just want to vent because I'm really lonely and I haven't felt this bad in a long while, I lost my support beam and I feel like I'm back at step 0. I only seem to make a new friend online like every 3 or so years, so it bothers me to think this might be my normal for a while. It's like having cake then going back to eating peanut butter. Peanut butter is great but how can you be content with it when you've had cake? I think my goal for next year is to have more than 3 birthday wishes and to try and actually put myself out there as much as I can.

I barely interact with anyone, but more on that later. I've been to four apps already. They are cheats and scam you. You can't use like 90% of the features until you pay a ridiculous amount, like 40$ per month on the app I'm using, that only gives you one or two features. You still can't access the rest because you need to pay even more for some exclusive membership. Also, on the app I'm using, both people need to like each other. What if the person never sees me on the app? And I've tried meetups and all that stuff, to no avail.

These apps aren't designed to connect people. They're designed to make a profit, exclusively. Every other industry at least provides SOME service. None of the apps I've used have allowed me to date anyone, and I'm really bad with technology, so I'm even worse with them with how confusingly they're designed. They never admit what they are, they're scummy about it. The reason I'm lonely is because I don't know how or where to meet people. I'm gay and I've wanted a boyfriend for three years now, ever since I first discovered that I was gay (before I thought I was bisexual). I got my life mostly together and I'm working, going to school, etc., after a REALLY bad patch with psychosis in my late teens. I gave up with friends a while ago. I've tried groups, but most of the members are 2-3 decades older than me. I'm just lost. I finally built the courage to use dating apps and I don't even know how to connect with someone on them. A few people link to other social media and at first I didn't know why when they could just send a msg on the app. Now I know why they do.

Does anyone struggle with the fact that it's so hard to actually FIND people in our society? Or am I looking in the wrong places. I was told by multiple people that bars are not a good idea.

My friend/colleague got a promotion and has been slowly acting different to towards me. I switched jobs and realized that I will be so busy if I want to move up at this company. My higher ups have literally promised me a position at a certain time mark doing my role but the mental dedication would require me to cut everyone in my personal life off. 

I‚Äôve already ran a lot of women out of my life because I‚Äôm constantly stressed out about expectations. I still live at home because I‚Äôm too frugal to move out. I make good money for my age and area but people around here expect you to ‚Äúspend‚Äù on cars and housing to prove you have your shit together. Most of my friends know I still live at home and although they don‚Äôt treat me different, I can sense judgement. 

My financial situation is great, I have no debt (except a car note for a car I could pay off today) and I have hobbies. I‚Äôve had sex 10 times as a 21 year old. I miss the essence of companionship. It seems like when I date, my professional life falls off but the relationship is good. The fall off affects my romantic life then the girl walks out because I usually turn into a stressed out, paranoid and arrogant dick. 

At this point, I‚Äôve decided to sell my soul for the pursuit of money, hobbies and legacy (outside of having children) for the meantime. I‚Äôll try to date once I move out and get this promotion but yeah. The loneliness is terrible right now. I‚Äôm used to being around potheads, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù girls, and depressed friends.

I almost think I have no hope. Almost. Perhaps I don't deserve better than what I have. It doesn't feel like love, even though I so deeply crave it. Everytime I meet someone new, my heart eventually cracks again. It's a cursed cycle. Do I just expect too much despite my standards being so low. I believed in true love as a child, but now... Dead silence. I've dug my own grave.

There's nowhere to go from here. My heart hurts too much. It's tired. 

I want my heart to be filled with love me care. Can't you do that. For me. Honestly... I don't think we're meant to be. I'm just waiting for us to end. For you to finally walk away. I've never been a priority and never will be.

""I'm not gonna get dragged down into your problems."" So walk away. I don't have the heart to push you away. After you go, I'll have no one else. No one to even pretend that they care. Every good thing runs out eventually. Happiness is so unreliable.

Maybe happiness and love isn't something I should strive towards. But then what else do I have. This repetitive world offers me nothing else. And I don't have the heart to love myself. It's all so empty. Eventually the last straw keeping my sanity intact with break.

2791,DivyanshPanwari,1620769591,1,"Do ya ever feel so full of love but have no one to tell about it? Here's my story:

Todays been really weird. This whole thing stems from an act i did 2 months back- going on omegle. I'm a pretty shy dude. Don't have a lot of friends but i love and trust the ones i have with my life. I have periods of time when i feel lonely that day was one such. I went on Omegle cause i had no ine to talk to. I wanted to talk to someone who had a similar perspective to life and things. Couple tries in, I met a girl who was looking for some life advice. I said being true to yourself is the most important thing. Thought she was suffering from depression. But we soon found out that we had a lot in common (like a lot lot)We exchanged snaps. We had similar takes on 97% of the things we talked about. I felt great to finally have someone who could understand what i was feeling. We also have had similar life experiences, with her having been gone through a lot (*lot lot*). I genuinely liked talking to her every day. We'd spend at least an hour talking. We shared our life experiences. Had *almost fights. Her talking about suicide and self harm that traumatized me (and still does), me scolding her for having these thoughts in her head. 

After a while we confessed to each other that we both think of each other as their perfect person. We talked about dating life. About her one bad experience with dating her ex. My one sided crush, which lasted 5 years amounting to a heartbreak. Our stories of depression and self-doubt. How she made me try dating again, even when i told her I'm not stable enough to handle another heartbreak. 
Her suddenly going off the grid for a whilez causing me concern and finally make me call her, to check on her. She was saying that she needed some more time for studies as her competitive exam was really close. 
For all the times I've felt appreciated by her. For all the times I've felt understood in my life by someone. I couldn't help but falling for her. I restricted myself (still do). Finding excuses to stay detached. 'I have no romantic feelings for her' , 'I don't find her attractive', 'She's not ready for another relationship after her last', 'She wouldn't be able to handle you and your insecurities.' I repeat these to myself. To stay away from her. But her personality draws me closer everytime. It is true I'm not romantically interested in her.  But i still can't stop myself fallling for her. 
We haven't even met in real life. We haven't even seen other. We'd just had photos. She had shared some of her writings, which were so deep, it hit hard and i was crying the whole afternoon.
The night today is chilling. But i can't help this feeling.
For the first time in my life i wanted to show my love, but I have no one.
I don't want to fall for her. But all i have been thinking about these weeks is her. I hope its not too late for me. I convince myself as I think of us as 'we'.
I'm not one those who can write good, but tried. All because of a girl who texted me and I cried. I have been listening to her every song. I don't think i can keep this up for too long. 
I really hope soon enough my mind gets cleared. Today has been really weird. 

P.s. I'm not great at english. I don't even think this is good enough. But i was inspired by 'her'. I wrote what i felt on the top of my head. I just don't want hate please not on this post.",lonely,Full of love but no one to share it with,2021-05-12 07:46:31
2792,Imn0tgerman,1620769147,1,"I've done dumb stuff in my past. When I was 13 I have sent nudes to random people I met on Omegle. Not even because it would arouse me. I guess I did it for attention. 
So to speak, I have had a lot of contact with people on the internet. I did that stuff waaayy back, but later on I downloaded an  app where you can make friends online. It was very friendly and most people(there's always the exceptions, but you got to ignore those) were fun, and from my age and friendly. I managed to gain some online friends from that. (one of which I sometimes speak to. Not often). Then I managed to meet someone almost 10 years older than me. For some reason I kept talking to them and eventually it turned into a relationship. It lasted over half a year and I loved him a lot. I genuinely think he loved me back. I broke up with him because it just wouldn't work out with our futures. Plus, my family had found out and they didn't approve of it in the slightest, which I understand. 

I feel like an attention whore. How am I ever supposed to tell my future partner about my past, the people I talked to, that relationship and the pictures I have sent when I was way younger(i didn't send any weird pics in that relationship, however he had seen all pictures in my camera roll) I feel horrible. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. I have never even been able to really talk about it with my family. I hate that I made all these decisions and did all that and if there was a way I could change that and never have done that in the first place, I totally would.
(Right now I'm just waiting until time passes. Then I might be able to tell my future partner that i was young and dumb back then.)

It feels so dehumanizing being used as an emotional therapist only to be tossed aside the rare chance I open up. Many of my friends talk down to me like I know nothing yet always come to me when they need something. Although I struggle a lot socially I have no problems communicating how I feel.

I've been to church and done charity with them and again  the same thing, older people and no one my age, I'm not even religious but it did give me certain views.

I've tried youth groups, programs that kinda thing and sure I met people, had a couple of dates here and there but never had a long lasting friendship and none of them dates ever lead to a partner.

Then I started working harder, 40 to 90 hours a week for 5 years, working with the same people, with the new face coming and going, night to night, all older than me, all under my supervision so there was never a friendship going to be built  or not a real one.

I have hobbies, but nothing that's done in groups, I've tried to get into things and I'm now at a loss on how to even meet someone new? I have a plan to get back into volunteering, travel more and find something I like to do eventually find someone i like but it's hard, I'm fit but my bones ache from arthritis and at my age it's weird to even tell people I have it.

I am scared of dating again I'll say that, I don't want to go through the turmoil of being the only one in love for a 2nd time and sure we met through work but with my new job I won't be doing anything in the public like I was, no more hospital stays or out-of-town trips.

2823,RuffCriminal1997,1620749772,1,"Spoiler ahead. I'm the most boring dude you'll ever talk to.

I've only had two dreams all my life. One was to get a dog. Fortunately, I got one a couple of years ago. He's a two year old pomeranian now and is bunch of joy to be around! I can't strrerss how much he has been affecting me daily. He means the world to me!

And the second was to own a gaming PC. I live in India and things like this are considered a luxury here. So my parents never got one for me. I got out of college and started working full time in the november of 2020 and I saved up enough to get one myself. I got one a month ago and I'm having the best time gaming on it!

I feel like I'm at the best place place I could ever be in my life. I've never been more happier! Honestly, I wish time would stop at this moment. I'm either working, or spendiing time with my dog or gaming. It's all I could ever ask for! Except, I don't have anyone to share all of this with.

I'm a huge introvert and I only made a handful of friends so far. 3 to be precise. 1 of them started behaving toxically towards me at one point so I had to cut him off. And I recently found out that another of them doesn't give a rat's ass about me. And lastly, the third one got a boyfriend and just doesn't have time for me anymore. There's more to all of these stories here but this is pretty much how it went down with them. And my relationship wiht my parents isn't the best either. I never understood them and they didn't understand me. Or to better put it, they never made an effort to try and understand me. Again, there's more to this as well.

Ughh. I feel like I'm giving out an exam or something. Like every word of this might affect the people I connect with. Does that make sense? It does not? Am I thinking too much? English isn't my first language. Apologies.

Anyways, getting back to my interests, my music taste is what I find the hardest to describe. I'm very picky about the music I choose to listen. I think it would be best if I just put out my favourite track. I'm going with 'reptile's theme' by skrillex. 

I watch literally any kind of movies, web series, anime and hell I read a few manga too.

I'm a huge fan of sports. I play badminton and cricket a lot. Or atleast I used to until lockdown hit. 

I watch football(Most of the major leagues), Badminton, recently started watching F1, Cricket, Occasinally tennis too.

And as for gaming, I'm super into valorant right now. I also started playing sekiro. I still have to make up for 24 years of no gaming :D

I couldn't write out all I wanted to but I think I did pretty well. To any of you who read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and also, you gotta text me now. Come on. You gotta at this point.

And now suddenly she's not into the idea of committing yourself to one person for the rest of your life. Or maybe not suddenly. She says she always felt that but being with me didn't feel so trapping. But yeah, she's changed her mind again, I guess. It's fucked up because we opened our relationship months earlier to help with our long distance.

I got used to loneliness before I met her. It would depress me sure, but I handled it. I threw myself into my creative projects to keep me sane.

All I have been doing for months is work, go home, sit on the couch, and try to figure out why I hate myself so much. I just beat myself up constantly. I can't feel anything right now but excrutiating emotional pain. I've been silently weeping on and off for the last 24 hours. 

It was triggered by hearing about a crush I had getting engaged, and I started thinking about how it's been many years since I even had a relationship, and how my last two were terrible, and I just spiraled.

I feel cold, alone and completely miserable. I don't want to die, but I don't know how to make anything feel good again. I don't know how to feel like I'm good enough to be loved. I don't know how to not compare myself to others. All I can seem to do is repeatedly subject myself to intense emotional abuse from my inner critic. 

I don't know how much longer I can do this. I feel like I am going to go insane. I can't afford to pay the fees for therapy that people are asking for.

Friends who you put above yourself seem to let you hang with the first opportunity. Family seems to have formed their own closer, inner family without you being part of it. And everytime when a choice has to be made between family members and you, of course you matter last. Even to your own parents. 

2 months ago my boyfriend broke up with me (I‚Äòm 22F). The one person I thought I would finally be a priority for. He left me because he wants to go drinking every day. He told me I was the most important thing to him and then I get dumped because he puts everyday drinking over me. (I didn‚Äòt even want to stop him from drinking, it‚Äòs not like I stopped him from being with his friends. I‚Äòm just not worth any of his time.) 

I feel even lonelier than before. Because now I know how beautiful it can be when you think someone cares. But what‚Äòs the point if they don‚Äòt - and never really have - in the end. 

I couldn‚Äòt stay at my parents‚Äò house anymore so since 2 months I‚Äòm running away from my life. I‚Äòm sitting in another country at my aunts‚Äò. She has everything I want to achieve in life. A husband that loves and adores her. He‚Äòs working his ass off for them to build their dreamhouse. It‚Äôs in construction. They drove me there so I can see it. I broke down in tears. They have two beautiful children. The girl‚Äòs in 3rd grade and the boy will go to kindergarten this year. The fulfillment she‚Äòs feeling. How proud she can be for all of this. And then there‚Äòs me. I feel like an intruder. 

I thought we were going on a little family trip this weekend. My mother said she would come and we‚Äòll all drive somewhere. Well, my grandma had a stroke and is doing worse with every day. Since she lives far away in another country we made plans to drive there to visit her before it‚Äòs too late. I was looking foreward to this. 
But of course another cousin wants to come. Of course I am the one who doesn‚Äòt fit in the car anymore. My mother won‚Äòt come to take me. So I will be alone here at my aunts‚Äò while my family gets to go on ‚Äövacation‚Äò for two weeks. Gets to see my grandma one more time. 
I thought I would matter as my aunt took me in. But like I said, I‚Äòm an intruder. If there is a choice to be made, I just come last. I just wish I would be as important to people as they are to me.

2856,ElectronicTurn2965,1620715778,1,"I would like therapy but I do not want to ask because I just do not want to talk about it with my parents/family.

I speculate that I could have BDD but I can‚Äôt confirm it because I can‚Äôt get help. When I say that I can‚Äôt, I mean that I do not know how to ask b/c I do not want to talk to my parents about it.

I‚Äôve already talked to my mom about this multiple times before but she will tell me that ‚Äúwe all have insecurities and it happens to everyone‚Äù, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know why u think like that because if I had your body I wouldn‚Äôt care about anything‚Äù. But when I do feel somewhat decent about myself she sometimes ends up telling me what she doesn‚Äôt like about my hair/outfit, yells about me wearing earrings or says I am doing too much and more. 
 
 She always says ‚ÄúI can talk to her about anything‚Äù but that‚Äôs definitely not true. If I were to ask her, she would probably say I should be able to talk to her first and she would get mad at me if i told her otherwise. But that is me just making assumptions so i‚Äôm not sure. 

Ever so recently I broke down because I didn‚Äôt want to take pictures st my aunt‚Äôs party and either before or after that, she told me that i have to stop acting as if i am insecure because it is unattractive.

My dad isn‚Äôt an option AT ALL either b/c he lives in a different state and secondly he is just‚Ä¶ not the brightest person either. My mom told him about how I was feeling one time and he stated: ‚ÄúYou are not supposed to feel like that because I am not ugly and no one in this family is. I take offense to that because it‚Äôs like saying i‚Äôm ugly because we look the same.‚Äù (we look nothing alike, we literally have the same skin tone and that‚Äôs really it)

I didn‚Äôt go to sleep until 8am yesterday because i was crying the majority of the night. I ended up crying all day yesterday. and my head was in fucking pain all day and it has almost gotten to a point where the bottom of my eyes start to burn. Luckily, the skin underneath my eyes didn‚Äôt start to bleed and bruise like the last time. Btw it is the next day and my head still hurts from the other day.

I would also like to add that I daydream a lot. I am not sure if this is normal but sometimes I unintentionally start rambling to myself when I think of something that I wish was happening? Like a conversation with desired friends, desired life or something . I never realize it til moments after. Idk how to explain that I just thought it would be nice to add because it makes me feel much worse.

I‚Äôm only a 16 yr old girl and I just want to be happy with my body but I can‚Äôt b/c I have no one to trust. My teenage years are boring bc I do not have many friends and things to do. I try to take my mind off of it by practicing singing (i just started trying last week), drawing, watching videos and playing games but it still comes back to me when i walk into the bathroom. I thought about working out but I feel like i will end up getting addicted. Idk..I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôm writing this because I feel like I‚Äôm in a dead end in my life. During in person school I was constantly bullied. I got made fun of for my hair, the way I talked, the way I carried myself, literally the way I fucking walked lol. It felt like everyone was picking on me and saying ‚Äúhey fuck you man‚Äù. my parents didn‚Äôt seem to care, I had cut myself deep and the scars healed before they even noticed. I was crying myself to sleep with no one to talk too but myself. , no friends, girlfriend, none of that. I absolutely hated it. I had days at school when I cried in the bathroom on the 3rd floor to avoid people. I was so weak, so shitty and I hated it. I cut, I lit shit aflame, I popped pills, I fucking even sliced myself on a discord server for attention once. when my parents found out it was worse.

I stopped cutting after my parents threatened to admit me, and I still fear that. To make a long story short, I‚Äôve recently been feeling these shitty feelings again. I keep constantly thinking back to my exes and how I think I was used. For example, I dated two fucking 18 year olds when I was 13, and I somewhat feel used and sad.

Nothing less. The main thing that I do for my digital art is drawing people. I've drawn people who inspire me here and there so I drew her and posted it. She liked and followed me which made me really happy. Things start to get emotionally tricky from here. I discovered another artist online and I thought her art was pretty incredible too. She has a good amount of followers and shes done a ton of stuff for singers and stuff. There are even conspiracy theories on her.... anyways I decided to draw her.

2895,perfect-mirror1,1620700376,1,"To fall for a fiend,

To lose yourself amidst desire;

A shaking sense of loss. 


Loneliness has its ways

Capering down your spine 

Desperation screeches to get out. 


Always shunned, 

Alone within myself

No foundation for worth. 


Societal influence breaks your heart

Creates a grander sense of emptiness

Is love really there?


Reassurances to oneself

Love is nothing other than

A maladaptive cultural construct


Never wanted, never accepted

With no places to turn

No place to belong


It is not a lack of confidence;

A prideful fool am I. 

(Solomon shames me to my grave.)


An aching fear of those 

Who speak louder 

And with tongues of fire


Why fall for one of these?


A dashing man in his own right

But with no care behind 

Those liquid blue eyes


Stature and wealth straighten his back

Give him an impressive air

And a quick, easy smile


A certain future predestined and planned

Prepared since his birth

To become someone of influence


While I fall into the needled mire

Into the fantastical theories of love

Blinded and lost in witless notions 


To see him brandish his weaponry

Pistols in pictures and 

Rifles in rooms


Fear and dismay

First red flags

And still I fall


Arrogant and perfect,

Frightening and flawless,

A man all his own


No perfect match is he, 

Though I plummet through thick-walled ignorance,

Solitary, left to wonder


Is there anybody out there?",lonely,To Fall for a Fiend,2021-05-11 12:32:56

The first friend, well.... he just straight up blocked me. I'll admit that sometimes I go through periods where I don't have the energy to respond to everyone... he thought I was ignoring him. I swear I've explained to him many times I still want him in my life, just that constantly chatting every day isn't a realistic expectation for me.. and he said he understood... but he just left. And I guess I only have myself to blame because I knew he relied on me and that I was one of the few people helping him, he didn't have many other friends besides me..I should've been more responsive.

And the second friend.. he stopped messaging after I said that maybe we shouldn't speak anymore. I said this after he'd gotten angry at me for bringing up that I hoped he wouldn't make the same mistake with someone else as he did with me (basically led me on, convinced me to send inappropriate things because I thought he liked me). It was something I'd brought up before and he was mad because he didn't need me to keep reminding him. And he was right, I shouldn't have kept throwing that in his face..he was already regretting his actions. 

I definitely fucked these situations up, and it's on me.. I just can't help missing them both like hell. But at the same time, I feel like if I try to reconnect with them neither is going to want to talk to me. If they do, it probably won't be the same. And especially for the latter.. this is a guy I'd liked for a couple years who'd had me convinced we would be together.. there are still hurt feelings there, lots of emotional baggage. Still... him not being there as simply my friend is like a hallow feeling in my heart.

I don't know, I want them back in my life more than anything..but I realize that I'm more trouble than I'm worth to them most likely. It just really hurts being alone, but it hurts far more being alone with regrets and knowing you could've done differently to avoid the circumstances I guess is what I'm ultimately saying. Yeah, we don't need other people to be happy, but it sure as hell makes being happy a lot more difficult a goal to achieve when we're missing the few people that we cared a lot about.

2906,Yeetaroo,1620695243,1,"I‚Äôve never really had any friends or people I‚Äôm close to aside from relatives who I feel I have little in common with. This time two years ago I had been in a mentally abusive relationship with a woman I had only gotten with because we had (what I thought were) mutual friends and I didn‚Äôt want to lose that.

Fast forward a couple of months and I had kicked her out of my house finally and once again had no one to talk to. That is until I reconnected with someone who I was completely crazy about since I was 14. We started seeing each other whenever we could and when we weren‚Äôt together we were texting or calling and it felt amazing. It is also around this time that I found someone who I felt really close to as a friend. This was probably the happiest I‚Äôve ever been.

Although after we had been dating for a couple of months she would start to say really toxic things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll just hurt me in the end‚Äù ‚ÄúI would be an escort‚Äù ‚Äúi would fuck a woman but I would never date one‚Äù all of this made me feel like I could never be enough for her or Make her happy in any way. But all these worries would fall away when she said she loved me.

But all of this piled up and I don‚Äôt know why I said this to her I guess I just wanted her not to take me for granted or appreciate that I care about her. ‚ÄúMy life would be the same with or without you in it‚Äù a text I wish I had never sent because even though she knows I have a lot of issues and some anti existence values, even though I would constantly tell her that I loved her more than life itself she broke up with me.

So there I was alone except for one friend, I had a part time job and was working out so superficially things were ok but I felt dead inside.

Fast forward a couple of months and she texts me ‚Äúhi how are you doing?‚Äù And because I‚Äôm a stupid bastard I thought since she said she loves me this would at least make her a little loyal (especially since I never even looked at another women and despite being broken up for a while the thought of being with anyone else made my heart ache) so then we called and she told me she‚Äôd slept with someone else and tried to defend this with ‚ÄúI was drunk and can barely remember it‚Äù (she did this on a trip we were meant to go on together) so there I was once again heartbroken and on the comedown from various substances, a feeling I‚Äôm disgustingly used to.

Fast forward another couple months and she texts me again ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting on a guy rn but all I can think of is you, I‚Äôm sorry, we were so happy, etc‚Äù and because Im an idiot I went to see her and I bought her dinner and flowers and drinks, then we went back to hers because her mum wasn‚Äôt home and we did some unwholesome things and I declared my undying devotion and love to her, I told her I didn‚Äôt care about anything that has happened and that we can be together and happy again. After which she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you like that‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd feel the way I used to when I saw you but I didn‚Äôt‚Äù ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù then she made me leave the house before her mum got home and I had to walk literally across motor ways and forests CROSS COUNTY to get to a train station where I could get home from because the busses were down.

To make things worse my friend called me a bitch for going and seeing her and wouldn‚Äôt talk to me.

I felt so fucked up I started online dating and a girl from there said she loved me after a couple dates and we saw each other for a couple of months, but I broke it off because it didn‚Äôt feel the same. The first girl texted me again but I told her to fuck off because it was too much to deal with but I still miss her and I still feel empty inside.

My friend apologised but it‚Äôs not been the same and a part of me hates him because he‚Äôs always talking about how many friends he‚Äôs got, how much money he‚Äôs making, how many girls are after him and how much he works out.

So here I am, no real friends, no ability to interact with anyone socially apparently because whenever I go on a date they look at me like I‚Äôm a freak, an insomnia problem and not enough money to get off my face anymore.

Got in touch with some old friends I hadn't seen in a while and generally started feeling good. Then one day I just randomly started listening to the same music I listened to when things were bad and I felt... fine? But then something weird happened. I actually started to *miss* the pain I felt. 

I don't know why. In a way, it feels like the pain is all I have left of her and since I never even got a proper goodbye, it's all I'll ever have. I've started going to places we went together and just sitting there for hours, reliving the memories of a better days. I have a very hard time sleeping and recently she's just been in my thoughts daily. Yet I prefer it this way. Even though I am chronically sad and lack motivation to go anywhere or do anything, It's almost like I'd rather be sad *with* her than be happy *without* her.

2950,AwkwardRush,1620667143,1,"This makes me sound like an a**hole but I don't know where else to turn. 

I am struggling very much with feeling lonely. 

I'm a single mother who has been through a very traumatic experience with the father of my child assaulting me, going through a divorce etc. while dealing with mental illness on top of everything. 

Others, myself included are so sick of hearing about it. It makes me feel isolated and alone which is why I decided to seek help on here. 

A doctor was rude with me on the phone the other day and for once in my life I stood up for myself asking her why she was being so rude and why she had such a negative tone with me. She immediately changed her tone, said she was sorry and that it wasn't her intention to make me feel that way. I burst into tears as it was mother's day and I had received a nasty email from my child's father calling me every name in the book. I believe he had purposely waited for mother's day as he usually does on most holidays to try to upset me. It always works but I don't respond. Most people say to just block him but I choose to keep the messages in a folder to prove his character in court and human curiosity gets the best of me so I always check my spam where they go to. 

The doctor asked me to please not hang up and to tell her everything. She ended up being so sweet and we spoke for half an hour about my divorce, the trauma etc. 

Her advice was that in 6 months I would be feeling much better. She told me to try to be around people as much as possible as it would feed my depression to be alone. 

I can't stand any of my friends and family anymore. I find them to be unsupportive. I have two close friends who are great but they live far away.


I tried expressing the extent of my depression to a family member but he told me not to dump my problems on him.

My child has come into their terrible two's early. They are constantly whining no matter what I do to care for them it's not enough. It has made my nerves absolutely raw to where the sound of their cry/whine pumps anxiety through my entire body. 

I love my child so, so much which is why this bothers me because I have no negative feelings towards them. I think it's just that my nerves are shot and I have PTSD. 

Sorry for this post being so long.. a lot of it is babbling I'm aware. I feel invisible. Hoping to find some kind of support and advice on here as I cannot find it in my day to day life with those I know. I am currently awaiting a counselor and psychiatrist but it's taking so long and I'm losing hope. 

I feel like I have 4,000 lbs on my shoulders. Getting out of bed is so exhausting. I have bizarre dreams every night that leave me feeling as if I haven't slept and I cannot keep my house clean for the life of me. There is nothing dangerous around for my child to get into.. just dishes in the sink, clothes on the bedroom floor, crumbs all over the bed dishes on the dresser. I am not a messy person at heart. I look at them and think, just take it to the kitchen yet something inside of me rolls my eyes and says no. It's like I'm rebelling against myself. My mind is so clouded and I wonder if I will ever see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my crap. I just had to get it out. It's all I think about and I so desperately need a way out of this depression. I want to believe that life will not always be like this but I just don't.",lonely,Desperate for a way out,2021-05-11 03:19:03
2951,shyokarai,1620666747,1,"I am f20 and done with life. I only have 2 close friends and this is because 1) I've been shy since the day I was born, and 2) all the people I've ever loved where bad and I had to leave for the sake of my mental health.

When I was in high school I had a group of friends for 7 years. They ended up being very very toxic, so I left, and when I left, these friends bullied me for doing so. I got depressed and suicidal, I had to go to therapy and take pills. It was traumatic. It's been 5 years, but I don't think I've overcome depression and social anxiety yet. After high school I met other people, but I'm not good at making and keeping friends now, so they all leave or ignore my messages.

I have 2 friends and a boyfriend, but I still feel lonely. I only see my boyfriend once or twice a month because of COVID, college, and the distance. And my 2 friends are very outgoing, so I'm not their priority whatsoever.

I'm writing this because of what happened yesterday. I had to meet one of my friends, but I had to cancel the plans because my family got COVID. I told her why I canceled the plans and I still don't have a response. ""Are you okay?"", ""No problem, hope you're fine""... none of that, not even an ""OK"". She does this pretty often but why would she do that when I'm talking about my health? Would she care if I die? Does anyone actually care about me? And my other friend has also ignored my messages for days now (and other people that I had to meet too, pretty much everyone actually). I'm not just mad because they don't reply, I've been through a lot and this is just a tiny portion of my life. So, something can be trivial, but it still contributes to harm my self-esteem.

What I mean is: I've been depressed for 5 years, I'm done. I felt lonely since I was 9. Nothing has changed, in fact, it's actually worse now. I'm used to being alone, but that doesn't mean I like to be like this 24/7. COVID has made this worse because I can't go to college, so I don't see my colleagues. I don't talk with anybody, I don't go out, and I'm being ignored by my own friends.

So, I don't know what to do. I really want to escape and hide from society. I've wasted my teenage years and now my 20s because of this because I know it won't get better, so why am I still here?

2964,indi_rose,1620659642,1,"So I watched a video of a guy giving a speech and the title was ""WHY YOU WILL MARRY THE WRONG PERSON."" Basically he said that we learn what love is when we are children, from a parental love which includes being let down and at times humiliated from our parents, so when we go into romantic relationships later on in adult life, we tell ourselves that we're looking for a love that will make us happy, but what we're actually doing is looking for a love that is familiar. ie, one that will cause us some suffering. That's simplifying it, there was a lot more there to it, and I don't know if it's based on any science, but it was really interesting. And judging by how many people seem to be in unhappy relationships and how high the divorce rate is, he might just be onto something.

I don't think anyone completes us, but I have always had this really deep belief that I would meet someone and they would be funny and affectionate and kind and he would make me ridiculously happy. I never settled for less because I really believed this person was out there and that he would find me. It's not that I want someone who is perfect - I know that doesn't exist - but I want a huge, all-consuming, passionate love. Is that really too much to ask? Well, apparently it is. A lot of years later now, still single, and I've pretty much accepted I will be alone forever. I'm starting to see that type of love doesn't exist, and if it does, it's not going to find me so I need to stop dreaming about it.

2980,questkitty,1620650866,1,"Hey there!

I've temporarily moved into my best friend's home which is quite far from the city proper (where most of my other friends and SO live). I'm pretty much just here to save up some cash until I can finally afford a place of my own back in the city.

I haven't seen my partner in 2 months (going 3) due to this. On top of that, we've been put in a much stricter lockdown on our side of the planet due to a sudden spike in COVID cases. 

Basically, I can't leave home to visit him. 

I've tried so hard to stay positive, give him all my affection and love and warmth - but often times I just feel like he isn't trying hard enough. I know, of course, maintaining a relationship during such troubling times can be sooooo tiring. But somehow I feel like I barely cross his mind - not even once. 

I normally have to be the first to send him a message to strike a conversation, and his replies are usually so bland and boring that it makes me want to pull my hair in agitation. 

I do my best to put his feelings and needs first - because that was a mistake I had made during the earlier parts of our relationship. We've had our fair share of troubles.

*We broke up (apparently) in August. There was no verbal agreement that we did - but according to him, we were broken up, so I guess I just accepted it. I found out a month after that he had been talking to random girls on reddit  Most of  the conversations were sexual. The most painful part about it was he talked to them in a way he never did with me.* 

We patched things up and he apologised to me about it. 

But ever since then, this whole predicament has left a gaping hole in my heart - JUST AFTER I'VE HEALED FROM MY PAST TRAUMA. 

I looked up to him a lot - but somehow I just feel like he's a different person now. Just...someone I barely know. He told me that if I still wasn't ""okay"" with what he did, then maybe we should just end the relationship. Valid? Perhaps. But I guess that was a fair sign that this relationship doesn't really matter to him that much...

It's painful.

It's been more or less 5 months, and I still try my best... But the energy he's been giving me is so disappointing - he doesn't even do the bare minimum. 

It hurts me so much because I love this man terribly and I always dream of making things work between us. But how can it be possible when everything just feels so one sided? I often feel dismissed.

I've had days where I think about calling it off, but I always try my best to remain hopeful. That maybe one day, somehow, he'll start missing me. 

Am I stupid for doing so?

I'm INCREDIBLY, OVERWHELMINGLY, lonely. I am constantly yearning for love and affection, even if it's just behind monitors and phone screens. I just want to feel loved.

But I couldn't make myself move on like that when I knew there was a chance that once he worked through his trauma and various mental health issues, he'd realize he wanted me the way he said he did when he was drunk.

Seeing his name every day on Discord, him messaging me occasionally, it's been fucking me up emotionally a lot. I'm so lonely in general, it's hard not having any local friends, and having him ""there"", but not really was just too painful. I felt constantly rejected. I don't blame him at all, but I needed a break, and told him so today, asking him to get back in touch with me when he's decided on something (relationship, friendship, no contact, whatever - I just want to know what he really wants). And I'm pretty sure it hurt him, or bothered him, or something, because of the way he replied.

I'm going to reach out to people, going to try and be as social as I can, because I'm done making this mistake. Rejection happens, but I can't keep going on like this, isolated from other people. It messes up other areas of my life, and I let my anxiety hold me back from developing solid connections, so all I ever *know* is rejection.

It hurts so much though. I don't know if he'll actually get back to me. His last words to me were ""not really"". When I said I loved him, he didn't return it, despite telling me he loved me literally last night.

3025,ShiveringSkeleton,1620620514,1,"Throwaway account in case new roommates are on reddit.

I won't go into every detail, but I am about to move in (again) with another couple and beginning to feel really anxious and lonely about the situation. Every time I have been in a living situation in which I need roommates, I end up living with a couple and their pets because that is the best and quickest option at the time. And each time by the end of the lease I am emotionally exhausted and heartbroken. Obviously I see a bit of a pattern here, however each roommate situation has been slightly different but I always end up being the third wheel.

Basically, I have known each set of couples for a few years prior to moving in and we would always get along fine at first. Every single one of them have had pets, all of which I adored, but I have never been able to get a furry friend of my own because there is never enough room (or I found it too stressful of a situation to subject a pet to). So there I would be, without a pet, have never had a partner of my own, and constantly being forgotten and left out. Don't get me wrong, I want the couples to have time together and feel comfortable, so often times I found myself being secluded to do so. I would go out of my way to give them time alone, and that itself made me more lonely, but they are a couple and I am just me.

I have always been an independent person though, and I usually enjoy spending time alone. The years I have been able to live alone have been the best, but this newest couple I've know for a bit and we all randomly happened to want to move to the same place in Arizona. I am hoping it works out ok, but again, it's them and their handful of pets so I am afraid of the same third wheel feeling happening all over again. When we've hung out as friends before it has been fine, but after spending a weekend in New Orleans together, I have almost all but been left behind the past few days. Maybe it is all just in my head. 

If anything I guess I will still be able to start a new chapter, but not sure how to handle any of these lonely feelings that might arise. It doesn't help that I've only been in an emotionally abusive relationship and the only other person in which a relationship was blossoming passed away from health complications. I am just tired of having no one other than a few good friends, who are just that, good friends. I don't really even have family members to talk to or take an interest in my life.

3033,PizzaBoy2086,1620614547,1,"I've been feeling pretty shitty for a while now. I would like to blame it all on the quarantine but if I'm being honest to myself and everyone else I've been feeling like crap ever since high school graduation three years ago. That night it sort of hit me that whatever goals and aspirations I had for my life were too lofty or too meaningless compared to the goals of all those people I saw walking across that stage to get their diploma. In high school, I was coerced into taking AP courses and AP tests because it was what my older sister had done when she was there, and of course she had done exceptionally well in all her courses whereas I, a supposedly smart AP student, had to get tutors for courses that everyone else in my class seemed to breeze through. I had my moments to shine in English and history courses, but I fell flat in all the rest even though my aim was to go into STEM after graduation. My hopes rested on that, that I would be able to breeze through the sciences to achieve my career goals. By the end of high school, those goals were out of reach, made so by my abysmal scores in those courses. I want to stress that I had planned out my whole life around those goals, and now I was utterly lost. 

I decided to follow my sister's route, apply for a scholarship to our local community college. I was rejected, probably because it was the first interview for a scholarship I had ever been in and was extremely nervous. She got a full ride while I got to work 30-35 hours a week at minimum wage at a Little Caesar's (the raises stopped at $8.25, by the way, would not recommend). But I powered through. I still had no plan for my future, but at least I had work and school to distract me from that rather large enigma. Of course, I fared no better in college than I did in high school, and I had to delay my graduation by a semester because I failed a Calculus course. But the final semesters were pretty okay, and I had some classes that I actually enjoyed. Y'know, until Covid reared its ugly head. Those few classes I did enjoy were snuffed out by switching to online course curriculum, which left the classes a shadow of what they once were, and I learned absolutely nothing from them for the rest of the semester. It was around this time that my dad began pestering me about the next step in my life; now that I had an Associate's, what was the plan? There was none, and for the rest of the summer last year I hemmed and hawed trying to come up with a new goal that would satisfy him. I kicked the can down the road saying that I would take a few more courses at the school to get some credits under my belt for a bachelor's degree, as my newly found career idea was to become a history teacher, the inspiration for which came from my sister of all places. He seemed satisfied with that answer but once those classes are over, I would need to apply to colleges and look for better job opportunities as my current job won't cover the cost of a single semester of any four-year school in our area, let alone room and board at one further away. 

That being said, I did hold for a long time a great joy in my life, that being my book. I had written about 70 pages of the book itself and maybe 30 or 40 more pages of stuff related to the book. Me being the goddamned idiot I am, I kept all of this on a USB stick which I lost this winter. I had poured almost five years of work into it, and now it's probably sitting in a landfill somewhere in midwestern PA. It has been hard to cope with and find the energy and tenacity required to rewrite all those pages. I might as well be putting in as much effort trying to remember what I'd written as if I were writing a dissertation. If there were one thing I'd have done in my life that was worthy of remembrance, it would have been my book. 

Such as it is, these things have weighed heavily on me for some time. Tonight was a particularly hard night. I am plagued constantly by my thoughts, and even among friends I feel ashamed and lonely. I try to convince myself that if only I had an S.O. that my porn addiction might wear off and that a relationship would satisfy most of the needs in my life. Sadly, they aren't so much ""needs"" as they are desires. I should be thankful and grateful not to be in the situations so much of the world faces. But my thanks and gratitude are nothing, they do not fill a void. I am consistently pressured by my family and my church to espouse our beliefs from the rooftops and to act Christian to those who don't return the favor to me. But if I am genuine to myself, I cannot put on a face or a front of patient loving kindness and mercy. I believe it, but I cannot bring myself to act it out, hypocrite that I am. I live in sin yet I profess the word of God. I stopped asking for forgiveness a long time ago, because I found myself returning to God every night to repent. In my mind, I justify it in that asking for forgiveness usually means you'll try to change your ways. I've tried, God knows I've tried hundreds of times. But I Just. Can't. Stop. So I stopped repenting. And my guilt is all the heavier for it. 

I'm very sorry to anyone who forced themselves to read to the end. I tend to ramble and carry on with these things forever. I very much wish there were a way to stop myself from explaining my whole life story, but I wanted to explain why I felt the way I did, what caused myself to be in my present predicament.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's those that say ""Oh, but before you try to be around others you must first learn to be alone with yourself and to learn to love yourself"". This makes no sense to me, it's like saying ""if you are afraid your house might burn down, just burn it yourself""... defeats the purpose. Been alone for over a decade, had enough of it. Why should I go back and get better at being alone instead of reaching out and meeting ppl in the hopes that 1 day I will run into someone with who I have a mutual positive influence on each other. Why do ppl keep giving this advice? Seen it many times, even got it myself a few. If I've been eating carrot soup every day for 10 years and I finally say I had enough of it and look for other food, would it be not normal to be pissed and frustrated if others tell me ""the problem is not the soup, it's you, you have to learn to enjoy your soup"". Why?!?! the more I kep at it the worse it will get! Well shit, if I enjoyed being alone why would I look for others? And if I didn't, why would I try to force myself to get used to it when it's not the only option? Why force myself to learn to endure something I hate or is causing me pain, on myself, if I don't absolutely have to? It's like being advised to adopt toxic thinking and to some degree, self harm!

I understand I'm quite off the rails and would take ages to actually find someone I get along with and also not feel lonelier while being around. But is this a mirage? As I tend to feel that someone spending time with me, would be better of around other that would be a better influence and better company overall. So eventually the guilt of having a negative impact/wasting someone's life(time) would make it impossible to get along even with someone that would be a theoretical perfect match? But I'm ok with who and what I am and learned to accept it a long time ago, so this should not be an issue, right? Yet it still is... I can learn to ignore it or live with it. It will be there forever though, ain't it? Is this what ppl talk about when they say ""a true friendship is 60%-40% where both try to contribute 60%""?

3082,chickenlessb0ne,1620590858,1,"Hello all. Just want to start off by saying if you‚Äôre lonely, you‚Äôre not alone. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. Billions of people across the globe feel the same way. Study after study shows that with an increase in our reliance on technology, especially with the pandemic, there‚Äôs an increase in individuals experiencing loneliness. Many of you may actually enjoy being alone like me! You come home, make some food, take a seat, boot up that PS4/pick up that guitar/turn on the TV, rain begins coming down slowly, and with no work tomorrow you get to chill all by yourself. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling... until you do this, over and over again, and the feelings every human experiences of being in a tribe/community/relationship (that word can hurt) begins to kick in and you realize that being alone doesn‚Äôt actually make you...happy. Believe me, I‚Äôve experienced this for YEARS, and it‚Äôs a long, painful process to make friends, find outgoing hobbies, meet people and create adventures, but it‚Äôs entirely do-able. Here‚Äôs what I suggest so you don‚Äôt make the same mistakes I did. 

1- Workout 
-I know it‚Äôs not easy, especially in a pandemic but I can‚Äôt even begin to explain all the benefits to working out. It‚Äôs sounds dumb, but it makes you happier, more confident, obviously better looking, and fills you with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I recommend creating a goal for yourself and sticking with a training plan. I became very passionate about running and it was super awesome. Although you won‚Äôt begin to see the results for a while, the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll want to keep going back. 

2- Try Bumble friends/Facebook groups 
-You don‚Äôt even need to find friends naturally anymore, you can quite literally meet people through the internet now. Some of the best in-person friends that I‚Äôve made were through social media/apps. When it comes to dating apps, I‚Äôd wait until you made some friends first. Having a social circle is the most basic building block of not being lonely. Relationships will come in time, and if they don‚Äôt work out you have friends to fall back on. 

3- Try and find new hobbies 
-Having new and interesting hobbies (even ones that you do alone) will really help create an interesting you. For me, it was bread-making, cooking, guitar playing, painting, finding a hiking/biking Facebook group, and joining a community service group. Also, journaling really helps put thoughts down on paper to clear your mind. Shoot your shot at tons of different hobbies and I guarantee a few will stick long term. 

4- Be as nice as possible to anyone and everyone you meet 
-This is for those who have social anxiety/are socially awkward. Not only does a smile make people instantly like you more and want to keep you around, you will quite literally make yourself happy. Yes, it maybe putting on a face, but do it until it becomes your actual face. 

5- Read ‚ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence people‚Äù by Dale Carnegie
-For me, it‚Äôs essentially the ultimate tactical book for dealing with people, and it kinda changed my life. Meeting new people and not being lonely means you need to understand people. You‚Äôve spent years understanding yourself, now it‚Äôs time you understand everyone else. 

6- ‚ÄúIf it makes you nervous, do it‚Äù
-Walking into the gym makes you feel intimidated? Do it anyway. Hopping on Tinder makes you feel nervous and more lonely? Do it anyway (but don‚Äôt binge). Don‚Äôt even want to get out of bed??? Do it anyway. Trying the things you hate the most will open up more doors than you thought possible. Breaking out of your comfort zone means putting yourself in positions of being uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs super exciting. Life, for me at least, was meant to be an adventure, not a day to day drone of things that aren‚Äôt exciting. 

I don‚Äôt want to come off as some motivational speaker, but PLEASE understand that it‚Äôs NEVER too late, even if you‚Äôre 45-50 years old, you can still get the fuck out there and change your life, because I did and I feel great. 5 years ago I was lurking hard on this subreddit, and now I‚Äôm happier than ever. Sure, sometimes I don‚Äôt even want to get out of bed, and I‚Äôve gotten my heart broken more times that I can count, but it‚Äôs definitely allot more adventurous than living my life though a fucking screen. I implore you, please try everything I said earlier. When it comes to burnout, of course try everything in moderation. There will be some days you don‚Äôt want to get up, or you continue to feel lonely MONTHS after trying new things. The time will come, I know it because it happened to me. A year in to rebuilding myself, I still spent Friday nights alone. Trust the process and take this as an adventure, like a quest in some kind of video game, and get out there and start living life. That one friend you make can turn into 3, 4, 8, and eventually a whole circle of amigos to hang with. If you‚Äôre looking for a relationship, never stop looking. Love can be around every corner, you just have to have the strength to reach every corner. Please remember confidence is key, you will get your heart broken but it‚Äôs better than never even trying.

This is your life, now fight for it. Whatever YouTube video, book, quote, saying, motivational whatever the fuck gets you up and moving, use it. For me, it was Man of Steel (the movie). It took me 5 YEARS to build myself from a chubby 17 year old depressed kid who played 8+ hours of games a day to a 22 year old guy who genuinely enjoys life. I didn‚Äôt hold a girls hand until I was 21, and that‚Äôs OK! I never even thought that I would even be able to TALK to girls, and now I do on a daily basis, and YOU CAN TOO (or dudes if that‚Äôs your thing). 

I hope this message finds you well. Just understand that what you maybe going through right now is just a low point in your life, and the highs have yet to come. Build yourself day in and day out, and your future you will thank the present you, because I currently thank the past me for going through all his trials and tribulations, and to have the strength to get out of bed and stop staring at a screen.

It's been over 4 years now since I've lost my friend group that I've been so close with ( we hung out every day and done everything together). It's still very painful and I'm still scared and get anxiety to face them. 

We were right before graduating when shit hit the fan. My best friend was in love with this girl and so was I but I actually had no idea. Long story short he got messed up in the head cuz of this girl who was also part of our group and clearly was madly in love ( she took his virginity). 

One day when I was wasted I've got with her and we had sex. The next day I felt so bad about it since my best friend was madly in love with her. However the sex was sooo good, probably even better since it was forbidden. We kept having sex behind everyone's back for a couple of months. Until one day when we were drunk he found out. I apologised but he wouldn't listen, I even told him to punch me but he wouldn't. I was so sad, upset and ashamed that I've done it and could barely live with my self. 

In the next 2 weeks I still kept seeing her and he knew about it. Then one night he wanted to meet up to talk so we did. However he just beat the living crap out of me. He left and my mom found me almost unconscious. She brought me to the hospital, but I was fine just a few bumps and scratches nothing serious. 

In my opinion the whole thing was fine now, I got with the girl he loved and therefore he beat me up. I would have done the same if I was in his position. I kept seeing her because at it turned out I loved her as well and finally I was happy! Most of my friends stopped talking to me however  some still talked to me and understood. 

3 days later I came back home to find my mom, sisters and dad waiting for me. They sat me down and tried talking me into going to the police to report him. I stood my ground and told them no way in hell I will do that as I knew how bad things are gonna turn. However they kept trying and trying until finally I gave in. I then went on to report him for which I to this day hate myself for. Since I don't believe what he's done was wrong and also having to report my best friend is just horrible. 

Obviously it completely backfired and all of my mates turned on me, I mean who wouldn't. I even had more of my mates threaten me to beat me up as well for going to the cops. As I live in a small town this story spread rapidly and I was even more ashamed. I developed anxiety for doing the simplest things such as going to the gym, grocery store, gas station, even getting pizza delivered cuz that person might know and spit in my pizza. (Thats messed up ain't it?)

 I've started travelling and moved away but to this day when I'm back visiting my family I still can't go fill up my gas without feeling anxiety and fear. I can't evengo grocery shopping without being scared. Usually I avoid any places where I could possibly meet my old mates or class mates or even anyone who's in my age group. It's a horrible feeling and it destroys me. I need to get rid of that anxiety and fear but I don't know how. 

By now I hate my family for basically forcing me to report this to the police. If they hadn't done that my life would be a lot nicer now. They forced me and then left me to deal with it. I can't understand how that is fair. Any time I try to talk to my mom about it she jtst says: ""you have to report this because it's wrong. If you like it or not"". She just doesn't understand what impact this had on me and my life. And how much anxiety and fear this has given me. Even while I seemed happy for being with my girl I was still deeply depressed inside. Losing my best friend has been the hardest thing in my life.

To this day I've never spoken to my former best friend and anyone else out of this friend group. Its still very hard for me to make new friends and even be happy. I also keep thinking back to this time in my life and still feel the shame, anxiety and fear.

This deep melancholy and a feeling that I'm truly alone even though I'm with my close family. It gets worse when my mom starts to complain that I'm not smiling or talking much or whatever.

With social anxiety, being among people never was my priority in the first place but pandemic really showed me how important it is to interact with other people. 

I have been working from home since last year and spend majority of my time at home, on my own. I live in UK so we had pretty strict lockdowns, and in retrospective the whole situation changed how I feel like about life as I think many other people do too.

May 8th, 2021
I met him yesterday. It could have been earlier, had I applied to that job. Of course, they required two more years of customer servicing that I never could have fulfilled in the six months before they opened. Still, a part of me wanted to say ‚ÄúFuck it!‚Äù, and apply anyway, but I never did.

His eyelashes were so long and beautiful. I considered telling him telling him that, but for some inexplicable reason, the thought was tossed away and disregarded, so I simply thanked him for selling me my joints. When I flashed my debit card he asked me what I thought of my bank. I resorted to hating it, because that's who I was in that moment. I liked doing that. I turned into a caricature of myself; taking a strong stance about something and playing it up. It's like a little conversation game, a little bait, to see if the other person bites. Keeps things interesting.
He did bite, and we talked about how shitty our mutual bank was for a few minutes. This was one of those moments where my adult life was beginning to cement and I could feel it hardening with every word. I‚Äôm turning 21, and now I'm talking about how shitty the credit union I was signed up for by my mom when I was 11 is. What‚Äôs next, dunking on the awful state of the roads we drive on? The price of meat at Costco is a solid contender as well. 
As someone who works with customers every single day, I can tell when somebody is customer servicing me, or just being themselves. In this instance, it truly felt like we connected as two individuals. Truthfully, it didn't occur to me until on my way home, that there was even a chance that he was just customer servicing me and enjoying it. These types of people are near invincible, and should be regarded as psychopaths.
Now, I used to be very friendly to people in public spaces. Very accomodating to the chatty people on the bus. I could probably write a Bus Excerpts from my life, which would ALSO be a love excerpt if I'm being honest. But then, in the last stretch of the pandemic, I regressed. I no longer invite or facilitate these kinds of interactions, and I have purposefully drifted away from socializing with even the closest people in my life. But that‚Äôs not the focus here.
As we were chatting in this tiny apple-store-esque smoke shop, to my own reluctance I was slowly backing out, turning away, rocking on my feet, until eventually I inched out the door with a meak ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù. And I didn't have any thoughts about it again.
Until I was across the street and about 60 steps away. ‚ÄòI should have asked for his number!‚Äô Ten more feet away‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI would never have asked for his number.‚Äô And thus my guilt dissolved. I'm not the type of person who asks for other people's numbers. That is incredibly, momentarily, vulnerable. So I told myself I would visit the store and try again. I realized I had forgotten to buy my usual 10 pack for the week anyway. And what, exactly, was I even ‚Äútrying again‚Äù? If you had asked me right after the thought, I wouldn‚Äôt have had an answer. I just knew that I needed to try.
I was, give or take, 100 feet away from my house. Absolutely winded from the climb, and a little irritable now. The last part of the journey always ends like this. I have this little set of rules for myself too. I‚Äôll spare the details, bar this important one; Never be the first person to stop and rest. I knew there was a person on their bike trailing up the path behind me, so naturally I knew I had to flex on them by showing them how in shape I was. I don‚Äôt smoke every single day, look at me go, I‚Äôm never absolutely winded from that two minute uphill trail. Good job, me. 
I was doing great, less than 100 feet from my house now, when the person on the bike swerves up in front of me and yells, ""Hey! I think I just sold you weed!""
I let out an honest ‚ÄúHA!‚Äù and I can‚Äôt help but grin. He laughs too, and somehow we slip right back into conversation. Much like the shitty bank, there was nothing special about the topic. But I felt us connect again. It was so easy, so uncaring and so, so vulnerable. It was like we both couldn't help but be anyone but ourselves. My cursed brain finally relieved from the thought of how much I wanted to see him again. Less than 30 seconds later, I got to the front of my house and said, ""Well, good luck riding up the rest of the mountain."" 
He gave me a shy smile and replied, ""Right, I'll leave you alone now."" Instantly I felt a pang of guilt in my chest.
I was already turned and had taken a few steps up my drive way, when I heard him say, ""Oh! You live right here."" I gave him an awkward smile. ""Yeah, I- Yeah. It was nice meeting you."" 
And as if I had imagined this entire interaction, he was gone. In all likelihood, he didn't think much of this interaction. Maybe a little, ‚ÄòWow, such a small world!‚Äô incredulousness, but nowhere near as monumental as whatever was going on with my brain. Or, maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I dojn‚Äôt think the emotions behind either of our motivations mean much of anything in this moment.
If I‚Äôm being honest with myself, I couldn't help but project my own disappointment onto him. That split second moment where I left him feeling awkward - or unwanted- I recognize like it were my own reflection. He told me just how far away I had drifted from myself. I needed to let Bike Boy know that I can be vulnerable, that I love other people wholeheartedly and unconditionally. I needed to try.
Saturday morning was perfect. I woke up at 6am, loved the fact that I could sleep in more than I loved sleep itself, and reveled in that until about 10am. I needed an outfit conversation worthy, I needed to smell great, and I absolutely needed to be myself. Which meant no writing down conversation beforehand, no self conscious actions, and no expectations. Notice I said self conscious actions, and not thoughts, because that is a ridiculous demand if you are someone like me.
If this guy was working today, I had no doubt in my mind I was going to reel him in. The weird part was that I was being myself, presentation and all, but I felt like I was watching it happen. Like a director crafting each and every movement of an actor on set. Didn‚Äôt matter, helped with my confidence anyhow. 
Each step towards the goal was invigorating, I would even describe it as beautiful (I swear I wasn‚Äôt high). No hero‚Äôs journey can be complete without conflict and as usual mine consisted of man versus self. I wish I could say that the near panic attack in the coffee shop was eye opening. But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a force on this planet that can crush my hope when it comes to romance. 
I wish I could say I ran into him on my way there because, damn, what a story that would make. But it was just a peaceful, sunny walk. I had been listening to music that was in hilarious contrast with my personality, and my style, but it made me feel like I was someone important. That‚Äôs a good tip if you‚Äôre someone like me; listen to music that makes you feel like the main character from a slice-of-life movie. 
The door to the tiny shop was opened, I slide into the room and around the wall blocking my view from the counter‚Ä¶ and there sat a short, adorable blonde girl smiling down at her phone. I greeted her kindly, and swallowed the bundle of social anxiety nerves I felt rise in my throat. It wasn't until I left the store that I felt the disappointment. Even after I had told myself not to be, and to just enjoy the act of doing this in the first place, I definitely knew how this particular ending would turn out for me. The thing about my pitfalls, though, is that most of them come with hope, as well. It is maybe my most unfounded, illogical feeling, but I think that's the point of hope. So really, I don‚Äôt think there is such thing as a ‚Äúhopeless romantic‚Äù. All love is intertwined with hope. Not in the way that, like, you have hope in seeing the person again, or having hope that they‚Äôll fall in love with you, but moreso that loving them (even against your own will) is an act of hope. Your body, your brain chemicals, they have that shit built in whether you like it or not. It‚Äôs annoying and it makes you do dumb shit, but sometimes that dumb shit works out. Sometimes it does not.
The closer I got home, the more I wanted to wait for him. I had to sit somewhere he couldn't miss me if he were going to work, or even just into town. I don't think I've ever been happier to live in such a small place. And, yes, I realize how weird and creepy this was. It was romantic to a desperate and lonely mind. There's a two-lane road in a school zone that leads towards the way into the biggest part of town. Perfect. This is ridiculous. 
But it was the only way to repent for betraying myself. I still don‚Äôt fully feel like I want to be so open again, but I know it‚Äôs so much more natural to me than whatever I am doing now. It's the only chance I have to let this guy know I think of him as a person. I see him and I've thought about him. I want to be vulnerable, with everybody. I want everyone to be able to bear witness to my self and to judge me. I want them to know that I am my own internal source of power and no external value can be my fuel (Okay, now I was high). So I wait for him. 
It's cloudy and windy now. But the sun will also shine through occasionally. Sometimes tiny leaves blow into my face but it doesn't bother me enough to move. I sat there, writing all of this down and occasionally smoking a joint, until I can bring myself to look at the time. 1:32p.m. I don't remember what time I sat down, but I left my house around eleven this morning. I‚Äôm not even disheartened by my efforts though. Whether I sat down to see Bike Boy again, or if I sat down for a different reason, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I just sat on wet grass, for like, 2 and a half hours on a Saturday by myself. It was time to head home. I could always try again when I run out of smokes.

When I think of Bike Boy now, I can see what he represents. I said he was a reflection of myself and that still rings true. But he is an example of how my past relationships have failed, of my own wrongdoings and miscalculated steps. I have a lot of thinking to get done, most of it too raw to share, but thank you for reading this far.",lonely,"Waiting for Bike Boy, a lonely love excerpt",2021-05-10 02:02:19

I still have friends but they're all online. It's not really the same as having someone to spend time with. This is barely worth adding, but I had a long term relationship end last year too. That was easy compared to anyone dying. But still, just one more reason I'm alone.

We used to talk like everyday about random stuff with efforts and talking to her becomes so easy that I used to tell her literally everything and she did the same. We usually used to fight too but I was just normal until one day we got into a really serious fight and I fucked up so bad that she left me. No it was not related to relationship it was just random. She blocked me from everywhere literally. I tried to contact her somehow but she refused to talk. She said she don't care anymore and I should stop caring too.

Fun thing, I had my 18th birthday party together with him and another guy. We all invited the same number of people, but no one came to celebrate my birthday. So I sat in a dark corner, drinking beer alone for six hours straight. I have no grudge though, actually I'm glad they enjoyed it so it wasn't a complete failure. Still, then I realized how bad the situation was.

I once had a girlfriend. That is, until I found out she's been cheating on me. After she dumped me(!), she would keep sending me vids I don't want to remember - every other day.

I don't trust my own shadow now and my self-esteem doesn't exist. I'm probably socially disabled now.

Every day I wake up and check my phone just to read some covid headlines, work 8 hours from home office and then stare at empty walls till I fall asleep at 3 AM.

I am a 20 years old guy living in a village in India.My life has been devastated since i finished high school. Last 4 years i have been living at home.i have a very abusive parents and I am trying to move out but I can't afford it. But one day I'll go away from this shitty country, i am working on it

But i don't think I'll ever be able to feel normal due to mental damage I'm having by witnessing how everyone is enjoying their life and I'm wasting my youth &amp; I'm hated even though i don't deserve it.

Being a indian its very difficult to find someone to talk but I still have made some friends online over the years but none of them lasted. 

I see every Reddit post by girls have a warning line for creeps. I have always been nice to people but still nobody is really Interested in a long term conversation with me. It's a curse being a male &amp; Indian and poor. I don't think i have a boring personality but I'm just exhausted to explain people that I'm not a creep to change their suspiciousness to good.

I want a relationship so bad but i can't do anything about it in my current situation but I don't want a online or long distance relationship either. I know i am capable of having a relationship but I'm not in right place now.

I want to have sex too &amp; i got a sex drive of a rabbit lol but i don't spend my days Watching porn or bashing the bishop. I mostly study, that's the best thing i can do to change my life. In my free time i read books everyday, i play cod mobile or watch the clone wars series.

So you know i am not going to bombard your inbox with nasty messages.I just want to talk to someone with depth of character, a meaningful long term with whom i can meet someday Hopefully. If you can respect me as a human and show equal interest in a conversation I'm going to return the favour. I'll be so happy if anyone is willing to talk to me.

I was stuck in jobs I never came into liking. Heck, never liked what I graduated because I was forced into it by my father. So many years have passed, 28 now, an opportunity came offered by gf's parents to go over and slowly takeover their small business. It's a pretty good gig on the surface and I kinda like the slightly less modernized, cluttered area of the country too.

But recently I kept fighting with my gf, she's over expecting me in every single way while tbh she's not doing that well (imo), meanwhile I kept running around not even doing anything for myself helping them on and off work. During the first year I genuinely felt she lifted my loneliness away. However, I noticed she changed when we got into the 3rd year, less lovely, less considerate. She doesn't believe in depression those sort of things. The family also have the mentality of doing whatever they wish to, in their minds they are correct, others are wrong. For example, they kept talking about how bad covid is, but not even doing any social distancing or wearing mask when talking face to face. When i voice out, they just didn't care. Even worse when they have a person of higher risk at home. Worst, the mother doesn't even register for vaccine.

We kept fighting, that made me feel alone eventho I actually have a girlfriend. My family and close friends are 7 hours away from driving, and we are in lock down mode, making visit alot harder.

My mother has my father, my father has my mother, my little sister has dear friends, all my older stepsisters are on a healthy couple relationship, all my cousins have dear friends, my classmates walk with someone very often unlike me, who has no one.
Looking at everyone having fun with others and their friends and all that stuff, makes me kind of glad and happy for them that they probably wouldn't have to go though this and that they have somebody to live for but the thought about thinking if I'll ever be like the people I see or if I'll ever have someone that would care about me as much I would care for them just completely overshadows that.

When I turned to people in the past, their immediate response was to get professional help. While I agree that I do need to talk to a professional, I feel like it is a way for everyone to dismiss me. Is there no benefit in talking to someone that isn't a professional anymore? Can't I build a support system independent from a professional too? I feel like my ‚Äúsupport system‚Äù has pushed me so far away by not hearing me out. This has resulted in me feeling very recluse and alone.

3165,New-Witness3885,1620545621,1,"TW: may have talk about suicide, and abuse.

i miss my old life really bad, i miss my old friends, my house, basically everything about it. 
i used to live in a capital city. it was very famous and popular, but i didn‚Äôt like it, but i miss my life there. basically my whole life i‚Äôve been moving back and forth to specific cities and. it sucks. i lived in the capital for a long time, around 6 years in total (9 if you include the times i stayed there when i was young before being raised for a few years in england and moving back) and some friends, moved to a city and lived in my grandmas for a year, made friends, moved back, stayed for two years, got stuck in my grandmas house for a few months during the beginning of covid. then moved there, this time permanently. got an apartment, lived there for awhile. before getting a house.

i miss my old friends, fro, both schools, the ones from my old school were my best friends, but now im forgotten to them (literally they forgot i existed) , never answer my texts, always are busy when they do, and they changed, not the same people i became friends with. we dont have that same type of vibe, it feels dull and fake when i text them. now 2 of them havent answered my texts in like half a year (will soon be a full year ig)  

from my school that im currently school i despise them, theyre snobby, shit bro i didnt do anything to you? why you suddenly acting like i murdered your mom or stole your fucking phone holy shit.they also forgot about me. i don‚Äôt consider them my friends.

i talk to one person every day, probably two or three per month in total, and the two others are only my mom asking me to do a chore, or the delivery guy.

i get so so lonely, i see my friends posting about them hanging out all the time now that they finished school a few days ago. i‚Äôm just there watching it.

i‚Äôm watching my life go by, not actually living it. 

i can‚Äôt talk to my mom or dad about it, they‚Äôre abusive. mom doesn‚Äôt care about me, broken relationship, and she always looks for reasons to be mad, doesn‚Äôt care about my health or my wishes. dad doesn‚Äôt even have a relationship with me, also abusive. he just cares about my baby twin siblings and my younger brother. awkward when i‚Äôm with him or look at him.


i want to be with my old friends and have my normal happy relationship with them, i miss meeting up at my old school and ditching together or crying together about exams and teachers, making up ghost stores, and when we met up too early we‚Äôd get freaked out my the dark halls.sneaking into the kindergartners playgrounds, or getting freaked out at bugs and running away from the janitor. or some dumb stuff, then meeting up at our houses and . now they do that without me. i understand, i‚Äôm unattractive, boring, dull, lonely, and lives somewhere else.

i wanna die, i‚Äôm sick of life, only reasons why is bc i don‚Äôt wanna go to hell, and i‚Äôm too much of a pussy to hurt myself, bc i get hurt easily and hate pain, but i wanna die a painless quick death and live an ok afterlife in heaven. probably reunite with my grand aunt and a few people i want to see again.

I quite like being alone for the most part. I get to pick what movies to watch, what music to listen to, what video games to play. I get to wear comfortable clothes and I'm not worrying about entertaining or making conversation. I even like getting high or drinking alone as I don't have to worry about looking dumb in front of someone. I'm usually content. 

All that being said, when those moments of loneliness hit, it's brutal. When I get out of work at 10pm and as I'm walking towards my car and wish I had somewhere to go besides home. When I've the house to myself and would love to have a girl over and watch a movie. When I'd just like someone to talk to or to send a picture to. Damn it's awful. 

I won't lie, I believe some of my loneliness is sexual frustration. At 21 I'm still very much so a virgin with not even a relationship to speak of in the past. That didn't bother me before but it's increasingly irritating. My tinder matches ghost me or after dates I'm strung along. I hardly feel it's even worth it half the time. But seeing as I don't have any friends on top of no luck with women it's obvious I'm the problem. I feel like an alien. I don't think I've ever met a person I feel comfortable being myself around. I just can't find somebody whose interests match my own. I don't even know where to look. If I couldn't make friends in high school where it's easier to make friends than anywhere else, what chance do it even have?

My parents were always concerned how i never showed interest in communicating with other people but didn‚Äôt do anything about it. 

I dont know whats wrong with me but everyone says that im weird for not having friends or talking to people, especially my cousin. My parents and cousin say its gonna be really hard for me in the adult world with no friends, but i dont want to have friends just to use them for help. 

I have never had any friends i kept for longer than a few months, they would always tell me i was weird and drop me. 

I knew i was ugly and had bad posture and i was bullied for that but i fixed both issues,but the only people who communicated with me were the ones who were looking for a relationship which i ended up going along with because i liked them but after breakups i would get dropped by them.

Now so far this might be sounding pretty incel to you, but my problem isn‚Äôt that i‚Äôm single it‚Äôs because for some reason I don‚Äôt get lonely or want friends and i don‚Äôt know how to fit in when i‚Äôm all alone all the time.

I found a small local pickleball event and decided to go. It‚Äôs on the other side of town and there‚Äôs lots of traffic. I felt kind of nervous but forced myself to keep driving there.

When I got there I approached the wrong group of people: Me: ‚ÄúHi, are you from the app?‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúNo...‚Äù

It was the other group of people on the courts. Well it turns out everyone there was 30s and 40s at the youngest and like 60 at the oldest.

I hadn‚Äôt played pickleball in about 8 years so I wasn‚Äôt very good. We played doubles and I sucked. I also didn‚Äôt understand the scoring at all or how taking turns serving works. It was awkward af.

After a handful of games some other players were saying they were going to head out. I wanted to leave too but wasn‚Äôt sure how. I just kept standing around trying to figure out how to get the hell out of there. Finally I waved and said ‚Äúnice meeting you‚Äù and left.

So that was my experience today trying to ‚Äúgo outside‚Äù as is recommended for lonely people. On the positive side I got some exercise and did feel better than before. On the negative it was so awkward and none of these people are my age.

I am at the university since 2018 (it's a 6 years-long program) and I realized that I don't have any serious relationship with others, I only have acquaintances; we usually talk about school or 1-2 common thing but thats all, nothing serious or more  involving

Is it normal? I mean, I am usually the guy who scores straight A's at most of the subjects, therefore a lot of people tries to take advantage of me (asking my class notes) but I usually sort these peope out quickly, and after that, I usually have like 10 acquaintances.

I usually spend weeks without any human contact. no family or friends.

I disabled all of my social media accounts ... I was sick of watching other ppl pics and stories. I tried dating apps for a while ... no matches.

I spend the weekends laying in bed wondering how can I save myself from this loneliness. how can I make ppl like me. most of the time I come to the conclusion that I have to become rich somehow ... that's the only thing I can control.

I know I'm not attractive or funny, I get it ... I probably wouldn't date myself too.

My university is in Bali Island, about a thousand km apart from my home.

I have many enough friends at the university, but totally zero at my homeland. And now, because of this pandemic, my university still go online until this August. But, just yesterday my University chanchellor publish a official later that online classes will be extended to next year. I felt so depressed to hear that. I miss my friends, I miss social life, 1 and a half year count from my return from Bali to my homeland I just stay at my home playing GTA V at home, what I can do is just hanging out with Lamar ( GTA V character ). Sometimes I feel very jealous when seeing my friends Insta story. 50% of them keep stay at Bali and another 50% of them also go back to their homeland like me, but they all have so many friends to hang out, while I am here not. Most of them who stay in Bali always go to the beach in the afternoon to watch sunset together, almost everyday. I can say that their live in Bali is just like vacation, and also every weekend, they must be visiting some cool tourist destination in Bali like Ubud and Kintamani. And thats all what my friends do, while I am here very very bored with nobody around. My friends in Bali keep seducing me for go to Bali so I can hang out and live together with them, but it cant be easy like that.

I have talked to my parents about this, but what they say is "" Save yourself the money if you want to go "". Yeah, maybe my parents want taught me to save money, but it need 3-4 months to save. And 3-4 months is if there is no spending, and in fact need some refreshment too there, maybe staycation for 1-2 nights alone at hotel, or having dinner by myself at the restaurant, and after I going back home from that, it make me more sad that the fact is I have no friends in my homeland there.

I've tried to delete my Instagram app to keep my mental health, but many of important things of my university are in Instagram, so I forced to use it, and again, I see my friend "" Vacation lifestyle "" while I am here so stuck and cant go anywhere because nothing interesting here.

I got only (1) online friend that I have met almost a year ago now on twitter. They don't really want a close friendship, which is what I crave. They care, I know they do, I do too, and they often try to be here as much as they can, but they need a lot of space, are scared of close bonds, and I am often frustrated and sad because I feel like I'm always the one trying to get to know them, which doesn't seem reciprocal.

And on top of that, I have attachment issues and fears that make meeting people and making friends very painful, panic inducing and confusing.

I don't want to be alone so that's why I try to still talk to them on the daily - but it feels very lonely, and they know I'm lonely with them, but they don't know what to do even if they wish they could, and I don't want to make them uncomfortable either.

What made think of this so I felt the need to write a post here - is how I have a ""public"" twitter account with them following me among other people, and they never interact with me. My private twitter where nobody even follows me feels less suffocating because at least I don't have expectations there, I can ramble, be sad, lonely and talk to myself there.

I don't think words are enough for me to trust anyone anymore, which is the only thing that can even be fucking exchanged here. And no one around me would give me anything, not even words. If you have nothing to say, don't. I don't want to see you sucking your dick in front of me. All I want is for someone to hug me and to tell me it's all okay, and no one can do that. I just want to scream at the top of my lung and I can't even do that, it all just keeps accumulating and the only way for me to let out is to hit myself, or punch a fucking wall. Everything hurts.

I‚Äôve had this fear for a while now, but I think it became fully realized a few months ago, when I was actually abandoned. I had a romantic partner, and we both fell each other very hard. He made me feel loved, and worthy of being loved. My self esteem grew, I felt happier. However, one day, he stated that he no longer had feelings for me, and it was almost out of the blue. It was devastating. After all of the time we spent together, he just threw it all away. Now, we barely talk because of his busy schedule, and he spends time with other friends. It makes me feel discarded.

Then I got serious about healing from my childhood. Ritualistic abuse, brainwashing, sex trafficking, torture and shit people can't even believe. All orchestrated by my dad. 

Friends disappeared. I didn't blame them. I was in the trenches. For years. I suddenly had one friend, who was 30 years older than me... and mostly a mother figure. And my therapist. Who over 8 years I became incredibly close to. 

I did trauma work most people never do. I dug into the darkness and pulled shit out that was excruciating to face. I told the secrets I was going to take to the grave. I accepted finally that I have DID... the disorder formally know as multiple personalities. 

As I embraced all the parts inside me that fractured off to save my life, I learned more about what happened to them. What happened to me. And I would face each new set of memories. 

All of this gave me a deep understanding of pain and suffering. It drew people to me who were also broken by trauma. I knew so much about healing I thought I could help. I never forced it, I shared my experiences. But I painfully found out over and over again that no one could relate to me. My dianoses confused them. And then when I tried to help them in their inevitable crises... I become the bad guy. A shitty friend. A judgmental bitch who thinks she knows everything about healing and insults people by being concerned about their mental health and well being. 

It's been a while since I made a friend. I made the mistake of doing it recently. It blew up between last night and today. 

So I'm going to stay alone. It's painful and not what I what. But I'm done getting hurt by people. I'm not judgemental. I accept where people are in their lives. But I'm not going to lie to them. If you're increasingly becoming less and less coherent, if I'm concerned about you... I'm going to tell you. But people don't want to hear the truth. So they accuse you of insulting them. 

This post will probably isolate me. No one ever seems to relate. I feel like I wasn't created for this world. I'm not suicidal, but I don't understand why I'm here...

The emptiness is eternal and tangible. And I hold it alone.

My therapist is ending our work together.

I don't have any friends in real life and I haven't since I graduated high school 5 years ago. I've never had a group of friends, I've never held a girls hand before, and I've never even had a girlfriend before.  For a long time it didn't bother me. I was happy in my own little world playing games and watching anime but now the things I used to love don't bring me anything anymore. I have no one to share my accomplishments. I have no one to watch things with or talk about how work was or anything. 

Last year I met someone who changed how I viewed everything and she was my best friend. We played games together every night, they always asked how I was and asked me to watch stuff. For a whole year I felt what it was like to have someone be into you but a month ago they met someone new. They turn down all my invitations to hang out, they don't message me anymore or even reply to me. I see them online every night playing the games I got her into and taught her how to play together and I can't even get a response from someone who I called my bestfriend and I'm heartbroken. I was there for this person whenever they needed it and I'm just thrown to the side like trash..

Right now I just go to work and come home right after and play games or watch movies or anime by myself. I only have one friend I can play games with and our schedules make it hard to even do that.

3325,AFatPandasaur,1620448032,1,"I‚Äôm almost 30. I used to love the weekend. I‚Äôd get to spend my time with my friends and do whatever we pleased. Early on is was video games or being out at night playing crazy hide and seek games in the dark. Later it was going the bars or going to concerts or festivals or just relaxing in our own apartments doing whatever we wanted. I‚Äôve had multiple relationships with girls whom I‚Äôve truly loved. With a special someone it really didn‚Äôt matter what I did, I was just happy to be with them.

My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were very toxic and abusive. It took many years before I realized that and we were no longer in each other‚Äôs lives for various reasons. I still kept one best friend though from that group. He fell to drugs and chose shittier people over me. Those same people treated me like shit and he always said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke man, you gotta lighten up.‚Äù If that‚Äôs how they always treated me, then it wasn‚Äôt a joke. He never got that. 

I became friends with others and was in a couple different groups of people. All of whom were also very rude to me and abusive but again to me it seemed like being picked on and treated like that was just how it worked, even though no one else in the group would ever get it as bad or as consistently as me. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was happening again. 

There was a girl who I used to have a crush on in high school and we became life long friends later. Recently she has completely stopped being my friend over something so petty, it just leaves me dumbfounded.

Oh, the relationship thing? Every single girl besides one cheated on me or lied to me or abused me emotionally. I haven‚Äôt been on a proper date in a very long time. I‚Äôve tried online dating and it‚Äôs awful. Nothing is real. There is no emotion and no one cares. Men are a commodity for women on dating apps and thusly we are expendable and replaceable. 

I‚Äôve been called handsome and very good looking. When asked, people have said ‚Äúoh, afatpandasaur? He‚Äôs one of the nicest and kindest guys I‚Äôve met.‚Äù I genuinely care for others and their well being. I want people to be happy, even compete strangers. I will go out of my way to help someone if I am able, no hesitation.

Yet, I have no friends. None. They all have left me. I stood up for myself and people didn‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôve tried reaching out and nobody cares. As I said before I‚Äôve tried online dating which seems to be the only avenue for dating and it‚Äôs demeaning and leaves me feeling so much worse. 

Due to life issues and my depression and anxiety and stupid financial decisions I‚Äôm currently living with my folks since living on my own would be so expensive I‚Äôd never be able to save money and get ahead in life. I tried and that was awful too. I‚Äôll eventually have enough to buy a house for myself but even now the market is getting worse and worse.

My job doesn‚Äôt care if I live or die. They are awful. I work in the trades and my only coworker I see in a daily basis is a selfish racist bigoted asshole who encourages civil war. I can‚Äôt leave yet cause I don‚Äôt have another‚Äôs years worth of experience under my belt.

I‚Äôm writing this because I guess I just want my story to be heard. I want it to be heard cause maybe you know someone in your life who may be lonely. Someone who used to love the weekend. If this can spark the light that someone sees to save them, even just one person, then I feel my pain was worth it.

It‚Äôs actually something I tell myself to make myself feel better. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going through this pain, this hollowing and numbing loneliness, these betrayals of love and friendship, so that someone else doesn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù To me, that makes this worth it to some degree.

This has devolved into the ramblings of a very very very sad and lonely soul. The pain has hollowed me out and I feel my strength waning. Therapy and medication didn‚Äôt help. My previous passions are lackluster. They only serve to hurt me more because I can‚Äôt even enjoy them. I ache. It won‚Äôt stop. The pain won‚Äôt stop. Not even my mom can make me feel better. 

Please please please, if you have gotten this far, fear not for me. Do not feel sad or sorry. Do not apologize or try to understand more. I have accepted my fate and while I‚Äôm still angry, I‚Äôm slowly making peace with it.

This is all I ask. 

Be kind. It‚Äôs quite literally the easiest thing you can practice. If you see someone or think someone is lonely. Reach out. Try. You may save a life.

Every single person is fighting a battle that you know nothing about.

Be kind. Enjoy your weekends.",lonely,I used to love the weekend,2021-05-08 14:27:12

3351,Medical-Implement-91,1620435210,1,"I've felt lonely my whole life. Every small up - not that there have been many - has come with a big crashing down. I can't trust people and haven't been able to for many years now.

OK, I'm going to give my life storey because I need to get it off my chest. If at least one person takes the time to read it, it would mean alot to me. I'm 37 by the way. 

When I was a child, I could never make friends. I was shy and awkward, and I would cry at what most people would say is nothing. I was very lonely. I was like this right up until I was about 15. I know right? A little old to be so sensitive. I felt excluded and bullied constantly. Then I snapped one day and decided to start giving people crap. Anyone that came my way got it. Not a healthy choice right? But there it is. Why is it people only respect selfish assholes? I just want one person in life I can share things with and be myself.

This harder but disrespectful attitude led to me forming a few relationships (friends). I hung around with them. We went out cycling for fun and shared our interests. But then my true sensitivity and quietness eventually started to show, and they left me to hang out with other people. I was devestated. I felt lonely again. I would call them to hang out and chase them around like a fool. And if I pestered them enough, sometimes they would. I couldn't see that they had me dangling like an idiot. Then I met my girlfriend through one of my so called friends.

I was 17 and she was 15. After a couple of weeks I very stupidly accidently told this girl I loved her. I guess I felt desperate to have someone in my life that would not leave me. She said it back and I promised her I would never leave her. We stayed together for 12 years... Out of obligation to a promise. Until I was 29. We didn't really love each other.

At the start of the relationship we started smoking weed. All of my so called friends smoked it and a couple of years after I got with my girlfriend they all got married moved away and had kids. Lucky them. I felt abandoned. I still do, and it's been 20 years. I remember each and every person that has ever hurt me like it was yesterday. None of these friends ever bothered to contact me again. I assume they stopped smoking weed. I guess I only smoked it for so long because psychologically it was the only thing getting me by. I know that's not true but I was mentally addicted. It makes you think you're happy at the time, until it wears off and you need more. It just adds to your depression. 

The girlfriend never once again said she loved me during our entire 12 year relationship and again, like the fool I am, I chased her around and kept trying to have conversations that actually meant something to me for 11 years. She would say all the wrong things and repeatedly broke my heart. So we argued. The whole time she just got high, avoided talking about anything that mattered to me, and slept constantly. She wasn't in the relationship at all. Not caring. Like always, I felt alone the whole time.

Near the beggining of the relationship we moved in together and I met a guy who smoked weed too, but he had anger issues, got into fights all the time, and actually spoke proudly of it. I pretended to be like him so I could have a friend. We got to spend the next 11 years sharing our problems with each other. In a way I feel lucky to have had that, but it was at the cost of my integrity. I was being fake and all I wanted to do deep down was quit smoking weed and be myself again. Truthfully I'm gentle. So I still felt alone inside the whole time.

During this relationship my girlfriend would constantly slag off my family and actually turned me against them. I was a fool. Then in 2007, my father died of lung cancer. He was only on his late 50's. It was a two year battle with two operations and in the end he suffocated. He was honestly on my side in life. My girlfriend was not supportive about his death at all. You always have to deal with your problems yourself. Nobody really cares. 

Just before my father got lung cancer my mother left my father for someone else and I could not understand why. I watched as she visited the house every day giving him false hope for two years and all the while he was deteriorating with cancer. My father would beg me sometimes not to let her in the house anymore if she came, because she was wearing him down. But the house was half hers and I couldn't stop her. My father was so strong and I watched him become so weak. I hated her for it. 

After my father died my younger brother was left in the house alone and was obviously devestated at such a young age, so I pushed down my own feelings and moved in to take care of him. I never even cried. My girlfriend was not happy despite the fact that she got to move from a tiny flat into a largish house and the bills would be alot cheaper. She just hated my family and I hated my mother for what she had done to my father. 

I argued with my mother for the next few years while I lived there. I wanted to move out. The same thing all the time. I would say. 'You have to move in with your son, so I can have my life back. I've given up my life for you.' She flat out refused the whole time acting like she was doing me some big favour. 

Throughout my entire life I had no money. The debt piled up and in the end I declared bankruptcy. Me and my girlfriend never had any money despite us both working full time. I've lived on the edge my whole life. This only added to the pressure between us. I started work as a delivery boy and met a guy that worked there who would bring weed to the house. 

Then when I was 29 my girlfriend finally left me. All the misery and loneliness in my life hit me at once, and I cried uncontrollably for weeks. All day, every day and in my sleep too. Yes, it's possible. I would wake up with the pillow soaked with tears. Everyone leaves me and I leave everyone.

Then one day I found an app filled with quotes from Buddha and one stood out to me,

""If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path, walk alone. There is no companionship with the immature.""- Gautama Buddha

This got me thinking how I had lived my whole life in service to others and got nothing but misery and loneliness for it. So I stopped talking to people. I mean everyone. Even the people at my workplace. I thought if no-one could get in my head and control me, then no-one could hurt me. Believe it or not I didn't speak to a soul for the next two years or three years. And guess what? I got stronger. That's right! It turns out you DON'T need people. I finally stopped crying and I stopped smoking weed and I took care of myself better and my confidence increased. I took my life back. But it didn't come without any downsides.

You see, because I wasn't speaking at work they started bullying me. Some of them would call me a bastard, some of them let the air out of my tires, and the guy that used to bring me weed burgled my house twice. I had evidence that it was him. They even employed a prostitute and tried to trick me into dating her. It was awful.

Then one day out if the blue some police officers suddenly showed up at work and arrested me. Apparently the boss there had told them that I had gone insane and started busting the place up and intimidating all the staff. It wasn't true of course. The next thing I know they are taking me to a hospital and accusing me of having schizophrenia when I was really just trying to protect myself from people.

They put me on a two weekly injection. What they thought it was doing I have no idea, because I still refused to talk to anyone. You see I felt so much stronger alone. While I was like this my emotions were stable as a rock.

Work fired me and I could not afford to pay the mortgage on my mother's house anymore. She would send me big abusive messeges blaming me and saying 'now I have to sell the house because of YOU' even though her house should have been her own responsibility. 

The house was sold and I had nowhere to live. I slept in my car for  a while then my mother decided to take me into her spare room even though she was not allowed because if her landlady. I supposed it was nice of her, but I did not trust her after everything and I still did not speak a word to anyone. I felt peaceful inside. For the first time in my life I didn't need people.

The next thing I know my mother gave me ¬£38,000. You have to understand throughout her entire life she always tried to buy my affection. She even stole me away from my father when I was young by bad mouthing him, and buying me sweets and toys. I was grateful for the money but I still didn't speak to her. You see everyone around me, including her, acted as if I had something wrong with me. Like in was sick in the head. I can assure you I have always been fully aware of my surroundings and actions. The more you tyy to defend yourself against people, the worse people accuse you, and the worse things get, so I continued my silence.

I used the money to settle my new debts. I redid my school leaving qualifications and finally got worthwhile grades. I got my big motorbike licence and enjoyed a 2013 Suzuki bandit for a year or so... But I became depressed and felt alone again because of it all. I must have felt like I didn't earn it or something, and everyone was putting the pressure on me because of not talking and giving me dirty looks. It seemed to me like the whole city had heard shit about me... So I came off the medication and skipped the country. And everything was fine. 

I lived in Japan for five months and learned some Japanese in a school. I felt right at home since most people there are too shy to talk to each other anyway. I felt strong again. I began to speak to people. I trusted them. They were considerate of my feelings, they never did a thing to inconvenience me, and they never once hurt me. I got along with all the people I spoke to. For the first time in my life I felt at home and peaceful. Seriously, it's like they did something to instill my heart with strength.

Then when my funds started to get low I moved to a small town in northern Spain for two months and sent for my qualification certificates through the post. I planned to try and get a job in Spain. When I couldn't get one and all I had left was airfare back to the UK, I realized I would need benefits to survive.

But I didn't want to go back to my home city. I decided to go to London instead and live in hostels until I could get a job. The second I applied for benefits though the police found me and put me straight back on medication and straight back in a hospital again. For this reason I don't trust shrinks, and I don't trust the police. They can't see the truth. They don't comprehend. 

I have explained everything as calmly as I can to these people on more than one occasion. As far as they are concerned me trying to defend myself means I definitely must have schizophrenia.

I would blame my country but it couldn't be that right? It's because of my so called, friends, family, and coworkers from my hometown. The people who only pretend to care about me, and only pretend to have my best interests at heart.

Anyway after coming back, my emotions had been fortified, and because of the medication, I went on benefits... Which have turned out to be more than I ever got on a minimum wage job. That's totally not right is it...? But it's true. 

I have felt stable for the last couple of years and been doing better than ever living in a flat alone, up until about two months ago. You see, the medication I'm on has brought me a variety of negative mental and physical conditions. Depression, foggy mind, liver damage, incredibly stiff and inflexible muscles, weight gain, and high cholesterol.

Also,my mother's boyfriend had been pestering me saying if I didn't make friends or get a girlfriend I would become miserable and lonely. After a while he started to get into my head. Then one day I joined a couple of new groups on Facebook and suddenly started receiving hundreds of friend requests every day. I don't know why but when I started getting hundreds of message I thought maybe this is a good opportunity to try and find some trustworthy friends.

I fell for it again. Trusting people. I spoke to dozens of people and they all tried to scam me out of my money. One girl, from China, gained my trust by being really caring and loving, but at the same time asking me for really expensive gifts off a really specific website. And the worse part is, I actually love her because no-one has ever treated me so well. I think she'll leave me when she figures out she can't get anything else out of me.

For the past twenty four hours I have just been crying again and I'm afraid I'm going to become like I was before when I felt so lonely and cried for weeks.

Why is it that if I don't talk to people I feel strong? But when I do I can't stop crying? It's people themselves that make me feel alone and depressed, not people that help me! Is that normal?",lonely,Storey of my life,2021-05-08 10:53:30

3377,ScrumptiousCookie123,1620423186,1,"I found out that a group of people I used to know and grew up with conspired together, and ran me through the mud in a smear campaign. They impersonated me on Twitter and other social media platforms. At the time, I didn‚Äôt have any social media accounts. So I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea why others were angry/disappointed/disgusted/hateful/embarrassed with me. I didn‚Äôt understand why I was being scapegoated/ostracized/excluded. Everyone kept insisting that I needed to apologize. For what?! They wouldn‚Äôt even tell me what I did wrong. They would keep it super vague and say that I would disrespect everyone but demand others to respect me - in reference to the straw man impersonation they made of my identity. I never asked anyone to respect me. I was getting bullied, had no idea why, and couldn‚Äôt even defend myself. I simply was not allowed to defend myself.

I found out too late, and the damage was already done. Before I could make an account to report them on Twitter, they made sure to delete the tweets and deactivate those accounts. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they made private impersonating accounts afterwards so I couldn‚Äôt see what was being posted.

They would use impersonating accounts to start fights, spread rumors/misinformation, and to misrepresent who I am as a person. 
Then, the same people who were impersonating me used their own accounts to refute/rebuttal the imposter/impersonating account - all to make themselves look like the ‚Äúbigger person‚Äù and paint themselves in a better light. They would pretend to have ‚Äúempathy‚Äù and ‚Äúgrace‚Äù when dealing with the straw man version of myself. 

I have so many questions...
Why are some people so awful? Why are some people so disingenuous?And why did people actually believe those impersonating accounts? Why didn‚Äôt people confront me in person and say anything about it? Why did people keep it hush, hush, and do all this behind my back? Why did it have to be me? I didn‚Äôt do anything to these people.

Experiencing this only brought me distrust and dislike people more. It also pushed me to write people off and generalize ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù as terrible, even though I know this isn‚Äôt true and there are good people out there. I feel super disheartened by this. 

The worst part is, even after being abused and done wrong by these individuals, I‚Äôm being medically pathologized/demoniz/vilified as a ‚Äúpsychopath‚Äù, ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù, ‚Äúsociopath‚Äù, ‚Äúborderline‚Äù, etc. I don‚Äôt have any of these diagnoses.

I have a live in boyfriend whom I am in constant contact with. He is my best friend, truly believe my soulmate. He has quite a few friends who he can occupy his time with when we work opposite schedules. Aside from him and my one friend who I don't see often, I feel like my connections and friendships are superficial, no real depth. I feel like I overshare in most of my friendships and it is hard to develop bonds with people when they don't want to be vulnerable. 

My male friendships either end because they can't respect my boundaries or their girlfriends don't like them speaking to girls. One of my best friends since 12 (I am 30 now) stopped talking to me because his girlfriend wasn't okay with him having me as his friend even though I've been with my boyfriend over 7 years...

I have a hard time maintaining friendships with girls, I don't know how to bond with them honestly. Most girls I meet don't have much to talk about. I LOVE makeup but don't know how to have deep conversations with them about it. 

Along this journey I am realizing the type of friends I want to attract. Those who are into the things I am! From music, astrology, gaming. I also like to enjoy the beach, go to the movies and watch stand up.  I think because I lean introverted I get drained easily, so when I try explaining to my friends why I don't want to go out, I feel like an awful friend. Sometimes I would hang out of friends and not enjoy myself, but now I avoid situations that I won't enjoy.

Recently one of my friends stopped talking to me because I didn't show up to her boyfriend's event. I told her in advanced that I wanted to study instead of go out. I don't want to waste my energy on people being constantly passive aggressive anymore.

The old me was okay with friends who would complain or nag, I think I was breeding toxic habits and somewhat attracting the same energy.

I was in a parking lot a few miles from where I live where there's many shops, heavy traffic, and lots of people around. I needed to make a phone call and rather doing that while I was driving, I figured I'd stop to make the call and then resume my drive home. Well, as I'm pulling out a heavily beat-up pickup truck pulls up with two men inside. They roll their windows down and proceed to try to coax me to roll my window down too. At this point I'm scared and I keep pulling out and screaming ""NO"", because they started to get out of their truck. I sped away and called my mom so someone would be on the phone with me until I got home. I told her what happened and that I was taking a different route to the house (we have about 4 different entrances to our neighborhood) and that I would be there soon. She proceeds to make fun of me saying ""Hannah, your dad is here you could've come straight home, just stop what you're doing you always over think stuff like this, it's a little ridiculous"". I then get home and my dad comes out waving his arms laughing, ""Where they at? Where they at? They're gonna get ya!"" I told him flatly, ""It's not funny, I was scared"". He responds with, ""It's hilarious."" And I stand up for myself saying, ""Yeah it's so hilarious they caught me off guard and scared me. So funny."" He then proceeds to go inside, slamming the door behind him. I follow, calling him out on his behavior and he says, ""I don't even recall saying it's hilarious."" WHEN HE JUST DID. I called my mom out on what she said too and she says what she always does, ""You look too much into things. Stop taking things so seriously."" They don't even try to be sympathetic, they just tear me down whatever chance they get and when I defend myself or call them out they respond with ""It's so sad you can't take a joke"". Like my mom will call me out for eating something and it going straight to my hips (I'm only 121 lbs) and my dad follows up with ""can't forget her face either, that's going to get fat too"". I feel so alone here. I'm moving to the UK in September for grad school, but I feel like I mentally/emotionally won't make it until then. I'm always made fun of and when I admonish the bad behavior they act like children. Even when I ignore it, they call me names and find new ways of ""joking"".

I know there's things I have to be grateful for, like free meals, a roof over my head, etc... I just don't feel like those things qualify someone to degrade me whenever they want. I'm just so done and so sick of it. The rest of my family is the same way too. I just don't understand why it's so hard for them to just be kind and considerate. I feel extremely isolated, lonely, and sad. I don't have the freedom to be myself here, so I'm always on my guard.

-Part I: Backstory 

My life didn't even start like most people. My parents couldn't have children naturally, so they dished out tons of money to a lab to have me created in a test tube. I was the lab's 6th attempt, actually an accidental twin that they had planned to 'dispose of', but my parents ended up deciding they wouldn't mind having twins. Given how much money they had invested to have me, my parents expected - no, demanded - nothing short of perfection. I was one of those 'gifted kids', who read a ton at an early age, talked mostly to adults and older people, and was constantly told by my parents to avoid talking to other kids my age because I was somehow ""better than them"". That led to me having almost no friends , a crippling inability to relate with other people my age, and burnout at 20. My parents always insisted that anything short of perfection was failure, and ""sheltered"" me from things they thought were bad, such as pop music and the early internet; this later led to my brief porn addiction and having a radio/mp3 player hidden in my sock drawer (surely, signs of good mental health). 

Shortly after the end of middle school, my family moved across the country to California for my dad's work. In high school, I started to befriend more people my age and tried to fit in best as I could. One of those high school friends ended up being the girl that changed my life - her name was Kath. We lived right down the street from each other, and did everything together; worked on our cars, played games, hung out - she even taught me how to surf. She was absolutely everything I could have ever hoped for - beautiful, athletic, funny, smart, caring, and sweet. I quickly fell in love with her; thankfully she felt the same, so we became boyfriend and girlfriend. By then we were almost inseparable, and boy were we a perfect couple. We even restored a Jeep together, and were both convinced that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. But that all changed in the summer of our Junior Year, when a semi truck t boned Kath's car at high speed. I remember getting the call like it was yesterday - I had never felt so much pain and agony at once. It felt like I had lost the better part of myself. 

Kath's death sent me into a dark spiral of depression and reclusion; she was quite literally everything to me, and I had a very hard time going on without her by my side. To make things worse, my dad's work transferred him across the country shortly afterwards, forcing me to leave Malibu, surfing and my fond memories of Kath behind. I ended up dragging through my senior year of high school in an unfamiliar school with strangers that weren't exactly welcoming. My grades weren't particularly bad, so I was accepted for a correspondence course at a local State College. 

Now, I'm in my third year of College. I've had no direction at all; I see no point in planning out or working towards a career¬† ¬†and life that's not worth living. I'm not particularly bright, and I'm already burned out and have no drive anymore. I can count the number of friends I have on one hand - it seems like I'm usually the one reaching out to keep our friendships up sadly. For a while I thought looking for a girlfriend might help me find some direction, but that hasn't gone well either. I'm always just the guy friend; girls might think I'm sweet or nice, but I'm never boyfriend material. No matter how hard I try, I'm not quite that they're looking for. I'm now convinced that there's no one out there for me - Kath was my one chance, and she's gone forever. 


Part II: Myself 

At this point, I'm just living my life completely around a false front. I deliberately lie to my parents about my grades, when I'm actually failing most of my classes in College. When I post photos of my most recent small-scale model I've built on social media, a few family members laud me on how good it looks. I feel like I'm not being honest with them - I take photos of my models at certain angles to hide imperfections or mistakes. I enjoy building the models, but it stresses me out when I mess up so I hide my mistakes and avoid showing anyone 'behind the curtain'. I'm working a job I hate to pay the bills, and I'm always struggling to meet my boss' expectations; I never tell my family or friends how exhausted and stressed I am after work every day.¬† 

I don't really fit in with people my age, thanks to my upbringing. I enjoy wearing suits, khakis/slacks, button downs, penny loafers or dress shoes, and sweaters - almost the Mr. Rogers look. I slick my hair, keep a close-trimmed beard, and my twin claims I sound like a senior citizen. I enjoy older music and retro things, though I also love newer music; in fact, I've found that music dominates what's left of my life. try my best to be an absolute gentleman, but the facade is starting to crack around the edges.¬† 

My life behind the false front is falling apart. I'm needing more and more sleep, taking longer and longer showers, crying myself to sleep and sobbing myself awake. I'm always tired and depressed, I'm almost always running behind now, and every time I see something about a happy couple it makes me feel terrible for a good 3 days. 


And finally Part III: the nail in the coffin - Brandy.¬† 

Since there's next to no chance she'll ever find this, I might as well use her real name. When my family was looking for a new dogsitter, a mutual friend around my age was recommended. She turned out to be a wonderful dogsitter, and we quickly became friends. From when I first met her, Brandy reminded me of Kath; I liked her instantly. At first I was convinced that my feelings were just a crush, and I tried to ignore them - I just wanted a friend. However, as the months went on I realized it was much more than that - I had fallen in love with Brandy, and my feelings were getting stronger and stronger. Now, having already experienced a few harsh rejections in my attempts to enter the dating pool post-Kath, I didn't want to say anything to Brandy. She started dating a guy from her college that she liked shortly after I decided to keep my feelings to myself. Now every time I hang out with her, I end up feeling terrible about myself; she's so wonderful in every way, and it reminds me how much of a loser I am. I'm convinced that even if she was single, I would never have a chance with her. Occasionally I feel a jealous of, even resentful towards her boyfriend but then I realize - I should be grateful for him. He makes Brandy happy, and in the end that's what's important.¬† 


Seems like these days, everywhere I see people they're experiencing some form of love, affection, companionship or romance -  the things that make life worth living, but that I can't seem to reach. I'm not sure I can keep going on like this. Life's simply not worth it",lonely,At The End.,2021-05-08 02:30:38

3436,rae_jule,1620386293,1,"before you read,, 1. spoilers are going to be bad words because I just want to vent and have people help me.  
2. this started because of a dumb math question. me and one girl, lets call her A, had a lot of tense&gt;! shit!&lt; between us already, so you can already tell I was annoyed because of other things that have happened. i will explain this stuff at the end of the post.

so a couple weeks ago, me + 2 other ppl (one is my ""friend""..? we will call her S, and A) were talking about a stupid PEMDAS question.  
I was just explaining that PEMDAS and BEDMAS is the same. i think we all got heated bc of different sides and idk it just happens that when people are frustrated we tend to get aggressive. I think I was annoyed because, I was explaining to S, and she wasn't listening to what I was saying and kept going with her own thing because she thought she was right. anyways, I really don't care about pemdas, it was a joke to show the equation and have them answer it and see if they got it right. i didn't mean any arguing to start.

anyways, we were all annoyed and (honestly I'm not sure how it even started) but we all got really mad at each other. i then proceeded to say some &gt;!shitty!&lt; stuff to A (I basically told her I wont miss A when she moves because i just want someone who doesnt judge me for what i say and how i act) I KNOW THAT IT WAS WRONG.  please don't tell me because it will make me feel worse LOL  
S and A literally told me to say it, and I was already mad that A kept saying things like K and just not responding literally and just saying nevermind, and I didnt want to act like her because its annoying (will talk about it later)

so i said that and they both got mad at me because i said it when they wanted me to, and i told them the times A judged me and they got mad for setting boundaries and distancing myself from A which she got mad about bc apparently i wasnt giving them enough clues. I think not responding to texts and just saying things that meant that i didnt really want to talk to A.

then they proceed to yell at me for being sad/disappointed bc of a relationship thing

(basically, A asked me to be her valentine and I said yes but I don't know if i want it to be romantic or just as friends, and then my friend, T, asked A out the day after valentines, and A, apparently having private feelings about T, ditches all her feelings for me and goes and dates T. their relationship didn't work out.)

and then S and A tell me I wasnt giving A enough hints that i was interested and I wasn't giving enough effort, so she moved on, apparently.  
then S and A proceeded to tell me that I shouldve just chose my feelings (that i liked A or not)  
and then after A just switched to dating T I put a song on my private instagram (IM SORRY ITS SO CRINGEY BUT I DID IT)  
and A had to bring it up and tell me I was overreacting because I put it on my story. Then also proceeded to quiz me on Rod Wave, and I calmly told her that just because I knew one of their songs doesn't mean I know/am a fan of the actual artist  
and told me i overreacted because i put a song on my story..?

and then R (another girl who idk if shes my friend anymore) came in and confronted me A and S and started to turn on me but also got mad at S and A for this argument

anyways that was that and A and I arent friends anymore, and I have no idea what to do. I feel like all three of them (A, S and R) are talking about me behind my back, cause I talked to R and asked her if they had a groupchat together and they said yes, but not to talk about me or a gc which is like ""oh no don't add her"" type of thing

I spent years of my life, my primary, my secondary; dreaming and conceptually asking for a lie. The few things that gave me happiness were nothing more than little packages that promised on their surface to give me that which I had not had for most of my life as a student. As soon as I opened these packages I realized all the disgusting things they had inside, it was not only the same indifference, ignorance and impurity that I had tried to disregard throughout my life, but also, it was the celebration and appreciation of all these things I had hated. The worst of the case is that I had asked for that miserable package and I do not know if it was out of fear or the lack of interest with which I had become used to living my days that I did not open the door to receive it until what it contained was irretrievably expired. I wonder if in the future it will be for me, as for so many people that once time passes and the contents of the package are fermented in a substance that causes them the same illusion of happiness that my dreams of the future caused me, that I will finally appreciate the false happiness brought by the pleasant lie that temporarily fills that very hole in which we will end up. The same hole that has been my home for a long time, where I have found some tranquility and calm, this hole has the name of loneliness. It is easier to hide in the darkness of this hole where my dreams and fantasies are perfect than to go outside where imperfections are so revered. Once in a while like a diver whose oxygen tank runs out, I would go outside to breathe, but when I did I was naturally so disappointed that I dug that hole more and more. I isolated myself to such an extent that those who originally saw me dig my hole with indifference, now whispered to each other and began to mock that lonely miserable digging his hole. It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don't like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?",lonely,The package and the hole,2021-05-07 19:54:17

3456,Rohifi,1620369351,1,"Just something I‚Äôve been thinking about:

If I put up walls to potential friendships upfront, I will only be contacted by/engaged in meaningful conversation with folks I already have real good odds of hitting it off with and feeling safe around; however, this means that most of my posts that are seeking some kind of connection mostly go ignored or invite hateful replies/dms.

Not always, sometimes they do seem to work and I‚Äôll be approached (here on reddit) by a seemingly like-minded, kind-hearted person.

But, fuckin‚Äô hell, the waiting, questioning, and yes loneliness between these rare connections can often be overwhelming!

Conversely, if I were to just chat up every post which even remotely caught my idea (extroverted introvert by social necessity), or made my own posts more generic and crowd-pleasing/baiting, I‚Äôd probably experience a lot more basic, first-step hellos but would then have to suss out who each person is at a fundamental, will we even vibe level. And then if we don‚Äôt, I have to decide to tell them why and bail or just ghost entirely ‚Äî in that situation I‚Äôd usually tell the reason unless it‚Äôs a truly heinous person who‚Äôs not even worth the courtesy of the truth.

I do have a couple of friends I consider close. I met them way back in school and have managed to hold onto them despite my tendency to fuck up everything I touch. 

We were all single, and I took a weird comfort in that. It helped to have people in my life that struggled the same way I was.

And now whenever I try to talk to them about feeling hopeless in finding a relationship, even if I‚Äôm reaching out to them in earnest, they‚Äôve started hitting me with the usual ‚Äúhey don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs someone out there it‚Äôll happen when it‚Äôs meant to happen :)‚Äù bullshit. I get angry at them cause we used to jokingly say that to each other since we all knew how fake it was. But now that they‚Äôve actually got somebody they think it‚Äôs suddenly legit advice. So now I just get to silently watch from the sidelines as my closest friends get to experience something I never will, while they treat me like every other ‚Äúrelationship expert‚Äù does.

I can't find anyone local willing to even go out with me, so I've been dating girls about an hour away, thinking they'd be better, but it's the same old 2 dates, take advantage of my wallet, then ghost me. I'm honestly tired of this ghosting game, I'd rather someone honestly tell me they don't like me/hate my guts than pretend to like me and *poof* gone, at least I'd have some closure or an idea of what I did wrong/can improve upon, but when I get ghosted I have no clue, I'm just the same old me that isn't getting anywhere with dates, still feels lonely in the presence of others because I have yet to form a true connection or bond with a date in recent years. I know it's 100% my fault, I'm somewhat short, don't have ripped abs, wasn't a jock in high school (still am a nerd). I'm just a geeky computer guy, girls naturally never really took an interest in me all throughout my life until after college, and I was so God damn lonely, mentally broke down and had to go to the guidance counselor so many times just because I felt so alone and frustrated, still go to therapy today, but I'm no less lonely. I've been with 2 women officially, and 2 unofficially, I have very little dating experience for my age, most people get their first sweetheart at like 12 or 13, I lagged 10 years behind, and think I still do socially/dating wise, I'm now at the level of a high schooler, but am dating in an adult world, I'm guessing 99% of everyone has more experience than me, I have no game and it sucks. I just wish I could find my ""soul mate"" and get over all this dating shit, it's tiring, I'm lonely, and I've been alone way too God damn long for my liking, something about myself needs to change, because I'm obviously repelling women away for some reason I'm oblivious to, and I'd like to know what it is, I'm pretty good looking (aside from the height) and mostly well mannered, though can be a hothead sometimes, but I've made a lot of progress in therapy with my anger problem and it's rarely an issue anymore.

It has been over a year since i exchanged words, written or spoken with my parents, because i was born in a culture i never wanted and that put me through abuse and alot of other things. 
My siblings never really tried to understand why i dont talk with my parents anymore, so communication has been kept at a minimum. 
My friends, if i can call them that anymore, well...havent even tried to be ""friends"" even if i tried to inniate anything. They only get in contact when they need something from me...
Relationships dont seem to even work out in the slightest, because it seems that i am ""too romantic"". Things start well because i got looks and ""being interesting"" going for me, but i havent had anything that lasted more than half a year.
I try to get through every day, but lately i cant do that anymore without having the urge to cry every night...but funny enough, im not able to cry at all, because i got raised to not cry, so i rarely shed tears, even if i wanted to...
I dont know why i am even writing this, i never wrote anything on reddit before. I struggle everyday to keep on going through this shitty life, but i keep on going, guess that its worth to mention that its because of animes like ""zetman"" (especially the quote ""keep your head up high, because you wont find hope lying on the ground"" or something like that).

3514,BattleRadiant,1620334991,1,"Everyone has heard these basic platitudes, and of course they are true to an extent. There are a lot of people in dead bedroom/lonely relationships, as well as people who have climbed the corporate ladder and are left unfulfilled. However, a complete lack of romantic relationship experience or financial stability is almost a guaranteed way to mental anguish.

There is clear evidence that earning more money does increase your happiness, up to a certain point. Once you can comfortably cover your living expenses and some luxuries, adding additional income won't add much to your overall happiness. Likewise, being broke and struggling to even make ends meet adds a significant amount of stress and anxiety to peoples' lives. 

I  would argue that relationships are very similar. Having very little to no dating/relationship experience, despite desiring it, is almost a guaranteed way to depression and stress. Just look at the Foreveralone and Incel groups; depression and suicidal ideation are common in nearly every post. There are some people who can live fulfilling lives without a relationship, but it is definitely not the norm.",lonely,"""A relationship won't make you happy"" is the basically the same as ""money can't buy happiness""",2021-05-07 07:03:11

I found someone 2 months ago, on Tinder, no less. It was a mistake, we shouldn't have matched. He wasn't even in my city, he'd moved out a week prior. Some sort of app glitch had caused his profile to come through to me. He was cute, he looked sober. Nothing fancy, there wasn't anything that drew me to him in particular. He had this photo in one of the slides of this fat man holding a huge container of something red. He looked familiar, someone I'd seen on tv? Either way, I swiped right to ask him who that character with the funny face holding a large container of red paste(?) was.


We matched, and when I asked him, he told me that was a guy from The Office, and instant dread passed through my mind. I judge people who like The Office and talk about it like a personality trait. We shouldn't have matched. I'd have never swiped right on him had I know it was a The Office reference. He said the guy in the shot spills tomato soup he worked really hard for and he could just relate to that. A little bit of small talk, and we started really bouncing off each other. I LOVED talking to him. We texted for hours, and the next day I didn't know if we were going to talk again. He texted the next night though, and we started scheduling Discord calls where we'd just watch YouTube videos together, and then movies and then listening to songs together.


Well it's been two months since we started talking, and we end every conversation with ""I love you"". If I'm being honest, I don't know how real this is, but having someone to say I love them is a privilege I will never take for granted.

I don't have the complete picture to analyze my shortcomings because we all possess blinders, but I do have the best picture of anyone out there. After all, who knows us better than we know ourselves?

If I can shorten the point of this to my pursuit it would be the following:

Knowing full well that personal relationships require give and take in regards to effort and expressing interest and investment, I feel like any fair definition of friendship doesn't actually apply to any of my relationships at all. Some people call themselves my friends, and for certain periods of time I experience tiny group interactions a few times a year, but I don't know how to properly calculate the process of showing apathy v. overbearingness to maintain these friendships if they are indeed genuine. Where is the sweet spot? Or am I just really that boring and socially undesirable? Is it fixable?

To try to counter a holistically negative description for a bit, I have improved a lot as a person. I'm more responsible and confident than ever. I lost the 130 lbs I needed to lose from high school to have a healthy body and I'm pursuing a career to be a high school math teacher after being in professional doldrums for quite a few years. I have a lot of common interests with people and I've been told I'm personable and genuine, etc. A lot of those qualities are just a basis for everyone, though and don't stand on their own to be a desirable friend.....

The act of writing this even robs me of sympathy for myself, so rest assured that's not what I'm seeking. I would rather further my heuristic and sense making to navigating relationships in every environment because I want to be happy. Everyone ""says"" that, but i want to genuinely be happy and have meaningful relationships outside of just my birth family. Ultimately I want a family of my own, but that level of relationship is even further off so I'm trying to work my way towards being desirable in a less serious context first (I think).

The tl;dr version: I suck with people as evidenced by my loneliness and others' actions if not given to me by advice or truth telling by others.

One hurts in a gradual way that doesnt make you feel startled or suddenly aware of it. The other is immediately and dizzying. You remember it. You fear it. Even though it's not as frequent as the dull ache, it's so much more obvious and unforgettable. So you choose the dull ache indefinitely, for days... months... years... you hurt.

I'm spending the last night of my 20s really alone. My husband is in the hospital fighting an infection. I am glad he is getting better and will be coming home soon. We are actually really relieved because he has a diagnosis and answers and it's all going to be okay. 

Last year, my family forgot my birthday and also mothers day which comes a few days later. It was a really hurtful disappointment. I always had this idea that if my birthday were ever glazed over by my mate, I would consider that to be the end of it. 

I have spent most of this year with that disappointment in the back of my mind.  It bothers me and it was never really addressed or resolved, because It makes me feel greedy and undeserving or entitled and obnoxious. But my heart is broken over it.

But now the poor guy is in the hospital- who cares about a dumb birthday when your husband is in the hospital?  My daughter is crying. My toddler is confused. My oldest is moody. Celebrating isn't really on my mind. I'm worried. I miss him. 

My father died on my birthday 20 years ago this year as well so it's just all super uncomfortable and I can't help but feel sad right now. I don't have any friends.

we planned our very first in person meeting when i was 15. she would fly from maryland to come see me, she'd rent a car, pick me up from home, and we'd spend the weekend in a hotel room. i was madly in love. she let me drive the rental truck. someone came all the way here to see me, how lucky am i. when my parents found out, the feds became involved.


shit hit the fan. it's been almost ten years, she's still in custody waiting to be deported. for so long i thought it was love. spent my savings on defending her. they added more time to her sentence when they found out we were still in communication. apparently we weren't supposed to talk. i had a burn phone from cricket. they had tapped phone lines. i hired a lawyer, dropped the no contact order. i couldn't quit her. 


we wrote letters back and forth, so many letters, confessing so much love, for so long. i'd fill the pages in my best words. i thought she was the one, that i'd move to another country to be with her. leave my family behind. this was all a mistake, i wasn't a victim. i wanted her. in the worst way.


piles of letters, filled with words i spent so much time swooning over. stamps, my name, so lovely written, sometimes with hearts decorating the envelope, sometimes with a scent i can never forget. she was proud of me and my accomplishments out here, she wasn't mad at me, she didn't hate me, it was her fault. she was doing well. she was becoming an electrician. in jail. you can do that. i know that because of her.


my heart broke when she told me that someone she had known during her stay got the letter ""R"" tattooed on their finger. that meant that someone else loved her in the way i loved her, all the while i thought her love was solely for me.


i've been depressed for almost ten years straight, bitch gave me ptsd, tried so many different meds, therapy, ketamine injections straight to the fucking vein, just trying to get her out of my head. lately, i see her in my sleep so vividly, doing so much better than me, and it hurts every time. to see her with other girls makes me so jealous in my dreams. i miss her in the worst way. i loved her something fierce.",lonely,i wish we never met,2021-05-06 12:57:44

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

3625,imonabloodbuzz,1620266501,1,"I‚Äôm emotionally weak. I know.

I recently met a girl online after giving online dating one last try. We hit if off immediately. We had so much to talk about over text. It was the first time a woman took genuine interest in me in my 25 years on Earth or so I thought.

We went on our first date. It felt like reconnecting with an old best friend. We walked 9 miles together, we had so much to say. She was funny, kind, thoughtful and gorgeous. She had the most unbelievable eyes. Yet she was going out with me, a socially awkward and average looking virgin. We didn‚Äôt need to discuss whether we wanted a second date, it was assumed. Same thing with the third date. And the fourth. No sex, but I had my first kiss ever with her.

We‚Äôd send hundreds of texts a day. About dinner, work, or whatever. She‚Äôd say good morning every day because she got up earlier. We‚Äôd share songs, podcasts and actually listen and discuss them. Some of her recs were totally of no interest to me, but I listened for her. 

I learned about her small midwestern hometown, her uncle‚Äôs war stories, and her favorite candies. I told her about my elderly dog back home and what instrument I played in middle school.

Things just fell apart on the fourth date. After a few hours of great conversation she dropped the hammer on me with the ‚Äúi‚Äôm not ready for a relationship and idk why I‚Äôm dating‚Äù lines. I was shellshocked. It came out of nowhere. There was nothing I said that she reacted badly to that I remember. She INSISTED on paying for drinks on several dates and did, I wasn‚Äôt being used as a meal ticket. 

She told her parents and sister about me and she even got express shipping on a dress once because she wanted to wear it to our date. We had 100 different dates planned. And she just ended it..poof.

Weeks after this ended, I‚Äôm in a constant state of emotional torment. Sometimes I have to take a break from work (wfh) to cry in my bed. I get excited when I receive a text for a split second when I hope it‚Äôs her but it‚Äôs always someone else. It‚Äôs only gotten worse.

I deleted her social media, number and our text convos. It hasn‚Äôt helped. Time hasn‚Äôt healed it, it‚Äôs gotten worse. I see friends and focus on work but I just think of her the entire time.

For a couple of weeks I have lost the energy to finish my college homework, it is only 3 more weeks and I will graduate but sometimes I just lose myself on the internet for hours until dawn, I get strength and it motivates me for one reason only, that I can look for a job and go to the city when i graduated.

Since the pandemic began I had to return to my town and well, I'm at my parents' house and they are not the problem (it doesn't even bother me that I don't have my own room here, I practically live in the living room because my old room it is now a warehouse of things that nobody uses). The problem is that I feel like I don't belong here, I went to the city almost 6 years ago to study architecture, when I finished high school I was 17 and spent a sabbatical year but from there I distanced myself from my hometown.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Context\*

I lost my childhood friends twice, when I was 12 and 14, the first time, and middleschool was a disaster, the third year was the worst.

The last day of school I almost had a fight but I was just watching and they left me alone, since then I never went back to that school, I could never do what I wanted, play xbox with my two best friends for a whole afternoon or online, because those two whom I considered brothers ended up pushing me aside just a month after my birthday when I finally had a console to play with. They became part of those who would make my last year a disaster, I was left without friends, without classmates, and without anyone who would talk to me in the whole neighborhood, and I was someone closed for problems at 12 years old, at 14 years who would say that I would exclude myself by not having anyone. My friends list on xbox were strangers that I added while playing Gears 3.

I was afraid to enter high school, I thought that when I stepped on the entrance everyone would laugh at me for everything that happened but no, it seemed as if I simply did not exist. It took time but I was able to make friends a month later and in second year I got the best group of friends I had but it was just that, one year. We graduated and we all had to take different paths, and for all that I lived I never talked much by message so I lost communication with them.

I went to study in the city, at university I made new friends again and although they are not many, they are good people. I was able to live a decent ""university life"" but COVID brought me back to my reality, to the place from which I was able to escape 6 years ago.

\*End of context\*

&amp;#x200B;

Everything bad that I lived in middle school ruined me, I was alone, without friends, and I only attended middle school out of my own obligation, because I never told my parents anything about my problems, they already had enough issues and I didn't want to worry them . Even with that, I found good people in highschool who gave me a hand and I managed to move on, slowly but moving forward. This last year of university that has passed is the last, and when I took the confidence to talk to a girl about trying to date (something I have never experienced before because of my fears), everything was ruined with the pandemic.

I am in the place that mostly only reminds me of misery, loneliness, humiliation and betrayal. Even having some friends, I do not take the initiative to send messages, I am not good at having conversations with them because although they are good friends we almost do not have things in common, sometimes when we go out we do things that I regularly do but they do not have that same hobby as me, and also they live in the city so I can't go out with them, and my student life will end soon. And now I will have to look for that experience of living a love in my work life, something that terrifies me more.

I had good times with my friends, little parties with them, going to play video games, walking through shopping malls and other places, but I could never live a true love, know what a girl likes me, a date, a kiss, not even grabs a girl's hand and blushes. (I'm obviously a virgin, but not living even some of that devastates me more)

That is why every day my desire to leave this place grows more, and live alone in the city, one place where, if I wish, I can stay crying alone in my room with no one around, but at least to have peace of mind, and that despite being alone I feel at least comfortable, I learned to some extent to embrace my loneliness, it is not wrong to do that, but, with it, my desire for a girl where I can lie down and cry until falling asleep keeps growing.",lonely,I don't belong in this place.

We were kinda best friends, duo at League of Legends, spent the whole day together playing or doing other things. And now she does those things with him, and me, 'have to be alright with that'.
We fought this past Saturday, because we were finally going to play a bit, told her to get in a call with me but she told she was already in a call with that people. In that moment I felt really bad, so told her I wasn't going to play and got out of the game. Then she texted me that I always say 'we don't play together anymore' and made fun of it. Told her to go back to her new friends and then she got mad, and wanted to end the friendship and stuff.
The moment she started that class, she changed for worst, ""I'm busy all day"", stopped texting me first, barely replied back with a few words.
I feel like shit. Told her I didn't wanted things to end, I entered a state of toxicity where I kept texting her and she ignores me. Last night told me if I keep texting a lot and with that kind of content, she'll block me.
So, here I am, trying to control me, lonely and depressed. I barely got any sleep since this past Saturday (5 days).

Hello everyone I hope you are having at least an ok day. I have massive amounts of platonic energy that has nowhere to go and I am constantly freaking out. All I want is to hug and embrace someone with them saying it will all be ok, and I would do the same back to them. I want to have that feeling that someone actually cares and you care back. None of these thoughts are sexual in nature and are purely focusing on just wishing someone was there. I want to cuddle with someone, to talk to them about all my crap and I listen to them talk about theirs. Someone to be there when times are hard for me and someone to be there for when times are hard for them. I feel I can never be loved because of the thing I am and my crippling social anxiety. I am kinda hopeless at this point with thoughts and feelings flying around my head aimlessly, I mean just look at my writing format. I have no life I sit at home and rot, yes I know I should get out and do stuff but my anxiety prevents it most of the time. 

That‚Äôs it, if you want to know a bit about me and my circumstances you can keep reading. Other than that thanks for reading my post

I cry everyday over the loss of my grade school years which I can explain what I mean in a second. I am a senior in high school have very few friends (mostly online) and have never dated, kissed, or been in a relationship. I suffer trauma when I was younger and I have almost no self confidence and I am a VERY in uncompetitive and overall submissive person who is also an introvert. I have thought about and almost tried to end it on more than one occasion. To return to my point I am crippled by the fact I am not a girl and never lived my life that way from the beginning, anyway this is not a trans post sorry. If I had to say anything positive about myself I would call myself a very patient and empathetic person or at least I try to be.

3660,SometimesWeNeedFood,1620247698,1,"I know it's not that easy, but [insert yelling here].

With that out of the way, cue December 2019. I've always been a reclusive, wary person shutting themselves off. That month, over christmas, I've been on a holiday with close family. My family is scattered, and the pieces that are in reach have large holes from people dying all over the place. Life and age are no joke, but that's a dance as old as time.

That holiday I had some time to think, and realized I'm more confident in myself than ever. So I decided that now would a good time to regain my footing in the social world. I planned to start the following spring, as during winter I would just freeze my butt off. Also that would give me time to figure out activities and events to attend and dig into becoming better with people. Reasonable and healthy, right?

Cue 2020. Cue Spring 2020. We all know what happened...

So back to my old life, right? Shouldn't be so bad?

After the second month of Zoom lectures I realized how the little trickle stream of socializing from just attending lectures in person had been keeping my mind somewhat lubricated. Now I was down to - hopefully - seeing my parents every weekend for dinner. It's mad how I could feel my motivation get stuck deeper in mud from day to day. The final third of the semester I attended my lectures from my bed, half listening, mostly wishing to... hibernate really.

Wake me up, when the lockdown ends.

Of course this is the time when I get the roundhouse kick from karma, for not caring for my social life before. I've had all these years in university for it, right? Now that I'm doing my master's, I should be in possession of a large enough network of people to help me get through, right? Except I wasn't ready to do that until that December 2019. Shiddlebricks Fiddlesticks.

From a logical perspective I won the jackpot by scoring a thesis I can do from home entirely, only in need of my computer and my brain. But this only makes everything worse to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I love that research and I write this text during downtime when my PC is doing its thang. But except for this weekly dinner with my parents, which sometimes doesn't happen because of lockdown laws, The only people I regularly interact are cashiers at the grocery store. Everyone knows how deep those conversations get...

I barely get to do activities. Nature doesn't cut it for me, and the one thing that seems to get my mind off things, karting, is very expensive for me. I'm living off savings through this thesis, so I have to be hyper careful about indulging in stuff. Thus I can't do it very often. Maybe once per month is doable for me for half an hour. But even then I don't get to interact with people too much there.

Before the pandemic hit, I planned on visiting game and car shows, talk up randoms and see if conversation would flow anywhere. During 2020 I was instead glued to discord and its servers. Sadly I made the discovery, that I might have outgrown the age group that settled down there. I'm in the latter half of my twenties, and that makes me about a decade older than the people active there. The difference in thought and the resulting difficulty to connect to someone on an interesting level is insanely apparent in that gap. It feels like the only thing I can offer is being a smartass about my experience to their situations. Don't get me wrong, I like to serve with my experience and help younger people not make the same mistakes I made, but it does make for a relationship that isn't particularly on eye level. Maybe it's me who is to blame for making it turn that corner, but I'm also out of juice to tackle that issue.

Another big issue I have with discord, and other social media as well, is this ""endless scroller phenomenon"", as I started calling it. You sit there glued to the screen and get dopamine shots from new content appearing. It's kinda like sitting in a casino. You are so excited to see the result of chance. ""...is typing"" is going to result in something new for the monke brain to clap the cymbals together over. Throw something in of your own and watch the roulette spin again. The same concept applies to [insert any social media here]. It wasn't enjoyment. It was straight up addiction. I had to get away from it.

2021 I reduced my social media exposure a lot. Outside of Youtube, which I use like TV would have been used 20 years ago, I haven't used much of the other social medias until recently. The inner pressure to be so secluded from humanity felt like I was doing a space-walk with a faulty suit. Both sides of the coin have their ugly face. Either I burst from loneliness, or I get hyper addicted to the social media roulette. If a sweet spot exists, it looks super slim and slippery to me.

I really don't know anymore. The solution is obscured by this [insert insult here] virus and the alternatives are tainted by a dopamine digging brain. I don't even know what to conclude from this experience. All I know is I needed to share this experience, insignificant in the mass of people with actual issues compared to mine. Maybe someone has something to say. I don't know.

Life sucks right now. I know I'm strong, but the moments of ""I'm close to bursting from loneliness"" are becoming more frequent now. I just want to interact with people deeply without having to fear being burnt in some way.

Either way. If you made it here, I wish you have some respite in this world situation. You deserve love and respect for what you do. You read through incoherent rambles of a person who has nobody to talk to except for their own voice. If you actually read it, you infinitely improved this person's wellbeing, because they know now they are allowed a little bit of attention to their thoughts.

This went on for the past 2 months, she has reported it numerous times, but nothing happened until she quit early in the day yesterday.  

She was in my area arguing with a supervisor when she quit, and on her way out she looked at me and told me to text her later, so after a few minutes I did.

After ending contact with my inmate penpal (knew him decades before prison, but it became obvious he just wanted $), I decided to 'get back out there' and rejoin this niche site for lonely ppl with diagnosed MI. Most ppl there are looking for dates, but it's for friendships too. A lot of deeply lonely men. I even paid for premium membership. 

I *literally* don't even get a single message. It's not a super active place, rarely ever more than 10 people online at any given time, but still. This happens with or without any photos. I often hide my pics, but ppl can request to see them...I don't even get requests. What's weird is all the other women get tons of messages. And I used to. I'm over 40, so I expect a natural dropoff in male attention (no matter how well I maintain my fitness and stuff) - but there's women older than me, who get tons of messages on there. They find partners too. I thought I would find community on this site and instead I feel even lonelier and more freakish. It's dehumanizing. 

I do get a lot of messages on other sites e.g. - okcupid etc. but I can't relate to 'normies' and I don't understand why people in my exact circumstances are ironically not interested in me.

3735,JEFFERS6969,1620199434,1," and I don‚Äôt feel loved by anyone, I am the last child of four in my family 10 years apart from my oldest sibling. It always felt like I wasn‚Äôt really apart of the family, it‚Äôs always been my mom dad and their three kids, and I feel like after I was born I was just an afterthought. My siblings are all out of the house and live near each other and are friends, while I am still at home alone. Things got worse once my parents got divorced and then I didn‚Äôt feel apart of any family, constantly moving and being torn in between them. I have two houses but no home and no sense of safety in my life. Everyone always has more important things to do than spend time with me. I have noticed that I have been craving attention more and more but never really getting any. I have done this at school too, trying as hard as I could to be funny to prove myself and make friends that I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore. I am unable to connect with anyone in fear of rejection and can‚Äôt be real with anyone. I make friends with people just to have someone to be with.

During quarantine, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and began self medicating with porn, every bad day I would make myself feel better until I was doing it on good days too and finally everyday. I knew that it was bad but I didn‚Äôt care at all. Since then I have been craving something more, I started drinking and smoking weed, but overdoing it every single time. I couldn‚Äôt ever casually smoke or drink, I had to get unbelievably fucked up every time. The only thing holding me back from being an addict is accessibility. This weekend I started early and hung out with some 4 people, we started by smoking and taking a few shots and as the night went on we bought two bottles of vodka and started drinking, by midnight we drank 1 and a half bottles and I was finished. We went crazy went to sleep and woke up at 8, and I decided to drink the rest with the help from some others. I remember myself saying something along the lines of ‚Äúfuck it give me a needle and some heroin‚Äù and just wanting more and more and more. I know this progression could be the end of me and it doesn‚Äôt scare me, I just want to feel better, I want to feel loved, I want to feel excepted, and I want to feel warmth and safety.",lonely,"I am an addict, and I am lonely.",2021-05-05 17:23:54

I may only be 19 years old, and there may be some of you who'll say something along the lines of ""you have your whole life to fall in love"" or whatever, but I don't want to go through the trials and tribulations of such.

I knew a girl back in middle school; let's call her Christina. We started becoming friends after our friend circles started colliding. Best way to describe her: imagine that shy, nerdy, cute girl you secretly had a crush on when you was 12 or 13. That was basically her in a nutshell, so you can imagine how surprised and happy I was when Christina asked me out. I said yes, and we became a couple. Throughout our relationship, though, she was shy to do a lot of things. She was shy to hold hands and hug in front of people. So, when it came to the times Christina kissed me on the cheek, it took a lot of courage for her to do so. As for me, I was patient and told her time and time again we can do intimate things only when she was 100% comfortable with it. (As you'll come to find out, Christina was the type of girl to expect me to do the complete opposite of what I said.) A bit later in our relationship, Christina became distant when it came to talking and being around me. When she wasn't saying anything despite my insistent asking, I had no choice but to turn to my friends. Turns out, they were trying to find a way to tell me: Christina was cheating on me. And, sure enough, she was. And, to put it simply, she was NOT a shy person whatsoever. Christina is the type of girl who wanted to be dominated by a man rather than being with someone who was patient; I didn't fit that persona she wanted me to be, which led to her telling me the reason why she cheated on me was because ""I didn't act like a man."" Also, she was going through developments in her sexuality that made her loose attraction to me, and she thought ignoring me was going to get me to leave her alone. With that being said, I was played from the beginning. Christina asked me out, only to not be honest with me when it came to how she wanted to be treated or being open about the changes in her sexuality, but rather, chose to cheat on me despite her initiating our relationship.

Something similar happened with another girl I dated during my sophomore year of high school; let's call her May. May and I have known one another since the summer before our freshman year, and became friends within our friend circle. May experienced a rough breakup during our freshman year when her ex cheated on her. So, cut to our sophomore year, May got ahold of my phone number and asked me out. She was another girl who I secretly had a crush on, and she's been having a crush on me for about a year or so, so I said yes. We were both busy in our lives, so it took a lot of energy from both of us to be with one another. Until, she broke up with me through text out of the blue. And, she went back to her ex, only to break up with him again when he cheated again. Basically, May asking me out was based on a quick impulse, based on the small crush she's had on me for so long. And, our relationship was nothing but a void to fill while May was still healing from a breakup, only to go back to the guy who already established himself as not loyal. My time was wasted yet again in maintaining another relationship that would mean absolutely nothing. 

You may notice that these relationships only began because I was being asked out, and not the other way around. I have asked out women in the past, only to be rejected every time I did. I never had a problem with being rejected or anything. It's okay when a girl doesn't like me, but the last time I asked out a girl is somewhat scarring to me based on the end result. I was friends with another girl back in high school, let's call her April, and we've been knowing one another since the eighth grade. So, we've known one another for a while. There was one point in our friendship where April and I were very close, and our friends saw something in us. (They never told her this, as far as my knowledge grants me. It was something they verbalized to me a lot at the time.) I wanted to ask April out, and it seemed like my friends read my mind when they were encouraging me to do so. So, I did. Only to be rejected. I'm okay with the rejection, except, she ghosted me from that moment on. It seemed like the close friendship we've had for years at that point just disappeared. She would always run away from me whenever we spotted one another in the hallway and among our friend circle. She would turn her head suddenly when we happened to meet eyes with one another in the hallway or if we were grouped in an activity together. Her silent treatment worked up until our graduation. During our silence, April dated an older guy who was long graduated by the time we graduated. From what I've heard, April was cheated on a handful of times when her boyfriend started seeing older women behind her back, and a lot of conflicts rose within her friendships because of her relationship. That aside, I never received any closure as to why she treated me asking her out as such a bad, taboo thing. Or, what she saw in the guy she would eventually date in comparison to me. So, I only have my interpretations as to why someone would react so strongly to that, and to be with someone else so problematic for so long. It made me look at myself in a bad light:

""Two relationships failed. First girl cheated on me. Second girl used me until she wanted to go back to her cheating ex. Now, I done ruined a long lasting friendship. What's wrong with me? Am I that disgusting to women that I can be mistreated and ignored so badly? Do girls see me as that disgusting and meaningless to either cheat on me or be with someone else who will inevitably end up hurting them? Time and time again even! Meanwhile, I'm over here playing love guru to all my girl-friends (""friends who are girls"") who already have boyfriends. Why do people see my opinions in such a way to where I'm the only person to talk to about relationships? It would make people think that I too am deserving of experiencing at least one good relationship, shouldn't it? Or, to come across one girl who'll treat me right? But no. I should've known better. After how many rejections I had. After how many times girls I didn't even know called me ugly. I should no better than to believe I'm worthy of being in a good relationship, or finding a girl who truly reciprocates the same feelings as I. Having passions and goals in life - hell, not cheating on people - means nothing when girls always call you ugly and whatnot.""

To this day, I haven't asked out another woman again. There was one point, however, where it seemed like I was close to breaking my rule when I met a transfer student during my senior year. She quickly found a boyfriend. Nothing wrong with that, except, I had to play love-guru again to another one of my girl-friends who was having boyfriend issues. Call me petty, but is that all girls see me as? Someone not boyfriend material, but smart enough to at least having relationship advice? It seems contradicting. I'm at a point to where I don't even wanna go through the possibility of going through the same hurt and self-loathing all over again. It's not like things are gonna get easier just because I'm in college. It's hard to find loyalty in my generation. With the amount of toxic feminist mindsets that women are influenced by, and the physical standards men are now expected to have in order to be considered dateable. No matter how often I try to keep up with my appearance or keep myself busy with my education and planning out the ongoing development of my entrepreneurship, those generational obstacles are not going away. Unless, I hardwire myself to become one of those cheating guys those girls end up falling in love with. It's not worth the personality change. It's not worth the energy of making yourself appear a certain way towards women. It's not worth going through the hurt. I do want to be in a relationship, though, don't get me wrong. I find myself shamelessly listening to girlfriend ASMR videos through my headphones while I hug a pillow to sleep. But, as I've said many times before, it's not worth it.",lonely,I never want to fall in love or have crushes ever again [SUPER LONG RANT],2021-05-05 15:32:51

3754,dmank007,1620188594,1,"I am going to write this in first person because it is simpler to write that way, but please interpret this as an observation regarding each individual person on the planet.

I was born, i was raised, and I have had thousands (if not millions) of unique experiences that shape the way i think and perceive reality around me. People are inherently selfish and think about themselves; not a single person (except for my father) in my entire life has truly given half a shit about me. This leads me to the realization that when I die, all of my experiences and wisdom that I gained throughout this existence will die with me.  No one will be able to live what i lived through, and those who come after me will never be able to learn from the mistakes i made, leading them to unnecessary pain and suffering.

No one will ever ask me ‚Äúhey xxxx, what do you think about this philosophical issue?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhey xxxx, what‚Äôs your viewpoint on yyyy.‚Äù  People always want to talk about themselves and never leave room for the other person to insert their knowledge or potential expertise into a situation unless it benefits them in some way.

Therefore, when i or another person dies, we have a  grossly inefficient transfer of knowledge simply due to our inherent selfishness, and this makes the world a darker place.  And the understanding of this concept (at least through my eyes) is lonely as fuck.

I really do not want to become a hateful incel. I have serious confidence issue due to repeated rejections and weight issues. For a long time I thought that only assholes get the girl and that nice guys don't even finish. I no longer believe that is about being nice or an asshole. I think it is about confidence. And that is my problem. The good news is that I have began a journey of self improvement. I have began lifting weights 2 times day and bike riding 3 times a week.

I dunno. Just would be nice to have someone to hold again and talk to but even if I did I'm sure I'd just mess it up. So for the past six years I focused on travel, hobbies, casual hook-ups, saving money etc.

So, even when we had fun, girls approached him and left me apart, just to get his number. It really made me feel like trash. Plenty if girls that were waiting us to stop talking in order to approach him. I‚Äôve never stopped comparing my life to his life. He‚Äôs always been popular, and plenty of girls. I didn‚Äôt care if he was full of girls, because i was looking for a serious relationship. But, some months ago, he got to know a girl ( she‚Äôs a model ) and their relationship is still going on. I‚Äôm surely happy for him... but life in not made to be happy for others.

Our friendship ended 1 month ago... when he sent me a nude pic of him half naked with this girl under her bed‚Äôs blankets. He knew that my situation with girls wasn‚Äôt ( and still isn‚Äôt ) great at all.

He was my only friend

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him and his perfect life, his perfect face, his girlfriend... he has it all... while i‚Äôm balding ( at damn 18 years old ) and ugly.

Im so scared of loneliness. For almost 6 years I talked to my ex boyfriend every single day, we talked about everything and shared even the littlest of things. We broke up more than a year ago, and since then its been difficult to adapt not talking to someone every day. I know this might seem bratty of me to say, but I cant seem to cope not having someone to share my day with.

I want to be able to find someone who is excited to talk to me, who wants to share with me, someone that always has me on their mind. Someone that can love me unconditionally. This makes me seem so needy... I acknowledge that immensely and I cant seem to shake it off

I wake up, go to work, come back home, work out, have dinner, take a shower, and go to bed, all while constantly checking my phone to see if someone has messaged me back. I recently moved to a new country and with the pandemic its been very hard to socialize.

But one thing I always had were brains. Im no genious, at all, but I always studied a lot (it helps when you have 0 friends) and so I always had great grades. I always won fights about controversial topics (race, sexuality, politics...) and that was kind of my most visible quality.

But in the last year, I lost that.

Besides that, this year has been so exausthing I just lost all track of news and whatever, making me always being criticized at every discussion.

Im not saying every person will relate to this, but it was the one thing I had garanteed was that, even if I would end up alone, I would have a good job, where I could do a meaningful thing. And now, I dont even have that.

I feel so lonely( this must be the right sub for me). I don't really have anyone to go outside with or be fully open about my feelings. I'm comfortable enough to go by myself to the park, coffee shop or similar places to hang out and I'm not having a bad time, but... these past weeks I feel so unmotivated to do that because I have no one to meet anyway. I'm also not a fan of big groups as they bore me honestly, and prefer hanging out with 1-2 people at a time and so far I didn't find anyone in the same boat as me. I tried Tinder, but the connection just isn't there. I also went to an improv class for at least one year, went out with the people there, and I made a pretty good friend, but after a while I noticed I was putting more effort, stopped texting first...and eventually the friendship faded.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to talk to others about your own loneliness because those who don't experience it so much think there must be a bad reason to why you don't have friends. I'm not the best, but I'm not a bad person either. I'm not any -phobic word, I always try to emotionally support my friends when they need to, I am a loyal friend and I have a whole universe I want to share. I don't look physically intimidating and I'm not some creep you'd wanna avoid at the gas station. It's just hard to find a meaningful connection since even as a kid I didn't have friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I get little to no physical affection and I wish I could find someone to be with. I tried to open up about my loneliness to some friends I have, but they weren't so understanding and I can't blame them. I can't help but wonder what went wrong. Why do I have to be so introverted? Why can't I also be the type that makes friends easily? I just want one best friend, is that too much to ask for?

3833,JustAnotherLonleyGuy,1620144959,1," This might be a bit longer and I am not a native English speaker or a good writer so bare with me

For background we are somewhere in Canada and both of us are immigrants(different home countries) both has history of going through tough times in our individual phases. We became friends about 8 months ago.

We used to talk everyday regular replies were common from both of our sides. Since we had traumatic pasts we usually get mental breakdown from time to time and as good friends usually do we talk each other out whenever needed. Mostly I get such mental issues because I am working at most toxic workplace that wont pay enough and need to work way too much (I do it for permanent residency other immigrants know what I am talking about).

Fast forward to March 1st week, we were talking regularly as usual and I was up all night in the morning she texted me around 4 in the morning (S stands for her, M stands for me) this is where I think everything went wrong but it must be my overthinking I am not sure!

S: hey good morning I am up super early.  
M: well I wasn't able to sleep unfortunately.  
S: you are still up what happened?  
M: try to sleep for sometime I will tell you later in the day, it is too much to sink in at 4 in the morning  
S: ok have a great day  
\*few hours later I text her what was wrong and what lead me to not sleep throughout the night\*

She did not reply for few hours and as she usually tries to calm me down and give the hopes that everything will be alright and so on.

But I noticed that now she was not replying to me as normally as she usually would, sometimes would take hours or even a day or 2. I thought she might be busy and her school exams were up so probably studying for that.

Fast forward around 3 weeks ago, thing were same she would reply late and would just ask me if I can help her with her assignments and what not that I usually help her with.

S: I am kind of feeling low  
M: you want to talk about it? I am always here if you want to vent it out  
\*No replies for a day\*  
M: hey everything ok there? I am worried for you now?  
S: I am feeling ok, my grandma is sick taking care of her  
M: feel free to let me know if I can be of any kind of help? Do you mind keeping me updated?  
\*No replies for 2 days, I thought she is busy and didn't want to be bothered\*  
M: hi, how is everything with you family everyone doing good? Always remember you have a friend that is always worried for you (She sometimes thinks that nobody cares for her)  
\*No reply throughout the day\*  
S: I am good, grandma is good. I am just binge watching on Netflix.  
M: Sounds good, carry on!

Few days past without no texts being exchanged, a night came when I was feeling low

M: I am feeling low  
\*few hours past\*  
S: I am sorry wanna talk? I've been just studying for the tests whole day  
M: sorry I didn't know that, please carry on I shouldn't have bothered you in the first place.  
S: are you mad at me?  
M: no I will not be mad at you like ever, I just want to tell someone that I was upset and your name stroke my head, sorry for disturbing you  
S: are you ready for your work tomorrow?  
M: as if I was good enough for a better job  
\*she liked my message\*  
M: I am sorry, don't be mad at me for this  
\*next day evening\*  
M: sorry for last night, I hope I haven't blown up our friendship  
\*no replies for 2-3 days\*  
S: can you help me with this test?  
M: sure  
\*we did the test and scored good (over 85%)\*  
S: can you help me with another test  
M: sure  
\*after 2-3 questions she did not reply at all and after 3 days and last day of semester\*  
S: almost done with the semester only 1 assignment left, can you help me with this? It is due tonight  
S: omg I just noticed it is due at 9  
\*it was a project and the time was 6\*  
M: no worries we can get it done together  
S: I am failing this course  
M: we can get it done chill  
It was a group project should be done by a group of 2-4 members  
M: It says group members names should be written here, can you give me their names?  
S: I am alone  
\*project was done like 30 minutes before the due time\*  
S: what will I be able to do without you?  
M: I guess we will never find out, I will not let you alone, ever!!

After this she would usually reply once or twice everyday or every second day.

Fast forward to earlier this week (Saturday).

M: do you have few minutes to talk?  
\*after like 4 hours\* (note: from now on all her replies are after the duration of about 20 minutes to 1 hour)  
S: sorry I was talking nap what's up?  
M: does it feel like I am forcing a conversation on you and you just don't want to answer me, did I do something to upset you?  
S: why would you say that?  
M: you don't reply for sometimes days and the other night you left me on seen and throughout the night I was just wondering if you are mad at me and you will probably never talk to me again  
S: I am sorry, I am just binge watching on Netflix, and my notifications are also off.  
\*we had a deep conversation that night with the same late replies duration\*  
(Sunday)  
M: why have you never given up on me?  
(Monday)  
I was at the client location she started working there, and her colleague called me to fix something.  
I was her and said Hi, and did my thing and left  
S: why were you in such a rush  
M: sorry I thought I was done, did you want something?  
S: just wanted to say hi,  
M: I said Hi to you and you never replied! I can come back after my work ends I will be around the corner for some groceries  
S: no that's fine  
M: ok  
S: I know I haven't answered you, I don't know what I want to answer  
M: you don't have to answer/reply if you don't want to. I've been pushy lately it's ok I understand.

Its been a day now and she has not messaged me. I am starting to think the she will never message me now and the friendship is done.

Something to understand from my perspective, I never took more than like 20 minutes to reply, especially when she needed support, help etc. So not that I am re reading some of the texts, I feel a bit insulted that she prioritized Netflix over replying to me.

I do understand that she does not need to talk to me day and night but replying after few days? Especially after talking day and night and discussing about our day? Is it weird only for me?

Now I am just sitting waiting for her text, I do want to just tell her that this was so upsetting for me but I feel like I will be ignored forever.

I am thinking that this is just my overthinking mind saying everything, so here I am trying to cry my heart out to kind reddit strangers. I do like her was planning to ask her if she wants to be more that friends, but before that I have to get a better job which is a bit difficult because 1) Immigrant(yes companies do not accept immigrants as their employees, only those who do are immigrants as well and know that employees will do anything to keep their job) 2) COVID-19

3838,slong35,1620142773,1,"Sorry for a long post but I need to get some things off my chest so I figured that sending it out there might do some good. I already posted this on the therapy subreddit but literally nobody saw it. I don‚Äôt want a pity party or lots of attention but I at least wanted to share a few things with people and see what they think. 

I‚Äôm 26 and have been diagnosed with chemical depression but I‚Äôm pretty convinced I also have some anxiety issues as well (based on a few other family members that obviously struggle with it but are too proud to go see a doctor for it.) I take medication but it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. I regularly exercise and have taken therapy before but neither one has been any sort of relief toward the issue.

So I‚Äôll list a few of the problems that I‚Äôve been dealing with (even though there‚Äôs much more to them than what I‚Äôll put in here.) I‚Äôve wanted my life to be much more of an adventure but I feel held back from the things I want to accomplish. Not just from my family but also by myself. I don‚Äôt have much respect for who I am, what I look like, how shy I tend to be, and all the things I‚Äôve spent years on to try and build in my life (music, drawing, learning languages, etc.) I‚Äôve always wanted to live and work in Japan. I went there for a study abroad program back in 2017 and I fell in love with the people, culture, and rich history there. I also felt strangely at home because many of the world views and mannerisms I experienced over there were very similar to how I feel and look at the world. Anyway, I want to go there and start with a teaching job but I don‚Äôt feel worth the trouble. It‚Äôs either I go there and leave my family, or stay here and be miserable. Kind of a ‚Äúlose-lose‚Äù scenario from how it feels.

I‚Äôve never been good with dating but I crave the feeling of being loved by someone. I also want to be a dad more than anything in the world because I feel like there‚Äôs so much love that I have to give. It‚Äôs just excruciating to have that kind of a desire but never being able to achieve that. The only relationship I‚Äôve ever been in finally had me thinking I was getting close but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that she was only with me because she couldn‚Äôt find anyone else that would marry her and I was simply her version of ‚Äòsettling‚Äô. I really feel like I did love her but I had never actually been in a real relationship so I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Long story short I ended up breaking things off with her. I still think about her a lot but she‚Äôs married and has a kid already so I feel like I missed out on a real shot at happiness.

There‚Äôs much more than these two examples but the gist is that I feel like human garbage and not worth anyone‚Äôs time. This stuff has been on my mind a lot (especially in the last few days) and I wanted to put this out there and see what people might think (from an outside perspective I suppose.)",lonely,Wanted to get this off my chest.,2021-05-05 01:39:33

3841,Dismal_Orchid555,1620141914,1,"Today I ended up having a long conversation with this friend (let's call them F). I was expressing my concerns about some tests and my friend was not having it. F's attitude was why are you worrying? relax. what's the point now?. I expressed  in agreement that there was nothing I could do about it too  but her unwillingness to understand that sometimes concerns can linger was off-putting.  I told F that while she may not care, I did because it was my responsibility to. F called me out for being hostile and rude. She really dug into me and claimed that it was the main reason she was rarely inclined to just talk to me. My blunt and 'hostile' attitude was quite a turn off on multiple occasions whenever there was a difference in opinion. This wasn't the first time F has called me out for being rude. To add to that I'm too dull for her. Anyways....

 The whole point of narrating this is to admit that I may be passive aggressive sometimes. When I'm crucified for something that doesn't strike me as deeply rude/offensive I'm hurt but even more so since I've let myself become that way. This incident is important to me because I opened up to F  about a serious personal issue a year ago....something that my own family members have struggled to voice to those close to them. So F became really important to me from that point on. But now I feel regret and confusion. Everyone has baggage but maybe it's gotten to me. Maybe I have cracked a bit. But now I look at myself and wonder who would empathize with my attitude. I think back on those who are worse and have no control and let themselves run free with their aggression.....I think about if I'm one day going to become like them. Now I wonder if I would be able to empathize with them......because I too am asking for that type of empathy........

anyways I feel better articulating everything in this form....so that's one positive take away......I guess",lonely,I'm tired of titles ....read if you want to,2021-05-05 01:25:14

No amount of money,  gaming machines,  or worldly possessions is going to make the pain go away,  yes thay can provide a temporary (very temporary) distraction but nothing else.

But we talk on the internet, not just often. My grandma and uncle are here to supervise us but we've had history of rocky patches - we used to be so close but not anymore. Barely spoke here in the household for years. 

And so everyday the loneliness and the longing caves in so much that I find solace in things that aren't supposed to be helpful to me. Seeing other children close to their parents, being hugged, comforted or even just having fun with them makes me envious and make my heart churn.

It's pathetic to feel this way, knowing I should be thankful instead for parents that strive hard for my education. So hiding it is the best way. I just open up here.

LAH was an action comedy that frequently broke the fourth wall and was a completely original masterpiece that was also a parody of itself and was way ahead of its time. It had Tywin Lannister as the bad guy, Random Task as the henchman, a literal cartoon cat as a cop, a freaking Shakespeare skit, and of course Arnold as the wise cracking never ending source of dad jokes.

Look at the most successful action movies of the past decades i.e. Marvel, they‚Äôre all action comedies. The best ones are self aware and make fun of themselves and their own characters. The heroes are as humorous as they are ass-kicking, and the bad guys are literal comic book villains. LAH was simply ahead of its time, born in an age where action movies had to be serious, the audience of the 90s wasn‚Äôt ready for a comedic action hero Arnold.

It‚Äôs a shame LAH got stomped at the box office by Jurassic Park. It was completely original and never got a sequel.

I‚Äôve always been ok not being the person any of them are the closest to, because I had my best friend. We used to date until she got overwhelmed by the concept of dating, and broke up with me. I love her SO much. I‚Äôd practically do anything for her, but I also consider her the worst thing that‚Äôs happened to me. Since meeting her 2 years ago, I‚Äôve become completely codependent on her. She loves me, she knows me more than anyone. I have a hard time feeling myself and comfortable with others (as much as I love having friends) and me and this girl could spend weeks on end together. We did everything together, she would get more angry at others than I did when people were mean to me. She loved me just as much as I loved her, or more. A bit ago I stopped talking to ALL my other friends, I only needed her. I‚Äôve kind of regained all my old friends not too long ago though.
But recently she told me she just, doesn‚Äôt feel connected anymore. She hasn‚Äôt been feeling disconnected from everything recently. It‚Äôs just me. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be bothering her or anything either, she seems pretty happy when we have our weird conversations like we‚Äôre two strangers that don‚Äôt have a connection. She always takes a while to answer. I can‚Äôt be honest to her about being sad, I know she‚Äôll just get awkward and leave and I can‚Äôt deal with that.
I‚Äôve recently got incredibly clingy to my other friends. I don‚Äôt want to be alone thinking about the possibilities of losing her for one second. But without her there, I can‚Äôt connect to anyone, but I still feel clingy with them. I know I both like them more than they like me but feel less connected to them than they do to me simultaneously. It‚Äôs really getting to me. All of them are there for me, but the thought that they‚Äôre helping me even though they don‚Äôt feel very close me, really hurts. 
I probably sound like some guy who can‚Äôt get over his ex, but I‚Äôm autistic, I‚Äôve never gotten this type of connection in my life. She‚Äôs also autistic and understood my special interests and would comfort me when I got sensory overload.

Every situation where Im starting to talk to a girl I really think I have a chance. Then things take a U turn. I will give u a couple examples. I was dating this girl for literally a week and we were really good friends before, so we connected. Then all of the sudden she dumps me for another guy. Another example is the most recent one (reason i‚Äôm writing this post). This story is really fucked btw. So I was scrolling on snap one day and added a ton of people. I then added a light-skin girl that wanted to know me. We met up and we instantly connected. By the 4th time we hung out she kissed me and we were flirting heavily. She was sitting on my lap and shit and touching me a-lot so I thought I was about to have someone. Then we hang out for the 5th time and she was acting extremely moody. When I first get there she gets her brother or someone to tell me if I hurt her he will beat tf out of me. I was confused cuz we weren‚Äôt dating. After that she calls a friend and her friend starts talking about me. She asks if Im her bf and she immediately says nooo as if Im disgusting. She then said I was a bad kisser ( even though it was a peck). I felt kinda hurt by that so I asked her what I did wrong. She didn‚Äôt answer me so I asked a couple more times. She then starts to call another friend so I put my headphones in. She got offended by this and asked why I did it. I ignored her and shortly after I said y‚Äôall hear sum as a joke. She immediately gets mad and says shes going home. I tell her sorry but she keeps walking. I then apologize on snap when I get home but she leaves me on open. 30 min later her brother starts texting me on her account saying I fucked up and he was gonna beat tf out of me. I was so blown away by this because all I did was a stupid joke. Then after that she sent me a snap saying bae‚Äôs streaks. I think she had a bf the whole time or she wants me to back off. All I know is that hurt me for a bit until the brother came in and I was like this girl is crazy. Tell me what u guys think. Was I in the wrong or was she. Also if u pm me I will drop a pic so u can tell me if Im ugly or not. Some people think I am and others don‚Äôt. I think I dont look too bad but idk anymore.

3886,Werbezeugvu,1620117961,1,"Hi, I (25m) have been lonely my entire life. I had a couple of relationships with a few girls for a short time, but it didn't end well. In fact, I was riducled by them because of my timidity and devotion to them. Yeah, I guess it was pretty weird for them to talk with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that my main issue is that I'm too sensitive, and women around me don't like it all. I get attached to people easily and am an open book when it comes to my feelings, sadly often not thinking about the consequences. I don't wanna wait a long time to become an important person in one's life, so girls tend to consider me too intense and ghost me. Just can't control this. One of my ex-GFs told me that I will never be happy if I continue being like this, and she's probably right. I was trying to change my personality to become less sensitive, but it didn't help much. I can't fix my romantic nature, and it seems I never will. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I don't think I need to be so depressed about it. I have a very cool job, I travel a lot, and I'm in great shape. I think it would be great to find someone who will accept my personality. But I don't really know from where to begin. I've never used dating websites to meet anyone, even Tinder, because I know they're full of fakes or scammers. I guess most of you will understand what I'm talking about. The only thing I ever used for searching someone was [onlysearcher.com](https://onlysearcher.com) to find some girls in my locations who make kind of sensitive pics. It was just for fun and I didn't mean to talk with them or smth like that.

Left the house post haste, befor I said something else stupid and regretted it nearly immidiately. I wasn't wrong, just lacking in tact, as ""my better self "" would say. 

My Better Self

They did what better selves do. Stood by the ones they cared about, no matter what, right or wrong. Loyalty was one of the few things that no one could ever take away from you, or force from you. Like respect, it is earned, and when it is mutual there can be strength like no one could comprehend. They took it to the mat, took punches took time, and and hits. They did all of the things that a better self is expected to do, and really more than that sometimes. Giving of themselves until, sometimes there was so little left they would fall into bed just long enough to start to fall asleep, when the alarm clock would remind them of their promises. Suffering in silence is the better self credo, as I'm sure you know. 

They did the thing that makes a better self into a Best Self. They gave everthing that they had, or were ever going to have. Stepped in front of the bullet with a smile on their lips. 

At least thats what I have been told. Usually just before asking why I can't be like that again. 

If I could, don't you think I would? God, I fall asleep every night begging the Universe to please, just let me wake up him. PLease... The light is gone, though. and all that remains is the shadow. I can remember most of what made him, me, me. It's just not automatic. It's studied. Out of sync with my new sense of perception. I have to work hard as hell to be kind.

We‚Äôre good now, they‚Äôre just not back in the gc, so its not like it used to be. I have people to sit with at lunch in real life, 4 friends that ive known since last year, but outside of lunch we dont actually talk much. And when we do text it‚Äôs just casual. 

I‚Äôm in three other group chats and I met some people online, but I simply don‚Äôt feel a connection to anyone anymore. I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù I guess.

3921,Dangerous-Stick-831,1620099375,1,"Ever since I was little, I always remember being alone. While in preschool other children would be playing amongst themselves, I would be playing with woodchips imaging I was the protagonist from *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*. There would be a few times I'd play with other kids, but my interactions were limited. I remember one time in kindergarten there was this kid new to my school, so I befriended him. I held a birthday party that year, but he didn't show up. At school the following day presumably, he told me that he didn't come not because he was busy or anything, but because he didn't want to.

Throughout elementary, I would try to fit in with other students, but I was always following people versus leading them. There was this one boy in my class that was very charismatic and would control what the majority of people did during recess. Every year, I remember hoping I would get invited to his birthday party. Sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't. I would always feel sad and left out when I wasn't invited. Throughout elementary, I did partake in sports and scouts, but this didn't help me make friends at all.

Fourth grade or so was when I started to feel like I didn't fit into society, and society didn't want me in it either. Multiple times, children would tell me their parents said not to hang out with me. I don't feel this was warranted. I wasn't that bad of a child. I'd disrespect adults here and there, and I used curse words. None of this was too bad compared to the average child my age. I always tried to be civil and nice to people and corrected many of my issues before Christmas break that year. Nothing changed and this pattern of rejection and social outcast has persisted until today. I would only very rarely get invited to hang out with children my age outside of school, either through playdates or birthday parties. I would attend one out-of-school social event every three or so months.

In fifth grade, I reached my height of social popularity, but it didn't last long. I became somewhat of a class clown, but the teacher liked me, so I wasn't that horrible. More popular students in my grade thought I was funny, so I became friends with them. Still, this was around the time when everyone started getting cell phones. I never got a cell phone and didn't understand the appeal. I also, despite my in-school popularity, never was invited to anything outside of school. I was sort of that kid people would talk to in classes to pass time, but outside of this limited circumstance, there was no reason to talk to me. With this social isolation growing and me dropping out of extracurricular activities, I began turning towards the Internet for social interaction. Of course, I had been using the Internet for years, playing online games, but I had never tried making connections with people before. The Internet stopped being a way for me to simply play games I loved and instead became a drug of the social life I desired. 

Through Minecraft, I developed many friendships. Of course, none of these were long-lasting, and as soon as I stopped playing Minecraft, I lost all of these friends. Later I started playing Terraria again and made more new friends. This led to me getting Discord, which even further increased my amount of online friends. None of these friends stuck around; many seemed to disappear as fast as they appeared. My best friend one month would be my enemy the next, or they would forget about me or turn on me for seemingly no reason. 

Around this time, I started developing misanthropic feelings due to my loneliness. No matter what I did, I could never seem to get friends. I grew jealous of others for their successes and wondered what they were doing that I wasn't. I grew getting more sad and frustrated with myself. I found that just my username, like my name in real life, would lead people to automatically hate me. People would hear rumors about me and not even give me a chance. Numerous Discord servers I was banned from because of things people had heard about me, many of which were not true and spread by stalkers or people who betrayed me. 

I looked for a solution for this problem, and I thought I found it. I began making numerous alternate accounts under which I would act differently. I started first with accounts where I would say I was a foreigner. I didn't gain any online social advantages from this, but at least my name wasn't holding me down anymore. This series of alternate accounts led to me making accounts where I, a male, would claim to be female. I mainly just did it because I was curious what it would be like to be female, or at least act like I was female, much for the same reasons I acted like a foreigner before. I grew amazed with my social success. I was invited to multiple Discord servers and would be often invited to play games with people. This didn't last long for me, as it made me very sad. I knew the reason these people were friends with me was not because of my personality or anything, but because I was acting like a female. I wasn't myself. This instilled in me an envy of females, as I viewed them as already having an advantage socially due to being female (there are many less females in online spaces I hang out). The accumulation in this was gender dysphoria for about a year (sorry if that isn't the right term, but other transgender people I had associated with short-term had shared my feelings). 

I've been mostly talking about the online part of my life for the past couple of years, but that's because it was the only life I had. I only became more socially isolated. Throughout all of middle school, I think I was only invited to one or two parties. I didn't have any stable friends, and would even be deliberately outcast by people, probably by their parents' wishes. 

High school was nice as I was around a lot of new people. Throughout years of social isolation, I didn't even know how to make friends. People seemed to already have their friend groups set. The only attention I would get from others would be mockery. Males would mock me in front of females and their friends, giving me sarcastic compliments. Females would hold cameras to my face to post on their social media while laughing. I'm not an attractive person, and throughout all my life have been called ugly by classmates and family alike, so I think it is safe to assume people in high school viewed me more as a circus attraction of socially awkward ugliness than a human being. 

I would begin trying to find advice on how to not be a social outcast. I read that being confident is the most important thing, but I could never understand what the meaning of this was. Being nice and kind was another piece of advice, and something I understand. I would help struggling students with their work and quickly became known to be helpful. Teachers would even request that I step up to the board while they would run out of the room. Despite my attempts at being nice and friendly, people ignored me when I wasn't helping them with their schoolwork. On top of this, people would pressure me to tell them the answers on tests for school. Cheating makes me feel sick, so this led to me not being so eager to help people anymore.

When COVID-19 came around, I was refined to my house. I would go months without interacting with anyone outside of my dysfunctional family. I didn't have any online friends, and I didn't have any real-life friends. Everything seemed so lonely. 

This trend continues through today. I don't know how I will manage to get a job or have a family. I cannot even imagine myself outside of my parents' house. I get good grades, but I cannot even hold a conversation anymore. Stuttering habits have developed throughout COVID-19 due to my isolation. I've picked up some hobbies throughout COVID-19, but due to restrictions, I haven't been able to attend any events for these hobbies. 

I doubt anything will change in the future after COVID-19. I try to be hopeful for the future and continue waiting for the day that everything will make sense to me. I would try to do something to change my situation, but I don't know what I can do.",lonely,I feel like I never had the opportunity to fit into society,2021-05-04 13:36:15

For 3 years from 6th to 8th grade, I didn‚Äôt have a single friend and the bullying permanently damaged me. When I got to high school I was afraid of talking to people thinking I might get them mad at me or that I might do something wrong. I was afraid to try anything. I was a loner my freshman year. All I did was watch YouTube all day. I remember my family being pissed at me for being a loner and antisocial all day and compared me to family members my age. Made me feel worse but I wanted to break out of my shell. I joined track but once again the bullying returned because I sucked at running. I was always short and skinny. I was 5‚Äô5 and 100 lbs.

I was the youngest in my family, shit happened and my siblings never got the chance to go to college so I was the only one left. I thought that was my chance. I spent the entire junior year of high school studying for the sat and looking to boost my application.

I thought if I could get a good SAT score ppl in my school and my family wouldn‚Äôt see me as a loser. Ofc I ended up just applying to a state university.

My school was very sports focused and I didn‚Äôt really fit into any group and it was too late. Even the nerds didn‚Äôt want me. I ended up just staying home all day and watching YouTube videos like before until pandemic hit and graduation was socially distanced. I didn‚Äôt even wanna go to graduation.

Ever since then its been a culmination of things, my 2 extremely close friends getting jobs which with school has made it impossible to hangout with them. The other friends I have are good and they are friends, I just don't feel the same hanging out with them anymore as well.

In the beginning stages of quarantine I at least had an outlet sort of. I had discovered staying up till 3 in the morning and was using it to break down for hours on end. But with 3 days of breaking down at night and crying, I would have 1 extremely good day where I would feel amazing.                                            Now I can't even cry, no matter how hard I try. At best I just feel despair and regret in my chest. One night I drank a Bang and it made me feel horrible, I wanted to cry in the shower like the pitiful husk I have become but I ended up just standing and staring into the wall. The warm effect from the water did little to make me feel better. 

I have no motivation now, my grades are kept good just because I know Its something i should probably do but i have no will to do so. I don't want to go to college or anything, i would rather Work a retail job and live in a 1 bedroom apartment sleeping in my free time. Because that's just how bland my life has become. I can't smell either so the world seems even more grey (deviated Septum, not corona related).  

I lay in bed at night, thinking if my future will be lonely forever. Corona has sucked adding to this. Majority of people stay home at school or just don't go out that much so its been very hard just finding more friends over the course of this year. Honestly i don't know if it will get better. It's puzzling, I've never felt anything like it before, the true void of nothingness.

3956,Legataux,1620084668,1,"I tried connecting with a couple of people I knew years ago. That spark of connectivity is gone. There was no back and forth. It was just me asking questions and being a little nostalgic. 

I know getting a random message from a person you haven't seen for years doesn't illicit the desire to spill everything, but it would have been nice if they asked me questions. The flow of the conversations were so one sided. If I was on the receiving end I would be thrilled that someone from my life remembered me and wanted to reconnect.

I know online messaging is impersonal, but in the past that's how I communicated with my circle of friends. We game, go online, and say hello to each other. We'd message each other for hours until it was time to sleep and we'd say our goodbyes until next time. I felt that connection then. It's gone now. It hurts knowing that I'm basically a ghost. I'm just a distant memory. I have no friends anymore. I'm empty. 

It's like that feeling of being the only one left. That feeling of watching an empty world. Have you guys seen your friends list on an online game and everyone is offline? 

I play online games because there I forget that I'm alone. I get to say hi to people, even though it's more or less one time interactions. It distracts me from my reality, at least for a little bit. It helps me regain some of that feeling I had, where I was part of a community and I can regularly say hello.

Sometimes I just want to lay on my bed and sleep. I have a loving family, but we aren't friends. There's no dynamic back and forth. I know there's love between them and me, but friends are friends for a reason. My family doesn't socially satisfy me that friends do. I'm so starved for socialization that I remember every bit and piece of it because I seldom get any.

I still cling on to the past because that's all I have left. My memories made me happy, I fear that I won't make new memories with anyone anymore. It will just be me.",lonely,I am truely alone,2021-05-04 09:31:08

And when we first smoked weed together there were times where it felt like she thought I was ugly or would become super sensitive and lash out. 

So she texts me one day to tell me she met this guy friend and he‚Äôs cute and she wants to hook us up so we can double date with her boyfriend.

But she tearfully assured me that wasn‚Äôt what she was trying to do. She rebuffs his advances and never speaks to him again.

Every time we talk to someone, they minimize our problems. You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say ‚ÄútHeRe‚ÄôS mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG‚Äù and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won‚Äôt date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dares regularly and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like in your shoes

You tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say ‚Äúbut but those are just the highlights‚Äù even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say ‚ÄúBuT yOu dOn‚ÄôT kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy‚ÄôRe hApPy?‚Äù And how do you know they‚Äôre just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I‚Äôm sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.

They tell us that friends, social events etc aren‚Äôt that fun and we aren‚Äôt missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn‚Äôt go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn‚Äôt so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren‚Äôt fun why do people go to them all the time? 

Instead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.

These are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems 

This is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don‚Äôt get help. Even if they knew you won‚Äôt stigmatize them for being depressed they still won‚Äôt talk to you knowing you‚Äôll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. 

This is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people ‚Äútrying‚Äù to prevent suicide/depression.",lonely,"The reason depressed, suicidal or lonely people don‚Äôt get help is NOT because of the stigma against depression.

4003,MissyMensa,1620063154,1,"I‚Äôll start this by saying I‚Äôm a lucky person because I‚Äôve never struggled with friendships or anything like that but love is a different story. 

I grew up a fat, tall black girl in a majority white school and area. I‚Äôve always wanted reciprocated love. I‚Äôm a loving person and have always felt I want to love and be loved. For 23 years I never had reciprocated love or affection. 

Anyone I liked didn‚Äôt like me back and vice versa. I had my first kiss because someone initiated it for me at 17 and the next week at school the boy denied it even happened. He was obviously ashamed to have kissed me. 

I lost 40kgs lately and have been getting more make attention but not from anyone I actually like. I still don‚Äôt have the ideal body despite the weight loss. I still have a tummy that spills over and breast that look like they‚Äôve taken a beating.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly but my love life being nonexistent makes me think there‚Äôs just something about me that‚Äôs unattractive and unlovable. 

Last year for the first time I had a reciprocated ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô. We had a great connection at first. Obviously since it was my first experience with any kind of love and affection I struggled to contain my emotions. I caught feelings, he didn‚Äôt (I‚Äôm assuming). Slowly but surely he started losing interest and I got less and less of his time, attention and affection. He keeps in contact (if you can even call it that) but I think it‚Äôs just because he wants to still have access to me. 

I miss him so much and I‚Äôm convinced I won‚Äôt find anyone to have a connection like this again. I feel so stupid for falling for him and thinking he would fall for me too. 

I so wish I didn‚Äôt crave romantic love and affection because I think I‚Äôm supposed to do life without love. I‚Äôve been so lonely for so long and I don‚Äôt know how to get used to it.

Throughout the entirety of COVID I have tried to be positive, trying to see the end of the tunnel in hopes that I can resume my life in the outside world.

I am single, and have been single for the past 3 years after a rough end of a 5 year relationship. I had a summer short term thing happen which I hoped to be more, but it wasn't right for either of us. Before COVID started, I was at a point that I felt so good about myself, I had taken up the gym again, work was going well and my social life was brilliant. But I think after this long winter, my attitude has gotten really negative again.

I'm starting to feel like I'm becoming too old to be wanted, almost as if my life will end after I pass 30. I am terrified that I will be alone forever. I really miss intimacy, deep connection and being in a long-term relationship.

I find online dating extremely difficult, not because I am not getting matches and conversations, but because I feel like I'm window shopping people on an app and I've always met people organically. I've been on dates with people online, I've had good chats and I feel nothing compared to growing feelings for a friend, or someone that I met through friends or hobbies.

I know there's hopes with the vaccine coming along, but it's almost as if my brain has been conditioned to expect the next lock down, and another year going to waste..!

To give some context i used to work and that's all I did, 5 days a week, 8h+ a day always talking to people and interacting, coworkers as well as customers.
I was completely spent by the time my days came up and i spent it sitting in my room smoking weed and playing video games. The classics, not joining my friends for nights out because I was too tired, never making plans.

Eventually I couldn't keep it up and quit my job a couple months after covid started in effort to try enjoy my life a little but this step was the first to my issue spiraling out of control. Due to lockdown and restrictions i couldn't see my friends anyways if i wanted to make plans. I wasn't seeing my coworkers or keeping myself busy with work. I was cruising and relaxing after 3+ years of non-stop work.

To top it off i moved back with my parents as well, no free house to invite who i want. I was in contact with a friend who moved away, also was in a similar situation at the time but eventually they were able to go back to work as restrictions are eased in his country.
We used to talk every day and play video games, we had each other at least. Since he left i just have a void in me, he was the only person still close to me.

My parents and i are ok but they don't really interact with me if that makes sense, i stay in my room lonely and sad and they don't really come to me. I feel like they just gave up on me / don't really care, even though I think they do I'm just not sure why they don't put effort into showing it.

I don't live in my home country, been here since I'm 6 and I'm 25 now. I don't speak the native language 100% as i went to an international school and i feel like an outsider, even though everyone speaks English here and i can speak somewhat of the local language.

I really don't know what to do, I feel completely alone, none of my ""friends"" and family approach me to interact, i don't see any future for myself, I'm just stuck in the hole for the first time in my life, and unfortunately it's a huge hole so i don't know what now.

If anyone has some sort of advice i would love to hear it, I'm very desperate at this point :/",lonely,Lonely without an idea how to change it.,2021-05-04 00:52:11

I treasure these moments in my own exploration of the darker corners of my existence. These moments temporarily lift my spirit from this heavy haze into something lighter.. a reminder that no matter how desolate everything can seem, there is still some joy to be found, and connections to bloom. 

I wanted to share some music, and would love you to do the same below, I listen to almost anything so there is no preconditions here, sometimes the most unexpected sounds resonate in ways we hadn‚Äôt conceived yet, so I‚Äôm open and I hope you are too to my little online window here. I hope there is a slither of light to be found here for you.

It‚Äôs a pleasure to digitally be acquainted with you all, please be kind to yourself, I know I have to work on that. And if you ever need an ear, my line is always open.

I was raised in a way to think that girls are bad and nothing and a boy/male should never meet a girl, or have any kind of connections, even tho my parents dated and frikin got married, this lead to me having love for females in my brain but to feel accepted I showed what they wanted me to show and feel, my parents are so sexist but in a different way, both of them thinks that females are low, Idk im so sorry I am all over the place, idk what to say, to talk about. they never let me have any relationship, not consciously but by brainwashing me, plus the food they were providing was not healthy, just rice legumes and shitty cheap vegies (i hate cooked vegies), not much meat and proteins and good vitamin-mineral containing foods, but mostly we ate rice vig, tortillas with curd and shit like that(sorry not trying to offend, when u eat that shit for so long you'll too hate it), my cognition wasn't good in my childhood and most of my early teenage life, so I didn't understand much, plus we all used to go to sleep super late at night, and then they forced me to wake up at 3-4 am for prayer, which lead me to not doing okay at school, not mentioning all the mental illness (ocd adhd mild touretts  Hallucination )I developed from all this. (which is so bad that I haven't gotten accepted at any job I have applied, plus I feel so embarrassed to exist in a public place for my social anxiety), my dad was rich but didn't provided us with much and gave most of his money to his mom's dad. the house we live in right now is my mom's dad given house(maternal grandfather), and my mom didn't get a divorce even her therapist told her to, but because of the society and religious belief system she didn't get it, a few years ago my sister got a divorce and came to live with us in this small house, and she is evil, she cheated on her husband, got a divorce, came here, living with us with her kid, uses my mom work, eats here and cusses and swears at my mom, me, she also used to torture her kid when she(her child) was 2-4 years old by darkening her room, closing doors and windows and blasting horror sound and showing horror gore images to her child to make her sleep by yellig at her. so she came and because of her we had to get a big house on hi-rent for a temporary purpose and that caused me to leave school because it was too far from that house and other reasons, then they patched up then divorced again, now she has thrown her child at my mom n dad for care and shes working a job, and enjoying her self. there was a time in 2018 when I was finally getting better but that's when she came for the second time permanently and her negativity made everything a mess again.  I feel so like a trash bag being thrown here and there just like I'm nothing. I tried therapy, but it doesn't help. I always and still do, felt good about all the womens, but there's some out there, one like my sis, that are just pure evil, and dads just married my mom to use her as an object. I almost never felt loved by a girl at any age, and when I talked to my mum about it, she says ""you got me, you can love your mom"" in an evil tone, yea I can and I do love you mom, but there's a different kind of connection with a women whos not your own blood, but she doesn't understand this. I just hate them all now, so much, Idk why I wrote such a long-ass post, I am not feeling anything, sorry if you don't agree with me, and please correct me if I'm wrong. living life is just so hard for me now, that I just cant explain it, I don't want to exist, but I have failed so many times while attempting it and I don't wana feel that pain again anymore..

But we said we would be here for each other regardless of it all. And I meant it, T.

I know you‚Äôve been hurting, I know it hurts inside. You feel like a failure. Sick, but addicted to this ugly world. I wish I could open your eyes and show you just how beautiful you are. I wish I could hold your body against mine and make you feel alright. I wish you could see inside of me, and then you‚Äôd see the wonderful man that you are. 

But I know it‚Äôs not about me or the feelings that might still linger in the deepest parts of my heart. I only want to give you my unconditional love and support, my stupid jokes and weird stories. Only as a friend I open my heart to you this time, because I know we aren‚Äôt meant for this life. 

Meet me outside my old apartment. Wait for me next to the bodega. Standing tall and proud with your beautiful smile. Hug me once again. Once again I‚Äôd tell you how unreal it is to be here with you. How unreal you are and so perfect you are to me. 

I‚Äôd tell you how I‚Äôm no longer underweight, how I‚Äôve gained 10+ lbs since covid and that I‚Äôve joined CrossFit. Now I even juice and I‚Äôm getting ready for the summer. I‚Äôm so much happier and I think I‚Äôm falling in love with life. I‚Äôve met a man. He‚Äôs an attractive doctor and he‚Äôs got a line of women waiting to be next. Lucky me! I‚Äôve got his attention for now. We‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù (tho I don‚Äôt think we meant it) and we also joke about having babies. 

Lately things don‚Äôt feel as good with him. It‚Äôs fading. Like it always fades with everything. Although you never fade. But I wish sometimes you would too.

I was driving home after being with him and I thought about you with love. Honest, pure love. But not in a romantic way anymore, but with nostalgia. I thought long and hard about our friendship. How I miss having you in my life, my confidant. Maybe the timing was off, feelings were off, we loved differently, but one thing is for sure, our love for one another was pure. So I will carry you forever in my heart. Till the day I die I will think of you, my T. 

I‚Äôll marry someone like the doctor and my dream of having the perfect family will come true. But your memory will always linger in my heart and I‚Äôll think of you when I fight with him, I‚Äôll think of you when I feel unloved, and I‚Äôll think of the life we could have had. And I know you will think of me too and you‚Äôll think what if‚Äôs. 

I wish somehow I could make all the hurt in you go away. I wish we could hug one last time and this time I won‚Äôt let go. I wish I could say something and make you wake up from this bad dream. 
I wish all this love I have for you finds you and makes you feel a bit better. Find your happiness, T.

I'm really upset with the way my life is going right now. I wanna do so much shit so others can be happy but I don't think I can excel to that level. I've always looked down upon myself. I have very little amounts of friends except for my girlfriend and roommate. I don't want them to worry but my depression has been getting awful lately and I hate feeling lonely but constantly find myself in a lone position. If anyone wants to consistently just talk and become friends that would be amazing. I just feel like no one is even out there anymore.

This feeling is only peculiar to these nights and I guess I wanted to talk about it.

I feel lonely all the time- On these nights though, I either notice it less or it simply doesn't bother me. These are perhaps my favorite times of life, the peacefulness I feel is something I wish was with me all the time.

Sometimes, I wish I could just observe the world. I don't want to have to worry about life. I just want to see the trees blowing in the wind and the sun setting. Why can't everything just be peaceful? ""I can't wait to grow up"" I used to tell myself.. ""I want to be young again"" I now tell myself.. Oh how things change.. I guess everything changes.

Do you ever just reach a point in your sadness, where you feel at peace? like nothing can hurt you more than you‚Äôve already felt, it can‚Äôt get worse, so it has to get better, right?

4087,khvacant,1620007650,1,"(19M) I kinda wanna explain my circumstances and give background first:  

I‚Äôll start with the past which will be part of high school and then bring it around to the present:  In 12th grade I got into my first relationship, but that all fell apart around this time last year.  All my flaws were basically pointed out to me and I was left an anxious, insecure mess.   I ran track back in high school and I actually knew a good amount of people, but I felt super alone and messed up after the break up, and really didn‚Äôt talk to anybody.  I didn‚Äôt have any goals or a sense of purpose, shit just wasn‚Äôt going good.  Other than being at the gym or the job I was at, I was in my room embodying the phrase ‚Äúdown bad‚Äù üòÇ.  COVID was in its prime so that only made things worse. 

(For more context my father passed away in the midst of things me really becoming a man and starting to have those struggles.  I have uncles to go to and what not but that comfortable figure to go to for guidance isn‚Äôt there anymore, which is probably a major reason why I‚Äôm on here)


From there on, I‚Äôve been in situations where anxiety kicked my ass.  I realized a few things, a major one being that I really just gotta be myself and not put on some type of facade.  Point is, I began to understand a lot of the basic sentiments that are preached to people all the time.  

 Before this past year of college I knew I wanted stuff to change.  I began reflecting on myself and started doing things like no fap, meditation, cold showers, this that and the third.  In all this, I even discovered my passion for creating, and got into videography, photography, and things of that nature.  The only thing was that for the most part this school year, I was pretty much alone like I was in the summer.  I‚Äôm in a MUCH better headspace than I was then, and I‚Äôve grown to be fine with being alone (that definitely can depend though).  It‚Äôs also not like I can‚Äôt have a conversation with anyone, and I‚Äôm definitely confident in my looks (idk how relevant that may be, but it‚Äôs just a perspective showing where my head is at). 

Here‚Äôs my point: Sometimes I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúdamn, I‚Äôm really alone in this shit‚Äù.  I start to think back to how I had that one person everyday just to talk to whom I genuinely was interested in.  I begin to think about how i‚Äôm at college and how it seems as if everyone is enjoying a great social life but me.  Even regular ‚Äúguy talk‚Äù makes me semi-uncomfortable now because I haven‚Äôt really had experiences ever, let alone in college.  Just makes me feel more out of place 

Though I have been improving  myself I‚Äôve just felt disconnected, and as if I need something more.  I‚Äôve been really working on my passion and doing things with that, and I‚Äôm going to be working this summer too.  I‚Äôm just wondering if you guys have any advice on how I should proceed, and maybe tips on what to do if I start to feel down like I am right now.

The minor stuff: I‚Äôm always irritated and impatient. I have hatred constantly churning in my gut that sometimes it‚Äôs almost like it physically burns. I don‚Äôt speak to my younger siblings at all, and I have a not great relationship with my mom and her current husband. 

The big stuff: Not only am I quicker to anger, I‚Äôm positively evil when I‚Äôm angry. The horrible thoughts that sometimes go through my head make me sick to think about afterwards. 
Example #1: My moms first husband after my dad was this guy who I never liked. So when we found out he was using my fathers life insurance money to sustain his coke addiction, I was LIVID. I imagined the feeling beating him to a pulp until he begs for forgiveness at my feet. I imagined the rush of stabbing him while he slept. I imagined making him pay for what he‚Äôs done in every way possible. And to this day, if it were up to me? He‚Äôd be dead. A swift end as final payment. But it would be a kindness he would not deserve. 

Example 2: My moms current husband. I hate him. He‚Äôs crazy, and has a temper. And I‚Äôve stolen liquor and weed from him. I‚Äôve also lied to his face and smiled while doing it. 

I didn‚Äôt used to be like this. I just want to be like I was before everything fell apart.",lonely,I‚Äôm scared that I might be an evil person,2021-05-03 09:23:52

I didn't grow up right, I was in an AWFUL, abusive, cult-like church growing up and stayed with terrible people in one long-term relationship after another for many years because I just didn't know how to function when I left high school. I gave up on organized religion many years ago and partied my 20s and most of my 30s away...being a musician in many different bands and gigging around bars/clubs/parties/venues/etc. There absolutely IS such a thing as the wrong crowd. And all the while I was with someone who cheated on me, disrespected me, and used me up for nearly 15 years. I had no self worth. But COVID times tore it all up, he went off to live with the singer of my former band, and I was left in my home jobless, injured and ill for the winter. I lost many people I thought were friends and was unable to recoup friendships I thought I had before that relationship. For 6 months AFTER the breakup last year, I was quarantined with both of them in my own home, and when they finally moved out with each other, the INTENSE, screaming-at-the-wind kind of gut-wrenching loneliness kicked in. 

I have never felt this way before. I have immediate family, a handful of friends, and one married best friend I am in love with, which further complicates my life. I try to play video games and music to ease the pain, but then something will trigger me and next thing I know I am screaming into a pillow and sobbing on the floor for hours. I have never been loved the ""right"" way, whatever the hell that means.  

I still have no job over a year later despite my best efforts. I don't have a band to play in and socialize...I don't know how to connect to people properly unless music is involved. I have never felt this alone in my life, even though I have a small handful of people I am SO thankful for who are rooting for me.

4113,Mr_Anonymous2772,1619994314,1,"Hello everyone. For the first time in a while this pandemic is beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I am just about the only person in my school year who seems to take the threat of COVID somewhat seriously and therefore I do not attend social gatherings etc. School has only just restarted, but I find it difficult to have the same connections with people. Going on PS4 with my friends was something that kept me in contact with my friends and maintained relationships. We started a Minecraft world (I am  btw) on which neatly every night in early 2021 we would work on, and it was great. We kept on doing this until one of my closer friends (Bryan ‚Ä¢fake name but just for reference) got a PS4 and joined us. He started getting closer to others in the friend group, and I realize that an inner circle begins to form with him and two others. I am not part of this as I am very occupied with chores and schoolwork. Soon enough, Bryan's girlfriend gets Xbox too, and a larger inner circle is formed. When I went on at night after a long day, I would really enjoy myself until we all went offline. Or so I thought. With little effort to hide it, the ""inner circle"" goes back online immediately afterwards, and does not invite me. I no longer go on ps4 to socialize as no matter how much fun I can have, I feel absolutely crushed when this sort of thing happens. So this group goes on every night playing and bonding together into the late hours, and on one occasion a group of friends that I had gone out with last year to drink and fuck around with all met up without me to celebrate getting into university etc (They are aware I'm also going to university). This just really upsets me, as even though I wouldn't have attended due to COVID restrictions, I would have really liked to have an invite. They were, and still unaware of how careful I am regarding covid. And then later on Bryan and three others go out together and don't invite me. It hurts a lot. It really does. Now I find it hard to enjoy my free time as when my friends don't reply to me for more than 30 minutes I begin wondering whether they are out together or on PS4 together. Recently, Bryan goes out with one of the group to go to town. I don't know what I have done wrong but I am progressively getting more and more paranoid I will be left excluded and replaced from a social life I once had. I am worried I will spend my summer holidays left out of all activities. 

Maybe I just need to accept that I am not as close to a group of friends as previously thought? Bottom line is, I feel like I am losing my closest friend and being replaced in my friend group.

I've done pretty well in school my whole life. I was valedictorian of my high school and I graduated a top 10 with a double major. I have the ultimate goal of pursuing an MD PhD to have a career in medical research and academic medicine. That being said I obviously know these things don't matter in finding love.

I struggled a lot in middle school and the first half of high school to find friends. Mostly everyone thought I was a nerd and a loser. I had the reputation of taking academics too seriously, even though I didn‚Äôt want to. I felt alienated from the ‚Äúsmart kids"" because I hated being viewed as a nerd and I also felt alienated from everyone else. This insecurity has never left me. I sincerely hate my intelligence and how hard I tried in school. It ended up amounting to nothing.

I was in a variety of clubs in high school and college. In hs I was in band (which I hated and quit 2 years into it) and speech and debate, where I made most of my friends in the latter half of high school. Even so, most of them thought of me as a loser and made fun of me for being a virgin. In all fairness I complained about being lonely at times. I felt alienated from them as well because of this.

In college I was in like 7 different clubs centered around service and medicine. I also joined a fraternity. I still had very few close friends in college. I had 0 female friends. I felt alienated from my fraternity a lot because I wasn‚Äôt hooking up with any women. I felt like I also wasn‚Äôt super crazy with drinking or partying.

Pretty much every social group I was in I never really felt a part of. I feel like I just dont belong anywhere. I am so lonely romantically I constantly fantasize about having a girlfriend that cares about me.

4138,frik4nd3lbr00dj3,1619983482,1,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It‚Äôs also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won‚Äôt even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON‚ÄôT be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‚Äò!‚Äô as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

Hey people.

I work in a Bank in India. I don't have anyone to hang out with on weekends - am getting very lonely. I tried getting close with people in office but it isn't working. Like I can talk and maintain a good rapport there, but a plan to meet outside of work simply doesn't happen.

Its been 1 year me working there now. Outside office, my pg friends left for hometown last year itself. Then I took a flat and now am completely alone. Neighbours are all live-in couples, just to add to the loneliness feeling.

Due to covid there is no scope for any other way of meeting people. Also I accept that chances are less regardless. I tried dating apps but am skinny guy so chances are very low, I never get a match.

Due to covid the roads are mostly empty. But the area I live in I can see couples all around - it just reminds me how ugly I am.

I cry on weekends in my flat alone. Financially I am a mess. Savings are nil - if I'm fired tomorrow my whole life will be a mess.

I dont know what my problem is - Loneliness / Depression or am I just so ugly.

I feel i'm inching closer to suicide every day.

Please advise.",lonely,Am I lonely or depressed or ugly ?,2021-05-03 05:17:54

Even tho I work in a supermarket (so I can interact with other people daily) and managed to hang out with a couple friends, at least on weekly basis whenever we could, loneliness during quarantine sometimes still feels really overwhelming.

The thing personally I miss the most is human contact. Cuddling, hugs or even just someone giving you a pat on the back or a handshake. In the long run the lack of human contact makes you feel so bad, to the point you start asking yourself if there's anything wrong with you.

Anyway, today in many eastern European countries it's Easter. Finally we had the chance to meet some relatives, eat and drink together and have a fun afternoon after a long long time. My uncles came to visit us for lunch and the afternoon, and since I have a little cousin she also came. She's only 4 years old and she's soo sweet and we vibe a lot together. Lonely and human contact starved me couldn't stop hugging her every ten minutes or so, probably hugging her way over 20 times this afternoon. We played together with some snapchat filters, took a few pics together, I showed her my guitar and played a couple songs, we both combed each others hair and just cuddled a little on sofa.

I‚Äôm moving to a new complex in a few weeks and really want to get to know my neighbors...and even make friends with one or two if I get lucky. There‚Äôs no way over 100 people can live in one space and  none of them will be both friend worthy (and open to a friendship). 

Anyway, I‚Äôve always been happier at poorer complexes, as the people were more often smokers AND open to friendships. I was a smoker for a couple years (half a pack a day) and when I quit people who smoked were still just as open to friendship.

With smoking being banned at most places these days, when people would likely be healthier smoking a bit and having social bonds (loneliness is worse than smoking like half a pack a day according to science), I don‚Äôt know how to meet people. I‚Äôm very open, friendly, and when I am in spaces where talking to others is encouraged (the climbing gym for ex), people like me very easily and we get along.

Making friends with neighbors is crucial for my own mental health ((probably most of us tbh)), as every time in my life I‚Äôve felt truly happy, there was friendship and connection with people who lived close to me and/or with me. I feel like many people are depressed now *because* we lack connection with our physical surroundings and the people closest to us physically, as this is something extremely important to being a social mammal. The closer the physical proximity to a friend, the more likely that relationship is to be maintained.

You know i grew up with myself since the past 7 years.
And started to realise fuck friends, i am a lion.

Well, the actual truth is, A real man has never required another man to survive happily, This isn't stone age where you will end up dead if you were abandoned by your group, this is 2021.

What a man requires is a wife and kids. Once you grow up your friends really don't matter. Your friends become your partners,thats all. 
When you die it's not your friends that are gonna cry over your grave, it's your wife, kids and your parents.

So my advice is, stop looking for friends and start looking for a girlfriend, and please make your life as cool as possible! That's totally possible without other males.
But first of all know yourself worth, value yourself.

Like go to sports clubs, go on a hike, develop a hobbie. Or anything you could ever imagine! Don't be afraid to go to the beach or a restaurant alone, remember a lion is a lion no matter if it's in a jungle or a desert.
Just don't look like a loser to the woman who you want as your wife/girlfriend. Show love, love yourself, your surrounding's , your work. Thats the biggest boost you will ever need to stay happy.

Recently I came to a strong realisation: we humans can only love those who are willing to live.

When someone gives up on living (aka depression) we just stay by their side if we expect them to recover. Once we conclude that person can't be saved, we walk away from them. That is, unless we are forced to stay by their side by moral, social or legal circumstances; in that cases we stay, but facing it as a burden.

I gave up on living a long time ago, but I wouldn't say I'm depressed. My life is pretty ok, I'm just really not interested. And the idea of suiciding doesn't attract me. So I guess I'm halfway. I do the bare minimum just so I maintain my material conditions and then distract myself, waiting for my end to naturally come.

But it would be nice to have some company, y'know? I do have nice friends and family, but they're all busy... well... living. I wish I could have someone to live this no-life with me.

But as I said before, no one is able to love someone who gave up. So I guess I'll have to pretend I didn't. Or accept my lonely fate instead.",lonely,To deserve being loved,2021-05-02 23:39:46

From few months, I‚Äôm surfing reddit alot and found eventually a dating sub reddit.

I thought of finding some serious relationship and someone kind girl and someone who can love me from his heart on reddit and I actually got quite good response but after few days girls don‚Äôt give efforts in communication and they get ghost. I feel really sad when im the only one who messages them. They won‚Äôt care even if I don‚Äôt message them. They won‚Äôt even message me first and give replies after an hours so I dropped on them. I found so many such girls who don‚Äôt give efforts in communication. Now the main part is im addicted toward seeing messages. In every 15 mins i check my reddit and discord to see if someone message me or not. I just keep waiting for someone to message me and no one messages me. I feel really lonely. My dating intention isn‚Äôt wrong. I just want one girl who can care for me and message me but I couldn‚Äôt find them.

I switched into a boarding school my sophomore year in high school and immediately found my home. The next 3 years living in that dorm were amazing, I had friends that understood me and they‚Äôre honestly family to me for life. When we all went off to college, most of us split off all across the country, so we knew we wouldn‚Äôt be seeing each other anymore. I‚Äôve kept contact with 3 of them, moving in and sharing a house with one of them. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve been in college 3 years and still have about 2 years to go. I have a wonderful girlfriend who I‚Äôve been dating for 2 1/2 years now, and I can‚Äôt wait to marry her. She‚Äôs the love of my life and I know she‚Äôs gonna be my wife. We‚Äôve lived together with one of my best friends from high school for about 2 years. But now everything is changing. My girlfriend is in med tech and is going back to our hometown (3 1/2 hour drive from me) with our dog for her internship, which will last for a year. My best friend is graduating this year. He has a job working for Amazon now as a software engineer and is moving to Virginia (we are currently in Louisiana.) My other two best friends live about 4 hours away from me at any point in time, and I hardly have time to travel given my engineering degree I‚Äôm working towards. I mainly interact with my buddies via discord, and was part of a fairly large group but for the past month nearly all of them have just been gone. Not sure why, most likely that‚Äôs a whole other story, but long story short I guess I just won‚Äôt be talking to them anymore, so that‚Äôs sad considering we all talked daily for the better part of 3 years, me taking the time to build this small community and introduce everybody, bringing them together just to watch them leave. All to sum up, by the end of the month, I‚Äôm going to be the most alone that I‚Äôve been in YEARS. And I guess I just don‚Äôt know how I ever handled it before, or how to now. I‚Äôm so used to being able to talk to someone I‚Äôm close to every day that this past month just without the buddies I had online is driving me crazy, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to handle being completely alone, working on these stupidly hard classes just trying to get my degree so I can get out and marry my girlfriend.

I already talked about it with them many times, but it's a decision my mother took, cause she was educated like this and doesn't know other thing. Definitely I can't convince her or them and I need to adapt myself to the rules

I can do it if I propose to, I can be hanging out with friends or going to wherever I'd want, but i don't want to have problems. They can kick me out of the house and I don't have no money to start living by my own, and it's difficult to start living like this in my country from overnight cause I've never worked before.

I've started college almost exclusively online and haven't really made any friends, despite really having high hopes going into my freshman year. I made a few acquaintances but no one I really hung out with regularly, and this spring semester I actually moved back home so I lost contact with even those people. As a little more background I didn't like high school at all, I had friends but wasn't really fond of most of my classmates and was one of those people seen as ""outcasts"" I guess.

So  I did have a few friends throughout high school, and one of them I had been close to throughout like 7th grade up until I graduated. We started to drift apart around junior and senior year though. I think the main reason we became friends though was because of convenience and shared hobbies. One of those people that during my low points would usually poke fun instead of being there for support if you know what I mean, though we did have a lot of good laughs together. So I reconnected with him over winter break and we talked/played games online, and now that the spring semester is nearing an end he reached out again.  So I've been talking with him and he still kind of has this condescending attitude. And out of all the good memories we have he still brings up a lot of the more embarrassing ones for me. Not even really in a joking way, more like low key making digs at me. And some are actually kinda obscure so I'm not really sure why he would even bring them up? Like I said I feel as though I've grown a lot since then and am glad to put that chapter of life behind me, but he still has this ""high school image"" of me I guess. If I had made more friends this year I don't think I would even be talking to him honestly, its moreso because I don't have that many people at the moment.  

I'm not sure whether it's worth just trying to move past this with him or I should just move on with my life.  Anyway if you've listened to my ramble, thanks I appreciate it",lonely,Worth reconnecting with this friend from high school?,2021-05-02 15:29:18

 We were at a house party/gathering and I was chilling about with my friends. Suddenly, I heard someone ring the doorbell. I went to open the door, only to see my classmate and ex-crush crying. Like the kind of crying where you know something groundbreakingly bad has happened. Before I knew it, I jumped forward into a tight hug, feeling absolutely shitty about how I could not help her.

I could feel everything. My palms on her back. Our chins resting on each others' shoulders. The warmth of a hug. 

The reality of the experience was second only to real life. Words alone cannot describe how strong I felt the emotions and sensations. 

I have several good friends. But as my friends don't show physical affection, this was the first time I had a hug this powerful and emotional. 

I realise now that I am horribly starved of physical affection - till the point that my brain created a situation to fulfill this subconscious desire. I'm even surprised that my brain could even remember the sensation of being in a hug.

4238,mrsaturn513,1619929517,1,"Title pretty much says all, as complicated as it sounds... or maybe it isn't. I'm not sure at this point. To be honest I felt like I should make an anonymous account for this but I guess I don't really care anymore.

So Person A (29), Person B (27), and I (25) met in an mmo 3 years ago. I've never really had any real friends before, but we ended up getting really close pretty fast. I never thought that I'd ever find anyone even remotely similar or like minded to me, never mind even feeling comfortable being myself around. We hung out with each other everyday on discord voice and played games together. I even got to finally play dnd for once instead of just hearing or reading about it... I was happy. Of course it wasn't perfect, I know nothing truly is. There were plenty of times where I would end up feeling left out with the two of them even when we did things together. My self esteem was always really low...

Still, I ended up falling in love with the both of them. Not at the same time mind, Person A was pretty much shortly after we first met. It was the first time it felt like anyone outside of my parents ever truly cared about me. So a few months later, I confessed. I was fully expecting him not to feel the same way though, and he didn't, So, It didn't hurt as much. Soon After I ""moved on"", and by that I guess my feelings ended up moving over to Person B instead. More months pass, maybe even a year, and I end up confessing to them as well. They didn't feel the same way either. I should have gotten over these feelings after but I didn't this time.

Maybe it was because I was desperate to be in a romantic relationship, since I never have been, or maybe it was something in the back of my mind telling me that I'll never find anyone else in life, especially now with covid, but I ended up stupidly holding onto these feelings hoping that maybe someday they'll change their mind. There was just something about B that I kept pining over. Almost as if they were this long lost childhood friend that I've never had. We played a lot of the same games growing up, we had similar interests and ideals, even similar experiences in life... Almost like we shared the same brain cell as some people would say. They were like me, but more outspoken... but also more abrasive... which I should have been wary of all these years.

Despite that and pushing my feelings on the backburner, The three of us still grew closer. Or so I thought. These last several months, it felt as though I was drifting away from them despite how often we hung out everyday. And to them there were a lot of topics which I expressed being okay talked about in front of and enjoyed even, but they would still only talk about it without me. There was a lot of miscommunication. It ended up leading into a huge fight between me and B in December because they were going through something, and only told A and decided to shut me out of it. Which while I do understand it's their decision on who they tell, It felt as though I wasn't needed, and it hurt... The whole time during the fight, which pretty much lasted the whole month, It felt as though Person A only wanted to be there for B.

Regardless, we still made up in the end. But it also led to me confessing my feelings again for B because of what was said in the process of reconciling. I realized that part of the hurt was because of me still being in love with them. They still didn't feel the same way. Even then I thought it'd be okay, because we were still friends and that it'd be okay that A and B were growing closer together believing that it was all purely platonic. Even if they did end up being romantically involved together I tried to convince myself that it'd be okay anyway. That Illusion all shattered in March.

I was on my way home from work when Person A had messaged me on discord telling me that he wanted to talk to me about something. He told me that he and B had been dating for the last couple of months long distance, and I lost it. I was already depressed about a lot of things at the time, and they knew that, and I didn't have the emotional capacity to handle the news. I was so heartbroken and hurt and I started bawling on the spot in my car. It hurt even more because for the last few months, I could already tell something was going on between them based on how they acted towards each other. and I felt betrayed somehow because I had also confided in A about me falling in love with B.

I couldn't be around them anymore with how they handled things. My emotions were all over the place and I couldn't think straight. The next thing I knew, I told the both of them that I hated them, I lashed out, and hurtful things were exchanged between the three of us and I left. We shut each other out. I know I could've handled the whole situation better, and I should have but I didn't. I know I didn't handle the situation well, but to be honest I don't think they handled it well either. Again, lack of communication... I wish they could have told me beforehand that they had feelings for each other so I could finally push mine aside and make way for them. I know they were trying to figure out a way to make it hurt less or so they said, but they knew that this was gonna hurt me regardless, and the outcome just hurt so much more. Especially now that they think less of me. The last thing B said to me was to get over myself about this. It cut deep.

This all feels like something I should have experienced when I was younger. And now I'm sitting here all alone while the two of them get to have the relationship I longed for... It's only been a month since everything happened and I feel empty and depressed. Like there's this gaping hole in my chest. On the worst days, I feel like I'm drowning or suffocating and trapped...

I even ran into them again in the mmo we met in because there was a new update... It fucking sucked especially since, at least from the surface, they really have moved on without me.

I don't know, maybe I just deserve all of this in the first place for not being able to be a better friend to the both of them. I highly doubt they'll see this, but if they do, I'm sorry I couldn't... At the very least, I'm glad that I was able to experience what it felt like to have friends for once. even if it didn't last.

4245,velius_the_devil,1619926478,1,"The events of this past year have left me incredibly isolated, frustrated, and lonely.

Sorry, it's kind of a long story but I'll try to give a condensed version...  
About a year ago I had a modest group of friends and a partner. I had recently become pretty sick so I was already stuck at home before quarantine became a thing due to covid. It didn't take too long for me to realize my partner felt more inconvenienced by my sickness than concerned or supportive. Despite knowing this I desperately tried to keep them around because my condition was getting worse and I wanted their support. Eventually they came up with a pretty lame excuse to end things and we went our separate ways. Most of our mutual friends have since stopped talking to me.

I then became completely fixated on my sickness. Constant online research, visits to the doctor, tests, procedures... No diagnosis. After losing \~45 lbs (didn't have a lot of extra weight to lose) and at the absolute end of my rope, a specialist prescribed a medication on a whim, a total guess. It helped for a while, to the point where I thought I had won my health back, but then I became really sick again. I've since gone through 2 more rounds of the medication, with a month or two of feeling healthy in between.

I was feeling REALLY good for a couple months. I had started exercising and working out, even gained back some weight. Then, even though I've been SUPER careful, I got covid. I had some of the typical symptoms like loss of taste/smell, trouble breathing, chest congestion/pain, etc., but it also seemed to bring back all of my old issues and symptoms all at once. This particular ordeal lasted for around 3 weeks, and my ""old"" symptoms thankfully started to fade just as the covid symptoms did. A miserable experience for sure, but I'm thankful it only lasted as long as it did.

Now I'm ""better"" again, though my symptoms aren't totally absent. I've since been able to start running and working out again and it feels good to see the progress I'm making. But now that I've spent so much time literally fighting for my life and putting so much time and effort into my personal health I've found myself totally isolated. I work from home, I exercise at home, I cook and eat my meals at home. It's like now that I have some room to breathe, some time to spend doing anything other than focusing on my health, I'm able to take a look around for the first time in a year and I don't see any of my friends. I've reached out to some of them, but for the most part it seems like the connection is dead. 

In a weird, messed up way I kind of miss being sick (yes, I am in therapy lol). It gave me something to focus my whole self on, a purpose. Now that I can get back to other aspects of my life I'm kind of reeling at the amount of loss, and how lonely, I feel.",lonely,Isolated,2021-05-02 13:34:38

I tried looking for people on the internet to make friends. I am not very enthusiastic about this usually, because I often not feel ready to reach out and make new connections. This time, I wasn‚Äôt able to find people to talk to and it didn‚Äôt go well because the conversation didn‚Äôt last long. I ended up going to omegle and somehow got jnto sexual topic with this guy. We exchanged nudes. It was nice to finally vibe with someone but not in this way. Makes me sad because that wasn‚Äôt what I was after. I was just lonely, specifically today. I felt vulnerable, but had the willpower to reach out only to set up a trap for myself to fall into. I am not going to shame myself too much because I want to stay positive to my sexuality. But it feels so meaningless to me to share intimacy with strangers over the internet. People you have no intention to meet. I want to spend time with people in real life and have meaningful connections. Not necessarily sexual. But for my sexual connections, I want them to be meaningful as well. I recognize what I just did was of self-destructive character. Keeping this going isn‚Äôt sustainable for me. Which is funny because what I learned from writing all those stuff to myself earlier in the day, was I wanted to stick to a sustainable way of living. A sustainable lifestyle. To not engage in self-destructive behavior. To recognize what is bad and refrain myself from doing those things. To not get involved with people who are toxic. Because I truly believe that is going to make me change into the better version of myself. I made a wrong step and I will never look back. I believe in improvement for myself from tomorrow onwards.

We developed a friendship and to keep the story short, I fell in love with her and she kind of picked up on that. I had never talked with her in depth about this but she gave me clear signs that she is not interested. Nothing wrong with that. I understood and we continued to have conversations, give each other advice, share big moments in our lives, check up on one another regarding our physical and mental health, things like that. However, I suppose these feelings never went away and over time they yet again started to interfere with our friendship.

Below is the very last thing I texted her. Please note that she has already responded to this and acknowledged my feelings but has again made it clear that this is something she does not want to pursue but wants to keep talking with me and be friends. She reserves the right to do so and I respect that decision but sadly I had to make the call to end it.

&gt;I think I'm in love with you. I just have these feelings for you that is hard for me to explain. I think about how kind hearted and smart and lovely you are and how I see beauty in that and it makes me find you attractive.

I also want to keep you in my life because you mean so much to me and despite how late or early it is you always found a way to take the time to message me. You always ask how I am doing. You give me advice and you compliment me whenever you can. Those types of things make me have these love feelings for you. And if you don't want to talk to me about this or if you never want to hear from me again I don't blame you if you don't have the same feelings. You deserve the best of love and I'm afraid that I think I am not capable of giving you what you desire in a relationship. I don't know where to go from here but my intentions was to share these feelings and not try and take a friendship to the deep end. What I mean is I still want to be your friend but I feel ashamed and incredibly stupid for wanting it to be more than that.

I know this was the right thing to do. Her fear of hurting other people's feelings forced her to want to care about me, but it's been very apparent that she does not want me any more than as a friend (it's a lot I don't want to get into).

I‚Äôm quite new to Reddit. I found this community and I guess I‚Äôm just looking for affirmation that I‚Äôm not the only one who feels the way I do regarding my social life. I‚Äôm 23, and as far as I can remember, I have struggled to make close connections. I also have never been in a relationship. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I can be socially awkward or anxious at times, or if it is also based on my circumstances. The majority of my grade school experience was a very small, private school. Besides the small selection of people in my grade, I was also shy and considered the perfectionist or the teacher‚Äôs pet. I went to three different high schools from 9th-12th and barely had the chance to settle. I‚Äôm finishing up college, and I go to my local university. I transferred out-of-state because I felt like I‚Äôd have better social and educational opportunity elsewhere, but due to medical issues had to return to my hometown. I‚Äôve never had the financial means of living on-campus, so many times I‚Äôd take the hour drive from my family‚Äôs home to and from campus. I finally decided my junior year to use the money I have saved up to move out and live close to campus, but the pandemic hit and so my dreams of making new connections came somewhat to a halt. Since I moved out, I have lived in four different apartments due to short-term leases and financial reasons. I believe I am a friendly person, but I think the volatility of my living situations and locations has made socializing difficult. I do not have a car either, so I usually walk or take the bus around. I have joined various groups on campus when I could, but never got too far besides an acquittance to anyone with those clubs. I have also joined dating apps with minimal expectations in order to meet up with people, but many times I am ghosted or it seems like people do not want to meet up in real life.

I reached a new low today. My friend, who I have feelings for (and who has rejected me in the past), told me that she received a message from a guy on an anonymous website run by our school. The website basically operates by having people send anonymous messages to people they're interested in, and then the person has to guess the identity of the mystery person. Like an idiot, I signed up and sent my friend a message, because it was the closest I could feel to having someone be interested in me. She responded, and now I have to pretend to be someone else so she doesn't find me weird and stop being friends with me. So now I have to have someone who I'm interested in message me in pursuit of a potential fling or whatever, all the while knowing that she would have no interest in me in real life.

So roughly 5 years ago i met my only real girlfriend at the age of 29 I am hope less and it was a huge thing for me. We had met online in gaming and was pretty much inseparable there. We met we clicked and of it went. Anyway neither of us was in a position to have their own place i was living literally in my parents basement and she was living with her mother in social housing.

Facing this conundrum i got back in to education i had a plan i said within two years i will have my own apartment and a job. Anyway i failed but today would have been our third engagement anniversary but i only failed by 3 months September that year i had my own place. 

This is when every thing turned into shit due to actually working like a dog i was unable to keep up with her gaming wise. So now we did not really game together anymore and it was no point in me even trying because in the end what kept me there was her. So we tried other things but it was never good enough (MMO addiction is a bitch for some i guess) at this point i was living a lone, she was going to move in but always postponed. First it was November. Then it was spring and then she wanted to get her own place and then not i was an emotional wreck already. 

In the end she broke it off about a year ago because I gained weight. I was fucking depressed already did everything that i could do but it was never good enough and now the only person that I speak to is my mother. I am crushed i did not exactly have a brilliant social life before this but now i am utterly alone with the exemptions of my mother. Before this i at least had people to talk to who i did things with and spoke to now i fear i end up alone forever slaving away to pay a mortgage for an apartment that hurt me more each day because of the implications. i could sell the place but that would mean i end up in my parents basement again and probably get thrown out when they move. 

I cry of loneliness every day I feel stupid and eating is the only thing that disturb these feelings and that is probably the reason i am in this situation in the first place. I was stupid to think I could be in a relationship and actually get there be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be happy. I have tried dating apps (which i truly think is a scam) without even having a conversation.

I can't stand it. If life was a person, I'd punch it repeatedly. And very hard. Like I said, if it gets better it certainly doesn't feel that way.

All day long I am surrounded by lots of people. Its been like that since the kindergarten. And yet I feel so lonely. I've always been a rogue among others, matters not where was I. But as time passed, it'd seem that people would interact with me more. But, all of it is an illusion.

Long time ago I've noticed that no matter how good people treated me, and how much they talked to me, all of it was within a certain frame where they could not ""escape me"", for example all school time, now currently the military service. Once I leave such a place, it is as if I am gone. Poof! I do not exist! People never chat with me, never call me, never care to ask how I am, never do anything, although they always tell me hiw great I am. 

Surely I am not the only one like that, who is somewhat lied to. I think most of the people I spend time with do not fully realize they'de lying to me in a way. It'd seem that once I am out of sight, I am erased from their memory. 

The point is, it seems like eternity has passed from the moment I started feeling lonely. I a way I got used to it, my life has become a reality where I am the only person to talk to me and ask me things. Perhaps fate decides to grant this rough way of lufe to those who can bare it... although it cannot be done for eternity...

That thing i mentioned of people getting irritated by my presence for no reason, yea i have that same feeling with my older brother whos also socially anxious, so im trying to be open minded and see why i feel that way about him, hes quiet too and such a fucking nice person, but maybe he falls into that ""boring"" category too cuz i get annoyed whenever im around him, even when hes not doing anything, i just want him away from me cuz im irritated, i obviously know how he feels now and im trying to redirect my feelings and try to incorporate them to help myself too, but how can i change? I suck at socializing and i just want friends for a change, i also think this was the reason why me and my ex gf broke up, im just a boring bastard with nothing to say :( i dont generate exciting energy, ( i obviously know it comes down to self confidence and such fyi, but besides that)",lonely,People generally dont like being around me,2021-05-02 05:13:25

First day and i am literally frozen in motion literally cant talk to anyone .I mean i was expecting that to happen but i thought i would have the willpower to manage and talk to anyone . It turned out that my mentality was too weak and ended up viewing mt first class solo on the back seats of the classroom .I was so nervous that my college life could be a huge mess .Second day as i was sitting and watching the lecture some guy came to talk to me ans we started hanging out .several days in and 2 more guys came and we created a group to sit and chat .We hanged a lot doing stuff outside of the university.Basically after a month from the 4 of us the one guy started dissapearing,the second guy transfered to another university and the third guy just gave up the whole college stuff and left so i was once again alone .Entering the class i caught with my eye another guy sitting a row behind me alone .I found the courage to speak with him and we ended up after some chatting becoming best college friends .that guy introduced me to some of his friends and we created another group .Basically the story begins from here.With one of his friends we became pretty close spending all the day with eachother and doing stuff .For some reason we argued and both of our behaviours started to change .He said some stuff as a joke ,i got really angry and i started fading away.i noticed changes in my behavior like i was keeping a big distance from people .i couldnt laugh that easily anymore and started to loose my cool and became a boring person .Summer came and i met my group of friends from where i was living .We were doing stuff all summer and basically it was one of the best summers in my life.i noticed again due to my behavior like i was kinda left out of the good stuff but i didn't have a problem with that cause i just wanted to hang out with someone .the end of the summer comes and its time for my university to starts again.The point is that my friend has announced me that he will leave college life and just come for a week or two for the exams.Then i fell like the depression was started to hitting on me.I spend a lot of time locked in my house watching movies playing video games and eating.I left myself out of control turned onto an obese person and the problems kept railing up.Going to 1 year ago i decided to send a message to my friend from highschool .he answered and we started talking for days about how messed up both of our lives were and how ruined they were by the circumstances of the enviroment we were in and how we slowly destroyed them .
The summer came and we started hanging around with mt friend more .he was pretty closed to himself so i tried to drag him with the group of friends i had but he wasnt in the mood and i respected that.With that group of people i was started to being left out from stuff more and more .i felt like hell watching them randomly all together while i was alone so we started fading .Now o just have that one friend that we rarely do stuff due to him prefering being at home and me feeling so lonelt .I HAD MORE TO WRITE BUT THE THINGS I WROTE ARE ENOUGH TO SEE MY STORY DONT KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME BUT I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM AND HEAR THEIR STORIES .ALSO SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH THEY ARE MY SECOND LANGUAGE !",lonely,I am alone feeling like screwed up !,2021-05-02 03:19:07

4351,estevao_mod,1619879278,1,"hi, guys. I am Estev√£o and i am 22 yo. Let me tell you guys my history. I spent most of my life in the church, but I left it when I went to college and changed many of my ideals and beliefs. After going through a period of great confusion with myself after leaving the church, I am already in a much better time and I can like myself the way I am. My friends walked away from me while I was in this transition phase of leaving the church, and to be honest, I also stayed away from them because I stopped going to the same places we used to go to, like church, evangelical parties, meetings with other young evangelical people, and so on. I am not angry with them, on the contrary, I still like them, but we are on different paths. Many of them are getting married and are going on with their lives, and I somehow miss having them with me and the moments we live in. Today I write this because it was my brother's birthday and one of my friends came here at home and we had some conversations. It is difficult for me to live with all this, I tend to understand, but in the end there is always that feeling that we could still be together and following similar paths.

4352,DangerDaskov,1619878775,1,"I've made a lot of post here before but for once I think I wanna be clear of how I'm feeling. I'm a single 19 year old who would give his own well being just to be with someone else. I joined the AF to try to get a break from my shitty life and hopefully start a new one. Yet being here I've felt more depressed and isolated. In 2 weeks I finish my training school to become a medic and so far I'm just at a lost because of this girl I just like too much. For once I'm not just attracted to someone I genuinely like them cause I envision a future where me and her are together. But there's days in class she acts so differently like she would act so nice to me, talk about her life, tell me about all the other guys she failed to get with. And all I can think is I would never be like them if I had the chance. I've never had a relationship before and I'm not smooth with talking to girls so all I can do is act goofy and act like we are close friends. And she tells me I'm her best friend so it hurts when I hear she's still talking on about these other guys she's talking with and here am I eating the soup she made acting depressed because I wish it was me she was talking to and not just the best friend she talks to. Cause in 2 weeks I leave to another base and so does she and although we live like a 2 hour flight away from each other it won't matter I'll be PCS to my new base eitherway I can't help but think how she'll be happier with someone else especially a friend of ours in our class who also might like her and lives only about an hour away from her. I want her to be happy and I don't want to become some over clingy person who gets jealous easily but that's who I'm becoming. I want her to be happy yet I can't see that without me being that person that makes her happy. I hide away my depression and always try to smile when I'm around her yet last night I showed her who I really am. She's an introvert I can tell yet it bothers me I can't seem to understand her sometimes or that truthfully it would never work out. She means a lot to me and I hide that cause I'm afraid if I'm too nice I'll drive her away like I did for every other girl. Some days it just feels like this will be life crushes that will never go anywhere and I'll die alone with nothing but the legacy of my career and no one to share what little bit of happiness I have or love and appreciation I have for myself. I don't want to improve myself cause I hate myself and honestly maybe if she told me she hated my guts and wished me to die I would be happy.",lonely,Just a loveless rant,2021-05-02 00:19:35

I usually eventually try to fix my mistake of ghosting for months or years by trying to reconnect but things are never the same and it's even more difficult to hold a conversation. I just feel like I'm gonna suffocate whenever I reconnect because it was my fault because I felt like a horrible friend or person and that they are better off without me. 

They kinda show that they are better without me by never trying to initiate another conversation after I never respond the first time they never try again that's why I feel comfortable ghosting because it felt like they didn't want to talk to me anyways. A lot of conversations are started by me despite my horrible anxiety because I really try to change and keep friends and try to get close but they consistently show me that it seems that they don't want to talk to me at all so I distance myself so far and ghost for months. Even friends that I had so much fun talking to seem like they don't want to talk to me because they don't start conversations. So again I disappear. I hate this and I've lost all my friends can't talk like I used to just trying to not be negative like I always am. So then we never talk again.

4367,sirhc0223,1619863249,1,"It's so strange.  I have people to talk with, to message, but I don't.  I have my own discord server with 90+ people, yet I have been gone for over a week.  I have been feeling dead, so I just sent a short message to them saying that I won't be there for at least a couple of days.  I find myself on reddit...seeking attention.  Yes, I'm not alone, but feel so lonely none the less.  I don't know what it is that I'm going through.  I guess it's because certain unfortunate things had happened with 3 people in the server that hurt a lot.  It's also not as active as I would like it to be and I've spent so much time on it.  I guess it all had drained me, although I had gotten pretty close with the people who are active.

I have gotten so good at wearing a mask and I don't even have to think about it.  I feel dead on the inside, yet I don't project it unless I get vulnerable with someone.  When I have been vulnerable with someone, they're usually gone.  I try my best to pretend that things are ok most of the time, but I want to be honest with myself.  I want to feel accepted.  I don't want to sound all chipper, when I truly want to cry.

I've finally admitted to myself about what I want and what I'm looking for.  I feel like I've been denying it and trying to run away from it.  Now that I've accepted it, I feel even more lonely, even if it's such a normal thing to want.  I want a girlfriend...to be there just for me...for us to do cute things together.  Like watch things together, read to each other, etc..  

But...I was called a bad person by someone I got close with late last year.  And all I can see myself now is a bad person.  Although everyone seems to say otherwise.  I try my best to be there for people, yet I can't seem to be there for myself.  I just want to feel loved.  But as I was having a nervous breakdown, she said I was a bad person and cut me out.  I wasn't ok before that point, and I have been worse ever since.  I was trying so hard to focus on the silver linings, because good things had occurred since then, but...It feels like more like I'm running away.  And.....Using people to cover up how I'm truly feeling.

I'm 32, yet I feel like I'm still in highschool.  Like I haven't grown up...Like I'm stuck in the past.   I don't physically look my age, my voice doesn't sound like my age, and my behaviour doesn't reflect my age either. This isn't to say that I'm immature or anything like that. It's very hard to describe. I have so many internal contradictions.  Although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just...feel like everything else is passing me by and I'm left behind.

I'm not looking for compliments.  I don't really take them well...I don't believe them when people say them to me.  I just want to be held and have that person say something nice to me and not ever leave.  I just want to be loved and not feel insecure.  I want someone to understand me...accept me for all of my faults.  And not leave when I'm hurting..

If anyone is thinking that I should be seeing a therapist...I am.  After what happened late last year, I made an effort to start seeing one again.  Just...Please don't say anything like that if I'm contacted.  It's triggering.  Also, I don't want to be contacted by someone acting like they have it all figured out...Again...triggering.  I don't want to feel like a lesser than.  And um...If I'm contacted, please don't suddenly talk to me well, and then gaslight and/or suddenly tell me why you won't talk with me anymore..  It has happened...It hurts and...Yeah...triggering..  

When I talk with someone new, I usually try to make them feel safe, welcomed and comfortable.  It's so strange hearing that come from me considering I have social anxiety issues, but...People think I'm outgoing when I'm not.  I did make a conscious effort to get better at using my voice, so yeah.  Anyways, I guess the way I act with people, puts me in a very vulnerable spot.  I take everyone seriously and not treat them like a joke...When...I shouldn't be expecting the same from them.  

Sorry, this ended up being longer than I expected.  I was crying throughout it.  Just sniffling now.  Thanks so much for reading this.  I was debating with myself for a few days whether I should post something here, but here I am now...doing so.  Thank you again.

4377,RuinouslyYours,1619856251,1,"Love is the one thing I want most in life, but it's also the thing which I am most ill-equipped to handle. I can barely maintain friendships because the idea of people *wanting* to hang out with me is so baffling to me, and yet I love my friends, even people I'm not friends with anymore (which is all of my friends at this point). I want the best for them and want to see them again but they aren't reaching out to me for a reason and I respect that. I don't think I know *how* to love people properly, and yet, I just want to bury them all in my love anyway. So many people hurting, so many people who need someone, I just want them to be happy, but I want to be happy too, even though I can't let myself do so.

I can't open up to people because there's nothing there. I am a nothing person. I don't have a personality. I had one but no one liked it so I chucked it in the trash and now I'm just... existing. I'm here and no one knows why so no one bothers, least of all myself, why the hell would I? I'm tired of being sad... but I love it as well, the misery cuts so deep and is so lasting, it's the only constant in my life, why would I get rid of it? It's my only true friend, self-loathing, self-destruction, all in the self because I am selfish. I want to help but I'm bad at it because it's all about me, my sadness, my anger, my rejection.

I'm tired of people disliking me but I don't want them to like me either, too much of a burden, too many expectations. I will never be the person they want me to be, they person they see me as in their own heads, the person they need. And I cannot be myself because there is no self, only a series of unmet needs and unfulfilled dreams. I am no good to anybody, least of all myself.

I hate being alone but can't stand being around others. I am a creature of pure chaos and dysfunction and deserve every second of misery I get because I have caused it all on myself, I *am* misery and it is the way I prefer to live my life, in chaos, in darkness, in a pool of self-pity so deep I'd sooner drown the world in tears before I could ever swim to the surface. I just want to die but I can't, not of my own hand at least. I am incapable. I am useless. I am a dull pair of scissors, a dim lightbulb, aged before my time and no good to anybody. I am a ghost, wandering about, wondering where I went wrong and how to turn my fate around but the truth is, I was *made* for this.

I don't want to get better. I wouldn't wish this pain on my worst enemy but if I can shoulder it, then it is okay, the world is in balance. I am fine. I will never be fine. And that is fine. If only I could absorb the pain of others like a sponge, and they could be free, and I'd have the misery I so desperately cling to. All of their misery, their pain, the injustices and abuse they've suffered. I want it. It only hurts them but it fuels me, fuels me to keep crying for the self I never got a chance to know. I cannot die, it is my mission to suffer and I gladly accept it, it is the only thing that I am good at.

I don't want to be left alone but I don't want to bring anyone else down with me. So I will just sink and sink and sink further into myself, until I fade completely.",lonely,Not used to love,2021-05-01 18:04:11

4387,starzwillsucceed,1619849815,1,"Yesterday night I(35m) was contacted by a user(27f) on reddit that claimed to be a young woman in the army. She consoled me with her opening remarks about my posts of being lonely she going on this sub r/lonely. I was suspicious from the start because the profile had 1 karma and was 1 year and 4 months old. 

I decided to just go with it since I am by myself most of the time since I live alone and if this user was who they claimed to be, then cool, I made a new friend. 

We talked for a bit and I then moved on to ask if she wanted to exchange pictures. We decided to use Google hangouts for this (her ask, not mine). She was really really beautiful and I was surprised that she would resort to reddit for attention from a male. But I just kept the conversation rolling while still being cautious. 

I then asked if she wanted to exchange social media such as Facebook or Instagram and she told me she had no social media at all. I was kind of surprised of this so I just wanted some way for her to verify that the pictures she was sending of herself were of her. I simply asked her to send a selfie on hangouts of her holding up three fingers while touching her nose with her middle finger. I even sent her one of me doing the same so she had something to reference. If she sent one back of her with the desired pose of the same woman in the selfies she sent earlier, then I would have been content to know that I was talking to the person she claimed to be. She said okay, but then ghosted me quickly after. 

I digress. The internet is full of people trying to get attention from us or trying to find ways to prey on lonely men AND women that will most likely lead to them asking for money or support when they aren't who they say they are.

This woman was very forward with how much she wanted a good man and had long prepared statements that seemed to be copied and pasted of her desire for a long, happy life with a man that would treat her right and love her unconditionally. I was very skeptical with this. I'm glad I've always had a sense to question everything until certain because for someone not prepared for seeing these things, someone else could have easily been taken advantage of.

Be careful men and women of people who message you on Reddit. I would suggest always questioning everything until you know for sure you are talking to who you say you are talking to.",lonely,Beware of fake users that claim to be a young women looking for a good man.,2021-05-01 16:16:55

I played sports, but I was terrible. I am the only one on my old team to not get some sort of college deal. One of them has a chance to be a star college football player. I have never reached the success that any of them have. 

I was also always weird. I never really talked to people, besides myself. It's all I have at this point, characters and personas I've made up in my head. It helps a bit, but it isn't healthy. Recently, I've been so addicted to wanting success and fame that I've went as far as to purchase social media accounts with big amounts of followers (20k, 30k, 40k), in which I always regret doing it and end up wasting my money. All I wanted to be was a pro-wrestler, but I am a middle class disabled person from the middle of nowhere. It's illogical to think that would ever happen. 

I don't hate myself, I hate that I haven't done anything with my life. I am most definitely running out of time, before I'll be stuck doing something I don't want to do for the next 50 years, or so. Not depressed, either, just alone. I can't say I'm not a failure, that's for sure.

There have only been two places who will accept me that I could actually live in and literally both of the landlords are trying to find ways to steal from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go out and meet people because I have a fear of being in public for long and it stresses me terribly to talk to people I don't know in person. (I come off normal but it takes a great toll so I can't do it all the time.) I have three people in my life and they're all toxic, but I feel like I can't cut them out because they're the only people that exist to me and I can't meet anyone new. One is an 'ex' who's still very emotionally abuse to me even though he moved away. One is another ex, same basic situation but not so much abusive as just a clinical narcissist who uses everyone. And finally my very rageful, emotionally unstable sister, whom I don't talk to much. (The reason for the PTSD is related to extensive childhood abuse so I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the history of abuse and the fact that my sister is unstable.)

So everyone just says ""Oh he told you you'll never do anything right and all your childhood abuse is your fault and you're a moron etc etc? Well just stop talking to him."" But I'm already losing my mind because there's no one to talk to and everything is falling apart. I can't find a place to live and I might lose my chance to move to move. My washtub just broke. My weird neighbor is randomly rearranging everything on my porch and it's freaking me out. My dog needs a vet visit and I can't afford it. I can't \*tell\* you all the things going wrong in my life, and I have this strong instinct that things are going to be much worse soon.

And there's no one to talk to who doesn't tell me it's all my fault or I'm an idiot or who cares or listens. I literally feel like the walls are closing in or I can't breathe- like all the time.

it hurts how others can simply just be loved, and I hate myself for thinking like this. and here I am, again, one step away from ending my non-life, thinking about who could possibly care. and there is absolutely no one, outside of my family. I'm trapped in my pile of misery, disfigured by my own blood, and I have no one to even turn to. not that I think I deserve a friend, I never did. but why do I have to go all of this unloved and unwanted?

4440,Pink_Ballz5000,1619824752,1,"More and more, I ask myself ""Am I the A-hole?""

... because I'm self aware enough to realize that if I find a problem with **everybody,** then that means that **I'm** the problem. After being recently diagnosed with ocpd, it's made me start to wonder if doing the right thing is literally a mental illness/disorder/abnormality. I simply cannot fathom the concept of **not** paying attention to details, or being a hypocrite, inconsiderate, or what have you. As the years roll by, I'm steadily cutting people off... friends, family, associates. All with very good reason. To the point where when I tell other people what happened, they agree the person was shitty and I did the right thing.

I cannot fathom ""imperfection"" to the extent that everybody throws around the term, and here's several reasons why:

1) If you describe, for instance, your perfect day... I highly doubt you'll name something that's impossible. I bet your entire perfect day can be broken down into steps that can easily be accomplished. Perfect does not equal impossible. 

2) People often use the phrase ""nobody's perfect"" as an excuse for half-assing something or just blatantly doing the wrong thing. So by that logic, anyone who simply does the right thing or makes a f\*\*\*ing effort is perfect. Cool, so that's nowhere near impossible.

2.5) ""Nobody's Perfect"" is meant for when you tried your best and still failed because life is legitimately unfair. It's not for when you knowingly cut corners until you get caught. People will literally cheat on their SO and then say ""Well, nobody's perfect."" Homie... you're not even breaking even, you're way in the negative. ""Everybody cheats""????? That literally makes me want to vomit.

3) That person who you bullied and called a ""goodie two shoes"" or ""prude"" or whatever... that was a perfect person. They didn't have angel wings or super powers... they just made a Fkng effort.

&amp;#x200B;

I am increasingly finding more and more problems with everybody to the point where I shut myself off from the world more and more because I am disgusted by people's blazay attitude towards morals, cleanliness, being considerate, etc. I consider myself pretty chill about most things. My cleanliness is what people do when they tidy up for company... so the lie you put on to pretend you are a certain level of clean (the basic standard), that's simply how I always am. Just the standard. The lie you tell to get out of trouble, that's what I was actually doing. Simply the right thing, the **standard**. Nothing more, nothing less. When it comes to consideration, I just treat people how I would want to be treated. I don't kiss anyone's ass, and I'm not disrespectful. Just the neutral standard. I don't see myself as doing too much. It's clear that everyone else treats the standard as this impossible thing that nobody actually does. It disgusts me. 

I even have complaints about my therapists. And all of my complaints come with receipts. My therapists just don't listen and can't even be bothered to get my name right. I've read over notes they took from sessions, and they misquoted me, and treated hypothetical things as literal statements. To kind of shove me in a box or avoid properly treating me, even tho I serve them my issues on a silver platter. The list goes on really, but the point is, I'm running out of people to turn to. I keep pruning the toxic leaves off my tree, and I just realized there's just one measly leaf left, and yes, it's my cat. 

Here's the real kicker... I do not expect anything from anyone if I cannot do it myself. I'm a strictly logic-based person, meaning you can't convince me otherwise because I could turn this into a 5th grade math problem and explain it to anyone. So it confuses me because it's also logical to see that the issue may very well be within ME, if I'm the only one who feels this way. I understand that to err is human... but to sort of reiterate, to err is to make a mistake. Once you graduate from ""accident"" to ""habitual"", you need to hold yourself accountable as an a$$hole. I will be the only person in a group who's doing the right thing by everyone, and yet people will screw me over and expect me to understand why it's human nature to be shitty. 

So I guess I'm not human, because I'm conscious enough about how my actions affect others. If I could find just ONE other person out there like me, who I didn't spot these ""imperfections"" like a blacklight in a motel, that would be such a relief. 

On the reverse, btw, it seems like people who \*do\* make an effort, go WAY beyond what's necessary (think cancel culture, and randomly being a dong to people who make honest mistakes) I never try to enforce my opinions on others as if they were fact, I just distance myself.

4442,hit-the-sack-zack,1619824152,1,"This school year has been hard asf for me.

It started off alright because i had a couple of decent friends around me, so i thought, some of which i have known for over a decade, but this changed completely. every weekend i would try to spend time with them but they all seemed so reluctant to see me, either coming up with half-assed excuses as to why they couldn't, or would do the old fashioned ""oh yeah ill get back to you on the day""-conveniently short notice. in my presence they would talk about parties and gatherings that i were never invited to, what happened at said gatherings, how much fun they had, etc; they would lie to me so i wouldn't come out; they would ignore my messages until it was conveniently far too late for arrangements. they would never tell me why they would exclude me so extensively, so one time i really reached out to one of said friends telling her how isolated i was because of this, to which she promisingly replied that i have no reason to feel this way anymore as i AM part of the group, and to prove this she would invite me out the following Saturday- this reassurance was all i wanted to hear, and she knew this. Saturday rolls around and im getting serious deja vu from the similar half-assedness i had experienced prior, until the same girl i opened up to tells me that she ""wants"" me to come, but doesnt want to be the one bringing new people, so 1 week im gang, next week im ""new people"" (bare in mind ive known all these girls from 5-12 years).

on another occasion i attempted to reach out to a different member of the group, who i thought to have a more empathetic way about her- couldnt have been more wrong. she got very defensive as if i was calling her out, i emphasised that this was not an argument, just me telling you how i feel, which she replied sarcastically that its a pity or something like that. so i asked her if her and her group really dont want me around, and she acted like she hadnt a clue what i was talking about. but all was revealed about a week after this through a heated argument in which i was told my suspicions were correct. why act like you dont know what im talking about when you do? I have the right to know the facts and im really not the type you have to hide the facts from.

i had invited around 6/7 of them to my house for my birthday party in july, with drinks, probably a takeaway or something, made a group chat where they all confirmed that they could probably go, with one or two excuses as to why one or two may not be allowed (getting the excuses in early in retrospect) the fateful day rolls around and it is around the time they should start showing up when i get a message from one of these people to say she cannot come as her and the rest of the group are going to a theme park in cardiff, not far from home, without me. they hid that from me till last-minute, probably so i wouldnt have it rearranged for a more suitable time. assholes.

my problem is they went to all this effort to cover up their clear hatred towards me, making false promises or lying to cover up why they would ignore me for hours- (""i left my phone at home"", ""i didnt see the message you sent""- globally recognised bullsh\*t.) i believe the aim was to prevent hurting my feelings, but id clarified many times i would much rather know the hard truth than the easy lies. every week i would betray myself with a sad attempt to meet, i took so long to learn, perhaps denial.

Do not lie to people about your negative feelings towards them when asked. Do not allow people to waste their time and energy, especially if you know this is the case. Youre saving them in the long run, and if you think this might be one of your friends speaking about you; 1-its definitely not, and 2- please ask if they are ok and would like to talk.

4449,DutchHeIs,1619820929,1,"I originally posted this as a comment but I somehow felt like I needed to make this an actual post. 

About a year ago this guy joined our scouting group, chill guy and we clicked from the start. We started gaming and shit and before I knew it he asked me to join a discord server with his friends (among us was getting really big at the moment). It's around December now, one of the girls 18th birthday is coming up and they never met me in person but they wanted me to join. I'm 23 and with that the oldest of the group by atleast 3 years. 

I'm getting invited to group chats and drinking nights every Saturday at this point. Then the problems started.

The guy that introduced me to the group had a ""disagreement"" with the rest and left, just like that. From here on out things are getting awkward. 

I started inviting myself to the Saturday evenings and I even picked up a few persons on the way there ( there being a curfew and all anyways we could spend the night there and not have to worry about driving under the influence). Anyways, things weren't really awkward with all of the people yet. This one girl taught me to skateboard and she was so cool, I even had dinner with her family.

 A week later there was a moment between me, that girl and another girl. We all shared about our past regarding depression and suicide (the 3 of us failed at it and we all found out about it because of my scars). I opened up to them, the first people that I've ever done that with so it was a huge deal for me.

Then 2 weeks later (2 weeks after Easter) it hit me like a bomb. ""Hey, we've got a bit of a conflict regarding you. How about you skip a Saturday so we can talk things out in the group?"". I was devastated, all of my anxiety and depression suddenly rushed to my head and I chocked.

The next day they wanted me to meet with the group and they started telling me how the girl (whom invited me to her 18th birthday) started feeling uncomfortable with me being in the group. There was a considerable age difference which made her feel insecure but she didn't want to tell me right away, she wanted to talk about it with the rest of the group first.

This day is still the worst day of my life so far, basically they gave me the ""It's not you, it's us"" spiel. I tried so hard to not cry and I didn't, I arrived there at about 14:00 and talked to them until around 17:00. They didn't want to kick me out of the group but according to them the thing was that they were feeling I was forcing me to be part of a small group of friends that basically knew each other for years. I was an outsider to them and they didn't want to force either side to be friends with each other. 

They told me they still wanted to be friends and they would invite me sometimes but they haven't yet. Every day I get snaps via snapchat about them hanging together and it makes me feel like I meant nothing to them in the end.

I feel so stupid thinking that I finally had a chance of having a good life, I thought I had finally found people that knew me and that I could finally learn to love and trust again.

My best friend with whom I spend online last 2 years nearly everyday talking and playing games, and watching movies stopped joining discord. First I thought maybe he got a big sad, as he had thoose problems previosly, so I thought I will leave him a couple of messages every now and then. He assured everything is kinda ok, he just doesn't want to talk to anybody rn. I assumed he just needs ""a me time"", but I tried to message him sometime.

Couple of days ago he stopped even reading my messages, so I thought maybe something happened, and I send him a text (text is only way to make sure he will respond), to make sure nothing bad happened, and he said he just don't wanna talk.

And now I just saw that he is having fun with bunch of other guys, so that meant that he just doesn't wanna talk with me. My heart just broke..... He was the only one I could talk about anything, and he is my first and only friend. I don't know what should I think about it. He was always on a first place for me and now I feel like I am not even worth a chat for a couple of minutes.

Just having that feeling that you don't belong.

Feeling unseen, unheard, or believed when you tell people things because you thought they were people you could trust.

People brush aside your fears, hopes, dreams, experiences, etc.

4471,throww5656,1619810737,1,"I know this is pathetic and a very ""1st world problem"" but its affecting me a lot.

I spend so much of my time on discord, talking to people on text chat, because I dont have many friends irl. As time has gone on I have become very clingy because of this, and have been noticing people speaking less and less.

It has gotten to the point where I doubt they even know about me anymore. Yet I care so much about them. It hurts checking discord wishing to see a message, but to no avail. I dont know what to do, I dont want to throw away these friendships by leaving discord because we've been speaking for nearly 2 years now, but I feel awful knowing they dont feel the same, being forgotten about.

A part of me wants them to miss me, for some reason. I dont know why, but I just cannot let go, and I cannot distract myself from this god forsaken app.

* She gave me her number without me asking.
* She voluntarily stayed the night, we stayed up talking loads about everything and anything.
* The next morning we had a tea talked some more. We had INSANE chemistry.
* On the way to the station we discussed me visiting her next and she even held my hand all without me even hinting it at. She grabbed my arm totally off her own accord.
* Kissed goodbye at the station, her choice again.

4498,Sikat01,1619798844,1,"Its definitely been a while since I browsed this sub. I‚Äôve been feeling better than I was before but still I have this gnawing feeling inside me. That craving for interaction, like something‚Äôs missing. I managed to find the most wonderful and amazing person but I can‚Äôt rely on her solely and put all that pressure on her. I always told myself that if I felt sad and lonely on the night of my 20th birthday I would go out on some kind of high. I‚Äôve started to realise that the majority of my feelings of anguish, anger and sadness stem from my loneliness. When you find people that seem to empathise with you, you cling to them for dear life because it feels like you‚Äôre drowning, and when that happens most of them end up leaving. Being lonely has the consequence of isolating yourself which makes it harder and harder to find people to interact with. The spiralling is the worst. You can feel that weight with each breath, the anxiety just eating away at you wondering if you are gonna lose everything and everyone, more than you already have. I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this, I think I‚Äôm just venting cuz i havent in a long time. Some space to breathe and try to better understand my situation. I think making friends and I mean true friends is one of the most rewarding yet difficult tasks in this life. To have someone who will have your back and be by your side at all times for the duration of your time on this planet is one of the greatest comforts available. Most people come and go throughout your life leaving little marks on your life, some larger than others but marks all the same. Some even take pieces of you with them leaving you less than before. The heartbreak and pain that humans can inflict is almost laughable. Why do other people dictate our own lives so much? Isnt that weird? I just hope when the time comes I‚Äôll be able to smile and live a happy life with the people I love and who love me. Its alot to ask of someone, to love me, but I feel sometimes like no one does, truly truly does. Not just because they are family or friends but because they deeply care about me and want to see me at my best all the time. I sometimes dont feel that warmth that I, at times, desperately need. Loneliness isnt solved by other people, its solved by love and warmth and I think im coming to realise that more and more. Without that love you just have the shell, with a hollow inside. It looks pretty but it has no depth, no meaning. I hope someone understands me, I dont even know if I understand myself at times but yeah here we are I guess",lonely,A void,2021-05-01 02:07:24

4503,Gondal90,1619794739,1,"I will try to be as honest and objective as possible giving my account of the reality that I see. 

Many times it *seems* like people generally are not motivated enough to talk to me. It *seems* like they are just not interested in me or they do not consider me important enough for their attention. Usually I am the one who makes the effort with other people, the one who does most of the talking etc.

If it was not for my efforts I doubt many people would ever even talk to me or even care. Yet I see other people who have had many friendships and relationships and here I am struggling. 

So now there are 2 possibilities here realistically:


1. My perception/interpretation of them is inaccurate and in reality they are interested in me but I‚Äôm just not seeing it. 

Or 

2. My perception/interpretation is correct and they really are not interested in me. If this is true then the question is why? What is it about me in particular that is not good enough for certain people? Why do they like others but not me? Am I not interesting enough to them? Not valuable enough? Not good enough? What is the problem? 


So there you have it. The most realistic account I can give and most realistic possibilities. One thing I can say with confidence is that I have seen people who have had many fulfilling friendships and relationships in their life. 

Clearly these people are doing something right. How are they able to do this but not me? What is it that they have that I don‚Äôt have? Are these people the majority? I don‚Äôt know.
