0,-Azucar,1619790821,1,I'm completely used to it. But that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. It does hurt but I'm used to it. Actually having company is so unusual that it even feels slightly uncormfartable even if the matter of the interaction is something minor. I feel like I have to entertain the person I'm with to keep them interested in me by talking and asking a whole lot of questions (doesn't work). At this point I've unlearned being in company. Obviously that doesn't change the fact that I wish I wasn't alone.,lonely,"Being lonely is the ""new"" normal",2021-04-30 23:53:41

In september of 2020 i broke up with my gf ( she was manipulative she used me she betrayed me and cheated on me) it was a nasty break up and i lost everyone i was close to because of it i thought im over her now because it was super one sided cuz only i loved her but today i saw her again on the street and this feeling hit me and i realized im still madly in love with her and i cant let her go she was the only one who cared about me even if it was fake. I wasnt able to eat or drink anything since i saw her again im only sitting in my room crying and cutting her name into my arms thinking about cutting my wrists open so i can end this pain .

I have so much stuff in my heart that I wish to share with someone who can understand and someone who cares but there is no one. My heart just feels very heavy all day and I do not know how to make it stop. How to make the thoughts in my head go away. I do not know how I can accept this that I will never have friends. Everyday when i wake up there are 0 messages on WhatsApp, 0 messages on Instagram, 0 calls... it's like no one cares about my existence other than my parents.

I just cry at random times in the day. Literally the only people I have talked to in a month are people who comment on my posts on Reddit and people in a discord server.

21,iaadoivx,1619772669,1,"I (22M) have been alone ever since I left my ""friends"" by ghosting almost everyone from school. I don't regret it. What I had were fake people in life. And I left them. Just thought I should get this off my chest. 

I'm from an Asian country. Growing up, I was one of the cool kids in my class. One day, someone wrote some nasty stuff about a girl (22F now and let's call her P) and one of the other cool kids accused me of doing it. P was my crush and I would never write something like that about her. But I couldn't prove my innocence and everyone turned against me, including P. She complained and I had a hard time in school. I had friends but always felt alone. I had one teacher who understood me and he helped me a lot to overcome this. (Lost contact with him as he left school.) 

I took up sports to forget it and I became good at it. Then puberty hit and I grew in height and started looking good. P noticed these and had a crush on me. When I learned this, all my resentment and anger went away. But neither of us approached each other. I had became an introvert and her wall of an ego stopped her from talking to me, telling her how sorry she was for not trusting me and hurting me (a good friend). She was the popular girl so she had a lot of guys hanging around her. Never cared about me. So I moved on. This all happened between 2013 and 2017. School ended in 2017 and I moved to University. Except a few of my good friends, I ghosted everyone else.

I eventually came in contact with P in early 2019. She wanted to be friends but I politely refused and said goodbye.

I've never had any friends except the ones I didn't ghost. But we don't talk either. We are in different fields of life and they have their new circle of friends. We are just in contact. But no hanging out and stuff. Except my gym, I go nowhere out. And the pandemic affected it a lot. I don't like parties and stuff. So that's cool. No dates or relationships. Sometimes I hate it.

It's grinding away my humanity knowing that if there isn't money to be made from me, there isn't any interest at all. I've tried OLD for years, I can count the number of actual messages I've gotten on one hand,  aside from the bots. (Once, a girl messaged me literally just to point out something she didn't like about my profile and then block me. This type of thing happens with baffling regularity.) Here's one: I once approached a woman at a bar and said, exact quote, ""Hi, I just wanted to say I like your hair pin."" (A handmade bottle cap hairpin. It was very cute) to which she looked me dead in the eyes as though I had called her hot-tits and asked ""Why?""..... What the fuck even IS that? I know no other person this shit happens to. ü§£ ""Oh hey, cool jacket."" Does not get met with a look like I've just whipped out a turn on a stick. There is no way this is not an elaborate practical joke or some kind of Truman Show deal.

I really try to be personable and polite. I'm sincere, I'm honest, I'm only ever on my best behavior, but it has never amounted to dick, and I've run out of constructive criticisms. I've seen other dudes' profiles, and they're just ""6'1"", üç∫üèÄ‚úà"" and they're seeing results off that shit. I get it, it's very normal, but I can't be, and I'm not desirable enough at a glance to make up for the abnormality inherent in my personality. It just sucks that my broken brain is such a massive hurdle to connecting with someone when it doesn't seem, where I am, to be all that big a hurdle to anyone else. I try so hard not to let this all fester into bitterness, and I hate turning my own helplessness into anger, but for fucks sake, the shit women say about some of the men in their lives. It's very hard to hear shit like ""I just want a man that cares about me"" and get met with complete indifference every time, you know? Obviously it's not their fault. Obviously, you can't take people's complaints as gospel, and caring about someone is the bare minimum, but a bunch of people still fail to clear that bar, and clearing it with ease and still bring met with ""big deal, moron, so something better"" every single time is draining every ounce of energy (joule?) I have left. I'm rambling, this is all very off the cuff. I have nobody I can talk to about any of this, so I get to rattle off into an empty room to the 2 or 3 people who might even see the title here.

I'm not even sure I'm, like, UGLY, per se. Not right now, at least. Every time I look into a mirror or try to take a selfie or something I'm overcome with this awful combination of rage and sadness and nausea, though, which makes taking good profile pictures basically impossible. I get this twinge of annoyance when OKC notifies me that ""somebody likes you"" because I know it's a lie designed to milk more cash out of me. This feeling, when I put myself out there over and over again and I'm met with absolute silence is way too much to take anymore and I just want to be done. Dying has officially surpassed finding love as far as my wants at this point because I'm too broken to ever feel like a person again, and the only fix at this point is to just end it. Maybe if it had come when I was a few years younger. Maybe if I had gotten one goddamn win when it mattered, but you can't change the past, and the future's looking exactly the same. What am I, just gonna keep getting socked in the chest for another 50 years? Why? So I can show nobody the number I got to? Ludicrous.

44,TheCollegeDropout_,1619757919,1,"Another post where I vent. Ever since I graduated from high school last summer and started college two months later, I've never felt more distant. Throughout high school, I had three friends (I became distant with two and one of them cut me off), one who I was close with, but I was still lonely. I didn't dislike it for awhile though as I still knew most people in the small school of 400 kids and had many of them added on social media. I also felt comfortable with talking to most people too. In college though, I feel none of that. I've tried making friends, but I've failed to do that (thought I found one, but I think the conversations we had for about a month burned that friendship out too quickly before college even started). I've felt isolated in a way.

Even before college, I think this distance was already beginning to develop. For the first two years of my high school experience, I wasn't nervous to talk to people over social media (even on those I had a crush for and even after they left me on read) and had a few good conversations. Throughout my second half of high school, that changed. I rarely would conversate with people through social media, add anyone on social media, etc. This didn't do me any favors either.

This distance doesn't hurt just because of me not having any friends either. It hurts because it very well may be the reason I'm still single too. That may seem obvious considering I'm lonely and I missed a few shots before, but there was a time I likely had a chance with someone. She was very likely dropping all sorts of signs through Instagram for me to make a move (and I knew this too), but I never capitalized because I was too nervous to do so at that point. That was two years ago and I still regret it. Doesn't help when I still see her every so often when I'm shooting around at the basketball courts at my park.

I just don't know what to do. This loneliness and distance hurts, especially with all this stress I'm going through in college right now. I'm tired of just talking to my twin brother and household family members everyday (I love them a lot though!). Just need a new experience. I'm not looking for online friends either as I value in-person friendships more, but I don't know how I can make it work. I got a lot to offer, but I just can't get my words out properly.",lonely,Loneliness got me feeling more distant from others than before.,2021-04-30 14:45:19

So as it is known I spend time alone and all that jazz. It's the things I think about like werewolves!

Seriously I have a dog. I let her out and sometimes I think or imagine a werewolf might show up. Or something weird and sinister with intent to harm. 

You know one time I downloaded Randonautica and told it I wanted to see a werewolf. It gave me coordinates but I was too chicken shit to go. I don't know like ever since I saw The Skinwalker Ranch documentary I really wonder. But I also don't want to know.

I think about songs at random. Like right now it's: ""can you hear them they talk about us"" wtf! Why? The Go-Go's song our Lips Are Sealed... But why?! 

I also think about guys feet. Yeah might as well come clean I like mens feet. Fuck it ya know. Tired of feeling ashamed about it. I mean I am a gay man anyway.

Lastly I think about where will I be? Like I want more out of life. I'm not satisfied or happy with how things are. Not just for my own well being but for others as well. 
You know I certainly believe there is more to life than money and slaving away at a job. 

""You say that money isn't everything but I'd like to see you live without it"" - Silverchair

So the above quote I've heard several and many times in different wording. Yes money helps but damn! Time can not be replaced. You don't get time back! Ever! 

Or as Joni Mitchell once sang:

""So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way""

I get upset, and then I burn down every friendship I have.  It feels satisfying, much like destroying a treasured material possession when very upset.  I just unfriended everyone who I was recently in contact with on Discord, but it's been months since I've had any close friends.  Some may call my incapability of lasting connection a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I don't think it is.  I've put so much effort into trying to make friends, much to no avail, and when I do find someone who I ""click"" with (which seems extraordinarily rare, by the way), the friendship seems to be inevitably doomed to end within a year.  When I get upset, I can't control it.  I can't make the hurt go away or even lessen it, and it makes me want to hurt people.  Even if I know that I'll regret it later, I'll push people away.  I've threatened to do some pretty mean things if I wasn't left alone permanently.  To be honest, it often feels like I've never had even one real friend.  People may interact with me so they can feel good about themselves (because at least they aren't me!) and/or because they'd feel guilty if I were to overdose and die, as there's probably a linear relationship between the likelihood of me ODing and how incredibly lonely I feel.  It angers me very much when seems like someone is just pretending to be my friend.  Anyway, I'm going to order some more diluted fentanyl powder on the darknet, it's been a while since I've had any, and maybe I'll die this time.  Things aren't going to get better.  I'm also incapable of genuine achievement, so I have nothing whatsoever to look forward to, and never will.  Everything even remotely ""positive"" about me is fraudulent in some way.  I'll always be a ""bad person"" by societal standards, and pretending to be someone I'm not in order to gain social acceptance would only make me feel even worse.

I immediately thought of three friends I grew up with and still talk to sometimes. Not as much as we used to, but we still go out once in a while, share memes with one another, etc.

I tagged the three friends in my entry... then I saw that all three of those friends tagged other people.

79,natypiggy,1619743746,1,"After I (21F) finished high school a couple years ago, I was ghosted by my two ""best friends"". They weren't the best people (they were toxic) but it really hurt me in the moment. I felt confused because I thought that I should be happy to cut off all the negative people in my life but I didn't understand what I did wrong, why did they leave? I could never bring myself to talk to them because everything ended super weird, and I don't want to start a possible argument.
In the present I get super anxious and awkward when interacting with new people because I'm afraid that I will do something wrong or make someone mad on accident. Everytime I say or do something in a social event I always second guess myself and over analyze the situation and get to the conclusion that no one likes me or that I'm an outsider. 
Now I'm in college and I tried to make friends but couldn't, I had classmates that would only come for favors and I always tried to be nice and help out but after everything was done, they wouldn't talk to me ever again. 
Today was an off day for me and that's why I'm writing this.
I'm in a dancing group and have online clases with a teacher, she's a pretty nice person. Today during a zoom call she decided to do a group activity, she asked a couple of fun questions to let us get to know each other. Then she asked to write an anonymous compliment to our favorite person in the group. I didn't have a favorite person so I randomly picked someone and said something nice about them. After we had sent a compliment, she started to read them to everyone. I didn't get any compliments. At first I was fine with it because maybe they picked randomly and I wasn't the first one on the top of their heads. But then the teacher went on to say that she wanted to do this exercise because she wanted us to know that even though we don't talk to each other that much in dance class, our presence isn't insignificant, which was a BIG SLAP IN THE FACE. Later she started to ask if we felt comfortable during the group activity and then asked me specifically because she saw that I had turned off my camara and pointed it out in a jokingly manner (I had turned it off because I was nervous when she read the compliments). I just faked laughed and said that it was fun. 
I know this is so stupid and it shouldn't bother me but it really lowered my self-esteem. It was a reminder that I'm not important to anyone and I don't have friends.
This is just a rant because I don't have anyone to talk to and I appreciate it if you read until the end.

Had a couple of close friends they all ended up disappointing me at one point or another, in a point where they could‚Äôve just showed that they value our friendship they chose not to. Anyways that was years ago I didn‚Äôt have a single friend to say I‚Äôm close with. I was sent to study abroad then got back after one year to be diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic. Got my shit together and travelled back again to finish my degree, there was this girl that we occasionally talked. As friends, she lived at where I studied. We ended up being in a relationship and when I say I gave my best for her I honestly did. To find out that she was still on contact with her ex. They never met it was an LDR and she chose to do this behind my back. I was supportive. Protective and loving her with all of my energy, she had family issues so I was basically her whole family. We broke up for a while and then I decided to forgive her and start from scratch, issues came to the surface my dad didn‚Äôt accept her as I was trying to engage her, I still talked to her family and they always come up with excuses, I connected with her and made her my whole world. Then to find out when I came back home to regulate my paperwork that she‚Äôs living the life of her dreams behind my back , she changed completely. And she did whatever she knew would hurt me and tear me down. After that I had a long time with myself to decide and to remove the blindfold I‚Äôve put across my eyes when I was with her. She never loved me , I was just sort of an escape to her that she used for her own benefit, I was keeping myself from things I wanted to buy just so I can save money and take her out to lift her mood due to her issues with her family, for the best part I don‚Äôt feel like I love her anymore but I keep on checking her profile, why am I doing this. Maybe due to me getting so attached? I know men should be tough but I‚Äôm just falling apart and the stress isn‚Äôt doing pretty good on my health and blood sugar control is jeopardized, why would anyone do this to a person ?

88,alt-for-vent,1619738837,1,"The post's title sums it up.

I tried making friends. I tried being friendly and talking to people. I tried it all. I forced myself to swallow my awkwardness. It worked for a few weeks and then everyone reverted to treating me like I don't exist.

I am sick of sitting alone at lunch, I'm bored of not speaking to a single soul for the entire 6 hour day because nobody will talk to me, and I'm fucking done with being invisible. I haven't had a real conversation with anyone in so long that I have forgotten how to talk to people.

I hate my school, my teachers, my classmates, everyone and everything around me. All of them can go to hell with their fake bullshit. At least tell me the truth.

I was fine with most of the the shit the world threw at me. I was fine with needing implants to hear since day one. Hell without that I would be the most uninteresting person alive. I don't feel bad about that. It would be terrible to feel bad about your most defining characteristic. But I digress...

I also was fine with being a natural weirdo because I at least I had some friends and looked decent, but the world took both of those away from me several years ago. So now I'm just a weirdo. Having nobody to talk to also took some time to get used to, but it became tolerable. Same thing with the repulsive problems that developed over the pandemic lockdown. It was all okay, but its still unfair. Sometimes I think I'm just a nutcase. Maybe that's it, but even if it were true it is still unfair.

Why did *I* have to be the quiet kid with few friends? Why did I have to be hopelessly unattractive? Why does it keep getting worse? I think I at least deserve an answer from this apparently meaningless chaotic universe.

...

Oh well. I can't complain too much about my existence because I seem to have it better than most people on this subreddit (at least from my perspective). The point is just that I'm done with all of it.

I began into british high school and I fucked up.so i basically didn't have any real friends (same story as everyone).lock down started and I felt like I was saved. My exact words were 'there is a god'.
I spent most of lockdown accepting that high school is a shit place and should just isolate myself from it entirely and just be myself.i also watched A LOT OF NETFLIX.

somewhere in lockdown my parents decided that it would be a good idea to take daily walks in the park with my 15 year old cousin (whom everyone thinks is perfect and she thinks she is better than everyone else she basically does nothing wrong in their eyes)one of the days me and my cousin were walking we bumped into my friend from school.
 Let's call her: S

Me , S and my cousin talked for a bit before I had to leave.me and S didn't really talk much at school I sort of just knew her as the girl who hung out with kids older than her.the weird thing was she kind of reminded me of my 15 fifteen year old cousin we were walking with.but she was so much more subtle.

We went back to school and realised we had both changed so much, and we both bonded over how kuch we jated this bitch and we got along really well.we became best friends and often role played as wives.she even picked me up from my house every morning. S had told me that she's bisexual and that she actually prefers girls but was hung over her guy ex.

We started making friends and I got 'popular because we were a group of some people at that point whom all hated the bitch.the bitch we both hated apologised to S because  S had a lot if friends and I think that the bitch could see that.S didn't forgive her at first bit tue bitch was very popular so I think it was bounced to happen. S eventually forgave the bitch and I knew things would change. Long story short we grew apart.

Now she's 'married' to someone else and were not as close anymore it's like we barely talk.but it all happened so fast.and were still friend but stuff changed .I miss her.i think I have a crush on her.i keep thinking about her with her 'new wife'.i mean I know it's not real but I feel jealous.

The horn from the old steamer snapped me out of my long pause, as it slowly moved under the Malinowskiego bridge. It was a very beautiful Saturday evening with a bright orange sky. I was sitting on the parapet overlooking the Vistula river, with a warm cup of coffee on my hands. I had been staring at the sky for a while now. It was 8 o‚Äôclock in the evening when the cathedral‚Äôs bell finally rang, and the streets began to light up with an astonishing golden glow. It was the moment I had been waiting for. The sight of Torun, with its medieval architecture and Teutonic castle in all its glory, never seized to amaze me even on bit.

As the time passed by slowly, I dragged myself, step by step, back into the cute Toyota Yaris. It was time to go home, or so I believed. It wasn‚Äôt long till I was already over the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Bridge, that I noticed the sky was pitch black while the cool wind swirling over my neck. I put my hands out to feel it. I slowly went past the Cinema City, that reminded me of my first day in Torun over a year ago - a time when I wondered what I was doing there. I felt myself smiling as I went past the streets where I walked that very first time. But isn‚Äôt that all what we live for? Memories, those of both good and bad times.

I was almost sad until and home when the car finally slowed down taking a turn into into a pitch-dark path. What am I doing here? Why am I here? My mind filling up the empty space with questions, no one knew answers to. I slowly got out of the car turned on my phone‚Äôs flashlight and moved forward as calmly as I could, to find myself on at a lake. At the distance I could see a faint orange glow of the old town of Chelmza. At first, all I could think of was to take my shoes off and put my feet on the shallow waters. But the real sight, was yet to be realized. It wasn‚Äôt until a few moments later that I looked up into the sky, that I realized that I was already smiling. I could almost not believe what I was seeing was unreal. 

It was the sky. A sky that I had been seeing since the day I was born, yet never something like this. The sky, that was filled with tiny little twinkling diamonds.

112,metalheadcat999,1619725889,1,"Hello, I am an extremely depressed, lonely 23 year old girl. I have been like this for a long time, old 'friends' ghosted me few years ago, I don't have a good relationship with my family either, had a long term boyfriend that manipulated me because he mostly needed money from me, I even made the mistake to move with him to another city. 

Fast forward a few months, I gathered enough courage to break up with him, made few new friends from my work place, especially started caring about this one guy after a while and he seemed to genuinely care about me as well, guess I was quite happy for a while.

Well, since then things went downhill, me and the guy I may be in love with right now became sort of ""friends with benefits"" or something, but lately he just ignores me, never reaches out to me unless he needs something, probably talking to other girls as well even tho he sometimes gives me the impression that he qctually cares about me, but maybe I'm just too naive.

Anyway, there is also a girl that I quite consider my best friend right now and since a few days ago, she doesn't talk to me as much either and I just feel like I'm bothering her all the time.

To conclude this whole thing that I hope none of them see this and realize they know me, I just feel like I'm that kind of person that no one wants to spend time with, they probably reach out in the beginning and then get bored of me. I just want someone to care about me? Like, one person that f***ing actually likes me and cares about my day and genuinely enjoys talking to me and stuff..
However, it probably won't happen, I really have these thoughts that it might be better to just end ir since no one would really care anyway and I will also stop suffering and just taking up space..

Also sorry for the long post, didn't mean for it to be this long..",lonely,I just want someone to care,2021-04-30 05:51:29

She dropped me like a sack of potatoes for this guy. It's been about a week, and I've contemplated suicide. I've hung out with a couple friends, but it's not the same. I wish I could go back in time and make things right. Fix things. Try to get her back, yet I know it's pointless. I just need to move forward. But I'm lonely. I have nobody. Friends who I smoke with, but that's it. No deep emotional attachment. I love her so much, and I cry every fucking day. It's so hard to let go. Now I'm lonely again.

114,jd18o,1619725401,1,"This feeling has been creeping up on me faster and faster throughout the years, and the last 2 years have just been so pathetic. I don't really have any actual friends, just people that I need to blend in with. Because of religious beliefs in my country, I genuinely don't feel like I can get close to anyone because if they ever know what I believe in, they'd genuinely be disgusted with me. Goes for family, friends, strangers.... everyone.

 With me not being religious anymore, I also started to lose my sense of purpose honestly. I don't really have a dream, or a goal, and everyone thinks that I'm so slow, justifiably so, because everyone around seems to already know what they want to do, yet I'm still lazing around pathetically squabbling with myself. So naturally, I went online, and tried to find friends. It was nice! At first at least, but then these feelings started creeping up again, and when that happened, the way I talked became more insensitive, to the point where I actually hurt someone from my jokes that just went too far.

 They forgave me, and I felt a bit better, but because of what happened I started feeling that I really might not deserve people to begin with. So I left them, at least I told them that I was leaving, but it was so sudden I think I basically ghosted them. After that, it was just a long while of being with myself again, but I started feeling desperate for social interaction again. So I found another group, and again, it was actually nice. But this time, I didn't need to hurt someone to feel undeserving of anyone, and it happened so much faster. So I left again.

 It nearly became a cycle, so I broke it off, but I think I'm going crazy again now. Am I too far gone to actually get close to people now? Is it normal for me to have full blown conversations with myself? Is it common to just start hitting myself in the head over and over and over again just to tell myself not to talk to anyone again? I don't want to start all of that again, I genuinely think I'll become suicidal again if I get that feeling again.

I honestly don't even know why I wrote this here, because nothing will change. All I did was just broadcast how pathetic I really am. I haven't changed one bit, yet I keep blaming everything around me even though I know it's all me.",lonely,"Life hasn't been unfair to me, yet I'm still so pathetic.",2021-04-30 05:43:21

It was all rushed, but since it was perfect at the time it felt right. Now I‚Äôm in the situation where I learned about her past / problems that are coming up. In terms of what I‚Äôve done wrong to her in terms of importance it‚Äôs been nothing, she said that herself. But the past is filled with using men. Like the guy right before me that she ‚Äúdated‚Äù she used for money / food. Cheated on him often. She followed up by using more men, and of course having a sugar daddy and selling pics to other people. Is this a problem to do if a person wants? I guess not, but red flags to me. And I didn‚Äôt learn about it all until the problems started. First she kept booty call guys around that I had to ask her to block that had been trying the whole time I was with her. She‚Äôd say no, but still. Next she said to a friend ‚ÄúI have to lock in this trust fund baby‚Äù referring to me. Later explained she didn‚Äôt believe money was real until a certain point, and I believe her, but not fully due to worry. Apparently they‚Äôd call all the people she talks to by their occupations, and mind was trust fund. But still, why keep me around if I was supposedly lying? Followed by keeping my previous main competition around until I ask for him to be blocked. Reason being that he‚Äôd go out of his way to talk to my fianc√© all day on literally everything. More fine details, but it was off and only on Snapchat after I discovered the first thing in January about booty call guys. She said she ‚Äúfelt lonely in friendships‚Äù. She never cheated that I know of because I‚Äôve been around her a lot, but July - November I have no idea. And now, she vented to her cousin about these previous problems (that I‚Äôve handled nicely and let eat away at me) and gave her cousin no context. Her cousin went off on me to her and she showed me. I naturally had a problem with it since I did nothing. Then I had to tell her cousin not to come to my house, and that sparked more problems. Fast forward a week and her cousin crafted more lies and told her whole family. When you break down the information given to certain people, you can craft the idea that she‚Äôs jealous of me taken up a percentage of my fianc√©‚Äôs time and wants me gone. So used pathetic ways to get it. My fianc√© caught her lying about ‚Äúfamily being worried‚Äù, but they weren‚Äôt. Now I gave my fianc√© the choice. I said if you keep her around I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm gone. She chose me and will be cutting her out of her life apparently. But she doesn‚Äôt want to, only for me. Her cousin also was disrespectful to her about it. I just can‚Äôt deal with more problems that make it hard to function daily. All I‚Äôm asking is what do I do? Do I stay or go? I love this woman with all my heart, but it became so hard and now I don‚Äôt trust her anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm waiting for something else to go bad. I‚Äôm truly desperate for advice. My therapy all of 2021 has been about her not being able to recognize problems (and even if she does sighting talking to that guy all day / cousin) I have to be the one to fix, and just the worry I‚Äôm caused. I know she really loves me and it‚Äôs hard. My therapist labeled her an ‚Äúunintentional abuser‚Äù, and she told her cousin then of course her cousin ripped into me for that in their texts. There‚Äôs more fine details and slight problems on her side of course, but just hard to text it all. All of my friends said to leave. But I see her trying so hard, it just became an unpredictable situation with a lot of risks. Like I fear we‚Äôll be doing great for awhile, and then maybe she pulls out and old tactic and cheats or something. She used to help at least one guy that I know of cheat on his girl often. And willingly did it. Now in closing, I don‚Äôt want her to seem bad. She‚Äôs so sweet and I love her, just don‚Äôt know what to do.

Yet I feel like he‚Äôs the love of my life and that he understands me better than anyone. However, even though we‚Äôve had our ups and downs and before I think we have finally reached rock bottom. Basically a month ago he said he wouldn‚Äôt be active for a while but couldn‚Äôt tell me why. He hasn‚Äôt been replying ever since and I‚Äôve been extremely worried about his safety and feelings for me.

In the meantime, I feel like 16 years of sexual frustration have taken over my psyche. I am a 19-year old virgin who‚Äôs never had a guy, other than the aforementioned online FOB, interested in her. I am actually not an introvert or anything like that and always had friends in high school and actually partied quite a lot. Yet because I‚Äôm so dumb and unattractive I never got to even be seen as a romantic option by guys. I‚Äôve been a compulsive masturbator since my preteens and have developed a lot of messed up kinks that I feel stem from the profound loneliness and a desire for an actually real experience.

Anyway this is where the title becomes relevant. I am in college, where as you probably know hook-up culture is really big and every night I hear my roomates having sex with different guys and frankly I feel really jealous. I go to clubs and sit next to my friends while guys flirt with them and treat me as though I was invisible. I am tired of this. I just want to mean something to somebody.

    I shouldn‚Äôt think my own mother would tell me something like that making me fully believe her words because I‚Äôm very wreck-less with everything and it just makes me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be in Control.

I‚Äôm 21F and have been in a relationship now for about a year and a half. Before that, I was in a relationship for about 3 years, on and off. That relationship ended in the summer of 2019, and at the time my since-high school best friend and I spent pretty much every day together. 

The relationship was pretty rocky, manipulative and abusive. I don‚Äôt want to get into it, but it was physical, verbal, and mental. 
I was harassed post-breakup and rumours were spread about me and how the relationship ended. My mental health really declined and I developed an eating disorder. My family was not very aware of the situation, as they either live 2+ hours away or are not there for me. 
I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety earlier that year and my sense of self was totally gone. I tried to still hang out with my best friend through this and maintain that friendship as best I could. 

Well, not long after the breakup my best friend messaged me to say that she was done dealing with my mental health and that she needed to move on. (she stayed friends with my ex though) I thought wow, if my best friend can‚Äôt even handle this I shouldn‚Äôt put the burden of myself on anyone else. I‚Äôve barely talked to my friends since then. In fact I think I only have one friend right now. I‚Äôm scared to make friends with someone who will inevitably find out my struggles and walk out of my life.

I also think I jumped into this current relationship far too quickly. I also moved in 4 months into the relationship because of my financial situation due to the pandemic. I regret it so much. I gave up my own apartment. The lockdowns don‚Äôt help.

I needed my friend.the only friend my husband allowed beacaue she lived so far away. She was almost happy when we split.telling me he was no good anyway blah blah, she been single 16 years and she's happily single so not a jealousy issue. 
I know she's Ill drs don't know why she's ill she just is. I love her through all her and I'm gonna say it pity party's she has or had, she was justified in being and feeling sorry for herself but on her birthday last year I texted her a happy birthday and got no reply. I figured she's busy having a good day ( I was at the time in a hostel with my daughter and working trying to get our life back on track) so sent her a few random standard it's your birthday texts etcetc and at the end of the day she sent a standard to everyone message 
It went along the lines of you all messaged me and I didn't want to be reminded of my birthday you all ignored my wishes to ignore my birthday I need space no one contact me anymore.... Ikr I felt awful if I hadn't at least messaged her she may have regretted not wanting her birthday mentioned but I didn't know her family would text her and wish her a happy birthday too.
Now in her defense she had told me she didn't want a birthday as it marked a year since her illness and a lack of diagnosis but c'mon a text from your bestie?? Wouldn't hurt right.well apparently it did. I figured she meant party or family gathering or something not a bloody text.
I've messed her, called her, written to her ( a funny card) done everything but visit because il be honest I'm angry 
This last year I needed a friend! A friendship is two ways? I needed a shoulder to cry on I needed a friend to help me out of the dark places my mind went... and nothing! She's ghosted everyone and now I'm feeling a little like fuck you then. I know her mental health is t great but damn girl we can't fix you if you don't at least try. She always has an issue as to why she can't make the changes she needs to help herself but like..  there's only so much outside help can offer and my life took that 180 turn so I've been a little busy.. what do I do? Go see her finally? Message her keep messaging her telling her I love her and respect her need to be alone etcetc. I resent her for ditching me when I needed her. But I want my friend back. Perhaps I should have of ignored her on her birthday but il be honest chances are shed have been all depressed because no one messaged her (she's weird like that) it's always about her... But I get that she's had to look after herself for so long but mehh.
Perhaps im selfish for wanting a friend so badly?

I'm shit at talking to strangers, and I'm so socially awkward that even if I ever got the courage to try to start conversation with someone, I'd probably say something stupid and make them dislike me.

I'm used to being alone but I make a fun production of it. I used to get real down about it. But I got through it. As time went on I had to prove to a lot if jagoffs that I was certainly independent. 

I even celebrated a Valentines once! Never had a Valentine so I had a bubble bath, fancy chocolates (I'm worth it), and a glass of wine. Oh and candles!! It was great til I spilt the wine in the bathwater.

I also don't answer the phone because it's always someone coming for me. Like Randy from Chase Visa (Mean Girls reference) or it's someone looking to sue or scam me. So my phone is the devil and someday I'm gonna burn it.

Also I like to sing into spoons when in the kirchen. If I have a tea towel I'll whip it around and dance.

All these things are true. I've had lots of friends in the past. To be honest they were all different groups or fit whatever phase I was in at the time.
But what remains is that they were all eccentric and I loved their company.

But as life moves on most of them are better at Monoply than me. But I played Risk but than they. It's just that they all got on with it and I had to find another avenue to stroll. Alone again of course but not for long.

Out of all of the years they've had to ghost me or fade me out because you were pretending to be my friend and never actually liked me: they chose the pandemic.

I know I'm not the only one who has been made to believe that loneliness is simply a mentality, a psychological inadequacy that we've simply invented. I was certain some months ago, that this ache I feel inside was all a matter of perspective.

Not only that, but this idea has been reinforced with the suggestion that we cant look for or find companionship and love, until we feel fulfilled by ourselves. However I've come to terms with my own truth. That's a load.

Humans have an innate social need, of which we cannot healthily be deprived of; and when I use the word ""need"", I'm speaking very literally, as people in isolation are almost certain to experience psychosis and paranoid hallucinations. We cannot be completely alone, it's devastating to our health.

Being told that in order to find love and friendship, we have to first find happiness in being alone, is a dangerous generalization. That line of logic only applies to very shallow forms of loneliness. Individuals that are seriously deprived are only going to suffer more greatly if they dont seek out comfort from others. It's comparable to insisting a starving person should believe they're not hungry anymore, rather than eating some food. 

I want to add an amendment to this philosophy. I want you to know, as I've finally allow myself to accept, that the empty feeling inside you is not imaginary, but completely real. That the answer to your struggle is not to rethink your position, but reach out and try again if you can, tell someone that you need them. You deserve to be cared for, and you dont have to deprive yourself of that simply because you havent overcome your friendless circumstances.  Being lonely is a real genuine hurt that needs to be soothed with friendship and love. Dont let anyone guilt you out of seeking what you need. There is nothing wrong with you for not being happy, you're socially deprived, your mind and body are starved of kindness. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved when you are so far from it. 

You can spend a lifetime trying to believe you arent alone, but you're still going to inevitably be in that same situation. Please, dont let this nonesense stop you from searching for a relationship or friendship. You're only human. You feel this way, because you are this way. And it's not your fault.",lonely,The hollowness you feel inside is real and you deserve to fill it,2021-04-29 07:57:54
221,somethingmisery,1619646280,1,"I'm so lonely. 

I have a friend. Not a *good* friend but she's been my friend for the past 8 years. Making new friends is very difficult so I thought I could get used to having one friend. Even if it makes me feel like shit cause I know, the moment I stop putting effort into this friendship.. yeah, It's frustrating and I try to ignore all her BS every day. 

It's better than nothing I guess but lately, I've been craving something else. Something intimate. I've never been in a relationship. I've never felt comfortable giving hugs and talking about my feelings. BUT I kinda wanna start giving someone hugs and tell them how they make me feel. 

Never thought I'd say this but I kinda wanna have sex. As a rape victim I haven't felt aroused since I was 12 years old but I kinda wanna do it. I want to have a relationship. I want to feel another person's skin against mine. I want to have my first kiss with someone special..

The only problem is that I'm unattractive, I'm scared of men (I've experienced a lot of sexual trauma) and I have a hundred problems with my mental and physical health. People always tell me ""wait until you feel better"" but that's gonna take at least 10+ years. 

I'm gonna be honest with you. Been suicidal since I was 8 years old. I'm still considering it so this might be my last year alive. It doesn't bother me. It's too painful to be alive. I've experienced so much trauma and pain.. this life isn't worth it. 

Idk. It's not fair. Why does everything have to be so complicated for me? I never asked for this life, yet I've spent every day suffering and feeling miserable.",lonely,I don't know what to do anymore..,2021-04-29 07:44:40

233,LongTermTrashAccount,1619639807,1,"Getting closer and closer to my 20th birthday, I've never had anyone I could call a true friend - I blame most of this on hyperprotective parents but caught myself consciously self-isolating due to anxiety in more recent years. Always wanted someone though. I've always wanted to have somebody I'd take a bullet for and somebody who would do the same for me. I've always wanted to find love but never did, and at this point I don't think an insecure social cripple like me ever will. And yeah, I've heard that the best things come when you least expect them and I'm not gonna doubt that, but I naturally tend to ruin relationships before they've even started so let's not be too optimistic here.

I've been depressed about this for quite a long time, seriously planning out a suicide in late 2020 - still got that plan on ""standby"", actually, but it's more of a worst-case-insurance than an urgency right now. Anyway. I've realized that the loneliness doesn't bother me that much anymore. I wake up, eat, work through my lectures and procrastinate every now and then. Sometimes being lonely crosses my mind but the thoughts don't hit nearly as hard as they used to. It's kind of like somebody telling you the sky is blue - uh, yeah, was about time that you noticed, so what?

I don't envy others for having social lives anymore, I don't get sad when I see happy couples walking hand in hand, I don't get instantly attached to every nice person, and I don't desperately try to stand out in online communities. I'm lonely, always have been, and probably always will be. I don't know what real friendship or real love feel like, never did, probably never will. I should be really fucking depressed - as I used to be - but it... doesn't matter? I think my emotion generator has stopped working or something. Can't complain though, maybe I wouldn't be here anymore if it were otherwise. 

Alright, if you've made it here: Thanks for reading, hope it wasn't a complete waste of time for you (apologies if it was). I don't really expect answers to this, to be honest, just felt the need to write something down and send it out to the whole world since I don't have anyone in particular.

I (M20) was in a very serious relationship for 3 years with a girl i held more precious than anything else. Although we were in a long distance relationship for most of the times, it was one of the most important part of my life. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for about a year and a half, and it affected our relationship in a very bad way. I started feeling insecure and constantly feared that she would leave me cause i was weak. Well, i guess my fears turned out to be true. She started feeling very distant from me and i could literally see everything crumble in front of my eyes. Things kept getting worse as i tried to fix it everytime. An argument about this about a month ago was the straw that broke the camel's back, and she told me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore.

We were still in touch with each other and i was always hoping that something could be done to fix things as it was very clear that we still loved each other.

That too faded away rather quickly and we stopped talking a few weeks back. It's been hell since then, constant memories of everything that happened. Both good and bad.

And everytime i think about it, i get terrible anxiety attacks. A fit of anger, grief and what not. Lockdown hasn't been kind here either, i live in a different city from all my friends and i practically spend all day locked up in my room.

But she thought i was a stalker . She told me so many times to leave her be. I kept feeling like she was all ive ever wanted and still do. But this year i finally just felt and understood how wrong it was and i should have just left her alone. Sometimes i wonder if its because inhave learning disabilities but i just couldnt see it until it was pointed out so clearly why it was wrong. Then i saw it but ive already hurt her by doing it so long. So now not only does she think im a stalker and wont talk to me, im miserable and likely to die alone. Im still not interested in anyone else and so lonely i just think one day maybe soon i will just end my life. So yeah i can confirm this. Dont make the same mistake i did because now my life is a lonely joke i wish would end. Im trying to improve myself and focus on that, because im overweight and my cholesterol is sky high and at 37 im high risk for heart attacks. But i struggle to even care any more.
I know people say move on etc but i cant.she was perfect for my tastes and we talked for a few years on and off. I tried to talk to new women but even as much as i liked them they werent her. And i didnt feel it. Even women i found really attractive i couldnt feel it. And i hate it.

285,Catastrophic-Jones,1619591900,1,"Hello internet. Guess it's my turn to try this out.

I like to think I'm capable of making good decisions sometimes, but this is not one of them. What's weird is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place, but through some convoluted Rube Goldberg chain of events, here we are.

It was a dark and stormy night...

Kidding, a bit cliche but gotta find the humor where I can.

I am currently living far from my home state, and have been for a few years. I've made some cool friends during this time, but often think about adventuring again. My current job makes that difficult, and with the pandemic I was working 6 days a week, 80 hours per. 

At one point I had my own apartment, but rent was expensive so I ended up moving into a friend's house while they left to stay somewhere else for the year. I had only one other roommate and we barely interacted but they were responsible and calm. It was perfect. I had finally given up using dating apps so I could focus on myself and self improvement. 

And then came the problems. 

Turns out what was happening was considered 'subletting' and against the lease agreement, so I ended up having to move yet again. A friend put me in touch with someone and I was honestly just looking for a place to stay, that's it.

So we met and hit it off really well, they felt like someone who got me and I enjoyed their company. It was still a long way from considering any sort of relationship with them and since I needed a place asap, I tried to bury those feelings and see if anything would just happen on their own. I was still prioritizing finding a place to stay, and if nothing had happened, so be it.

But happen they did.

They came home from work early one day, we ended up getting drunk and after some talking, hooked up. I felt really happy because it seemed like life was finally working out again and even with my job being stressful, something like this would've definitely helped me through that. I would've preferred it had been initiated sober but I got caught up in the moment and a bit attached too quickly.

After a couple days, they started acting a bit more distant at times and we would talk about things but I'd get a lot of vague responses. I'm big on communicating and wanted to make sense of everything because my anxiety and insecurities get the best of me. Just a little confirmation, that's all. Then one day they had their ex show up but I didn't think much of it since they had told me they were over him and he was just going to drop stuff off. After a few days of blowing my roommate off, he finally showed up and did, and I could definitely tell my roommate still liked him. Ouch.

Fast forward a bit, things have become even more tense between us. I kept trying to carefully pry or figure out what was going on and it's gotten to a point where I'm pretty sure I'm no longer welcomed company here. At least I don't feel like I am. The ex was over again tonight. Ok, that's fine. My solution is usually to remove myself from the equation, and leave the person be. I won't hold a grudge against them.

So now I'm planning to quit my job if I can't transfer back to my home state, and move out the end of next month. I will give them my 30 days notice but I've already paid for the next month anyway. Though it sounds extreme, I was already planning to leave before this. I just needed a bit more time, which I'll have by then I think. I do miss my family and friends back home. I acknowledge this was not the best judgment call I've made, it actually goes against my own set of rules but again, I was put in a corner and had little room to work with. It's definitely a lesson learned, that's for sure. But it also hurts too.

What also sucks is my birthday is coming up in a few days and I'm supposed to have a huge celebration with a bunch of my friends here. It'll become the best farewell party, even if most of them don't know it yet.

I'm not looking for anything, I just wanted to vent about it somewhere while I get through the next month with these new adjustments. I'm still going to work on improving myself, always, this was just a wound that truly got me in the most unexpected and unnecessary way. RIP.",lonely,Whoops,2021-04-28 16:38:20

335,TheCollegeDropout_,1619569825,1,"I'm 18 and have been lonely for awhile now, probably dating back to when I was 12. When I was 12 (and before I turned 12), I used to have friends from the neighborhood. I was close with 2 of them, a few others I enjoyed being with too.

Eventually, that all ended. Basically, this went down: I lost a close friend due to an incident with the family of my younger sister's close friend (they still keep on contact with each other) and two others faded off (including one I was close with). The only neighborhood kid that didn't fade away doesn't talk to me much. We talk from time to time though.

After that, my loneliness continued through 7th and 8th grade and high school. In 7th and 8th grade. I was friends with two people. Once I graduated, I lost contact with one friend (readded him on Facebook about two years ago, but we don't talk and he's doing surprisingly well) and another went to high school with me and we talked from time to time. 

In high school, I had one close friend. Talked to two people: one basically cut me off after he became popular in the small school and the other faded away. I wasn't really unknown though as I knew just about everyone in that small school of 400 kids. Many of them I have on social media and from time to time I would strike conversations with them (these days I don't even got the confidence to do that).

I used to be able to handle this loneliness. Sure I didn't really talk to people being shy and all, but I still knew most of them. Once I started college though, that all changed. I feel lonelier than ever as I end my freshman year. I tried making friends in my CO '24 group but had no luck. I don't know anyone and going from a school of 400 people to 2000 people is major for me. This loneliness is seriously hurting me and making me feel very sad sometimes.

This feeling of loneliness gets even worse when I think about what could've been with a few people. Since I'm shy, there's not many of them, but there are two in particular I can think of. One was a person I was close with (as friends) online from late 2017 - mid-2018, but eventually as the months passed things were changing. We basically mutually agreed to stop talking to each other in our best interests. The second was when I had a crush on someone from a class we had together in 2019. We didn't talk, but we followed each other on Instagram. Summer break came around and it was looking like she was dropping non-verbal signs for me to make an effort to talk to her and make a move, but my shyness held me back. Hurts even more when I run into her occasionally (like today).

I just don't wanna be lonely anymore. Tired of it. I like talking to my twin brother but those convos can only go so far. Same with my family. I need friends and I need a relationship. I need a support too. I can't just hangout with my cousins all the time like I did two years ago, I need friends. It sucks.",lonely,Loneliness just hurts me even more day-by-day.,2021-04-28 10:30:25

M, 29 (almost 30), ex-USSR (English is my third language and i\`m little drunk), so please, be forgiving...

For almost 30 years i have never had sex or even kiss without money. Only ""professionals"", if you understand. Smthng bout me - i\`n not ugly, but i\`m shy AF. Bit fatter than average, but not typical fatass - wide shoulders,  height above average, not-so bad face... I\`m EXTREMELY erudited - i can participate in discussion with pros in almost any field - from healthcare to car engine tuning. Have read a lot of books,  But i don\`t know how to talk with girls - i have newer had ANY relationships. In terms of money - i live in own flat in really good apartment, have an average job and average car. 

Anyway, i was searching for suicide support subreddit that isn\`t dead (i hate myself, i hate my friends, i hate whole world - and instead of hanging myself tonight i just bought some alcohol, if you know some ""iruinedmylife/ihatemylife"" sub/r - share a link, please) - and solitude - one of main reasons.

I used to suffer from extreme bouts of loneliness, so much so, that it felt I was going mad. Today, I started feeling it a little bit again. 

I realized that the loneliness doesn‚Äôt come from being alone, but from being around people who make you feel alone. 

For example, let‚Äôs say you are in a room by yourself, and you feel okay. But you hear voices next door, so you go investigate. You know these people, so you try to join the conversation, but, they turn their backs on you, cut you off, and ignore what you say. You go back to your room, but now you feel lonely instead of okay. 

Or, you were okay, but you decide. To call your friend. They don‚Äôt pick up. You text them. They don‚Äôt respond to your text all day. The fact that you made an effort, but that person couldn‚Äôt bother to make an effort back makes you feel worse than when you started.

I think this is mainly due to how I was before, because I haven't always had problems finding friends. And I can never fully commit to telling people how fucking bad it is.

I think it is because I hate talking about it. I've asked my doctor for help, as in ""what do I do with this"", but I don't qualify for a psychiatrist. And I can't afford to go to one outside of the health care system. I wanna shake him and tell him that I'm in a personal hell, but instead I just downplay it and start reflecting over what I could try to do to counter my loneliness. Because begging for help sucks.

How do I communicate my loneliness, and most importantly, to whom? I don't want to talk to my family about it. I don't have any close friends where I live, and I would rather not talk to my old friends about it either. What can they do?

395,jhinglebell,1619541009,1,"Hello everyone who's reading, I've been going through a very rough patch since 2017. Its like the more I am growing the more hectic and lonely it's becoming. I don't want to talk to anyone because no one will understand wtf is going in that ball of bones up there. It's like I am doing suicide everyday. In my mind sometimes I jump from a building, sometimes in the ocean. But at that time when I am dying in my dying its really peaceful. I forget my pain at that time. I look at my surrounding like i am dead and it all seems so beautiful, so peaceful and then boom something brings me back to reality and then the pain comes back and then i again die and so on and on. But the problem lies is that I had only one person in my life I used to talk to openly about my feelings but she left me again. It's the fourth time she left me. I know she'll never be mine but still i can't stop thinking about her. She is the love of my life. She usually leaves me for 4-6-12 months dates someone else and comeback and then again leaves whenever she wants. And the thing that mostly hurts me is that I always shake my world to make her happy, give my 100 percent, ignore all those bullshit she does to me only in the hope that one day she'll understand my love. One day she'll know that there is no one better than me. But i am fooling myself. I know that again when she comes back i will jump to her with open arms and after few days she'll again left me. So idk what to do. All I am doing is hoping for her to one-day understand my love. And other than her i used have my homie. We stayed together since we were 3 to were 21 and then suddenly one-day he ratted me out to police for a crime he convicted and i had to gothrough a whole lot of bullshit nonsense of some motherfucking narcissist police. But finally justice is served. So currently I am really low and lonely. I really want to talk to someone who can make me remind what it was used to feel to be alive. I wrote this essay about my life in the hope that someone will talk to me. If anyone is going though a hard time and don't have anyone to talk to. I am here.

435,Throwra_12234,1619507515,1,"If this isn't allowed in this subreddit feel free to remove it. I just don't know where to begin. I'm usually not a person that's sappy and down like this. Normally I'm a go-getter and somewhat upbeat but this shit sucks. I know I have a lot going for me. I have a great career, I have a great set of friends, I'm working on getting my own place, I'm just missing the special someone that I want to go through this with. I'm still young (21m) and have plenty of time but I'm feeling pretty hopeless now. I've had a few relationships in the past that lasted pretty long and left me with some battle scars just like everybody else. However, this last one has got to me the most. I'll give you a little backstory. When I was younger I was in a manipulative relationship with a woman who lied to me about being pregnant. When that ended I focused myself on my career and not dating for a few years. After I got my career started I wanted to get back out in the dating game. I'm not the most photogenic person but I'm also not ugly. I feel like I'm a solid 7 out of 10 maybe a 6. However, I feel like I have a great personality, sense of humor, and many other great qualities. Anyway, I downloaded the dating apps Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid. I met a handful of women who were okay, some not so okay. I found myself lowering my standards and making me depressed that I wasn't getting any matches. (When I say depressed I'm not the person that gets ""depressed"" but that's probably the only time I've felt it.) I met one girl and she was nice and some things developed but she was not my type and I found myself acting really desperate. Then I matched on bumble with this woman when I wasn't expecting it. This woman was everything I wanted. We got along great, she was genuine, had a career, and was someone I felt like I could talk to about anything. I'm usually a very VERY reserved person and don't open up to people I don't know very well. It took me a year to open up to my best friend and even now I don't talk to him about everything, I haven't even told him this story. This girl though I opened up to her immediately. I felt safe with her. I was head over heels for this girl. Anyway, things were going great for three weeks, we were having fun together, learning a lot about each other and the sex was great. I just couldn't get enough of her. Best of all I was happier. I had a bounce in my step, smiling, and less stressed. She was really good for me. I know it sounds like so high school bullshit where they say they loved each other after a week. I wouldn't say I loved her but I cared for her a lot and yearned to know her more. Then the same day I deleted all the dating apps she pulled the rug out on me. She said that we didn't have chemistry. I couldn't believe it. I thought we had plenty of chemistry. She told me that I was everything she wanted on paper yet didn't feel right going on because she didn't feel the ""chemistry"". She said she would like to stay friends though and I can't bring myself to remove her from my snap. I still hold this feeling that her feelings for me will change for me but I know that not to be true. I am thankful she didn't lead me on however, I felt like I had done something wrong. Like it was my fault because it was going great before that. I have a lot of time to think at my job and I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I did anything wrong. I've replayed every interaction we had in those 3 weeks and couldn't find it. So I assume something else or she didn't want a relationship or something else. Usually, just move on no big deal. This time though, I haven't. it's been over a month and I'm still thinking about her. Not all the time but a few times throughout the day. I know I should stop and can't, especially, since I know she SURE AS FUCK NOT THINKING ABOUT ME. So I redownloaded the dating apps and now things have changed for me. I can't get likes let alone matches. My standards have dropped to an all-time low. My self-worth has dropped when it comes to dating. On top of it all, I've run through everyone in my radius furthering the thought I won't meet anyone. I know I will meet someone eventually it just doesn't feel like it. How I realized this was I succumbed to something I told myself I'd never do. I purchased tinder platinum and boy did it do fuck all for me. A few likes from people I would have never swiped right on, people from 9900 miles away from me liking my profile, and 1 or 2 matches that end with 3 messages because the other party can't carry a conversation. I've also followed multiple advice subreddits, relationship advice, dating advice, etc. So I know about join a hobby. Great, there are not many hobbies around here that I can do to just meet new people in general let alone find dates. I've started hiking which I enjoy and even lost 5 pounds since starting but, I can't meet new people with that hobby. I am not interested in a sport and meet-up is dead here. I don't have a dog and not going to invest in a dog just for the sake of meeting people. I am fully ready to date and could put my feelings for that girl aside. I don't miss the girl just the feelings she gave me. These feelings are exaggerated by the fact that a friend of mine died in a plane crash recently and had everything taken from him. I want to experience my life like there's no tomorrow. 

I also have become more introverted in these past few months so I don't know how to approach these people without seeming awkward after reading many stories on Reddit. 

So I pose the question what do I do now. Where do I go to meet people? What hobbies do I pick up? Do I just say fuck it and ask people out?

437,Due_Comb4109,1619507395,1," I want to tell my opinions because I couldn't find someone to tell. If you don't want to read, it's your decision. No spoiler about Attack On Titan so you can read freely. Now.. let's start. I am 20 years old and I have never had a boyfriend or a girlfriends or real friends. I mean I have never feel love for noone until this time. I always care my lessons and my future career because I think love is just unnecesarry for your goals. I was a succesfull student but I passed from a really bad highschool period. I mean I was just unlucky about it.. so unfortunately I have not much friends. I always tried to be kind to other people but it just made me hurt. Actually all friends I have are virtual. I like spend my time at home so I can only communicate with them on the Internet. But you know, you can communicate with other people on the Internet but it is not really make your relationship closer. You cannot really understand the real feelings person who you talk on chat. So, I didn't feel my virtual friends are really closer to me but you have to talk someone. I just focus on my games,animes and lessons for future. I try to don't care people because I feel really broken because of them. But I couldn't, I still acting like I am fine on my chats. Whatever, this year I started to watch Attack On Titan. At first time, I dreamed friendship of Armin, Mikasa, Eren or Sasha, Jean, Connie.. I always wanted someones closer like them in my life but it never happened. When I finished the first part of the season 4, I started to read the manga to see the final part. The first time I saw Levi, I really don't understand why people love Levi so much. Yes, he is good-looking but I really don't understand that loving someone for only apperance. When I continiued watching, I felt more closer and closer. And I realized Levi's personality is who I wanted exactly to be like or exactly who I am. I saw myself on Levi. I started to care him. When I feel sad I always remembered him to make me feel good. I am a regular, planner and neat person but sometimes I can feel tired. In those times I motivated myself with Levi and I keep follow my daily plans regularly. I still no real friends to talk but I am more succesfull to don't care it. My days are passing more efficiently. I am the leader of a project which is given by university. I feel more comfortable than my high school years. I realised I love an fictional character..because for the first time I found someone who are like me. Or who I wanted to be. I know it's not normal but I finally more comfortable now. But makes me broken because he is not real as I said and I have no hope meet someone who actually understand my opinions. Like friends, boy/girlfriend... I just wanted to told it someone and if you read it know, thank you. I just don't know what can I do about that situation. If you have no close friend, is it normal love someone even he is a fictional character? If noone cares your opinions or respect your ideas, is it normal feeling better with virtual?

Since all of this, I‚Äôve become quite introverted and found that this just works best for me. I reached my threshold of foolishness, betrayal, usury, selfishness and everything in between.

Having recently experienced health complications, I learned that even THIS does not change the mere fact that you may remain alone. Just as friends and associates won‚Äôt be there for you, family may not be either. Never forget that they‚Äôre just people and can sometimes be even worse than friends or associates. I‚Äôve just accepted all of this for what it is. I learned that I cannot change myself and who I am for the sake of other people‚Äôs poor behavior.

Or when my family wants me to go somewhere, pick up food, get yelled at for something I had no part in or run an errand, I'm suddenly the first person on their mind. But when I want to watch a movie, eat dinner they suddenly have a lot going on. It sucks because I'm always around people, but people don't really want to be around me, or at least it feels that way. If i were to stop texting them or talking to them they wont make the first move its always me and I'm exhausted for carrying 1 sided friendships and relationships. At this point the 2 people I have to talk to and hang out with and that want to hang out with me are my dog Duke and my little brother. I don't want to sound ungrateful for them because I love them dearly and love hanging out with them. But the alone feeling persists everyday now. It's gotten to the point where I am now pushing people away to be alone because I see being lonely as better than being used. I know that's not helping, but I either feel lonely or used. Both lead to the same feeling anyway so it's not like it matter either way.

It was a nice visit and my aunt who is my dads sister told me she wanted to be in a lot closer touch and she‚Äôd like to visit me.  She began calling me and she did actually visit me.  She never has before.  She was always really nice to me and I loved her as a kid.  It meant so much to me for her to visit and for us to be in touch.

Hi Hello Hola

My name is Krishna. I am Medico from India. I would like to get things of my chest before its too late. This is 4th day I could not sleep because of my scrambled mind and breathlessness due to Covid (maybe) tho my spO2 level is 92-95.

Today I wanna share my experience with my opportunistic friends Sriram and Naga. Lets talk about Sriram today.

I met sriram in a Help Website called 7cups almost 2 years back tho i have never met him in person.

We chatted for days and were looking for same thing "" a friend "" so shared each other numbers.

I gotta admit it was one of the best times of my life, the feeling of having a friend with whom you share your day and talk about random things.

I have shared all my secrets and he has too. We were very close. Being lonely all my life I was fond of him and loved his company. The days he made me laugh, the times we watched movies together. Will cherish it always.

Its not like we had happy times only, oh we fought a lot too but you gotta let somethings slide in friendship but we were close. We used to always patch up and get back to normal.

There were times (most of the times) I was one who would say sorry and move on from argument.

So we were there for each other during thick and thin of times for each other.

But I was a fool who didn't understand life and friendship. The change depending on circumstances. My mum tells me I am weak and gullible but I never heeded to what she says. I trusted Sriram completely with my life.

Things started spiraling downwards early this year, I could sense things not right between us. He would complain for silly reasons and was looking for reasons to distance me.

He has said many rude things but I always let it slide for betterment of our friendship and we will have good days ahead.

2 days back he picked up a thing I said and made it big issue. Guess what it was about. It was about pets-dogs to be exact.

I said I feel sorry that People adopt a Dog and that dog is lucky to have food on its plate, someone to take care of dog, but whereas Kids from poor family are malnourished.

I come from a developing country where people are poor like you see kids as small as 2 years begging on Traffic Signals and sleeping on Footpaths and no one cares.

I said a insensitive thing "" If dogs are not fed by their owners they wont be affectionate towards owners"" which is kinda true but my opportunistic friend took offence.

I had a Cat for year and half , I used to spend a load on his food and would fight with family for the cat, but one day the cat didn't return home. I searched for him for days. Sad time of my life. I felt heartbroken. But that's another story.

So I have nothing against pets but Sriram who claimed to be with me for life said a lot of things. He swore and abused which was shocking at first but now I understand He was just waiting to pick up a fight and ditch me because he has found new friends and apparently they are cooler and much better than me in every single way.

We Medicos have learned something called opportunistic infection, Its when your body develops a infection when your immune system is compromised. I have related 2 of my friends as opportunistic Friends. They were with me as long as it benefited them in someway and when they made new friends they ditched me.

So my Opportunistic Friend Sriram ditched me and blocked me for good without even understanding what I had to say and how I would feel.

I feel bad but somewhere I sensed all this coming. Well It was my mistake I let someone in my life with so much importance. He left me in a vulnerable time but I have no bad feelings for him. I wish him the best what life can offer.

I have learned my lesson.

If you are still reading till here I thank you and if you have ever gone through things like this I would like to talk with you about how to cope up.

If you feel for me, hit me up maybe we can be friends because we know the feeling of being ditched.

I can't promise you that your friendship with me will be cool and happy 24x7 but I promise you I will be there for you always no matter what of-course if I survive Covid.

This is my Life experience with Sriram. In my next post I will talk about Naga. Would love to hear yours.

Hugs,

Krishna",lonely,"My experience, and need a true honest friend.",2021-04-27 12:49:14

480,Every_Opportunity250,1619489823,1,"I joined this subreddit because I needed a place to vent and little did I know that there were tons and tons of people who felt exactly what I felt. I don't vent to my friends about this mainly because I feel as though they wouldn't get it. Sometimes I don't need to be cheered up, sometimes I just need to listened to. 

There are many of you that I relate to. It's almost as if you guys are reading my mind sometimes. I know the feeling that you might think there's something wrong with you or that you're tired of seeing people in relationships but I assure you that there is nothing wrong with you. Your time will come and when it does it is going to be greater than anything that you could have ever imagined. Someone will see you for the amazing person that you are. 

Some days are better than most but just because it isn't happening right now does not mean that it will never happen.  There's a quote that goes like this ""Happiness is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it eludes you but if you turn your attention to other things then it comes and sits softly on your shoulder."" It'll happen for you and for me. I know sometimes it's hard to keep the hope alive. 

I just wanted to spread some positivity in this reddit because I know how it can get. Trust me your time will come. Sometimes the best things in life take a little longer to happen but when it does you're going to be so happy and you're going to realize that everything was meant to be the way it was. I hope that this can bolster at least one persons spirit because I know that sometimes I need to hear these words. Thank you and have a nice day,",lonely,Keep Hope Alive,2021-04-27 12:17:03

On paper I think I have a good relationship with my husband, but he's the only one I have a relationship with and I can tell I wear on him. I talk a lot *at* him. I can't stop. It's about stupid stuff. I get obsessed with really weird things and I can't stop talking about them. I don't mean to, but I corner him when he's trying to work and talk at him. It's pathetic. I don't look at people much so it takes me a bit to realize I'm doing it, but when I do he'll just be working usually because that's all anyone should be expected to do. Tolerance. I am tolerated. He's very intelligent. I'm ""cerebral"" but contribute very little of value to anyone really. A real waste of brain cells.

When I was young I was an alcoholic and things were easier socially. Now, 12 years sober and I'm just so incredibly lonely. Other people don't make sense to me. My anxiety makes leaving my house difficult.  I can tell what most people will do before they do it. It's all just primal instincts and biological imperatives dressed up as complex social behaviors. People are predictable, but also disappointing. Knowing why they do what they do, believe what they believe, like what they like-- it doesn't help. And I'm the same or worse. 

I watch people all the time when they aren't paying attention. I try to figure them out. Some people I even really like in my mind but I don't actually *know* them, just what I observe or learn about them. I cannot authentically connect to anyone. All of my attempts are embarrassing to me. I feel critical and disgusted with every conversation, every email, every text, every neighborly exchange. I'm just terrible at it-- I try too hard and I don't even know why. I never maintain any non-professional relationships with people who seem willing. It's too hard to do the dances and say the words. It always feels like effort and I get so tired. As soon as I start trying I burn out or end up cringing over something I've done and isolate.

I think about everything...every little tiny thing. I have to make everything so complicated. Why do I have to make everything so complicated?

Knowing I'm self-sabotage doesn't stop me from feeling left out and envious of other peoples' relationships either. It's really illogical. 

At night when I'm lying in bed trying to sleep I think about the fact that dying is probably just like dreamless sleep and that I won't even know if it happens. It's scary and comforting. When I wake up in the morning, I feel surprised.

486,redshoes666,1619487992,1,"TW - mentions of mental health, addiction

Hey all, just dropping by to vent to some fellow lonely hearts. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it‚Äôs been especially bad for the last..... oh, maybe 4-5 years? At one point in my early 20s, I had accumulated what I thought was a large, incredible group of friends who I considered to be like family. I would stress endlessly about how many gifts I would have to buy for birthdays, how packed my schedule was, etc etc. But as the years went by, the friendships kind of started falling off for various reasons - couples broke up and moved on, fights happened between people and groups split down the center even when you didn‚Äôt want to take sides, people moved away, people got busy with careers and families, people just straight-up changed (totally normal for the age we were), and honestly my mental illness ended up pushing several of my closest friends away because I just wasn‚Äôt handling things right. An overarching theme though ended up being that almost everyone I loved so much were really basically just party friends, or friends of convenience (school, mutual friends, high school connections who I felt a nostalgic pull to, friends of my husband, etc). 

Then I ended my decade-long relationship with my husband, partially influenced by my depleted mental state, and with that also came the destruction of most if not all of my remaining friendships. My plummeting already-low mental health issues led to me completely isolating myself from everyone in general, and a lot of people took sides without knowing my side of the story at all. 

I‚Äôve been doing a little bit of Bumble BFF here and there, and trying to reach out to people who I am more so acquaintances with, and have met a few people who seem cool, but god I am so incredibly lonely. But also so incredibly socially anxious. I have a partner who I live with who is essentially my only friend, but our relationship has been super rocky lately and it has me thinking even more about my lack of support system. Before now, I lived with my husband and always had a least one roommate, but our home also had basically an open-door policy because there were always so many people coming and going (mostly friends of my husband). Our house was the meeting point, the party spot, the crash pad, and everything in between. Even though I wasn‚Äôt necessarily interacting with them all the time, I‚Äôm so used to having a hustling bustling house around me. It used to drive me insane a lot of the time to always have that going on, but now everything is too noticeably quiet. My partner is a bit older and doesn‚Äôt have the desire or energy for a party lifestyle, and honestly neither do I, so our home certainly isn‚Äôt that place anymore (even before COVID). I also definitely had/have a drinking problem that tends to sometimes still rear its head when I‚Äôm in social situations, so I have cut out most of my old party friends who I did still speak to, for my own health (we all had severe drinking and/or substance abuse issues), but I feel stupid sometimes for doing so, just because I‚Äôm so lonely and desperate for human interaction.

I‚Äôm trying to heal myself from everything I‚Äôve gone through in the past few years, but damn I‚Äôm so fucking lonely and it really gets me down sometimes. However, it makes me feel a little less lonely to know that... well, I‚Äôm not alone. So thanks everyone for sharing your stories here.",lonely,Empty Life,2021-04-27 11:46:32
487,No_Spirit9156,1619487991,1,"The night before I was scrolling on Instagram and I saw how one of the most valuable and important women I have ever known gloated over her laments, writing a status that revealed sadness eating away at her inside. Even in beauty and near perfection, pain is there to be an obstacle in our lives.

That girl had what is apparently an enviable life. A friend that I always support, but could not hide her problems for much longer, and brought out all her demons, although not exactly all her followers. Only his best friends.

Who is not on that list, they will think that their days are an adventure that few have the opportunity to experience, but what they do not know is that each person shows a perfect image of themselves on social networks. Definitely, those of us who only dedicate ourselves to observing give us by feeling lonely and miserable before the good life of others.

Comparisons are hateful and cruel, and sometimes unrealistic if we are based solely on an image and not on the inside of a person. Social media is like walking through a desert, with the sun shining and the temperature so hot that hell is envious. Sand sneaks between our boots and our dry lips cry out for a single drop of water. In the distance we see what we need, what we long for, but it is not really there. Our eyes see a presence that does not exist. A ghost that fulfills all our wishes. That presence is those photographs that we see or upload, but every traveler is thirsty. Some have a backpack with supplements, others created their own shelter, others have absolutely nothing, but are excited to do so. It is the reflection of what we want.

Not in all cases it is real. I invite you all not to feel burdened by the lives of others. This is not about a race against time, it is about a destination that we all want, and we do our best to show that we achieve it.

I end up just logging back onto work until I fall asleep. 

I‚Äôve been in relationships before but nothing serious. It‚Äôs mostly been with older, married men. But it was just sex and they didn‚Äôt care anything about me. I‚Äôm so tired and my spirit is so broken that I don‚Äôt have a the energy to get my heart smashed again.

I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll never find anyone because everyone my own age is still in college and older men see me as a sex toy and not a viable relationship. I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable doing dating apps so that‚Äôs off the table. I can‚Äôt meet people in person because I‚Äôm very anxious and also I‚Äôm not attractive at all so I‚Äôd never be able to get anyone‚Äôs attention.

518,BossTitleGiver,1619474379,1,"I feel lonely in my beliefs. In my thoughts. Not because I don't know anyone, but because almost everyone I know doesn't seem to care about the things I value most. Things like kindness. Nature. Morality. Integrity. Minimalism. The beauty of life.

I live my life trying to do my best to be kind to the world. To the people around me. To myself. I really the little moments of peace it gives. The things nature provides. I am in love with my life.

But sometimes I get the feeling I am one of the very few people who see life this way. Sometimes I get sad when I see people hurting others or hurting themselves. Even if I try to help. Sometimes I feel sad when others seem to care only about themselves. Especially when they are part of my family or one of my friends.

But just as that gets me sad, there are many things which bring me peace. Like looking at the movement of the trees. Their leaves. Looking at my hand. Asking myself questions like, *""How can something so taken for granted like a hand or like a finger be so beautiful, so perfectly made?""* or *""How many people out there stop and admire how beautiful their hand is?""*. Because, have you ever taken a few minutes just to admire it? Have you seen all the lines that make it *your* hand? And think about it. Everyone's hand is different. There is no one else in the world who has a copy of your hand. Isn't that incredible?

And just like that, there are so many thing in the world which make it beautiful. I am truly in love with the world. The things it gives. We are in a world so beautiful and made for people to enjoy, but we have made it easier to hurt other people or hurt ourselves than to enjoy it.

Have you ever asked the why of the things that make up your life? *""Why do I feel this way?""*. *""Why do people do things which hurt themselves?""*. *""Why do I use social media, if it only makes me compare myself to others?""*.

I really love to think about this sort of things. To ask myself things. I feel part of the world when I do. Not of the people, of the world. Of nature. But then, I want to share my thoughts with someone else. When I find myself alone in the middle of a sea of thoughts. And I start asking myself things like, *""Will I ever find someone who sees the world the way I see it?""*. *""How long will it be until I find someone like that?""*.

I feel like there is no one to whom to talk about these things. And I feel sad. Because I sometimes feel like no one wants to listen to these things. As if these things were not important. But these are the most important things to me. Thinking. Wondering. Feeling. *Living*.

At least not to the people I know or with whom I live. With very, very few exceptions. But those exceptions sometimes are not as available as I wish they were. I feel there is no one available to tell these things. Which is why I feel lonely. Really lonely.

But just as I am in love with life, I am really hopeful that I will meet beautiful people in the future who will make me feel less lonely and less rejected. I know in my guts that I will. I just have to be patient. But for now, I will be feeling lonely a little more time. Because I love my life and feeling lonely is just part of the journey. I don't believe it's one or another. I believe what I feel is normal, even if it hurts.

I just wanted to vent. Thank you for reading. I believe other people's stories really help us remember we are not alone in our loneliness, even if they are different kinds of loneliness. Which is why I wanted to share my story. I hope you have a very beautiful day and I that this, in a way, helped you at least one per cent.",lonely,I love my life and I feel lonely.,2021-04-27 07:59:39

I was watching youtube and my mom called me into my parents' room. Oh shit.

Sitting in a bed was my dad and my older brother (22M). Last week I posted a close friends story in which I said that I love my (future) ""sister in law (19F)"" (my brothers gf) but that she had terrible taste in men. Of course it was humor.

My sister in law, thinking it was funny sent it to my brother who laughed at the moment. But then my 22 year old brother went to my dad to accuse me of this.

Dad (50M) was very upset. He claimed that people's image of us could be ruined by me doing this. He said it was distastefull and not funny. I felt betrayed. Close friends aren'r supposed to screenshot anything.

The funny thing is that the day before my sister in law and I took a picture and my brother jokingly said to me ""**oh you better put your mask back on,**"" claiming i should hide away my acne. After taking the picture, my sister in law asking my brother how do we look and he saying ""**you always look good, but her...**""

I didn't say anything. It hurt a little atm but I knew he was kidding. I didn't go running to daddy to accuse him of this because I am mature and get it was a sibiling thing.

My brother knew my dad would take down the hammer.

Here are some of the things he said to me.

""No one is every gonna love you more than your family. **Your psychologist only bears with you because we pay her.""**

the idea that people can become so deeply ingrained in our lives then leave in the blink of an eye gives me whiplash. this can be either voluntary or involuntary leaving.
a part of this fear is thinking, or realizing, that i can become dispensable and/or forgettable to someone i love.

605,lookingforatribe,1619415560,1,"Hi, Like majority of people here, I'm lonely...'*cant focus anything else in my life, have to keep listning to podcasts/youtube/audiobooks so I can feel a bit human'* lonely. 

I have no real life friends and no online friends. I have tried to make friends many times but it never goes anywhere.... I have seen that many times that is because people have  other friends and not invested in the idea of developing a long term friendship. This gave me an idea for below  

So I have a proposition for you... I will make a discord server for us... 10-15 lonely people, who are desperately looking for friends. This is why it can work if we try- 

1. Everyone will be as desperate and lonely as you for friends and new people. So you dont have to feel anxious while speaking. 
2. As everyone has experienced lonely ness, it will be easy to connect. 
3. with 10-15 people, you will at least find a support network to keep you afloat till you find friends. 
4. This will be a good social interaction practice, with comparatively less pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why it may cause problems - 

* Everyone will be a bit depressed and introverted, so conversations will be stilted. 
* We have no common point other than loneliness. 

I would really like to give it a try. What I have in mind, wait till I have at least 5 people on server. After that have a small Voice chat about everyone,( 5-6 questions which everyone will answer, fav band, food etc) , then daily/weekly voice chat session, May be we can watch movies together, play games....whatever normal people do. If you want to try, I am a type A personality so I will plan something, you will just have to show up and participate. 

**Criteria for joining - (you can comment on this post or if you are uncomfortable with that, DM me for server info) Please note I would not let the total number go above 10-15, as otherwise, it will not feel intimate.** 

* Age range - 24 to 35 ( so everyone will be kind of similar stage of life)
* Basic knowledge of discord and technology (Voice chat and typing, thats it)
* basic knowledge of English for communication.",lonely,I would like to make a group,2021-04-26 15:39:20

     It sucks being lonely. And not just alone, but really lonely. The type that, even when you're surrounded by people you love and who love you, there's always that feeling of...

Seperation.

Distance.

Annoyed. 

Angry? 

Sad.

And despite better judgment, knowing I should be happy they are happy too, I just cant. It's selfish, and unfair to them, and I know it.
     But still that red hot fire broils up within. Just a flash of heat, but enough to get me wishing I didn't have ears. 

Or eyes.

Or life.

     To just be gone, and feel none of these awful, selfish, cruel feelings. It always seems unfair to me that I instinctively act like that when they actually deserve what they have. 
 
What anyone has.

     And I somehow expect it all to fall into my hands without any effort. And I know that isn't how the world works. I don't deserve anything. Not a single speck of dust I'm worthy enough for.

Never had friends, my mom told me I never got along with anyone at school and that I was doomed to be bullied.

Queue my entire childhood, teenagerhood, and now in front of a computer. Before you ask, yes, I made a whole one friend. Don't know their name, have only heard their voice twice, but they are pretty much my best friend.

609,NecessarySlow9955,1619413883,1,"Hey all. So a few weeks ago I asked my boyfriend (for context we've been together for a year and two months) if he could go see his mom for a bit (she's about 150 miles away) because I felt like I needed some space away from him to evaluate our relationship and where it was going and also to just get some mental and physical space to myself. We were both unemployed and spending far too much time with each other all day every day in our tiny bedroom (and I mean tiny; probably around 100sq ft and filled with stuff). I decided very quickly after he left that I still wanted a relationship with him, but that I wanted some changes. I'm feeling much better about all of that and my relationship is going well overall, but he just got a job over there and is planning on living there for the summer. He wants me to move there with him but I'm still pretty unsure. I'm nervous because I'm worried about his mom misgendering me and in general just living in her house under her rules. I want to maintain a sense of independence. On top of all that, my family and I all caught coronavirus so neither of us can visit each  other until I'm recovered. Even if we could, visitation is difficult since neither of us has a car (he doesn't have a license and my car was totaled in an accident).

Basically what I'm getting at is I'm really lonely with him gone and, although I know that reasonably I can't blame myself for this, I feel guilty for suggesting he leave because it feels like I pushed him away. Logically, I know that we needed the break but especially with my current inability to see him I feel like I did something wrong. I'm trying really hard to be supportive of him in his decision to stay at his mom's for the summer. He's making a lot of progress; he got a job,  he's working on finally getting a driver's license and a car, and he just got his first dose of the covid vaccine. But there's still a part of me, one that I feel selfish for, that doesn't want him to stay there.

I feel really alone right now and I'm wondering how to deal with all of this. How do people make long distance relationships work? How do people who work internationally or who are on active duty (or their partners) deal with being separated from their love for so long? It's been less than a month and I'm feeling increasingly torn up about his absence. It's been really cold these past few nights and not having my beep next to me to warm me up has been more and more noticeable the longer he's away. How do I deal with this?

Hello, 

I‚Äôve had a really hard ~24 hours. The only time I haven‚Äôt been crying is when I fell asleep out of exhaustion. My head is pounding nonstop. My eyes are swollen to 2x their size. I cry so hard and I feel it so deep down into my chest and it physically hurts. This year will be the 10th year since I started showing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôve been on psychiatry meds since 2017... I was only supposed to be on them short term. I got put on another one a few months ago for depression. The last time I felt okay was fall 2019 going into early 2020. It took a sharp dive with 2020 and I became severely burnt out. The only way I survived was therapy. 

Of course, the past year has been traumatic for everyone. I work in healthcare. I graduated college during the last year, literally one of the worst times, and struggled for a while to find a full time job. I kept being rejected and rejected. I already knew my generation was set to be poorer than our parents and this just blows. I broke up with someone I had been seeing for 1.5 years. I live and work in Minneapolis and watched my city burn and mourn. Every time I‚Äôm down there I‚Äôm watching over my shoulder. I‚Äôm Asian and know I could be assaulted at any time for ‚Äúbringing COVID‚Äù. And just last night, I had a very triggering and emotional event where I realized another facet of my trauma that I hadn‚Äôt faced before. For the past month, I had truly thought my mental health was slowly getting better and things felt a tiny bit hopeful. 

I feel broken, a failure, and incapable of making connections. I feel so much grief and pain for the lives lost, for the social injustice, for the amount of trauma, and for myself and what I could be. I try to follow positive social media accounts, such as self-love, animals, and good news. Even though I see post after post about self-care, recharging, how it‚Äôs ok to not have things figured out, being kind to your mind, being patient with yourself, ETC. I feel like my mind is just completely numb to them. I only have maybe 2 friends that I still sometimes talk to and they both have lives of their own. I feel so unloved. I come from a super dysfunctional and abusive family. I feel like I will never ever be normal and healthy and capable.

620,Tumbleweed_Intrepid,1619409340,1,"To start this off I'm 20 y/o and never had a relationship. Before I start I want to clarify that I'm not fat, I do take showers, and I've had female friends throughout my years so I don't think I am coming off as a creep. If I don't state this most the comments will be about one of those things. I know I'm still young and have time. There is a good chance I will find someone but there is an albeit smaller chance that I will die young and alone. Sometimes I get into anxious thought loops about that and I can't help it. Anyway the point is that the people who say ""relationships aren't a big deal"" and ""don't let it effect you"" are always the ones who have had that kind of connection before. Everyone from my friends, to my parents, to even my therapist says this kind of crap and I'm sick of it. To them experiencing a relationship is something that is natural to them. It's like eating or sleeping so of course they don't see it as a big deal. As if it's really as easy as to just stop thinking about it. The only people that can understand the true loneliness of that are the people who are/were in this situation. Maybe I just feel double lonely cause I don't have any siblings and other than my parents no family has ever lived in my city my whole life. So in addition to never having experienced a relationship I've never had any family around my age grow up with me.

Anyway out of literally all the people I know my age only two of them has never had a girlfriend and both of them have had sex while I haven't. So as far as I know I'm the last virgin I know and people just want me to ""not let it effect me."" How tf am I supposed to do that? I feel more left out than anything else like everyone else on this planet is being let in on some huge secret. The best way to describe the feeling you had back in elementary school when you forget your homework and had to stay in during recess doing it while watching all the other kids play on the playground having fun. But instead of only feeling like that every once in a while you feel like that every single god damn day.",lonely,"The people who say things like ""relationships aren't a big deal"" are the ones who can get them with no problem",2021-04-26 13:55:40

623,mrslezzy,1619408636,1,So ever since i was about 15 is when it first started. Its only now tho that i realize what i was expiriencing was in fact lonliness. I remember when i was in about 10th grade id stop texting ppl and getting no replies i felt extremely unwanted in about every social situation i encountered. Its not like i didnt participate either. I played sports was varsity went to parties had tons of aquintances but no actual real friends. I was extremely distrusting of everyone and it felt like everytime i needed a shoulder to lean on or have someone listen to me no one would. I never felt over bearring or annoying because i purposefully avoid trying to do so. I watch what i say carefully so ppl can avoid my problems if confronted unless in a absolute belligerent way ill usually smile and go away do my own thing so i dont get why i still feel lonely. Why i still feel scared to open up. I assume the absolute worse about everyone too even when i try not to. I see someone make a face or say or text a word and assume immediately they dont wanna be friends. I try not to be at any moment i will drop someone and completely cut them off in fear of being a burden. I think it stems from past friendships of being open and ppl kinda just shrugging my openess off or ppl being very dismissive to me and third wheeling me in friendships kinda not feeling in the loop. Also never having a mother and past childhood expiriences could maybe play a role but it seems futile and almost impossible to pinpoint exactly why so it feels like a problem ill never actually solve. Even when i get friends this behavior persist in fact i did it today. I took someone texting me what as attitude and anger for no actual good reason.,lonely,Lonely for a long long time.,2021-04-26 13:43:56

Are you telling me they don't notice I haven't been smiling a lot these past few days? Or my voice sounding weak because I barely want to speak? Or that my eyes look obviously fatigued from trying to hold the tears? Being a quiet person sucks because you express emotions through body language but nobody bats an eye.

You know how they always say ""I never saw the signs"" when someone suddenly turns out to be suffering all this while? I feel like most of the time, people do show signs but they're just not attentive enough.

I try to never be alone at home because idk what I'd do to myself when I am alone. I went out with them yesterday (not saying a word to them) and met this mutual friend of theirs who usually gives them food. She asked me, ""where do you live?"" and I answered, ""I live with them"". She then surprisingly says that she thought they lived in a 2 bed house all this time. It would've been usual talk for me on a normal day but this hit me hard.

638,blessthissmess,1619402723,1,"Throughout my life (I‚Äôm in my mid-20s) I have always felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in. I had to change my group of friends many times, and I accept that I have things to work on cause it‚Äôs never just everyone else‚Äôs fault, but at the same time I always felt as if values like respect or hard work, caring about others or enjoying time with your family were looked down on and had very little value for the people I hanged out with. In every group I had, the most popular guy was always the one trying to put down others and deciding who gets in and who doesn‚Äôt. Naturally, because I felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in and wasn‚Äôt following these guys, they made sure I got excluded most of the time.

So the thing is, I‚Äôm moving to a different country soon (from a South American country to Canada) and I‚Äôm doing everything in my power to be a better guy, be a more easy going person that people would want to hang out with. But at the same time, I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm doing all of this hard work just to end up with the same kind of shitty people and social dynamics, so I need some motivation in knowing that it can be different.

To be clearer on what I see in my social circles is that caring about others makes you either creepy or lame, relationships/friendships are extremely shallow, the only topics that I hear people talk about are parties, trips, sports and it‚Äôs always a competition about who does those better, who gets laid the most, who gets more wrecked during the weekend, whose group of friends is bigger and how many vip things they can get. And if you are not up to party three or four times a week, if you focus on school or your career, you won‚Äôt get invited to anything. Everything seems like a power struggle.

In the last couple of years, I‚Äôve watched my best friend turn into this huge asshole that only talks about himself, can‚Äôt get happy when something good happens to others, and always tries to make it seem like he is the star of every group. And it seems the shittier he gets, the more popular he becomes and people just chase him.

I know I sound judgmental and I know I have a lot to work on, but try not to see it as a judgment but more about things that don‚Äôt align with my values. I‚Äôm fine if they wanna be like this, it‚Äôs just not for me. I guess I‚Äôm more traditional and enjoy caring about my friends, helping them out and getting happy for their successes, it would just be nice to find people with that same attitude.

So my question is if you guys feel like it‚Äôs similar everywhere and the world has just turned to that, or if maybe I‚Äôm just in the wrong place for me.

It started young.

You know in school how all the kids used to stand around in circles in their own individual groups? Well, I never had a circle. And no one ever let me in theirs either. No matter what I tried, how many times I tried, I was always the only kid outside of any circle. I'd try to slide in but they'd close it off or move whenever I tried to mingle with them. 

I never had anyone who'd want to play tennis with me, so I played tennis with the wall. No one wanted to play cards with me. No one wanted to ride their bicycle with me. We used to have board game Friday's and I will tell you - it's hard to play chess by yourself. I was never invited to any birthday parties. No one ever showed up to mine, even though I invited a lot of my classmates. 

Whenever teachers forced kids to make groups, I'd always be the last pick. 

No one would let me sit next to them on the school bus, I'd have to always go all the way to the back and sit on the ground. There was only one driver that ever cared but he left. He'd tell the other kids that he wasn't going to move an inch until someone let me sit by them. It was good for those 4 months but then that was all.

I was the only kid in school that didn't go to prom because I didn't have anyone to go with.

All kinds of people called me stupid, dumb, slow, a freak, etc. all the way until graduation. During graduation, no one wanted to take a picture with me. The only picture I have is one with me and my mother. My father never showed up for my graduation.

I thought this was the worst it would be but how wrong I was. That best friend got herself a boyfriend so she‚Äôs always with him, which I don‚Äôt blame her for. In fact I‚Äôm thrilled for her. It just hurts. She told me, so many of them told me the same thing. That they would always be there for me. And they might‚Äôve even meant it but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Because now they‚Äôve moved on. My very last close friend ,the last person I even talk to AT ALL is moving on. I used to be able to expect a text back within a reasonable time. Certainly no longer than a full day.

And when the teacher notices and asks why I'm not in a group, there are always plenty of people who want me to be apart of their group.   


I'm beginning to feel sick and tired of people feeling bad about me, and only invite me to parties &amp; workgroups because they feel sad on my behalf that I'm lonely.   


Most people would say I'm decently attractive, I'm pretty smart, I'm very trustworthy, I always keep my promises &amp; I'm very nice. So why can't I get close with anyone?   


Now that I've become 18 I'm starting to believe that it will become a big problem for me finding a girlfriend to give my unconditional love to, as I've never been in a relationship. It's not that I have any high standards, I just want someone average who hold me dearly, who I can cuddle and be with. The worst scenario for me would be to have someone who would date me because of my loneliness like how people invite me to groups.   


I just want people to like me for my many positives and not out of pity :(

697,pgnikhil,1619374756,1,"Rather a story:

It was almost midnight when I looked up into the sky to see the snow falling on my face. The bells around St. Petersburg were ringing, and a feeling of warmth and happiness gushed all around.

Besides, who would not like the beautiful snow and cool wind while walking down Nevsky Prospekt?

Looking at the phone, my Yandex taxi pulled over and got my bags into the trunk. This was the beginning of yet another adventure.

I was on my way to Pulkovo Airport to grab a flight to Kaliningrad, then a bus through the Russian border from Kaliningrad to Gdansk the old town with the tallest church, then a flight from Gdansk to Paris.

Some may ask, why such a long route for a simple flight from St. Petersburg to Paris?

Because it is the best way to enjoy the travel, experiencing new and old places, a different feeling, while moving in between two places. The flight at midnight from Pulkovo is yet a feeling you could never miss. Moving through the clouds to see the orange city's glow at night is stunning.

I got some Alyonka Chocolate from the Pyaterochka in Kaliningrad, then some Ptasie Mleczko from the Biedronka in Gdansk, for I was in love with chocolate.

Then slowly make my way to the airport in Gdansk, to fly to Beauvais, Paris. Slowly enjoying the morning sunrise on the flight, the purple skies slowly turning bright white.

And this may sound dismissive or ungrateful but if having internet friends was enough then I wouldn't be in this situation. 

The truth of the matter is that you're *not* here for me. You're way over *there*. The only one here for me is me and not even that is true all of the time. I need interaction with real flesh and blood beings that I can reach out with **these hands** and touch. Meeting the corporeal barrier of others with my own physical being and feeling the resistance of something that reminds me that I'm real is my desire. That organically warm embrace of another soul; this screen is cold, my keyboard is inanimate. Taking off my headphones I am always met with this absolutely deafening quiet. Seems I forgot I was alone for a minute. How thoughtless of me.

Seeing letters generate on the digital plane can only do so much. Nothing is real when all you know are signs and symbols. Do I even have the experience in my life to solidify these words? These abstractions of what is real? I mean, what does love even mean anymore? I only know it by imagination, fantasy, and definitions. What's a relationship? I think I saw one on TV before. Happiness? That's when you lose the energy to cry, right? I swear the mind is a hellish place that allows you to feel relief so it can send you tumbling down again. After all, you may forget your misery if it's all you experience and have nothing to compare it to.

I wish you guys were closer. I wish I knew how to find the others. There's gotta be good number of us out there that isn't on reddit, ya know. I could pass you on the street and not even know that we suffer the same. If I only knew I'd reach out to you and pull you close so that maybe we can find a way out of the fog together.

I want to make more but people don't seem interested in becoming friends with me. I talked to a lot of people because of the pandemic but it hasn't worked out. I just have shallow conversations with them giving short replies and not caring about who I am.

I go to therapy. I'm learning to be with myself and heal the wounds of the break up. It's very hard for many reasons and I feel so lonely. I like spending time alone, but having no one to talk to or spend time with has been hurting my mental health. Doesn't help I've been hunting for a job for almost six months to no avail. 

I just want friends to rely on that can rely on me too. I'm a caring person but I haven't found people that want anything to do with me. I think maybe I'm a boring person. I feel it's no wonder my girlfriend left me and I no one want to talk to me. Everyone has their lives, but I have no part in any of them, even a small one...

What can I do? I don't want this. I'm sick of thinking about my ex every day. She doesn't love me and it's not fair for me to try to contact them.

They made me feel good about myself.

I'm not gonna lie. I did some social media creeping. I found out she has a bf/fiance/whatever. They seem to have a very loving relationship. I was feeling pretty bad about it - I chugged down an entire bottle of wine.

i have a bad habit of distancing myself when i‚Äôm in isolation and quarantine was a perfect setting for me to hide away from those who‚Äôd been there for me before. the only reason i didn‚Äôt spend 10 months completely alone was because i would find one boy to hang around with for a certain amount of months. when that ended, i‚Äôd find someone else. i‚Äôm really happy i met them, honestly, but i can‚Äôt help but feel so selfish about it. as sad as it sounds, it‚Äôs much easier to find companionship in guys because i‚Äôm very horrible at making new female friends since i‚Äôm scared to approach people/be outgoing. i do have a best friend that i love to death, but we haven‚Äôt lived in the same place for years. i still wouldn‚Äôt give her up for anything, though. 

anyways, i actually had a group of friends in college with whom i felt comfortable with. until we got kicked out. two of them transferred and one hasn‚Äôt come back since march 2020. moved back into an apartment with the remaining two after a 10 month isolation period and it‚Äôs been horrible. they‚Äôve been having issues with each other and living in that has been hell. i get too scared to leave my room to get something to eat unless the common area is empty. the apartment is ridiculously small, i can‚Äôt escape them. one of them moved out indefinitely, but i‚Äôm still so socially anxious about leaving the room - it‚Äôs not getting better at all. today it dawned on me that i‚Äôve lost most of my friends. 

i know a lot of it is my fault, which makes this feeling a lot worse. i came back home for two weeks to see my parents but i‚Äôm still pretty depressed. my closest friend in college ended up becoming my boyfriend but our on-and-off relationship has always been really dysfunctional and has made my mental state worse. two of the guys i hung out with before have been starting to talk to me but i feel that they‚Äôd want nothing to do with me once they found out i‚Äôm dating someone. which is totally reasonable. 

i have no idea how to make new friends. my classes are all online. i rarely go on campus anymore. i rarely leave the room anymore. i‚Äôm used to being lonely but this is a new extreme, it‚Äôs been a year of seeing close to nobody.

I guess we all just want a little bit of love a little bit of real love and care. But we can't get it. We blame ourselves for it and maybe we are to blame and maybe not. I am no expert but I certainly feel that no amount of people or no amount of things or whatever fucking external shit can cover this feeling of loneliness but yourself.

Sometimes you just have to accept that it is upto you and jo matter how helpless how much of a storm is raging within you. You are the one that can calm it. And there are so many things when you search the net, things to do and inculcate into your life to get better. And we try we fuckin try it all. And when it doesn't work we give up. 

For what I have learned about loneliness is that it blocks your sight of seeing a future where things are better. 

So maybe I can get out of this, if I just keep doing it and having faith that there exists a world where the world isn't so angry with me. Where I can feel that my existence matters and I wish this upon you. You Matter alone or with a billion people. You matter and just trust there exists a world where it's good. 

I don't know if it will fix things but it sure as hell beats being broken everytime. From now on I am going to push back, I'm going to fight.

Most of my friends are also friend to one another, during lockdown I saw them having videocall every single day, but when I asked to they always find an excuse not to include me (BUT they would still have the damn call).

When it was possible to hang out they would do it every other day, but when I asked to hang out they wouldn't answer me or they, again, would find an excuse not to go out.

Sometimes I tried to talk to them and ask why they have been pushing me away, they said I was the one pushing them away.

Since covid I am alone, I have no one to talk, I'm trying my best not to fully relapse in a goddamn eating disorder, I planned to kms in March 2020 but I am so fucking weak that I couldn't do it.

758,dadouks,1619331503,1,"Hi, i'm 25, and since covid, my life has been in complete shambles for a while now.

In 2018, after two years post high school of not finding any diploma to apply to and failing a classes because of personal issues and depression, I finally found a job I loved, made a lot of friends and it was great even though it didn't pay much at all. Then covid hits and since the job was in concert venues (I live in France), I haven't been able to work outside of a couple days in October since basically March 2020.

Summer 2020 was great, went on vacation basically for the first time in my life at 25, had 20 people throw a surprise birthday to me which is the best thing someone ever done for me, and I had two groups of friends, lets say one is my local group of friends from my town and the other are my coworkers.

In October, shit went down. My local friends were treating me badly, pretty emotionally abusive, I just tried to be their friends but they say I was too forceful when I just asked if I could help them or hang out even though they asked me as much if not more themselves, and it wasn't just reciprocated, so basically I lost pretty much that entire local group, then there was a second lockdown, and ever since then the venues are closed and we are limited by a 10km radius, so my coworkers friends either left Paris to work elsewhere, or were outside of my reach.

My situation at home ain't great neither. My sister is 30 and refuse to talk to me and dips out whenever we're in the same room for more than a minute, my parents divorced in 98 but still are in the same appartment because they just never tried to find a way to have enough money to get out or just fix those issues. Their motto is ""there are worse things in life"", even about situations like these that are very serious. They'd rather have 20 years of silent suffering than 15min or argument and end up with a solution, which is nonsense to me.

The issue is that this situation is all i know and I grew up with that mindset passively. After highschool I closed my eyes and 2 years went by without doing anything. I could stay at home for 20 more years and they'd say they still love me, but this is not really the type of love I want. I just have more ambition than they do, they gave up on life more than 20 years ago, they have no friends, no sex life, no occupations, and they just either avoid each other or argue and don't talk for months. I lost hope trying to fix it because I was the only one trying to change things, and just ended up mentally exhausted by seeing people just passively die rather than living their lives.

So let me resume all that : Lost my local friends, stuck in a small radius with barely any friends, with a broken family

Even some of the coworker friends I wanted to see started to act weird, some of them told me that I was a great person and didn't deserve to be treated like that by my local friends, but they ended up acting the same way, literally telling me they were busy just for me to see a story of all of them together the same day.

I been trying to defend myself more and it's crazy to see how people change when you call them out with how they treat you. I'm glad I stood up for myself because I kinda sense a ""Who told you that you had a right to complain?"" afterthoughts when I argued with them. I couldn't be something other than happy with my local friends, whenever I was sad or had a good reason to be mad about something they would just ghost me, but when we saw each other it was great, that's insanely weird to me.

Kind of the same with the girls I got rejected by or that are shocked that i'm not just a friend who's a sea urchin without genitals and that actually have needs and am attracted to people. That also doesn't really help my self-esteem to just be told ""you're great but not my type"" and being thrown like a hot potato on to the next girl forever.

I just want to be someone's priority for once, even intimately, the girls I was intimate with always told me that I wasn't really the main person in their lives, and my ex which is my only long term relationship told me that she never really loved me and that it was moreso an emotional ""patch"" in her life, and trust me she told me that years after our relationship and not trying to throw a jab, she genuinely said that and it kinda broke me ever since.

I guess I attract these kinds of behaviour because people always get to know me, think i'm great, and then throw me away, like i'm pretty sure that 90% of people who don't talk to me anymore will say that they don't think i'm a bad person at all, or even compliment me, but it just that they...can't. There is something about me that engaging, fulfilling for a while and I just get thrown away because I don't really fit their criterias or I want very basic things that they won't ever give me like just genuine friendship.

Social media clearly doesn't help me, i'll just be alone on a saturday night and see people partying even though I could completely be there because all those people like me when they see me, but i'm never invited and i'm tired of having to (mentally) fight to ask if I can join their party, I just don't feel welcome and moreso like a burden everytime.

My loneliness also brung two new friends thanks to constant overthinking because I don't have much better to do, hypocondria and thanatophobia. My health been going pretty bad from too much computer use and bad posture/lifestyle so my eyes / elbows/jaw is kinda screwed at the moment and I got misdiagnosed for a brain malformation which is always great. I recently developed an insane fear of not existing / dying and so i really want to just explore the world and LIVE but I can't because of covid. The thought of exploring the world alone and think to myself ""you went alone because no one loves you enough to share that moment with you"" hurts too much for me to consider going alone.

I just want to live things a bit with people again, I don't mind being a grumpy old guy on an island alone growing potatoes but I just want to live with people, feeling wanted, needed, appreciated, heard, needed etc, I never had this and I just need it so much.

If you have any tips, question, book recommandations, anything you wanna talk about on here etc..i'm down, thanks for reading this lengthy post.",lonely,"My loneliness is taking a toll on me, at this point i'd rather be surrounded with fakes than being true to myself but alone every weekend.",2021-04-25 16:18:23
759,AnonPinkLady,1619330260,1,"It's so frustrating. I definitely think about my loneliness on a daily business, and that empty feeling inside but talking to others feels exhausting. No matter how slow I take it, dates never allow me to feel anything for others and over and over again, I put in a little effort and then feel frustrated and numb and give up. I cant explain what I'm feeling or why which sucks because I usually know myself so well. 

It just feels like this invisible hand that weighs a thousand pounds, pushing me into the floor, making every text feel like a moving a mountain, every hello like raising an elephant, to the point that body just feels like it will collapse under this force. I'm not sure why it feels this way. I think about giving dating another go and that heavy arm like a hateful isolating force pushes me down to the ground again and forces me to give up. 

It's impossible to motivate myself to get to know anyone new. Conversations feel so hollow and pointless and I find myself pretending I like people just give myself hope only to face that fact that I just feel nothing. I desperately want... to want someone but something has an iron grip on me and I feel like I beg for it every day to loosen but it wont. I smile and act kind to new faces but my stomach is angry confused and fearful knots inside. Thinking about it makes me want to cry.

Being alone hurts so fucking much and all I care about is special memories and connections in my life, more than money and success, fame or popularity, more than anything in the world. I've been a hopeless romantic my entire life and it feels like having your favorite suddenly make you vomit even by just the smell of it. My entire body and guts fights it but on the inside I desperately want. Sometimes I just want to curl up on the floor and cry and beg like somebody please help me fight myself. 

It's like I've developed a full blown guy wrenching phobia to the one thing I want. I'm tearing up just writing about it because I honestly dont want to admit it to myself most days. I really hate me. I hate that I cant let myself be happy ever again because the last time hurt me in the end so much. 

I hate that I cant be content without someone and I hate that opening up to someone feels physically impossible. The funny bitter truth of it all is my ex used to describe these feelings about me. Saying that he liked me but had fears of getting his heart broken so potent they were petrifying. I thought I'd help him open up and instead its as if I've caught his miserable paranoia and now live with it myself. This thing stopped me from connecting with others doesnt even feel emotional. It feels overpowering physical like the moment I try I feel dizzy, exhausted, shaky and a need to lay down. 

Sometimes I day dream about someone meeting me and somehow persevering despite all the odds, love me anyway, win me over and put themselves out there so I dont have to face my own terrifying fears. To just see through my constant timidity and understand me so I dont have to pour my soul out to feel even a little bit heard. I'm so tired.

He'll come up and talk to me if I ask him to, but it has to be all superficial light-hearted talk and he sets a timer because he's too busy to talk long.  I can't bring up issues in the relationship, like that I'm lonely or I want more romance, he'll just get angry and blame everything on me.  He's a lone wolf and cold, I don't think he values companionship or relationships, it's more of an inconvenience to him.  It has been hard during the pandemic because I need interpersonal connection and I can't rely on him for that.

He said that he's concerned that I'm becoming desperate for his affection, and it unintentionally is pushing him away. This hurt to hear, but I'm glad he told me. 

We're still together, and I'm happy about that. But I'm so scared that my chronic loneliness is going to push him away. I don't know why I feel so empty and lonely all of the time. I always try to give him space, but it always leaves me feeling so lonely.

I have the opportunity to go out every night, and I have the opportunity to talk to and possibly build relationships with girls, but I just get so caught up in my head and scared at first, scared of rejection or just scared of people depending on me... But I feel so bad when I read these posts and even more guilty for not going out and living my life. I guess I just see it as, superficial, and based around drugs and alcohol, and nothing mattering. I think it‚Äôs because for most of these guys and girls on the ‚Äúpopular rung‚Äù they‚Äôve never really had a problem with socializing, so they see it as... ‚Äújust go out??‚Äù But I see it as, Im dealing with a lot of other stuff, and a fraternity is a huge obligation. I guess it shouldn‚Äôt have been like this, and I‚Äôm kind of an outlier, my best friend from high school died in a car crash last year, and I‚Äôm still waking up a year later questioning why it happened....how do you expect me to do that, worry about succeeding in my highly competitive study, and then expect me to come set up and put on a happy mask for your beach bash party?

But have we ever wondered, if we are really lonely out of sheer luck or due to our choice as well?

Have we really asked ourselves if we are lonely by choice?

Have it never happened to us that we longed for people to come to our life. But they either didn't respond or ghosted us after a while.

At the same time, we too had been approached by some other lonely soul. But because our eyes were set on the star up up above we ignored the candle burning for us behind us, and we continued lamenting why our world is too dark.

Irony is we cry for people who don't reciprocate our feelings, but ignore the people who were there for us, ready to give themselves to us.

But no, we don't value things that are easily obtainable.

793,reddituser736184,1619316458,1,"Here‚Äôs a little background info: I started my freshman year of high school at a new school back in September of 2019. Previously I had been at a private catholic all boys school which sucked. I‚Äôm also the oldest of 5 other siblings and have some very overprotective parents, but I try to not tell anyone but i feel like they all know. Anyways, I hadn‚Äôt had a phone up to maybe early March of last year. My parents do not understand what kids do nowadays. I was so  sick and tired of them using the excuse that they didn‚Äôt have this or that when they were my age. No matter what I said they used some bs excuse and just threatened to punish me or whatever for ‚Äútalking back‚Äù. I got a phone in March of 2020 and thought that I was finally a normal kid. Boy was I wrong.

Since most of my friends had had their phones since middle school and maybe even elementary, I had some catching up to do. I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and just thought of it as not a big deal. So during the summer I kept trying over and over and over again to hang out with them but they were never ‚Äúfree‚Äù. I being stupid enough to fall for it believed them for the entire summer. I can‚Äôt remember when I realized that they were just making excuses but I remember telling myself that it‚Äôs not a big deal. At one point during the summer I got angry at one of them (lets call him Jake) because I was so tired that he and everyone else were not telling me when they were going to meet up with people. He got mad and made it seem like it was all my fault and I was dumb enough to fall for that and later apologized. So I kinda just had a lonely summer thinking that everyone else wasn‚Äôt doing anything either.

 Well, my sophomore year starts and Jake throws this huge party without me. I‚Äôm talking like 20-30 people. And out of everyone there, I wasn‚Äôt. I thought we were best friends but I guess him along with everyone else just forgot about me. I completely let all hell loose upon him and another kid (who I don‚Äôt really talk to as much and didn‚Äôt deserve for me to be yelling at him). I ghosted everyone at that stupid party because it was actually happening once or twice every month just with smaller portions of people. Some people got worried I guess and contacted me. I thought they cared but they just slowly drifted off. 

A few months later I get a message from a friend that I went to school with but had never met before because of covid and she texts me saying that she‚Äôs doing tennis with a few other people for the school and would love it if I could join. I didn‚Äôt really know who was gonna be on the team so I just was like ‚Äúsure, why not.‚Äù Turns out Jake and another one of his friends are on the team. This time I‚Äôm going to make sure that I‚Äôm not gonna act like nothing ever happened. Of course he‚Äôs acting like nothing ever happened because he‚Äôs so popular and could care less about me so I talked to him and things seemed to settle down a bit. During this one month period of playing on the tennis team I was doing just fine and had hoped that everything had gone. Welp.

The fall tennis season ends (in early April this year due to covid)and I started going back to school. During lunch I sit with a kid who‚Äôs a junior and is on the spring tennis team with me. Well apparently he‚Äôs best friends with people who are best friends with the people I thought I was back on good terms with. He‚Äôs telling me stories about how they sneak out and smoke weed and get drunk all the time. Most of the time he‚Äôs not with them he just hears stories from his friends but sometimes he is. I play it cool and try to tell him that I‚Äôve never done any of that before because of my overprotective parents tho I‚Äôd really like to. Inside however I‚Äôm absolutely furious. Why aren‚Äôt they inviting me?! They‚Äôre having fun without me. They‚Äôre doing things that normal teens do, without me. It still hasn‚Äôt stopped since last summer. I found out about this a few days ago and my 16th birthday is in less than a week. I‚Äôm probably gonna just lay in my bed and cry. 

All I wanna do is go out and do stupid shit with them which sounds incredible dumb but I want to live the experience. I want to have a good time. I need some advice on what I can do to get them to invite me to hang out with them. And no, I can‚Äôt invite them over because my 5 other younger siblings here are being overprotected by my parents and they think that a ‚Äúgood time‚Äù is to just play ping pong or some shit and talk.

I had a gf, but I never felt like I got treated right.  There was a huge issue less than a year ago that was infidelity with a dude, but she felt it wasn't because we broke up 12 hours earlier.  We broke up because of lies and infidelity, but she maintained that being sexual with a girl didn't count.  It was the dude's gf.  The whole thing was planned while we were a couple.  

I took her back (super embarrassingly) and we broke up again recently and she kept saying she loved me, but we had to start over and just date.  A few weeks later, she posts a picture of herself showing she is with that dude and his gf again.  

I was mad before when it happened, but now I'm numb.  I'm just lonely.  It's me, my dog and my TV.  

I spent my night investigating exit bags, but I have no plans or desires for that.  It just seemed interesting.  It's a pandemic.  I don't have a lot of social outlets.  

I'm just amazingly lonely.   The good part of seeing she ran off with the dude and GF (D-lister and bi gf) again is that pain reminds me I'm alive.  If I have emotions, even bad ones, then I'm still human and still alive.  My best artwork comes while in extreme emotional distress, but alas, I only want to drink beer and talk to the anonymous world of reddit.

I have two actual friends who I don't see very often bc of school (one of them remained in online school, the other goes to private school). Aside from that I have a couple ""friends"" who only usually talk to me when they have nobody else to talk to. Bc of this I end up sitting alone during lunch at least one day out of the two in person days that my school gives us. 

I won't lie... its painful to be by yourself, but also surrounded by the entire lunchroom having a great time, laughing, and talking. I feel like Tantalus, the mythical greek guy who was surrounded by heaps of food that he couldn't eat in the afterlife, but instead of food for me its human connection.

I am convinced that something is wrong with me. I feel like I am separated from the vast majority of my normal peers. It could be that I'm just invisible, but I'm concerned that its something else. I know I look weird (appearance wise), which is probably part of the reason, but I'm more concerned that I either act or sound strange.

I mean, two weeks ago one of my actual friends described me as ""unhinged"" (he wasn't being mean btw). That's the closest I have ever gotten to a real answer on this. Everyone else I have asked either denies that anything is wrong with me or downplays it. It almost felt like they saw me as an inferior... as if they were talking to someone with a mental disability. 

I think I'm just not normal or perhaps something even worse. The one thing that is clear is that I do not belong. I may end up being alone forever.

Its a shame. I had hoped one day I would have a fulfilling life, maybe meet someone... who knows? But as I said in my last post which nobody read... human suffering is inevitable. I can't do anything about it.

Quite the desperateness if you ask me.

I genuinely thought relationships would help, but honestly it seems like if I can't even keep a single friend around for a while, how can I maintain a long term relationship? I made the horrible mistake of thinking that being in a relationship would solve my loneliness, but it actually turns out you just can't have one person to talk or hangout in general, so I gave up on this idea altogether, and I decided that the last thing I need right now is to be attached to someone who might not see me in a special spotlight.

For now I decided that it's best to disconnect from everyone that shows little to no interest in talking/hanging-out with me. Yes, it might end up in me being lonelier than ever, but let's not fool ourselves, having nothing is better than having someone just for the sake of having....someone?

Tldr,I know but please I need someone to hear my story as no one ever will. I need help and I can't live like that



I'm a really demaged persona. Here's a short summary of my life up until the point I live in now which is unbearable. 

I am the only child alive after several previous miscarriage.

I was tied to a chair in the back of a resturant while I was with my family and playing in the surroundings with them losing an eye on me. I was psychologically tormented and practically held against my will at the age of 4/5

I was always going out with kids way beyond my age even then so it was a real reality check when at the age of 5 my ""best friend"" told me everyone was just pretending and that nobody likes me and they all just use me as a laughing stock.

My parents divorced when I was six.
I went from a relatively above average lifestyle to poverty, living with my mom. She was working overtime so I had to take care of myself and spend up to 10h alone going into midnight in the old house of my grandparents with nothing but video games and tv for me to find comfort in.

At a school camp in first grade, I got severely Ill and could here my bunkmates wishing me death while I was a sleep.

I was bullied up until grade 5 for my good grades and manner's even tho nobody ever cared about my school work or tried to help me with it.

I found myself in a different friend group by that time, still being really withdrawn from people and not really being like anyone else.
I developed my first crush in grade 5, it was a girl that was in that friend group, innocent and trying to fit in but I saw she was different. She had been ""outcasted"" for that and I stuck with her and later convinced the other's to let her back. Anyway sorry for making this so detailed. 
One day, she was raped and sexually harresed by those same individuals at that age, in front of me. I was frozen, I didn't know and realize what was happening and I left her there. We were all very much kids, even tho some were something way more sinister...

I resorted to being alone and playing video games.
I was hitting puberty at that time and was really confused without again a stable support or parent figure. 
I found myself in a group of people online that I yet again called ""friends"" they were bullying me day n night calling it jokes, they were incredibly bad and toxic influence which had an impact on my behavior as I just broke and started being more like them.
I would be violent, angry, agreessive towards others.

My school grades were rappidly decreasing, I was scared and confused, I was feeling extremely stressed and anxious.
I developed ocd which was fueled by the stress, I didn't tell anyone and tried to hide it. It was controlling and destroying me even more. 

I menaged to pull through all this, to get away from those friends, to challenge my ocd and to fix my personality and behavior.
A big play in that was metal music which by the end of 5th grade, I rediscovered.  A lot of people say ""that"" or ""this"" saved me but metal music really saved me, it played such a big role in my life and the musician would never even know how impactful they were.
In 6th grade I was moved to another class, seemingly more elite one. I was doing better there and the bullying was almost none. Yet again I changed my friend group, didn't really fit there but I liked some of the people.
I still had parts of toxicity left with me. I started introducing two of my classmates into pc gaming, one of alienatedy friend group from me and we would frequently crash personalities with me feeling enraged by his wack if logic and just pure bad for the sake of bad. 

7th grade came. I was practically more matured, really misunderstood and ahead of my peers, I developed a complex of my age.

Just need to add I've always hated how I look. 

I found my first actual love and first to be girlfriend, she was so kind and understanding, she was so interesting and lovely. I never really felt so understood or comforted by anyone, no one ever liked me at all or treated me good. We had a 4 year age difference and I fabricated my age of being one year more out of fear in the early stages of our communication. I have suffered for that and I repent, don't hate me for it as I already hate myself enough.


This was the first actual happy point in my life for years tho.


My father one day announced to me that I will have a half brother, I told him that I won't love him and he screamed at me calling me an egoist.
I still don't love him, it's not the kids fault, he has the blood of true evil and sin running through him, his mother, a person who brutally broke a family up. I could never love the creation of hers. 



Moving on. 


My friend group had completely kicked me out.
A year passed and we reunited with them, both sides realizing the mistakes. 


Few months pass
My girlfriend had clingy tendancies and I was okay with that but sometimes I just couldn't manage, I was feeling stressed and I was having moments of anger and fear when we had a difference in something,just pure emotion, unexplained by anything to this day, along with the lie after few rough months I ended our relationship for her good and never told her the truth so I don't hurt her more.

I am a bad person
Now its around the middle of 9th grade.

I finally think I learned from my experiences and having yet gained more maturity. A girl named Katlyn (hiding her real name) found me and we started texting, we have met before but I didn't even realize and our parents were colleagues. anyway
We were friends with her for a rew months, I didn't really have feelings for her but she did as she had later told me (wayy later), I started developing feelings for her whennwe started texting more and at first we were really similar.
I promised I would be a different person this time and I was, I held to my word, We started out relationship and it was lovely, really lovely. It didn't hit hard as first love but it was something deeper something else. 
She then started doing volunteering in the summer break. That's when the cracks and her problems started showing, she was overly unhealthily ambitious, she was often disregarding me and people, she was cold and distant but I was warm and patient. She treated all people like engagments and was incredibly distant from idea of compassion due to her traumas and anxieties oreventing her from having healthy friendships and more, things were getting worse and she broke up with me because she was feeling stressed and wanted to let me be free as she knew she couldn't be a good partner. We spend two weeks as friends and at the end of the second week we starred talking and talking, I was getting to her with my words and she realized her mistake. We got back together, she was better, we were better things were nicer and more stable. I helped her with her own personality issues.

Everything was perfect, we were doing amazing we were getting so close and so together, we bonded, we felt and functioned like one.

Few months down the road I started seeing a lot of difference in character and so did she. We thought we were similare but we had different opinions and we realized we werekind of different.
We still loved each other a lot, we had a lot of trust and love built and went through a lot of struggles together.

Eventually tho those difference's were becoming a bit much to me, I would often have the same states of anger and fear yet again short damaging and unexplained.
I hate myself for that but some of the differences really hurt sometimes as you wouldn't be able to share something you love with them.

Despite that we were still a good and connected couple but those states of mine started causing problems, she also started slipping into a bit of old habits, I had trust issues from before and she broke up with me again.
I felt of doing it a day before but decided that this was too much to throw away and that it could work.
We were both literally nothing without each other.

This is as of time of writing this one month ago.

I said some stuff I didn't want to say to her after we broke up out of fear and confusion and anxiety. She did too. We caused problem's in our relations not as partners but as really close people. It hurts
My das got covid at that time and was at his death bed, he told me he would die as the dictors have said so and I didn't know how to handle all that, it felt like my world wasveing crushed into infinite pieces.

By god's grace my dad survived.
My relations with my now ex continue to get worse and better and worse yet again. She still cares for me and I do too but she is incredibly, incredibly distant from me because of the exchanged stuff after our breakup.
I have no one to turn to fir help or advice
My mother currently has severe ocd and panic attacks.

I don't know what to do. I still want her back and I want everything to be okay but I know it wouldn't

On top of that I forgot to say when I turn 18 I will inherit a 500k debt from my father.

I don‚Äôt have friends, I don‚Äôt have family, I don‚Äôt go to college, my life is fucked up. I live by myself trying to survive, most of the time I‚Äôm in my room, watching the same tv show over and over again. 

I don‚Äôt last much in my jobs because i feel like a hamster, running but with no purpose, making someone else rich while I try to save money to eat and pay my bills. I‚Äôm currently jobless, I have enough money to survive at least 2 more weeks, after that I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. I cant find purpose in my life, that‚Äôs one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôm gonna studied something or not. 

Everything is pointless, people thinking they are better than me because of some $12 hour job, flexing fake designer clothes, driving a car that they can‚Äôt afford. I remember one of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù telling me that my life is a shit because I don‚Äôt pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not. 

I came to the conclusion that my life has absolutely no meaning, I‚Äôm done. If you see the bright side, no one is gonna remember me, if somehow disappear no one would find out.

825,WeSufferingTogether,1619301717,1,"I‚Äôve had a crush on this girl at a local coffee shops for months. When I met her and looked into her eyes, everything in me changed. I felt this rush of crazy feelings and it really felt great. I left for a week motorcycle trip in the mountains and remember feeling so cold, alone, in the darkness. When I thought about her I felt a warmth cover my entire body and it kept me going. When I came back, she was the only one who asked how the trip was... it made me so happy because it was actually really hard and scary. I went and bought her flowers and had some random guy deliver them to her. I think she saw me pull up on my motorcycle and the employees all told her it must have been me. From that day on, she would hide when I pulled up and all the guys were treating me differently, trying to alpha male me.. it took me every cell in my body to not neck punch one of the guys. 
I felt horrible and so one day I met another girl who worked there and I explained it all to her. 
She thought it was so cute and told me to just explain it to her and so I felt this boost of confidence. I came back days later...finally caught her trying to go to the back and told her that I‚Äôm sorry and that I just want to get to know her. She laughed and everything was great. 
I then went on a 3 week road trip to the north east.. the entire time I thought about her. When I was sleeping in my car, cold in Maryland one night, just thinking about her, made the hard times okay. 
When I came back I knew it was time to ask her for her number finally. It‚Äôs been months... it‚Äôs now or never... so I came in and asked her and she wrote it down and that‚Äôs all. I was on top of the world, best mood ever.. lol such a stupid fool I was. 
I was texting her and didn‚Äôt even think about the ‚Äúrules‚Äù about texting and I guess I sent like 4 messages in a row haha I‚Äôm dumb. 
She didn‚Äôt respond all night... then all day the next day. Then hit me with the I just want to be friends.
I‚Äôve been crying on the floor like a stupid child. 
I‚Äôve never had a girl friend and am very lone wolf.. then the one time I open my heart up, I get it burned whole. The pain in my heart is indescribable.... it‚Äôs like a black hole opened up and my soul is being sucked in. Fuck love... fuck this new hook up culture bs... I‚Äôm numb. This is what breaks people.

828,frik4nd3lbr00dj3,1619299146,1,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It‚Äôs also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won‚Äôt even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON‚ÄôT be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‚Äò!‚Äô as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

No. Ffs that is not how the world works. Life isn't fair. Not everyone gets what they want in life. Bad things happen to good people. Innocence is punished. Weakness is also punished.

We live in a chaotic apparently meaningless world where our chances of finding happiness/success/peace in life are mostly determined by the environment we find ourselves in or immutable characteristics ranging from attractiveness to mental health and disabilities.

Human suffering is inevitable and whatever meaning we create in this world is artifical- easily destroyed when it comes into contact with contradiction or harsh realities.

There are so many different beliefs, religions, ideologies, philosophies, morals, government systems, individual lifestyles, values, and behaviors that mankind has created to combat this. While many are able to temporarily benefits individuals and certain groups, **all of them have failed in the long run.**

We humans seem to be made to wallow in our own misery. Our attempts at salvation have failed.

What is the point of life? Why does it seem so unreal... so pointlessly frustrating?

And doesn't it bother you? The combination of a miserable world with the inevitability of death. The realization that you will return to the state which you were in before you came into being. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. There is probably nothing waiting for us. No heaven, nor a hell, not even some deep dreamless sleep lies beyond the grave. No consciousness, existence, memory, or thoughts will remain of us.

One day, for better or worse, the world will burn and nothing will be left.

Our generation (or at least my generation) is most unlucky. We have been born into a tumultuous era in which social change, innovation, and new ideas have given us longer lifespans and the ability to fuck whoever we want, however much we want.

We may have the benefits of modern technology and thought, but we will never experience what past generations did. We will not have the opportunity to fight for something greater like the generation of the 40s did, the idyllic prosperity and exceptionalism of the 50s is gone, there are no movements like those of the 60s and 70s, and we just missed the emergence of a new era in the 80s, 90s, and were too young to properly experience for the early 2000s. Oh and don't even get me started on the even more distant past.

Sure those decades weren't what we make them out to be... the grass is greener on the other side and all that... but I feel that those who lived through them had some sense of meaning that we didn't.

(Admittedly this applies more to Americans, Europeans, and those living in western countries with similar problems.)

What my generation recieved is a world in which most civilizations are in decline. We got stupid politicians, even stupider dramas, the pathetic ironically intolerant whining of militant atheists, the ridiculous condemnations of braindead evangelicals, the aftermath of various culture wars, cancel culture, the possibility of actual wars, fears of authoritarianism, and dystopian mindsets. Where is the fucking meaning? What's the point?

Funnily enough, *I don't even really believe what I'm writing right now*. Isn't that ironic, probably untrue, and contradictory of me to say?

But I digress...

Hedonism, blind faith, and apathy seem to be our most effective way of escaping our misery. However: I deeply detest hedonism along with those who succumb to it, find blind faith appealing but hard to follow, and cannot allow myself to be apathetic. So there's nothing for me. I have yet to meet another person with a similar mindset.

I'm not sure what I will do with my life. I have a crazy probably unrealistic dream of maybe being a politician. I like the idea of standing in front of a cheering crowd, of having the power to influence and speak to society. I also have a contradictory ideal of living a peaceful ""wholesome"" life with whoever I end up being with. The former is probably a better choice if I want to do something worth being remembered for, but the latter is also something I deeply crave and might be more satisfying for me. Doing both seems impossible, although if there was a way I would take it.

Sometimes I also think I would have made a good medieval monk. I could have enjoyed a peaceful solitary existence surrounded by nature and beautiful architecture. I wouldn't have to worry about other people and if I ever got bored/lonely I could just read a book or do medieval monk shit. That would be nice I guess.

Of course, my expectations are largely unrealistic (and obviously I can't be a medieval monk).

I just wish that things were different. I want more from life than this... pointlessness.

That's all. If you read through all of this inane rambling without falling asleep, thank you. I am open to having discussions on this although maybe this is the wrong sub for that.

God... I am an insane, lonely, pathetic person lol.

844,TheF1rstHuman,1619286938,1,"At first when I joined subs like r/lonely, r/depression etc I thought it'd be great to be amongst people who share in my struggles and who I can relate to.
However, after a year or so of being exposed to a daily feed of all the negative stories and thoughts that people share on these subs, I've realised it's making things worse for me.

Always reading really negative things that relate to my own life just triggers spirals of negative thought that cause me to slide deeper into depression. Someone might say something on here that I hadn't necessarily considered before but then I realise it applies to me too and then I just get increasingly depressed and it only adds to the mountain of insecurities and worries that I already have. Reading all of the posts is basically reinforcing my negative thoughts and in some cases, triggering them.

I just got home from a really long, hard day at work. Sat down to check reddit and what I saw instantly put me into an even worse mood. I really don't want to be in this perpetual echo chamber of negativity anymore. 

Of course, I'm not criticising anyone in this sub or the sub itself. In theory it's a beautiful thing to allow lonely people or depressed people to talk, vent and share their feelings. As well as offer support and advice to each other. It's great, in theory. It really is. And I'm sure it is helpful for a lot of people but for me, it's definitely making everything worse.

Hopefully some of you can relate to what I'm saying.

I grew up dirt poor but have managed to do modestly well on my own in terms of finances. And though I'm a fairly reclusive ambivert who's very selective on who I choose to let in my life, I've never had problems getting dates or attracting people who want my companionship.

I've never had an easy life, but at the end of 2018 things really started going south for me. My fragile mother now lives with me. She's a bit of an idiot but she's always done her best to raise me right and has had a very tough life as well, so for me, taking care of her is not an option. We're not anti-vaxxer by any means but neither of us are ready to get the COVID vaccine yet so we're continuing to live in isolation and I don't know when that will change.

So now I'm living in isolation and going a bit stir crazy. My small circle of close friends only really keep in touch through Facebook and since they're all inundated with work and raising families now there isn't a lot of personal connection there anymore. I have a small network of local acquaintances but they're usually only interested in getting together in person and I don't really have a strong connection to any of them. Sooo... here I am.

If you're in your late 20's through mid 40's and are looking for someone to talk or chat with about practically anything, feel free to hit me up. I've been told I'm a good listener and don't mind just letting you vent. I'm an avid learner and objective observer, so I'm happy to give advice to those seeking it. I also have a lot of life experience and am happy to share stories and give perspective. I'm an open book and don't mind talking about anything. I also like music of all genres, horror flicks, all things supernatural and paranormal, TTRPGs, health, fitness, memes, and collecting trivial information. Need help getting a job, achieving a goal, fixing a vehicle, renovating a home, improving your relationship, getting sex advice/insight, feeling comfortable in your own skin, improving your wardrobe, or getting into a healthy routine? Just want to talk about something weighing on your mind? Chat me up!

FWIW, or if it makes a difference, I'm a 42M in Missouri USA. I'll chat with anyone from any walk of life no matter if you have an innie or an outie between your legs but I'm not looking to sext/cam/hookup.

I'm a 21 year old girl born and raised in Los Angeles. I'm currently in college studying Biology. I‚Äôm premed so my end goal is medical school. I enjoy meeting new people and learning about people's life experiences so as much as this is a college-student-who-needs-money thing, I'm also excited to talk to and meet new people! I'm currently single and probably staying so until I start my career. I'm a good listener and oddly, though I'm bad with names, I'm really good at remembering small details in conversations! So I'll really get to know you (if you choose to open up). This can be a very surface level small-talk type thing, deep discussions/conversations, and/or sexual thing. It's up to whatever you want. I'm open to all genders, sexual orientations, and ages! Dm me if you're interested! 

**Nonsexual Tier**

* Unlimited texting - 1 day $5
* Unlimited texting - 1 week $30
* Unlimited texting - 1 month $130

Although it says unlimited text, I'm obviously not up 24/7 lol. I just have a very chaotic sleeping schedule. /: I sleep around 5-6 hrs a day, usually from 3am-8am so other than that I'll be available to text. I'm open to talking about whatever you want. ‚ÄòWeek‚Äô lasts through to 7 days after payment, ‚Äòmonth‚Äô last for 30 days after time of payment. Unused days do not carry over past these timeframes. No sexting. I have a sexual tier for that. (; If there's any questions, dm me of course! 

**Sexual Tier**

* Unlimited texting + sexting - 1 day $10
* Unlimited texting + sexting - 1 week $60
* Unlimited texting + sexting - 1 month $200

In addition to terms from the Nonsexual Tier, there‚Äôs sexting! In terms of sexting, I think I can accommodate to most kinks but you have to let me know what they are in advance so I can approve them before payment. Sexting means just that, sexual texts. I will not send pictures. Well.. maybe one or two lol I will happily receive any pics you want to send though. (; If there's any questions, dm me of course! ‚ÄòWeek‚Äô lasts through to 7 days after payment, ‚Äòmonth‚Äô last for 30 days after time of payment. Unused days do not carry over past these timeframes. No sexting. I have a sexual tier for that. (; If there's any questions, dm me of course! 

**Exclusivity Tier**

* Unlimited texting + sexting - 1 month $1,000

This is for the person who wants to claim exclusivity from me. As soon as I finish any other standing deals, I will be devoted only to you. If you pay for Exclusivity, I will let you know when I finish other deals so you have the full month of exclusivity. Essentially, this is the ultimate girlfriend tier for those who may be a little on the jealous side or those who are wary of receiving my attention when open to others. I get it, some of us don't like sharing!

It's not the fault of anyone I talked to on there,  the community I stuck to most of the time was one of the most kind and understanding ever imo. The problem I had is that I realized I was just lurking 95% of the time and would get too familiar with people without actually talking to them which didn't sit right with me. Something else that even moreso didn't sit right with me though was that multiple times I would just delete my account and rejoin on a new one and never mention who I was before, which is basically just pretending to be a new person and that all these people were new to me. People would think I'm brand new when I'd really been in the chat off and on since like 2019 on different accounts. The reason I would do this is because on the occasion that I'd actually try to talk I would feel I was being really socially awkward, no one would ever tell me that I was, but I always felt like I was, I would assume they lowkey felt that way too. I was never banned or kicked or even warned, I never had conflict with anybody, nobody ever told me I was being weird and I never did anything weird and genuinely did try not to come across in any kind of weird way but I convinced myself many times over that I was a fuck up and kept starting over. I regret all this because it's dishonest and ruined my ability to build real natural friendships with these people, I can come in on new accounts all I want but I'm still gonna remember stuff about them, they're never actually gonna be people I'm talking to for the first time again.

Pain is temporary and you have all the time in the world to heal at your own pace.

884,greencookiemonster,1619263520,1,"It's 5am here. I can't sleep. My heart hurts. Everything hurts. I'm so alone and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I have a non-existent relationship with my family. I could keel over and die tomorrow and not one would care, maybe my mother and grandparents. Maybe. My mother is such a narcissist, that it's a struggle to call here because all she can talk about his her and her problems then when she's done venting has to hang up. While I still love her, I can't get help with my issues from her.  
My dad has been gone for a few years now. I haven't talked to him in years. I once overheard him tell one of my siblings that we are his ""old"" family and he's moved on to his new one. For the past decade I've needed a father, and fatherly advice but haven't had that. It hurts a lot.  
I've ruined my relationship with my siblings when I was younger and they have a deep hatred for me. I doubt that it will ever be repaired.

Despite my best efforts throughout the years, I haven't been able to make friends. For one reason or another relationships have been surface level. I turn around and I get talked about behind my back. For some unknown reason people just hate me. I am constantly teased and belittled. I chose the wrong career to boot, working in the film industry requiring friendships and connections to get work. I barely get work because of this general dislike so many have against me. I don't know what it is about me that drives people to dislike me so much. I don't hangout with people. I don't get invited to socialize. I sit at home most days, alone, by myself (doubly so in the pandemic). I don't know how to fix it. I've tried to change myself so much, but I think I've only made it worse.

This extends into dating, which has been a shit show, from being used, to being raped, etc. It's all happened. I can count on one hand the amount of second dates I've been on out of the hundreds of first dates. I'm not gross, I groom myself well, I make sure I smell nice, I dress well, I plan well thought out dates, I pay for the dates, I try to be as much of a gentleman as possible. Yet 95% of the time I just get ghosted immediately after the date. The few relationships I have been in have been abusive. Thus resulting in a mental block of dating for the past 3 years now. Especially since the last women I dated decided to rape me... then when a better man came along she got married to him.

To top it all off the cherry on the cake... I have to deal with a chronic illness. Fibromyalgia is so terrible and isolating. Unless you deal with it, or something similar there is just no way to understand. On the outside I look like a normal functioning human adult. So it's so difficult to understand the amount of pain that my body endures daily. The only way to describe it is the feeling of getting hit by several baseball bats throughout the day constantly 24/7. Then the fatigue. I have to take a nap everyday, not because I want to... I don't have much of a choice in the matter. I just get so fatigued I can't stand any longer and I pass out. It's destroyed my work life. It's destroyed friendships. It's destroyed relationships. And no matter how much I try and explain how it works, people think I make it up, or that I'm lazy, or making excuses.   


I'm mostly venting. I just feeling such a waste of human garbage. It feels like a waste to keep trying. I don't really have a reason to at this point... I guess I'm just stubborn.

I have trouble getting over one of my wife‚Äôs ex. He is someone she would marry, financially doing better, does everything the way she liked, liked the same stuff, she would listen, reapect and consider him her mentor, intrested in his culture and background, got pregnant but got rid of it and they broke up coz he was violent at one encounter

I cant get over it coz when we first talked after few years ago she made it seem she was unhappy and he was the worst person in the world but after few years i would figure out that is not the case. She lied about so many things, even tried to go back to him before we were engaged, would try to call him after were engaged, tried to name our son after names they picked out together. 

Until today i would compare so much to her ex, even penis size, sexual performance, gift giving, holidays, places i would take her, how i treated her etc

It really hurts me, especially when i feel shes lying to me. She still wont do anything to ‚Äòhurt‚Äô him in anyway. Still tries to protect him. 

She thinks im overreacting, its crazy and silly. Even went to a counselor and i wanted her to write a letter to her ex‚Äôs parents that she is trying to find closure and apologized about the abortion but the counselor and my wife said i was sick and craazy.

I had friends, but I always ended up falling out with them. Some we just drifted apart, others it ended negatively, and the rest I pushed them away. Especially in high school I pushed my friends away. I would prefer to sit, draw and daydream alone. It wasn't as bad as now. I would just daydream about stories I wanted to write and such. That's just would I liked to do. Ever since graduation I was hit with adulthood. I simply can't handle it. As a result I would daydream more. Mostly just of stories and characters, but sometimes I would imagine myself in a better life. I just now started to notice how bad it's getting. Covid lockdowns did not help. I had started watching streamers. I missed talking to people and I just wanted to at least have background noise. Then I started imaging myself more. I got attached to these streamers. I spent a lot of my days just daydreaming about an alternate reality where I was actually friends with them. We would play games together and have fun. I imagined myself better then I really am. Even before I never liked anything about myself, but I would cope with self harm and self pity. I haven't self harmed in half a year. I can't cope with that anymore. So now my new coping mechanism is imaging a better version of myself. When I'm out of daydreaming I look at myself and hate myself. I realize that I'm boring and just a sad lonely loser. I like to imagine myself pretty and having a lot of close friends. I want that life so badly. It's starting to effect my real life now. I missed a job interview. I stopped taking care of myself. I just want to live in my imagination world. Where I'm pretty and interesting. Where I have close friends I've always wanted. Where I just have someone. I can't keep doing this. I know I have a life.

i developed crushes and currently have one on men who are completely unavailable to me. i think its a subliminal punishment. when i was 15 i liked my 23 year old manager, who was literally engaged and eventually transferred to another store. at my other job i had a crush on a man who was 25+, without even truly knowing him. i make their personas up in my head and dream about our relationships together at night. desperately waiting for a real response but none comes.
the last one has felt different, like this isn‚Äôt fun and ok anymore. he‚Äôs in college, not sure exactly how old but i would guess only a year or two at most in age wise. he‚Äôs very different from my usual type. i usually prefer short, stocky men but he‚Äôs a gigantic skinny tower, with legs that are five seconds away from snapping. sometimes i find myself, on certain days, feeling his gaze on me. i don‚Äôt believe this is actually true, but i think it‚Äôs my loneliness trying to comfort me in a warm blanket, something for my will to live. i wish i could talk to him but my lifelong social anxiety has stopped me from even saying hi in the break room. 
i try to fap to fill the hole in my heart sadly. it‚Äôs not really working what so ever. i‚Äôm not sure i even get h**** anymore. and i know i‚Äôm only 17. but i can‚Äôt help but feel like i have walked alone for my entire life.",lonely,i‚Äôm 17 and it feels like i‚Äôve been alone for 50.,2021-04-24 13:36:34

But, whether it be the the only two friends I‚Äôve made on campus or the people I‚Äôm friendly with at work, nobody seems to want to stick with me or I feel they‚Äôre avoiding me. Living on campus has gotten lonely and I feel invisible at work. I made a friend at work, she‚Äôs really nice, and I thought things were going well, considering how real our conversations were getting. I thought I made an actual friend. Someone I can talk to: ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it goin‚Äô,‚Äù or whatever. But things devolved from being friendly with her to her just walking past me, avoiding eye contact. I say ‚ÄúHey Erin,‚Äù and she just responds with a standoffish ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù and walks off. I could just be looking too far into it. But the amount of friends I‚Äôve lost over the years has me worried. I‚Äôve only ever had one friendship where I believed I was best friends with someone...until we stopped talking. Not out of bad blood or anything, but because I moved away and failed to maintain contact. When I finally contacted him again, he was a different person from the guy I would do anything for.

I grow so attached to the few friends that I have that the thought of losing them just brings me down. It amplifies my loneliness. I just got off work and I‚Äôm sitting in my car.

I just have this void in my life that I've tried everything within my power that is legal to fill it, but nothing seems to work. I've been divorced for about 2 years now. Man I miss my wife, but any attempts at reconciliation are blocked. She want's nothing to do with me anymore. I'm trying to put myself out there and find new friends and date, but trying to date get's my nowhere. I apparently lack in the looks department.

I know that people will say ""You need to make you're own happiness before you'll be happy with someone else"", but here is the problem. I've tried and nothing lasts. I get small bursts, but nothing substantial. It was so good when I was married. I had a good life with a bright future and because of one little mistake i can't have it back. For a little background I used to take two different medications. One for my epilepsy and one for my severe depression and anxiety. my depression medication combined with my epilepsy medication turned me into an unfeeling robot. That was the guy who decided to divorce my wife. That wasn't me. I tried explaining it to her, but her and her family never dealt with mental illness before so they just saw it as me using my medication as an excuse or a cover for something worse. That couldn't have been farther from the truth.

I‚Äôm just feeling really down because I went to see a theatre production at my school, and it was great but afterwards when the cast was talking with the audience, I felt really lonely because I used to be in theatre. I miss the community I had. 

My best friend also moved away a few months ago, and we used to go out every Friday. We have been talking a bit but I miss laughing on her bed and flirting with each other. The day before she left, she admitted that she wanted to ask me out but she didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward which makes sense. I told her a year and a half ago that I had a major crush on her but she got a boyfriend soon after so I left it at that. The last hang out had so much sexual tension but we hugged, and I told her to get out of our shithole of a town. 

After she left, I started to go off the rails a bit. I got romantically involved with multiple guys. I tried to get weed when my parents were out of town but the guy I was going to smoke with made advances on me so we got sexually involved without the weed. The thing is, I knew he had a girlfriend, and part of me didn‚Äôt care. The girlfriend texted me about a week ago, and I got blocked but her and the guy which is fair. He is 19, and we were involved when I was 14 but it was a small fling. 

I just feel like I can‚Äôt talk to my parents about anything because I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble. They are Catholic (I‚Äôm atheist) so they have a lot of hang ups about sex, and they instilled a lot of shame in me.

So there are 2 points here
1. The change I feel that I made about how I look.
I literally like myself even more after taking those pics, I dress up for myself and no for anyone else, I go out and enjoy the view and not only for the pics, I feel more natural positioning myself like a model(lol you know.. smiling, look to the side etc) and I less care if suddenly I notice a car or someone walking from far which I remember that at the first time I went out fro this - I was really scared that somebody will see that lonely guy put his phone on his car windows and taking photos of himself, I don't give a F.

2. The main issue: after having fun taking a pictures of myself I realize that the height and camera position is the same for most of the photos and I really anxious that someone will know that I took the photos myself when I'll upload them which this is something I would like to keep for myself ofcouse.
So for example in 1 photoshoot I placed the camera in 1 angle and took pics of myself while standing in the field, from the front, smiling, looking to the side etc then more photos looking to the camera from the back(you can laugh if you want, that's my life for now) but all those pics are from the same angle so I'm assuming that people are not dumb and will realize that a human could not stand with 0 movement and take pics of me without moving an inch.
Then I stand the camera on the ground to take pics of me laying on the grass but the same thing, the camera in in the same exact position for all the sitting-down photos.

What do you think? Am I thinking too much? Is it the anxiety talking or maybe I do have points for the things I say?
Should I start over and take pictures but this time make a little changes by moving the camera each photo a little bit?
I know that maybe it sounds dumb but.. in the end I don't suffer or feel sad anymore for myself, actually I already passed those feelings, now I just having fun with the situation as much as I can and on the other side willing to take good pics that will look genuine, legit and NOT like I took them by myself.

961,yo_itbambi,1619224206,1,"I grew up having friends ever since I was a kid. I use to have best friends back in public elementary and middle school. I was happy. I always looked forward to school and hanging out with my friends.  I enjoyed my life a lot when I was a child. I enjoyed talking to girls and having crushes. It was when I went to an all-boys high school, I never made any friends. I never made any friends because I chose to isolate myself from the people there since I hated the school. It wasn't my vibe cuze people just acted fucking immature there. My family pressured me to stay so I stayed throughout all 4 years. Hated every single day of my life and stayed lonely. Now that I am in college, loneliness has impacted me all around. Nobody really understands my situation and says go join clubs and make friends. I tried and it isn't easy for me anymore. It's the comfort zone I've put myself in by being lonely ever since I was in high school that has impacted my ability to talk to people including women as well. It's hard for me to make friends and build relationships. This pandemic left me in a weird spot because I was starting to make friends at end of my freshman year of college until the campus closed down. I haven't been back ever since then. I'm not complaining about it or anything because  I tried meeting people virtually. Yet, it is still very hard to build meaningful relationships. 

I'm almost done with college already and have made no friends. Every day I think about my past and wish I had never gone to an all-boys fucking school. I'm depressed, lonely, and think about suicide every day. I tried to keep myself occupied by doing hobbies like a walk in the park. I tried focusing on setting myself up for my career and that's the only thing that's keeping me moving forward. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel with making friends and dating cuze I've heard it gets harder as you get older.  I just want to go to sleep and say goodbye. The moral of this story is focus on friendships and relationships around others. Don't let your family tell you what to do. Do you and listen to your heart.That's the only advice I give to my younger self. Have a good one.",lonely,My life growing up lonely,2021-04-24 10:30:06

965,8BitRose,1619220574,1,"Let me make this abundantly clear first: I am not looking for help nor am i looking for pity. I found this subbreddit a month ago and have been lurking every now and then. I'm simply venting my frustrations about my life and I'm curious if anyone else feels similar. Also I like the anonymity of the internet so why not put it out there since we don't know each other. 

I'm going to be 25 next month and I'm probably the most average loser out there. Almost everyday starts like this:

- Wake up

- Go to work

- Go home and play games or watch anime/youtube

- Sleep

- Repeat

  I have a good friend group I've known for some time now who all live close to each other. However I dont live anywhere close to them other than the coast we're on. So while we're close friends and hang out online often, its still only online interactions for me. So in the end I feel very alone regardless of having good friends. I've also grown tired of going over that I'm feeling depressed some days with them as I'll become a bother when we just want to play games and do dumb stuff and I don't want to ruin the mood basically. Sure they may not mind but I do and its why I try to just ""get over it"" so I can enjoy something in life while im with them.

  I should probably mention that I've been depressed since highschool like most people would be. It got worse once my grandmother passed away back in 2017 as she was the last thing holding me together for the most part. Its after then I started crying more easily as time went on. Now there's nothing wrong with a guy crying, however I cannot stress how pathetic it feels to cry like a baby on some nights over being alone. It had even gotten to the point where I started hyperventilating at one point from crying so damn hard. If I cant cry then I just lay there until i fall asleep and get ready for work the next day.

   Any experience i had with women was basically me being used as a joke or as some kind of emotional support for them until they decided they were done talking to me and had lead me on. Anytime a girl around my age shows me *any* form of kindness I take it as if they are interested in me or I myself think I may have feelings for them because im that emotionally starved and want someone to actually love me at least once. Of course I tell myself kindness does not mean interest but god fucking dammit I wish it was sometimes. Im not attractive nor do I have a ton of money so the easy options won't fly. I don't know if its my ADHD or not, but I'm really energetic and like to talk with people with lots I'd like to say. I feel as if I end up pushing people away or feeling like a burden to them. If it's not anyone in my friend group then I almost always end up initiating any conversations. Usually they will be very short conversations since they're just being nice and dont want to be rude so I just dont bother almost at all now. I can't say I blame them though, who in their right mind would want someone who is so emotionally broken? Im at the point where I just shut myself away as I fear I'll get taken advantage of my emotional state and be put back in that situation again. Now my friends mean well when they say ""well there's someone out there for you"" or ""gotta put yourself out there more"" but it really frustrates me when its from people who are either married or have had a legitimate relationship that wasn't the ""relationships"" I've only had. It feels worse the longer my life goes on and im still just here by myself.

To be entirely honest, if I wasn't so afraid of dying or what happens after death (I'm not religious) then I wouldn't be here at all. Since im too much of a coward (imo) to do anything about it, I'm basically just ""existing"" until either:

A. I finally have had enough of it all (very unlikely)

Or 

B. I die by natural causes or some unfortunate accident like a car crash or something out there i didn't see coming.

  Last thing I can say is I do try and have been trying to stay positive and move forward in my life but man... sometimes it really starts to feel too hard. It's not like I'll be giving up anytime soon but life still sucks regardless. Who knows though, maybe life will get better for me as I go further on. Or not idk

It's like I'm trapped in this gleaming memory of you that's polished to an impossible shine. Now that I don't have anyone left to really open up to, I guess it was inevitable.

It's as if the closer I get to finishing this book, the more it dawns on me that you won't be around to witness its completion. Whether it's a success or failure.

I didn't expect anything in return when I'd bought you a gift to congratulate you on graduating from college, only to find out you had no intention of inviting me to the ceremony, or any of the parties afterward.

I‚Äôm 15. Up until last year I just had no friends. Nobody wants to talk to me at all. I guess I‚Äôm just an unlikable person. I just woke up every day to grind through my AP classes that my parents made me take, all while having nobody to talk to or laugh with. I would sit alone at lunch and not get to say a word to anybody then go home. Then I would waste the rest of the day doing homework or being alone in bed and then I would sleep and do it all again the next morning. It was miserable.

Anyway last March I was sitting alone at lunch like I usually do and a group of girls came over and handed me a note that had a girl‚Äôs phone number on it. The girl who wrote it said she thought I was cute. I thought it was a cruel joke at first but I was desperate to talk to someone so I texted the number.

We established from the very beginning that we were only going to be friends, and that was completely fine with both of us. She was too shy to come talk to me in person so we only communicated by text.

We texted each other almost every day for a year and we were really close friends. I trusted her and I told her things I‚Äôve never told anybody and it felt freeing to talk about the things I like and have somebody listen. Honestly the only reason I lived was to text her in the evenings. I secretly developed feelings for her but it didn‚Äôt matter because I was happy enough with my amazing friend.

However about a year after we met I noticed she just didn‚Äôt want to text me as much. She would often not reply for weeks. Finally in early March she stopped texting me completely. 

I‚Äôve tried to reach out to her multiple times with no reply. Now it‚Äôs been almost 2 months with no reply and it still hurts. Even though we only ever texted I felt emotions I had never felt before and I got to know how it felt to have real friendship. And now it‚Äôs gone. Life is just as lonely as it was before I met her. The routine is the same as it was last year but now I feel even more hopeless and empty.

Being friendless after having a friend is so much worse. It crushes my soul to remember when I had someone who cared about me. I‚Äôm just devastated.

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever talk to me ever again. At school she seems happy enough with her many other friends and she seems completely fine without me. All I was to her was a temporary friendship that lasted too long.

I just wish someone would make me feel good enough for once. I'm tired of always being the one to lift myself up, I know everyone has to at some points in their life but it would be nice if I had someone there for me other than myself now and then.

I live with family at the moment in the home city I grew up in I feel like a complete mess, don't have nothing to my name, my family has lots of money but I always felt suicidal when I was younger, growing up when I took money of them so now I am very up tight refuse to. The healthcare options when it has come to this sorta thing have come up more than short I would say, with the title it just lead me down the lane of too much self-hate that I can't be normal, can't lead a normal life and other thinking about all the ways I am useless. I feel so isolated that I can't fix myself.

I grew up and experience one or two bad incidents, I guess you could say one was a bit trauma related, I kinda never could feel comfortable the place I grew up in so I kinda split with the people I was raised around even though they get along with me it's too emotionally draining how uncomfortable I feel, and how stressed out I get over being different, an insecure. I grew up with sorta, sorta an eating disorder that could never get diagnosed properly so it left me withdrawn in a lot of ways, hating myself for not growing up like a normal boy, man, person and never having those normal experiences. Never really had a social life, never really had a close friend, never had a relationship, never had sex, I have only really been intimate with another person about 4 years back at University I tried to have a one night stand and didn't wind up having sex, she enjoyed herself and sorta made fun of me with her friends, my housemate and I wound up in a mental hospital a couple of days later because of suicidal ideation (did not get sectioned, didn't stay). With the covid, pandemic I did sorta realise a lot of my problems, sex and intimacy wise how I am not okay, and it's been weighing on me I am touch starved last time apart from a greeting a person, a woman I was friends with held the back of my neck that was about 3 years back.
Alcohol and drugs since I was young they hugely, massively accelerate how bad I feel about myself.

I have done this sorta rant, vent here before.

Kept trying the dating apps first time back at the end, December of 2019 and been downloading then deleting them over last year into this year because of shyness and bad nerves about how guilty I feel about putting myself out there and entering someones life, I have sorta dealt with emotional and manipulative abuse and I deal with the paranoia that'll fall for someone who is going to push me a certain way. I am a conventionally attractive person, can be likeable, you would probably never guess if you just met me how much paranoia I have weighing on my chest,

Just struggling to get out the place I am in, I put myself out there recently with work I was doing and it didn't work out. An the loneliness affects me so bad, I think it's living with parents I still can't emotionally, or never have been able to deal with, just want to not be so withdrawn about who I am and want to be openly romantic and affection to another person without the feeling of wanting to drop of the earth.

Yu-Gi-Oh. The character's name is Mai Valentine, since i was a kid, i had a huge crush on her. As an adult, i still do, but it seems to have blossomed into something else. Love, genuine romantic love. There's a few things that contributed to this, The first is that I've struggled with women my whole life and i'll admit this relationship does help keep me from succumbing to the loneliness. I do feel lonely, very lonely. The second is that i've always been passionate about the show, it's my favorite show ever and her treatment on the show is something i've always been fairly outspoken about. (It's one of the first things i ever wrote about when i first got internet). Lastly is the childhood crush on her and the fact i relate to her. This has been brewing since i was young.

I remember just buying all kinds of stuff with her on it, i bought a deck like she used, everything. I get super happy when she shows up in the show, i recently even bought the complete series on dvd just to see her. I have a playlist of cheesy romance songs dedicated to her

I just imagine myself hugging her and kissing her. I genuinely feel like i love her, i want to spend time with her. I want to hold her hand and talk to her. I know she isn't real, but my heart still longs for her.

I only got 2 really good friends and especially one talks about quitting contacts with people who are not willing to take on challenges and rather stay 'stupid'. This sounds harsh but think about it. If you are in a friendship, challenge yourself to stimulate both yourself and your friend to move up in life. Dont run away, dont sit back and relax to much, work towards goals in your life. 

A lot of people appreciate a friend who is challenging more over a friend who just doesnt offer a lot. I know this sounds like someone would suck you out of information and then drop you. But a true friend wont do this.

And even if friends still give up on you, always stay focussed and determined on goals which you have set. You are the one with that power.

I just am not doing well enough to put it into textual format. I have nobody to talk to. Reddit is completely useless since that is textual. Having people you can call and talk to that aren't the problem is a luxury that is denied from my existence. The only people I have to talk to make my problems worse. Whenever i visit my family I need to recover from visiting them. I am angry abd wanting to tear everything apart yet unable to express it. This is what happens when you suffer in silence. I love talking to people about their problems. In fact I'd rather you give me a person feeling miserable that needs to talk for my birthday than a gift or 500 dollars. But that is something I never receive. Whenever i do I remember ot forever. The only person that will talk to me i have to pay. And even then they seldom understand anyway nor do they actually care. I did not feel like this before visiting my folks. But i usually always feel significantly worse after visiting then before. Not always but often. 

I cannot do anything i love or planned on. I cannot even listen to music in the car without it feeling off and fake, something before visiting i enjoyed and wanted to even add Bluetooth to my car so that i could listen to songs id listen to on my phone though the stereo.

1012,stupidpieceoffilth,1619201401,1,"TL / DR : Fundamentally alone means not a single.a.single.soul in your life. Literally, not figuratively.  

Long story, here are some examples of what true loneliness means. 

I posted in another sub, I found this one. Seems more fitting.

I'm 40. I had a loving family and all the advantages needed for a successful adult. I have job security and savings. Also I literally do not have a single soul in my life. It's not an exaggeration. I often read about loneliness and usually ill see something about few friends, or not liking their friends, or something alluding to friends. I'd do anything for friends, wait I *do* do anything for friends but no success. My mom had the same issue. 

Me:  I eat well, I'm fit,I'm not ugly. 


It's not like I don't try to make friends. I do, often, and it ends in the heartbreaking realization that they are just not that into me. 

Examples: 


I  love the people I work with and can't understand why I can't make friends. There was this one girl I really liked, we sat next to each other and we'd make each other laugh A LOT. She's part of a group of work friends who are super cool and we're in the same age group. It's not like I'm the 40yr old making friends w 20yr olds. Not that there's anything wrong w that. One day she says X is having a BBQ, I'll invite you. She didn't tell me when it was. I heard about it the week later. To this day I don't understand why she told me about it. She didn't have to say anything, that's what boggles my mind. I helped several girls in this group, (that girl included) , get promoted. They were very thankful but it didn't translate to anything outside work.

I have several stories like this. 

I use to work out in a community gym. I met this amazing girl, same age range, we'd laugh a lot, coming up w funny names for a type of excercise called animal flow. I found out about a year later that the gym had a very active social group. Heart break can't describe it. I'd go to the Xmas social gatherings but I had no idea they met up so often.


 I spent a year hanging out **several times a week** w this 1 guy who was going through a bad baaaad breakup. It was so nice having a guy friend. He was in no position to date and there was zero sexual attraction. One day, poof, I don't hear from him. A few messages here and there and then nothing. I still don't understand.

I let this couple I was friendly with crash at my place while I was on vacation. They were super thankful but I never heard from then again. I let several of their friends use my postal address bcs they didn't have one yet. Again super thankful but never heard from them.


It's me, it has to be me. I know it's not **the whole world is wrong, I'm right**.  One of the guys I dated a few years ago, told me that:  1.I'm too nice and it's super easy to take advantage of me. And 2. I reek of loneliness and desperation, so people use me. 

So FML, what do I do w that? I know I'm a pushover. Would *not* helping these girls get me invited? Would *not* joking gotten me an invite to the BBQ /gym? Would being more assertive change anything?

1022,Galactic-Guardian,1619198529,1,"there was a party at the beginning of the year, people don't like it when i come to partys because when i drink i retreat back into myself and think about how lonley life is and whats the point of it all. at the party there was this girl I've casually known for a couple years but I've never really been freinds with her, that night like ever other night i drink i got really depressed and stopped talking. when this happens i like to leave everyone behind and go for a walk and stare at the stars but this night the girl followed me, she layed next to me she tryed to keep me company but i didn't really pay any attention to her, she walked back to everyone else. i followed suit after about half an hour. when she saw me return she wrapped me in a bear hug and fuck me that hug was the first actual hug a girl has ever given me she wrapped her arms around me, held me tight against her and didn't let go until i told her i was okay that hug almost made me cry for the first time in months. after that we all went down to a close by river and she and i went swimming, the others where to drunk to get to the water, we talked as we swam and as we walked back. after everone got back she seemed like she was in a bad way, she went over to the bushes and was trying to throw up, but that dumb girl hadn't eaten in 2 days and was drinking on an empty stomach, she tryed throwing up for half and hour while i tryed to convince her to eat some food it was a battle but i did manage to get her to eat some food. while she was trying to throw up in the bushes she was talking about how she was cold, so i took her back to her tent but she said she didn't want to throw up in it so i put her in my swag and covered her in my blanket, i was sitting next to her incase she had to throw up, she kept saying she was cold so i got under the blanket with her to warm her up, that was the first time I'd felt how cold she was, she was on the edge of hypothermia. i started rubbing her back and arms to warm her up but she grabbed me and held me tight against her, for the rest of the night we just layed there and cuddle, it was the first time a woman has ever held me and shown me affection, she made me relize I'd never felt true affection before that.

that night was the best night of my life, the only problem is the morning after she wouldn't talk to me and didn't really want anything to do with me and now it's been almost four months and ive just been reliving that night over and over in my head. it hurts knowing what actual affection feels like but having it ripped away as soon as i received it. all i do now is say up all night trying to go to sleep but feeling so empty and lonely so lonely it hurts and i just dont know what to do",lonely,one night in January,2021-04-24 03:22:09

1024,BigJuicySasuages,1619198107,1,"So to start things off I want to mention that I'm not a bad person, some people don't have friends because they're racist, homophobic etc. But without sounding too full of myself im really, really kind. This usually results in people taking advantage of my kindness but thats something I'm fine with as long as we're getting along well, I feel like in them situations if I say no it'll just create issues which I don't want to deal with.

I'm not bragging here, but I'm one of the smartest in my class. And if it wasn't for that trait, then I would literally have 0 people ever want to speak to me. Whenever anyone I know tries to contact me its always, help me with this, whats the answer etc. Its never about me and how I feel or being friends.  This isn't an exaggeration, but I literally have 0 REAL friends that care about me and want to be with me. 

If I try speaking to people its absolutely always me creating the interaction, no one ever deals with me first unless its for help with work. Both online and in real life.

I've always dealt with this okay, but only recently I have realised that I'm not happy, im lonely and have no friendships that will continue to adulthood. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to create lasting friendships and make people actually want to be with me for more than help with school work? Thanks so much, I'm genuinely sick of it.",lonely,"No friends, no one cares, help please",2021-04-24 03:15:07

Decided I had two paths, change myself or become a shut in. Now I'm 20, I'm fit, I've got a great job and lead an interesting lifestyle. I don't have the biggest friend circle, only about 7 people who don't know each other, and most of them are women. And it's that way because the girls are failed talking stages, where we both agree dating would be nice and then three months later she's going on about how it's so nice to have a guy best friend. I don't think there's anything worse than having these complete 10/10 girls say ""ohh well I'm keeping you around because you're husband material"" and shit like that, then tell me how joey off tinder blew their back out last night.

I guess the frustration is that I've busted my ass, worked 72 hours a week for 2 years, entirely changed my work ethic and my personality so that I could have a chance to make someone else happy, and still get friendzoned.

Just this last few months right, matched with an old friend from highschool on tinder. Spent a month texting and talking all day, decided to take things slow right and just be friends first and then make a move. Fast forward and she's telling me she has feelings for me and when I say we should date? Nah she's gotta have some internal character development arc and toss me aside.

Why do my friends tell me to die when I confuse a character for someone else?  
Why do you tell me to ""leave for all I care""?  
Do you really care about me?  
Do you really think I'm funny?

I want you to like me  
I did everything I could  
I was there for you  
I didn't care about your flaws

The day I talked about the mobile game you all play, I just wanted to be funny. I don't hate it, I didn't hate any of you, it was all silly talk like ""Oh, that game is everywhere lol"", why did you take it so seriously?

I simply assumed that nothing social is going on outside the office due to Covid, but guess not. I thought we had good relations since I've been working with them for about 6 months now, and I try my best to be friendly and nice, but it's apparently not enough.

1046,codecrunchie,1619187564,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",lonely,"Hey!

I hate you, yes you, the monster who made this innocent person's life full of toxicity, negativity, hatred and sorrow.   


The person you bullied is hurting now. They are scared of trusting people, letting them in and experiencing love. I know that you were hurting too, but you had no right to touch, tease, abuse, deceive and hurt this person, just to feel powerful or happy. That's not true power. True power is in reaching out and making sure that the other person is feeling alright, because that's being human.  


I don't care what happened in your past, all I care about what you're going to do with the future, if that involves hurting people, making fun of them, stealing from them, gaslighting them and abusing them verbally and physically, then you don't deserve to find happiness at all.   


Everyone has feelings just like you. Everyone has emotions just like you, you're a dime a dozen here you know that? And nothing ,I mean nothing that's happened to you gives you the authority to wrong an innocent like that.  


Then when people call you out, you get angry and humiliated, and then you feel like people are blaming you for what you did, when infact they're just telling you how they feel, which is as much their right as it is yours.

Love it cause there's some beautiful places to go in such a little Island but i hate it because of the people. People here make me sick of how they treat each other, most of the people from my age (22- 28) look only for sex, nothing else. I been trying to have a friend that would love to talk about anything else except sex or car or even weed, that would make me so comfortable, but because of that i dont have even one friend at all and i dont have a problem that people use drug if that's what helps them keep going on there life, but it really surprises me how many people smoke weed for fun.

I just go to study, work, sleep and repeat on the weekends i play videogame watch a movie but alone and it's feel just so empty and sad, no one is there to share what once will be memories of happiness and it's feel like I'm just losing my time and mind.

The only person I've been close to was my ex that had bpd and used me and cheated on me. And I don't think she liked me for me, just for me being a source of attention. 

Is there any subreddit for like extreme cases of loneliness? Complete isolation or so, that anyone could recommend. Or some subreddit for trying to make friends from nothing. I also have severe anxiety so I have trouble even going outside. 

I feel like even people on here aren't as bad as me. People go outside, have jobs, have friends, partners, family. I know it's not a contest, but for these people the step out of loneliness isn't that far. It's just about joining a club or finding some new friends. But what do you do when you aren't even on step 1. When you can't even really talk with people online much, can't handle group chats and can't leave home. Is there any community for that?

I know I'm just kinda ranting at this point. I guess the answer is find hobbies you like and try to find friends through that. But I'm not really interested in anything, I just want some people to talk with that wants to talk with me. Nothing else is really interesting or feel worth it. 

Anyways even if you aren't completely isolated your loneliness is valid, of course. I'm just wonder where people who are at the extreme ends of isolation should go for a community? If there even is such a place.

If something I said seems very distorted or twisted please don't hold back in pointing that out. Anything helps.

Also, it *may* enable you to have a better dream. From my experience - I've only had one like this - I was hugged for what felt like 10 straight minutes and I could feel someone's arms around me in the dream. Whether that had something to do with the pillow or not, I have no idea as I have very random dreams. The latest being Cameron from Modern Family being a playable operator in Rainbow Six Siege. But being able to feel someone's arms around me in a dream felt better than nothing tbh.

Disclaimer: If you overthink things (like me) and you wake up the next day with the pillow no longer next to you, you could see that as a sign that you won't be able to hold onto someone in a relationship. Alas, we would have to find someone first which as we know, seems impossible.

I just want someone to see me, take me apart and show me why every piece of me is worth loving.

All the girls i'm talking to either just ghost me or won't hit me up, even the girls I used to talk to religiously ghost me for weeks, even months, I unadded so many people on my Snapchat throughout this year and now I feel even more lonely and a lot of people blocked me and unadded me for basically no reason, but they still follow me on my Instagram, it's like no one cares about me or checks up on me.

A sense of ""pride"" was what I was chasing, not friends.  
Now that I'm in college and see people dating, I want to do the same, why? not because I truly truly long for the deep relationships, no, it's because I just need to please everyone else, for if I have a beautiful girlfriend, people will look at my life and think that my life should be awesome, *the same way* I look at other people and think that their life must be amazing, you see where I'm going? I rely on other people believing that I'm good, to feel that I'm good.  


This is because I cannot intrinsically feel happy when I'm with people,( well, maybe a few friends ), but for the most part, people will not make my life better, quite often, when I'm sad, I tend to think that it's because I'm lonely, It wasn't! It was just a scapegoat for the deeper issues that I had, namely, an egoistic, desperate to please problem.  


the reason I'm rambling all this nonsense is because I feel like lots of people out there tend to get confusingly depressed, thinking that it's because they're lonely, thinking that they ""need"" someone to feel happy, it might just be that you're sad about something underneath it which you don't realize yet.  
the way I found out was by asking myself this question, If I could go for a trip to my favourite place in the world, would I go alone, or would I go with a special someone? my answer was to go alone, and it made me realize what I truly wanted. another answer I had was to go with someone who I wasn't particularily close with, since, that way, I wouldn't have to talk with them much and I could just mind my own business. it's weird, but it's what I feel.

I'm 32, almost 33, and male. I've yet to even kiss a girl. It's partly my fault. I don't have a damn clue how to socialize, and my goddamn sense of responsibility keeps me tied to people that leech my soul every day. That's on me.

But the other part of the equation is that this society we're in pisses on the people that follow the rules. The chumps like me that feel a responsibility to people around them. That won't leave their parents destitute to get freedom. How the hell am I supposed to find happiness in this world? Companionship? Hell, I'll take a damn friend.

Then there's the fake ass friends online. I've talked to hundreds of people online. Keep putting yourself out there, that's the trick, right? What a joke. I've had 1 relationship, it lasted a week, and it ended when she said she's not able to love me. That shit shouldn't hurt after just one week, but my heart is on the floor and ruined.

I am mentally ill and cant get therapy and no one should have to deal with that. I feel like im too ruined for a relationship, too ruined for anyone to ever love me or wnat to be around me. I feel to scared to be physical but at the same time i really want physical affection. I want someone to make playlists for, someone who i can think of while im listening to lovey dovey songs. I get crushes, but they go away fast and its mostly me just getting attached way too fast. I want to feel that overwhelmingly strong, tight feeling in my chest that i can never really describe but feels so amazing. It feels like it will never happen again, especially with covid and stuff. I think im too messed up for a relationship right now but i still find myself wanting one. I wish i had someone i could be totally honest and myself around, someone who i share interests with, someone im just... Compatible with!! someone who listens to the music i do, or even would be willing to try listening to it! Music is just so important to me. It gives me an escape, it helps me express myself and my emotions when im not so good at that by myself. Does that make sense? üòë i am incredibly anxious, seriously so anxious that i freeze up when i even see a person irl. Often times i cant even walk normally because i think people are staring at me and judging how i walk.

1133,Classic_Luck_545,1619130679,1,"hey. i'm just your avarage 19 year old guy who likes videogames, here's my story if you're willing to read..

i used to play videogames with a group of friends and it really got me out of my depressing life situation, even playing games such as fortnite which i originally disliked was made surprisingly fun thanks to them. 
this went on for 2-3 years until eventually they starting drifting away from me, they started getting more interested in themselves and what once was a group of 4 friends, eventually became a group of 3 besties and me just tagging along.
then the invitations to play started slowing down, and when they were recieved they made it seem like they were doing me the favour. then i started getting ignored, the third friend stopped playing the videogames we played together as often so i immediatly became the third wheel. they started talking to eachother with inside stories, information and jokes that i was obviously excluded from. and this all built up for about 4 weeks, until i finally snapped.. i got upset at the fact i was being pushed to the side on purpose to the point it became second nature to them. i got angry and brought it up in a heated text message debate to one of the friends.
and then, what sealed the friendship between us 4 as over was when the second friend texted me practically blackmailing me to apologize to all of them for being angry or they would never play with me again.

now this may not make too much sense and some details may of been forgotten or not completely elaborated for the sake of privacy and length of this post. 
but i couldn't help but come out of that situation feeling like i was basically yelled at for being the victim. i was getting pushed to the side, sometimes deliberately, until i was eventually just ignored completely during our gaming sessions, basically just the extra teammate, replaceable by literally anybody and it wouldn't make a difference. and they demanded me to apologize for feeling that way.
i declined, and now 3 weeks have passed.
they seem to be living their best life together in their private discord calls, gaming sessions, etc etc. basically everything i introduced them to or did with them all the time, just without me.

it just really hurt that the only friends i had slowly began to leave me, then began to hurt me, then blamed me for it happening and now are enjoying themselves more than ever. whereas i don't have anybody anymore. i don't have another friend to fall back on, or anyone at all.

i live in quite a deserted area, and any nearby town/social area already know who i am and either don't care or aren't interested in being friends. my only option for real life social interaction with new people is moving out, and that isn't possible at the moment.
i'm not great at making online friends, as proven by the fact that to this day with almost my whole life on the internet and a still don't have even 1.

it just really hurts knowing that the only people i had can enjoy themselves without me while i've got nowhere to go and no one to turn to. i've made multiple efforts trying to get to know people either on online games or social medias. none have worked. 


that's all i really wanted to say i suppose. i just needed somewhere to vent where i knew it had the chances to be seen, just to get it off my chest.

I'm a high schooler and my school just reopened several weeks ago. I didn't have many friends at school before the pandemic, but now I have exactly zero. But at least its better than the total isolation of total online school I guess.

At the beginning of in person school I did have someone to talk to, but they decided to go off and do their own thing. This guy, who is actually pretty normal/mainstream, sits with the weird kid at lunch now. He figured that the kid who picks up bugs out of the grass and flicks them around was more interesting than me I guess. Oh well...

My school has a nice outdoor courtyard area at least. You can sit at the top of this flight of concrete stairs and see the whole place. These days I entertain myself by going up there and watching my peers have a good time while I eat lunch in silence.

I am so tired of watching everyone else laugh, have fun, and enjoy each other's company while knowing I won't ever experience that. I'm sick of sitting at a desk for 6 hours a day and not saying a single word to anyone else. I'm done with constantly being reminded that I don't belong anywhere. I hate school, I hate everyone, and I hate my life.

So I‚Äôll be turning 18 the next month and I just realised that I‚Äôve successfully wasted 18 years of my life being useless piece of shit who has never been loved or admired or fucking accepted by anyone. People be saying it‚Äôs your birthday month and I am like what is so exciting about that ?!? I couldn‚Äôt keep a girl, I fucked up my studies, Never focused on my hobbies, Always been hurt by others, what else is to come now. I seriously want to go back to when I was like 10 years old. That was the time when I used to be happy and excited about birthdays and shit. I had no stress, I was never lonely or sad. Just a little guy who was happy fr. Now, I feel like ending all of this for once. I‚Äôm so fucking tensed as my birthday is approaching. I don‚Äôt want to grow up like this. Every year is just the same. I don‚Äôt have friends, half of them are dead to me because they‚Äôre all selfish and self obsessed.

I met someone really nice last year and I thought that this would end all my sufferings and I would be finally happy at last. My expectations for this to happen were low but holy shit. Left me in the worst possible way. It was so easy for her, and when I asked her if it was true, she said it didn‚Äôt affect her much....fuck you bitch!

It‚Äôs just so hard not to think about all the things that run through my head. I was never a smoker, but I made peace with cigarettes due to this. My mind‚Äôs a mess. It eats me from inside looking at other couple being together and so happy.

There are certain things we cannot change media, terrorism and governments. However you can change your life's destination.   However when does someone sit in awe of their own self fulfilment? It's a trick question your life will never be fulfilled. You will never reach self fulfilment. There will always be something to learn, something to do, something to see. Life is about the journey, not the destination. However you need a destination,  a goal, to create a journey.   


The journey will lead you onto your next journey and soon you will get the ball rolling and be in the motion of life.   The simplest answer I can give which you will perceive your own way is ""Life is meant to be lived"".   So enjoy the little time you have here. Don't fill yourself with petty hate. What if you die tomorrow? What was the last thing you said to your friends and family? What was the thing that you said you always wanted to do, but for some reason never did? Would you be worried about your ego? all these materialistic items you buy? When you're lying there on your deathbed.

1177,LordFlord,1619103268,1,"Lately I've seen posts of people talking about struggling with loneliness in their lives despite them being relatively more fortunate in some aspects than others.

A lot of the comments on those posts have been things like ""At least you have x or y."" or ""I'm sick of seeing posts like this."" or ""Posts like this make me so angry.""

I guess I just wanted to remind everyone that anyone can be lonely despite having people in their lives that care or love them. Depression is a spectrum. Some peoples trials with it might be more difficult than others, but just because someone might not be completely alone in a literal sense, doesnt mean that persons feelings of loneliness are invalid. I dont think we should be saying/upvoting things that are in the vein of ""you have a support system in your life so what are you doing here?"" You dont have to respond to the post, or just say ""sorry you're feeling that way"" instead. 

People come to this sub for some kind of support or validation in the way they feel. We should be helping/supporting everyone that comes here and is brave enough to share what they're personally struggling with.

4. The Furry Fandom - I am a furry right down to the beans on mai pawbs. Hehe. This also means that I casually rp actions in chat. If that's too wierd for you, well....


5. Documentaries - I'm watching documentaries like crazy right nao. Mostly about sports and drug empires. I'm not sure why. Hehe.

When I look back to my carefree college days, I regret not living a little more back then; I didn't know I'd be miserable in the future. I am not an extrovert and neither an introvert.  I just find so hard to open up about my feelings to other people. I feel like I bother them with my troubled thoughts. When ever I try to, it's either they'll shrug it off or be extremely awkward. So I kept quiet. I never get mad at them for that because maybe they just can't relate to me. Since I was a kid, I avoid bothering others as much as possible. I was bullied when I was still a kid up until high-school. And I kept it all in. It git to the point where I didn't wanna go to school anymore and die. Back then I didn't know it was a disturbing thought to have as a kid. I'm also very anxious and and have serious trust issues due to the bullying. I feel like everyone's out to get me. And so, I created this tough bitch persona so no one can mess with me anymore. I've made myself so hard so I don't feel anything.I've kept this up for a long time and it seemed to be working. But as time wore on, that ugly crying kid from my childhood started to break out of my facade. Life has been cruel to me since I was kid. I suffered bullying and verbal abuse from peers and even family. I am highly insecure but I mask it with fake confidence so they can't get to me. I've been keeping this up for so long and now I am tired. I just want to vanish. I want it all to stop. I want life to treat me a lil gentler. Just a little. It took to much away from me. My parents, my guardians, my friends, and even my cats. I feel so helpless everytime I lose one of them. I just want to give up. I live with my relatives. And they treat me as their ""strength"" and I am nor allowed to appear weak because I am their stronghold. They think of me as someone invincible and strong. I am none of those things. Inside I am still that weak crying kid all those years ago.

I would spend hours and hours talking to her on the phone, texting, and face time with her day after day that I got use to her always being there.

There was a time in my life where I was with someone for 10 years and we were in a polyamourus relationship/open relationship that I did try to look for someone for me but I never made a connection with anyone to actually meet up or do anything. I constantly reassure her that she was the only one I spoke to and that I only have eyes for her. She is monogamous which is fine with me because I honestly don't need to be in a polyamourus relationship/open relationship.

1186,Thiccredit,1619090841,1," 

21M. I can't put in anymore effort on this stupid life. I feel lonely everyday and I'm not sure where all this is going. A little about me:

My parents are from two socially opposing social communities so, because of all the prejudice I never met any of my relatives. So the three of us are the only people for each other. We were very rich when I was a toddler(only child of my parents) but due to some reasons my parents lost almost all of it. My mom never wanted me to face this so she sent me to the finest school, bought me all the finest things on par with my friends who happened to be pretty rich(we really struggled financially) and made sure I always felt good. I am fairly gifted when it comes to academics and luckily got into one of the finest universities in the world with a scholarship. I am going to graduate next month and stand well in place to get a great job. Despite doing all this I don't feel like anything has changed and with time I am only getting more miserable. Now I am even starting to hate my major.

My Dad is a selfish, lazy, insecure scumbag who never did anything for me neither emotionally nor financially and I have no clue why I love him. He works in a profession which one would assume pays well, but my dad rarely brings any money home(we are still at the same place financially 19 years later). He is extremely restrictive(doesn't even let us go into the backyard when he is home) and makes new rules everyday. He expects us to respect him when he does nothing respectable. All the people he knows think of him as a man of values but at home, he is a complete dictator(he doesn't abuse us physically but gets crazy when we disobey him). Yesterday, when I stood up and started questioning him and he shouted ""Will you hit me? Come on hit me!"", to make it look to the neighbors as if I was abusing him. This is just one of his antics where he plays the victim. Mom also suffers a lot because of him, but says she can't leave him because she loves him. Living with him under the same roof is getting tougher each day(especially after I came back home to attend uni virtually).

My personal life isn't going great either. I never had a girlfriend because I may have been too picky and rejected the ones that approached me, only to regret later. I am also left with no friends. The only genuine friends I had were the ones that I made in childhood and they are either getting married, pursuing further studies, have moved to a new place or have got jealous of me. The remaining ones are depressed. I am not socially awkward but I find it difficult to make a deep/genuine relationship with new people as the turn out to be selfish sooner or later. My friends at university were never really friends compared to my childhood buddies, so I can't share my feelings with them. I have never felt more lonely in life and the pandemic/ lock-down restrictions are not helping.

I don't want to work the job I can get, I feel like a well-paid laborer. I have no clue how I have grown this old without realizing anything. I am tired of sticking to the rules and having this monotonous life. I am now considering to runaway from home. '0'' tall, have pretty decent body(I work out and put effort in looking good) and quite a few people have mentioned that I look hot. I want to move to a new place, change my identity and start a new life as an escort/bartender. I will have enough money to lead a promiscuous, care-free life. I don't care even if die at 30 due to drug abuse. I don't have much time left in my youth.

I didn't want to discuss this with anybody else. I don't feel like I'm making a stupid decision as I have been thinking about this for a few months now and calculated how things might pan out. Please let me know if I am being really stupid.",lonely,I'm getting more and more hopeless day by day. I wish I could runaway.,2021-04-22 21:27:21

...then one day when she had to move to college and I visited her there, everything changed for the worse...and we broke up because I wasn't attending to her needs. Fair.

I mostly have a good sense of humor, I am a good comedian, song writing and poetic guy but mostly because I was too shy I had no one in my life.
That all changed last April.
When the universe pressed this giant pause button, i met someone on a cold night.
This girl, and me immediately clicked, we had really really good chemistry. We literally used to talk 24*7 all day. So much as since this girl was studying her post graduation, she had to ghost me because she and were just too addicted to each other.
But she came back after 2 days and we resumed our story, our chemistry.
Fast forward a year, she was too attached to me that she was struggling about her feelings, and since she js about to go to another country, I asked her out.
She said no because she didnt want to hurt her and me when she leaves this great chemistry.
I fucked up, asked her out again, we had a ugly fight and now it's all over. Everything is over.

I honestly wish I had siblings that could have helped me out with all the life problems that comes with being an adult because I know they would have been much easier to deal with if I had any. But I don't. So instead of focusing on the negatives, I'm trying to look at the positives that come with being an only child.

Yeah it sucks when things get too difficult but at least I don't have to worry about dealing with sibling-related issues that could very well disrupt my life. A part of me is glad that I don't have any because I won't have to worry about their lives and they won't have to worry about mine. Plus, I don't have to worry about stuff like buying them gifts for their birthdays or having to spend the holidays with them when I just wanna be alone. So yeah, there's that.

So it ain't all bad. Just gotta look at the positives. Because hey, looking at the positives can help in so many other aspects of life so why can't it help here? I know sometimes it's really difficult to do so but it beats the alternative of allowing sadness and emptiness to take over.

Oh, I also made something for all my fellow only children. Hopefully it helps in further showing the ups of being an only child.

I'm 18, trans-female (she/her), and Canadian.

I love cats (but I own two dogs :c), The Office, B99,  Parks and Rec, chill music, talking to people, and playing games such as Apex, Siege, Rust, VRChat, and Pavlov.

I'm very lonely &amp; I want to find genuine people who will somehow genuinely like me and want to hangout, talk to me and shit. I'm super insecure, weird, sad, and awkward and that drives a lot of people off maybe? But I'm human, believe it or not.

I can be shy and withdrawn (not talkative) especially when I first meet people, and I do forget to reply sometimes but it's not usually intentional. I always want to talk, I'm very dependent on people and I'm an extrovert.

I'll try my best, but I'm often in a bad mood so I'm sorry if I do poorly.  I have trouble investing myself into and trusting ppl often, because of shit that I've dealt with.

So to give some backstory, I‚Äôve never had a significant other. I‚Äôve had a few crushes, and they‚Äôve usually lasted pretty long. One even lasted for like 6 years, which would be almost half of my life. Of course, they‚Äôve all ended in me still being as alone as I am now. (Luckily I‚Äôm still friends w/them). Whenever I‚Äôm in a crush, I spend all of my time on just making them happy and laugh. I‚Äôve gone from making scavenger hunts across to school to making strange music videos, and they all end negativity.

Anyway, back to the point. My friends have been dating for about a year now, and their Anniversary is tomorrow (4/21), and that is around the time I was last rejected. And they keep talking about it all the time. Now, I‚Äôm happy for them of course, but the thing is my last crush rejected me around the same time to 2 of them got together. So it just feels life just keeps hitting me in the face. Idk, it feels nice to vent tho. I would be FaceTiming them right now, but they‚Äôve been FaceTiming together 1 on 1 instead of the three of us. And they keep saying how I‚Äôm gonna find someone eventually, but I just don‚Äôt have any confidence or anything anyone wants.

I might not respond right away since I made a fake reddit account to post this and it is linked to an email I do not use every day. I am going to try and check on this post every day or so. I hope at least one or two people see this. 

I am a 16 year old male junior in high school. I come from an upper-class family and I go to one of the best private schools in the country. I have realized over the past few years that I do not have ""real"" friends. I can't think of a single person in my fucking life that actually cares about me. I have two ""friends"" who I have known for over ten years now who kind of care about me, but I only talk to them a few times in an entire month (we all go to different schools and are busy with our own crap). In school, I have five to ten ""friends."" But recently, I have realized they are all fake. I always have helped people in my life. Always. If anyone needs help and I can do something about it, I stop what I am doing to respond. But when I ask for something from anyone, I'll get a response 2 hours later. Even if I text my ""best friend,"" something as simple as ""you got a lot of homework tonight?"" the majority of the time, he will not even respond to me for hours- if not till the next day. When he finally responds to me, I reply instantly.  Another thing is that I always remeber things about people (and I have a shit memory). But people always forget about me. I began to question my other friendships. After analyzing them, I have felt that I have no one in my life. All my other friends have other people that they hang out with and get along with. In my life, there is nobody who I can go to and talk to openly about how I have felt like shit. There is nobody who I can tell that I almost cry every night thinking about how badly I wish I had ""real friends."" Nobody that would care enough to ask me how my day was. Nobody who I can go to who would care enough to listen to what I had to say without interrupting me. If I mention even the smallest problem that I am facing to any one of my friends (even the two that I have known for 10 years), I will legit get a response saying ""damn"" or ""oof."" When I see this, it litterly breaks my heart. I would do so much so anyone- whether I know them or not. And this is what I get? I am pretty sure that I am depressed and this is not something that I would feel comfortable talking about in front of my parents about. Let me tell you, my parents don't help one bit with my stress. In fact, I feel like my parents do not even care about what I have to say sometimes. For instance, I trade stocks. I have been doing it for several months now and I really enjoy finance and business. this is something that I want to do in college and in my life. My mom will ask me like ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS how my stocks are doing. They do not support me in anything that I do. it's funny because i know my mom knows that I am not supported, and she doesn't do shit about it. I clearly remeber about a year ago my mom talking to a guest we had at our house and she was telling them how I am not really supported in things I want to do. Nothing. Nobody supports me in anything. This is why i feel alone. I want to rise up and i have plans to become one of the greatest people in this world, but nobody is there to help me get up. They put so much fucking pressure on me to do well in school so I can go to a good college. I have really good grades coming from my school. I do everything they want! I help them too with whatever. I just feel like no one cares about me. It's even worse for me because I am soft. I have been a ""soft"" boy all my life. I cry easily. If someone insults me, it sincerely hurts me.  I really wish I had someone who I could talk to. My parents probably think I am fine- but i am not. They do not understand how much damage  them ignoring me all the time has done to me. or they will say things about me and I will over hear it. The shit I hear or find out about really fucking hurts me. I feel like I am alone in my battle and I just want someone to actually care about me for once. Someone to ""return a favor."" I own so many materialistic things in my life, but that really has taught me that money does not buy happiness. My life is a representation of that. I would give up everything I have in my possession to feel happy. I just don't fucking care about any of that shit. I just want real friends. I just want someone to hug me.

He also doesn't want to paint, take a walk, work on jewelry, work on leather crafts, read stories that I write, have sex (his libido is very very low compared to mine), play various card games, or anything else hw used to do.

I know he has some depression he absolutely refuses to get help for and I'm reasonably sure he isn't doing anything behind my back. He just seems happy treating me like a plant or statue.

I'm looking for one to ? people to exchange occasional emails with. You can be anyone in any country, just as long as we are able to communicate and share at least one or two interests and seem to jive well together. Three years ago, I stumbled upon a long term penpal from my home country that my family immigrated from 150+ years ago and we exchanged information and pictures about where we were from, daily life, interests, etc. They even went to my ancestor's home town and got pictures of the home that my family left to immigrate to the USA! It was great - I had so much enjoyment emailing back and forth with them! But, they recently became involved with a new companion that didn't like the idea of them penpalling as often as they did and had them stop. I really miss the communication and learning about life in a different area, so, that's why I'm here.

Me; Early retired a few years ago from a small commercial building construction / remodeling business. 30+ years experience owning / operating business with approximately 10 employees. I live in the central USA and my wife and I are eager to move to the foothills area around Ft. Collins, CO in a couple years to be closer to family after she retires.

Interests; 50yo+ physical fitness, resistance training, hiking, biking, Colorado and it's mountains, early and late model muscle cars and performance modifications (specifically Ford Mustang), Index investing, Drones, DSLR photography (mainly landscape and a little astrophotography) and metal detecting. Recently, I've gotten very interested in 360 photography (Insta360 OneX) and action camera video (GoPro Hero8 and Insta360 Go2).

But my parents weren't that comfortable being close. They are very much in a marriage that isn't about love. They're together because of finances and at this point they just know they're stuck with one another. There was very little love or romance expressed between them. And very little affection or expressed love towards me. I have never been able to talk to either of them about personal feelings or experiences.

I am very much a product of my raising. I have never had a relationship last longer than a few months. I'm not romantic. I'm not great with feelings or expressing them correctly. I have never been able to feel attachment to anyone. I just never feel good enough or worthy enough for a relationship like that. I'm used to what I know, and what I know is a terrible model for a relationship.

I also can't use people. I can't even use them to gain experience dating. I'd feel terrible if I was the reason someone was messed up and started messing up other people because of it.

I just found out recently that, they really did that on purpose. They didn‚Äôt respond to me but they responded to other people.

It‚Äôs hard to convince myself when we used to be so close and of course, I always thought that they would change the way they were before.

1241,UcfStudent117,1619045007,1,"Hello! I am a student at the University of Central Florida and I am needing to do primary research for my composition 2 class. The topic I have been studying all semester is loneliness, something I have personally experienced for a good chunk of my life. Thus, I believe loneliness to be at the forefront of issues we should address as a society today. For most of the semester, I have been looking at research articles focusing more on objective facts of loneliness which I feel goes against the very nature of loneliness being the subjective lack of social support. So, I have come to all of you.¬†

Whether you have or are currently suffering from any form of loneliness, I would humbly ask you to partake in an interview for my primary research. This interview will be through text with pre-written questions, so no face-to-face interview, and will ask a variety of questions pertaining to your perception of loneliness within your life. This research will then be used to write a research article detailing my findings and any patterns I may see within the interviews I acquire; this information could be sensitive and thus you may include to opt out any information you do not want in there at your discretion. Going into detail is key, and thus could be related to personal aspects of your life.¬†

My main goal is to treat this information and any interviewee with the utmost respect due to the possible sensitivity of the information, so if you have any questions specific to your answers and how they will be used you may ask. Though once the final draft for the research article is submitted, I will no longer be able to make any more changes. Follow-up questions may be asked at a later date, and this form will close within the next few days. Thank you for reading, and I hope you may participate in my research!

Here we go‚Ä¶.

I think that I can safely say that I have the best job in the world.

I‚Äôm an eGirl on a site that some of you may not heard of. On this site, one can sell his/her spare time and play games with others. That may not sound like an actual job, mostly because of how the phrase ‚ÄúeGirl‚Äù is thought of. But it has definitely changed my life.

I‚Äôve been able to meet a bunch of new people and build a group of friends and a community that I am proud of. At this point, the money that I make doing it is just a bonus. It‚Äôs really the experiences that matter.

But recently, something happened that might change things, and I don‚Äôt know if it will be for the better.

I fell in love with one of my clients.

I know that its probably an unspoken eGirl rule to get attached to any of your followers, but I can‚Äôt help how I feel.

It started out innocent enough. I was just doing my job, playing games with a guy that paid for my services. Like a lot of my other clients, we had a lot in common. I thought that I had made another friend for sure. He would constantly give me tips and he would always talk about my ‚Äúlovely voice‚Äù, which is what made him buy my services in the first place. 

But gradually, the dynamic shifted. I barely realized it at first, but we started flirting back and forth. Not in big, overt ways. But in small, seemingly insignificant bursts. We would tell jokes that had undertones of something more.

It got to the point where my heart fluttered when I saw that he had booked some of my time. Then, it even evolved to playing games together off the clock. 

Things never went far. I think both of us are hesitant about it. But we did get to know each other a lot better. Not just our likes and dislikes, but our worries and fears and dreams and goals. We became closer than the confines of our original meetings intended us to be.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Flirting with or even dating a client is frowned upon, but not strictly against the rules. However, there is something else that is stopping me from allowing things to go any further.

My client has a family. A wife. A kid.

I have never been so torn in my life. I don‚Äôt want to be a side chick, but neither can I ignore the feelings that have blossomed for him. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should continue on as we are now, or if I should back off, or go all in. It feels like my heart and mind are at war with each other.

Now, in the same moment that my heart flutters when I hear his voice, my mind tells me that what I am doing is wrong.

I lost most of my hobbies and now small things are what makes me happy, for example I go to a fast-food restaurant, get my favourite stuff and I feel so great after eating sth that most people would describe as junk food.
I have no real interests but it's okay, I rarely get bored..
I'm not depressed, loneliness seems like a normal thing to me now. 
I have some goals in life, so my life isn't totally pointless, I'd say..
It's a bit striking to me how different everyone else is, when I hear my peers talking (I'm 19) I feel like an alien from another planet, I simply don't understand their slang and what they're talking about.
For me it's kinda frustrating that I'll have to deal with people in the future in some ways, hope I'll be able to avoid it tho. I know that everyone would say I'm boring, dull etc but I don't care.

Is empathy that difficult to have ? I used to go through needs as well. At the end of each day I wondered how I have survived. Cuz the thought of suicide was really a thing. I tried it sometimes, but I failed at all of them. Just like in many other countries, assisted suicide is illegal and I‚Äôve ready that where it‚Äôs legal, it‚Äôs only allowed for terminally ill patients and also you can‚Äôt have any kind of mental disorder (what is not my case). Here I am: almost 31yo, poor, unhappy, feeling like dying but too coward to pull a trigger to end my suffering. Really, it hurts.

I'm 35, single and I can't say I have friends that I really feel connected to. Most people I know seem rather negative or as if they only like me for doing them favours but don't seem to be interested in who I actually am which makes me feel pretty unimportant meanwhile. I rarely talk about myself anymore as no one seems to care anyway.

I just so long for someone to love and get me just the way I am, I miss sharing fun and interesting stuff with a like minded person. And the pandemic makes all of it even worse... 

I still try to get on with it as I know there are people who are far worse off than I am and maybe I'll be lucky again. I had to promise my friend to stay strong but I'm just terribly sad and I can't imagine to be that alone for the rest of my life.

I just am not clicking with anyone and the people that I do 'click' with for a mere moment usually turns out to be some virgin simp that only want to talk to me from something that ISNT friendship. 

I'm also sick of the amount of times I've tried to start a friendship through this subreddit and literally barely anyone after a day bothers to continue the conversation, like what the actual fuck. People sit and complain about being lonely but don't even bother making an effort to be friends.

1254,OppsFearMe,1619036024,1,"About six months ago, I had the most amazing experience in my 34 years of life on this earth. A beautiful girl who was always ‚Äújust a friend‚Äù bravely admitted she had feelings for me. We had an amazing conversation. I told her I felt the same way about her. We talked about our feelings. We made love. Nothing was weird. I was maybe the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. Literally, all my life I have searched for a meaningful romantic relationship with someone like her. She is so smart, funny, kind...she‚Äôs such a great a person. So perfect. And totally my type. This was likely the best thing that had ever happened to me. It was like a scene from a movie where the guy finally gets the girl. It literally felt like the K-Ci and JoJo song... ‚Äúall my life, I prayed for someone like you...‚Äù

And then fast forward a few months... it all went to shit.  The short version is she gave me the classic line she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready to date anyone‚Äù and we are back to being ‚Äújust friends‚Äù. And now I get to play the mental ‚Äúwhat did I do to screw this up‚Äù game, over and over again in my head. Healthy, I know. 

I get attraction isn‚Äôt always a choice. I get people can feel one way one day and then totally different the next. But God, I am so fucking tired of looking for someone. 

I have only been in short lived ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù like this one that never work out. Nothing long term. Only meaningless occasional casual sex here and there, and girls who strung me along but never wanted to get serious and commit to anything with me. I‚Äôve never had a girl who acknowledged we were in a legitimate relationship and ‚Äúgirlfriend and boyfriend‚Äù.  That feels so pathetic to admit at age 34. 

I‚Äôm trying to look within and work on myself, to be the best version of myself I can possibly be, but it is so fucking exhausting sometimes. Especially always going it alone.

I want a romantic connection, intimacy, and all the things that come with a serious relationship. I‚Äôm so tired of being alone.

Allow me to introduce myself, my friends call me Jayce. I'm 35, bisexual, serving time for second degreemurder and expected to be released sometime in 2028 with good time. I‚Äôm looking to meet some new friends and learn more about as many different cultures, lifestyles, and perspectives as possible, including yours! I am tall, witty, educated, confident, spontaneous, open-minded, and nonjudgmental. I‚Äôm open to the unexpected possibilities of life. I‚Äôm searching for meaningful and lasting friendships!!

Since becoming incarcerated in the Washington State D.O.C., I‚Äôve furthered my education with adult continuing education (ACE) classes, self-improvement classes such as anger management and drug and alcohol treatment programs, as well as several cognitive behavioral therapy programs. I try to stay busy through various activities such as tutoring other prisoners for their GED, teaching ACE classes to other prisoners, assisting other prisoners with legal work such as helping them file their appeals as well as writing to their attorneys and the courts. However, I‚Äôd much rather spend my time corresponding with you! If you‚Äôre looking for someone who will listen to you, talk to you, email you, write you and that will dedicate time for You and Only you, then look no further!

I believe true friendship should be built on trust, respect, honesty, appreciation, and sincerity. I believe in being honest and upfront at all times, while also living a life of transparency, authenticity, and integrity. So if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôd like to know, please feel free to ask. Nothing is off limits!

I enjoy staying active and like being outdoors. I like hiking, swimming, camping and bicycling. I love to travel and explore new and exciting places while capturing the moments with my camera. Music is very therapeutic for me. I love most genres with few exceptions. It really just depends on what I‚Äôm in the mood to hear.

I've wrestled with myself, convinced myself that there must be something wrong with me and that's why I've never had someone special. I had to be wrong. I had to be ugly. I had to be not good enough. I had to be the bad guy.

But what bad guy puts up his mother and brother in his house, gives them a place to live and a place to get back on their feet? What bad guy would give of himself to help people when they  need it? Is it wrong to expect that if you do good that good be done to you? Am I a truly ugly person for having loved unconditionally because it's my nature? 

I have suffered and worked hard in my life, to the point where I have damaged my physical and mental health, and was then told by the world that no, I hadn't gone far enough, hadn't been good enough. 

It's not me who is wrong. The world is wrong. And I'm sick of being held to standards that keep shifting just as I am about to reach them. Sick of the goal line being moved back as I'm close to the finish. And I'm sick of feeling like a loser just because no one in this fucking bullshit world ever saw what was worthwhile in me. Never saw what I could give. Took me for granted. 

I'm alone, but to be honest if the world has no one truly capable of seeing what a gift I could be if someone would just open up to me and just give me a chance, then it's their fault and the world's fault for cultivating such blind fools. And I'd rather stay alone at that rate. I'm tired of being miserable for being alone just because the world continues to fail me. Even when I try to put my best in.

my girlfriend had helped me through a lot. i met her when i was at my absolute lowest and she has been nothing but perfect to me. yesterday she decided it was best to split for a while, rightfully so, i have just struggled realizing it let alone coming to terms with it. i see her today. we are both seniors in high school and i know we only have a couple months till graduation but it is still very rough.

i dont feel comfortable talking to her about myself right now, and i rarely open up to others about the more personal and intimate details, so i will share them to strangers. i have ate one meal in the last two days (since everything came up). i smoked a bit more than half a pack of cigs in that same time, when i had only had two in the last 2 years (since i quit, i had been smoking for a month in lebanon) i cut yesterday for the first time. i vomit from anxiety. i cannot trust myself, especially in a relationship. i cannot trust friends. i just feel empty and alone. i flip between blaming my friends for not even trying to explain to me how they feel to blaming myself for being a bad friend, which i am. i am a bad friend, a bad boyfriend, and a bad person. in the end, i am okay being alone. i will just work on art. but i just dont know what to do or feel.",lonely,ive lost a lot,2021-04-22 02:20:12
1280,micqdf,1619020798,1,"so I'm 23M, I moved away to go to uni nearly 2 years ago, the main reason I moved was to get away from my parents. 

I had 2 friends near the city I moved to (when I moved here I was dating a girl but that fell apart when she moved away) I had been a chef for like 4 years before I moved and you don't get much of social life as a chef and I made a lot of friends in work but they are work friends, we never see each other outside of work (only exceptions were when they go to the pub after work but I hate going out drinking, it seems that's what everyone does these days when it comes to being social).

&amp;#x200B;

When I started uni I made a small handful of friends, we are not like the best of friends but we talk quite a bit and would hang out in uni, now with covid, we have not been into uni in person for like a year now, Its impossible to make friends, I did online german course recently and I became friends with a small handful of people but it just goes nowhere, one girl I became good friends never replies anymore, her social life has picked back up (no regards for covid restrictions at the time) and as such is never online.

the others I spoke to on the course just don't seem interested in being social, I created a discord for everyone but no one uses it.

like, I get on with so many people I meet but when it comes to in-person friendships (like ones I can meet up with) they just go nowhere like all people want to do is go out drinking and to me, that's so dull, as so every friendship I have either dies out or I stop because they aren't good people (happens a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

making friends is so hard here, my ex started uni at the same time as me but in a different country, she has made loads of friends (also no regards to covid restrictions) and I sometimes wonder if it's a cultural thing or because she's a girl, we are both doing a similar course (computing-related) she instantly got talking to loads of guys and made lots of friends while I got nowhere with the people I met, they were all very anti social and was hard to get them to talk, after a couple of weeks they all formed little social groups and would never go out of these groups, they might talk to me in the lessons but didn't care outside, would just go back to there little social groups, I have had it in work with girls that where new would avoid me for a few weeks until they realised I wasn't gonna harm them (at least that's how it felt).

&amp;#x200B;

so I got a call from my dad today, he has booked this little weekend holiday for us on my birthday, never asked if I was interested, just booked it then rang to let me know, I just went with it and just said ok but I don't want to go, to them its a nice idea to spend time together and have a break, to me it means sitting around all weekend feeling extremely uncomfortable being around them with nothing to do.

They seem to think I'm depressed living on my own and that they hardly hear from me, but what they don't realise is I am happier on my own than spending time with them, I am happy with my day to day life atm, I don't need a break for anything, I feel like they booked this for themselves, I wish I had real friends or maybe a gf to spend my birthday with but I don't, and as such, I don't care about celebrating my birthday, for the last few years I have always felt like my parents use my birthday as an excuse for them to do what they want, I go along with things just to keep the peace.",lonely,rather be alone for my birthday then spend it with my parents,2021-04-22 01:59:58

1285,arkticturtle,1619014617,1,"Disclaimer: I've gotten carried away empathizing with the villain here. Don't take any of this as my true ideas. It's just a train of thought that I totally get and seeing it clearly helps me to not fall into it.

I know I do. Usually they are hurt people hurting people. Nobody care about them. Nobody thinks to pray for the devil. They are people who are brought up on pain. It's all they know. And if the world has abandoned them and cursed them to a life or misery with no hope in sight then I can completel see them wanting to take this out on the world.

How many people saw their suffering and added to it? How many ""good"" people ignored them and made it worse? I'm not saying it's anyone's responsibility to do anything. Maybe it is but that isn't what I'm getting at right now. Evil is ignorance and a lack of love. Happiness is ignorance and a gift of good fortune.

But if you've tried your hand at healing and tried your hand at doing the ""right"" thing and it leads to nothing or more just more suffering then what do you do? Will people ever understand unless dragged down to your level? Why should those privileged people have a right to happiness when your right to happiness is perpetually violated by mind patterns ingrained into your psyche since birth? Patterns that have been handed down and intensified by previous generations with each iteration. Their happiness is an offense to the existence of the villain who lives in pain. Maybe if others hurt like I do then I'll have a chance at empathy.

What's even the point of being moral if it just brings you pain? To make others happy? Why should I be nothing more than a mechanism for the happiness of others? To be used. To be a tool for those more blessed than I to feel more blessed. They should know just what they have and just what they've been lucky to miss out on.

Oh and I know that there are an uncountable many who suffer more than I. Why not heal them? Shouldn't I have empathy for those people? Aren't I a hypocrite? Yes. How can I manage the suffering of others if I can not even manage my own? But if you bring others down to your level then how do you expect to receive empathy if they'll be too broken to give it? That's true. Hopefully there would be those strong enough, stronger than I, who can push forward to healing and help me. 

At the very least I won't have to watch people be happy. Part of me enjoyed the suffering brought to people via the effects that Covid had the world. Lockdown got ya down? Hahahahaha. Every day of my life might as well been a pandemic. Nothing has changed in my life this past year. People cry and complain because they've gotta go through a year of what I go through every day. But they will be none the wiser because their condition is temporary while mine is eternal. Stuck in time as I always am.

If I am unable to change then the only option is to change others. If I can produce no goodness without hurting myself and the light blinds me then I may as well go the easy route of doing what I know - spreading suffering and pain. At least then I'll know that I exist. That I am real. At least then those living in blissful ignorance will be enlightened.

Why not just end my own life at that point and be done with it? As if you don't fear death. Why wouldn't I fear death? It is a great unknown and a commitment to that unknown. Survival instincts are a bitch too. Of course my mind plagues me with a long list of ""what ifs"" that prevents action. But wouldn't living a life of hurting others only add to your sin and guilt? Aren't you just as bad as those who hurt you? I said earlier I had given up on goodness as it has done no good for me.

Life without intimacy and sincerity aren't worth living. And all I've known is distance and disingenuousness. Maybe I should become a scammer of a sorts and prey on people for money. Money can buy me whatever I want. And I've no hope at attaining that which money or power cannot get me. Might as well go that route then. Exploit others for my own gain. Humans may be social animals but they are selfish creatures.

How can I expect any sort of goodness to come my way with a view like that? Goodness didn't come my way even before I had that view. Life is a pattern of being neutral enough to be productive at work and then falling into the void as soon as I clock off. The sounds of work fade as I walk out the door into the persistent silence of my life. Some noise would be nice. Any noise.

1307,obviousBever,1619001565,1,"Truth be told all i have ever known is loneliness. It's not just a passing emotion. It's a state of being. From early on on as a child I've felt it. Even in my most deepest and closes relationships and friendship I've felt it. I care deeply for my family, my brothers, my sister, my friend. But I've never had a place I've felt like i  belonged in this world and they only know or see a fraction of me. 

No one can or has seen the real me ever. I assume we all feel this on some level as human being. It is apart of the humam condition and perhaps it maybe a caveat of it to assume it can't be filled. But i imagine some must have at least once met their equal. 

But i truly feel as if no one has ever even touched the surface or got close to understanding the depth, the complexity, the nuisance, the magnitude of myself. It is beyond thier grasp. It's a bug or feature of my own uniqueness. Yet it is one of the most basic things all humans desire is to be understood, to be known, to belong. 

All i know is this and there are no words, no connection, no conversation, no ideals that could bridge the gap of this void.  Loneliness is a state of being i have accepted.",lonely,All i know is this,2021-04-21 20:39:25

People like you never deserve a girlfriend or someone who loves you and respect you equally

I meet a girl sometimes before everything is going great between us and when ever she wants me I am there but one day on my birthday party I think I have to tell her my feelings and confess that I love you

I hosted a party first time in my life and it's going great but when I saw that she is Missing I started to find her and found her with my friend in my bedroom I was heartbroken not because they do this . Just because my friend knows everything and after that he did this they are having fun on my bed I ended the party and throw everyone out of my house with their gift before my cake cutting i Don't lie to you but I cried full night feeling dead from inside. Next morning my phone is blowing with calls and texts I didn't reply single one when I get to my collage they both approach me and then she was saying I am sorry I didn't know you love me I like you too and all shit my friend says sorry we are drunk and that happened in that moment on that day I lost everything my only friend and my love

I guess my experience of studying abroad has actually made me very conscious about myself, that i was always lonely, it just hit me that i was giving my time to my friends cause i was afraid of being lonely, cause i was dependent on my emotion onto others. But after realizing that i can be independent on sustaining my own emotion without relying on others, I am now prefer being alone most of the time. Like seriously, before the pandemic hit, i was a social butterfly, a friendly and approachable guy. I welcomed everyone, i loved everyone. Now, I am not active on social media anymore, i go out of the house once a week and walk alone, i play video games and watch netflix, i love being alone now. 

I realized that I hate having social interaction cause it comes with drama. Yeah drama are part of the spices of life and makes life interesting, but no. Im done with that. I might be acting this way cause i finally be able to be myself in a foreign country, no expectation, no pressure.

1321,Tumbleweed_Intrepid,1618989538,1,"Let me start this off with saying I'm 20 never had a gf. Before you ask no I'm not fat and yes I do take showers. Now that's out of the way I can start by saying I've never really had any real attention from girls that didn't go past friendship. I've had my fair share of female friends throughout my years so I don't think I'm coming off as creepy. Anyway I don't wanna turn this post into me whining about how I've never had a gf cause I've already posted about it at least a million times by now.

Point is how can I not feel desperate and self conscious about myself given my situation? Think about it this way, if you were playing basketball and you airballed a bunch of 3 pointers would you feel confident in your jumpshot? Hell no so I don't understand how someone like me is supposed to be fucking confident with girls if every single time I try to find one it ends in failure. Out of all the people I know I only know two people who have never had a gf but both of them has had sex. As far as I know I'm literally the last person I know to never have sex. How am I not supposed to feel desperate about that? Of fucking course I'm gonna be desperate. I'll take anyone at this point other than fat girls and by fat I mean landwhale status I don't mind if they are a little on the bigger side. I find 80-90% girls my age attractive. So the problem definitely isn't my standards being too high.

The question I have is how can I not help but feel desperate and self conscious about my situation? I know those are the two things girls hate the most for whatever reason. I don't really understand why those two things in particular tick off girls so badly? We all have our problems and demons we struggle with. We just have to accept people for who they are. I just wish they were more understanding. I just hate it when people just say ""be more confident"" or ""don't let it get to you so much."" Like you really think it's that easy. I can't just flip a switch and then tune out all the negative thoughts. You don't think I don't already know my lack of confidence is causing problems? I can't just pull confidence out of my ass I would have done that a long time ago if that were the case. If girls love confidence and high self esteem the most which I have neither then are guys like me meant to be alone forever? It is just a big cycle of being turned down and then losing confidence until eventually I lose the confidence to even approach girls in the first place.

If I tried to feel, then I wouldn't get up in the morning. You think it's like a choice, I chose to have no friends, I chose to spend my days alone, I chose to not talk to people. No buddy, you see me showing up to life all the time, not because I don't need people (but honestly the shit I did alone without any support at all when I could have quit is not common) but I still had to live my life despite not having people, lol. I ate alone for maybe 2 years, and even longer from childhood because I kind of have to, if I want to eat. You can say it's a choice since there was no one in my life, but I still have to eat, so the next time you see me there alone, don't make a joke about me not having friends. That ruined me and it hurt so much, maybe try to understand how it came to be rather than assuming I 'chose it'. Jesus Christ who the fuck would choose that? Just because I do shit with my life and I keep showing up doesn't mean I chose it. I'm showing up because nothing changed either way. I went to therapy multiple times and I showed up in life and there wasn't a fix. I stopped showing up and I just felt worse. Here, I do feel a couple things. When I do shit, or I'm listening to good stuff, I feel motivated, and angry in a righteous way. It's based of 'who the fuck's gonna show up, who the fuck is still showing up-- I am'. And when I share in groups I get that social connection and feel much better. 

But what led up to it? We don't know. I feel like I paid my dues in getting support, reaching out, whatever, it was never 'good enough'. I didn't even have an identity, I didn't know what my personality was, and if I did, I would want to change it. I had no sense of self or there was nothing for people to relate to or I just couldn't have them see me, having someone know me would only open up for hurt. I didn't get to see what good there is since all I can see are how people can hurt me. 

I didn't have any friends for like 2 years, and I don't think I *ever* had real ones. I clearly didn't like it though I might write like I do. I didn't want anyone to know, or at least not to observe how I never go out or never talk socially, but sure I do things for myself but I'm never with people. In college, when everyone was surrounded or had a fucker to turn to, I had absolutely no one, for whatever mix of stupid factors-- shyness, anxiety, temperament, environment, personality, whatever the fuck it was I'll tell you maybe it looks like a choice and maybe haha it actually is a choice but really no one in a right mind chooses to go on alone like this.

1346,chewybacbacca,1618974913,1,"So lately I've(21, F) been visiting Jules's(not her real name) Facebook page more often than usual(we're FB friends) and have been thinking about her more than usual.

The story starts off in 7th grade. Me and Jules went to the same middle school and didn't have a class together until 7th grade. The most memorable class we had together was English. In this English class, our teacher made us write a journal entry at the beginning of every class and we could read them out loud if we wanted to. Jules was probably the best writer in the class. I may have been #2. Her journals were always so haunting, yet written so well. The whole class would stop in their tracks to listen to her journals the same way people stop in their tracks to notice a breeze on a particularly sultry evening or notice a sunset while driving home. I thought Jules was so cool. She looked cool, was kind, funny, and made everyone laugh. The thing is, she didn't even have a dark personality even though you may not have been able to guess that at first glance or if you listened to her journals. (A word she used often in her journals was ""agony"") She had such a wild spirit, but deep down inside I always wondered if she herself ever felt agony like the characters in her journal. Back then, I wanted to be friends with her so bad but I was never cool enough. We probably hardly ever talked, but her writing prowess inspired me each and every class to write the best work I'd ever written. I wanted her to notice me. I don't know if she ever did, but I do remember she wrote something kind to me on this index card on our last day of 7th grade(our teacher made us write letters to our classmates. it didn't have to be everyone). 

During the summer after 8th grade year when we were both heading to different high schools, she made a brief FB post saying she was gay. I thought, once again, she was exuding all of the energies of a free spirit. If she cared what people thought of her, I couldn't tell. I was still in the closet then and didn't see myself coming out. I can't say she inspired me to come out but it was a great experience seeing someone I respected so much be the first girl I knew to come out as lesbian. To this day, I don't know whether I had/have a crush on her or would just like to be her friend. She currently lives in my city, but I'm afraid of messing up this image of her in my head if I reach out. I'm aware this sounds pathetic, but I'm just not as cool as her. I'm afraid I'll bore her away due to my introversion. Sometimes I imagine both of us being published one day and reading each other's works. She's currently in college majoring in Creative Writing. I wish more than anything to read the works she's written recently, but I don't see myself reaching out to her. I just don't think I'm cool enough for her. I remember growing up hating my personality. I hated that I was so reserved. I hated that I wasn't the life of the party. I hated that I was so insecure and had such a miserable home life. I hated the fact I missed out on so many friendships and experiences due to me being so shy and insecure. 

Yeah, so that's the gist of what I've been feeling lately. I feel like I've improved a lot since middle school, but I always feel this sense of loss when I realize what I could've had. Jules continues to inspire me to this day and I don't think she ever realized just how much she inspired me. The thing is, it's unlikely she ever thinks of me so these feelings are likely unrequited.",lonely,"I keep thinking about this girl from middle school, who I never got a chance to be friends with but who continues to inspire me to this day",2021-04-21 13:15:13

I've been alone for 22 years after having been disowned from my family for being gay. I grew up in an orthodox Jewish family (I'm still a practicing orthodox Jew today). No more than my family members do I sympathize with myself for being gay: it's simply impossible for me to see myself with another man. So many people have told me to ""let go of the feelings and connect with who you really are."" But being gay is most certainly not who I am. It's something I've struggled with since I was 12, knowing since then that an ideal, normal, perfect future was not a guarantee for me, and almost completely out of the question.

I should mention that ""on paper"" I'm not doing too bad -- I hold a good position at my company, I get payed well, I'm happy my job and reasonably well-liked there, and I live in a nice house. But ""on paper"" isn't everything: I'm mentally destroying myself. If only I could find a way to either accept the fact that I'm gay or something else to push me over the hump of being a depressed 40 year old kiss-less virgin I'd probably be a lot happier.

   This is a hard post to make but I really feel like I need to come clean. I can't tell anyone this in real life because, well, that's how you lose friends and my circle is already small as is. I made a friend online and may have accidentally developed feelings for someone I haven't even met in real life, but she rejected me. We're good friends now, thank God -- but I know we're on borrowed time till she meets a guy and he'll take her from me. Why am I telling you this?

&amp;#x200B;

... Good question. I feel like if I put it into words it might help take the sting away. Like the title says, I've been alone my whole life. It doesn't help that I'm a short male and statistically proven to be unattractive, but what **really** doesn't help is when I see all my friends from high school already married with friends they made all the way back in 2014 and it's mind boggling.

&amp;#x200B;

I think what's even worse is that no matter what I do to better myself it's always for nothing. I lost weight -- then gained it back. I started exercising and bulking up. Did that help? No.. But I did feel good for a week or so. I got a new hairstyle only to be told by nearly **every** girl I meet ""I lIKe guYs WiTH LOnG HaIR"" after I cut all my hair off. It's like you can't win. After all this I likewise also get told ""Well No WoNdER Why YOu'rE ALone, yOU'rE AlwaYS sO NEgATIvE!""

&amp;#x200B;

This road has been so long and winding... Not to mention arduous. What made it worse is that I had to walk it alone and that's just shitty. Then again, I don't think I need to explain that feeling to everyone here.

Step 2: reach out to them with gentle words such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm struggling‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need some encouragement‚Äù words like depression, anxiety, and loneliness scare people away usually.
Step 3: figure out who is receptive to you,and find the right people. Let the other people go, don‚Äôt be mean, be gentle.
Step 4: after talking, schedule another talk with that friend later that week or early next week.
Step 5: use texting at first then slowly work your way to scheduling phone calls once a week.
Step 6: try to build a rotation of 3-5 people you can talk to and spread them out throughout the week. Talking to a different person each day.

This morning, we're having a decent conversation while he's at the dentist when he tells me ""my other half doesn't like you..."" 

Confused, I asked him what the hell he was talking about. Evidently he has a boyfriend who won't accept the fact that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. I calm him down and tell him his options on what he can do in bad-case scenarios and what he should do in case he gets violent. 

A while passes by and we're both calmed down again, and I make a joke saying ""I stole your phone lol"" to which he just freaks out and says ""And \[his boyfriend's name\] just stole me"" 

I proceed to ask him what the fuck was he talking about, but he blocked me then and there, left all our common groups, and that was it. He was gone again. 

I have no idea where to start... all day he was telling me he was mine and wouldn't go anywhere again, would never let anything get between us and he wouldn't take him away from me.

I'm haunted by the fact that whenever, if ever, I'll get to have this kind of interactions with someone I, a fully grown adult, will have to explain to them that i don't know what I'm doing. That I've never even given one kiss in my entire existence. 

Which only serves to make me even more reclutant to try and put myself out there, because how? How can I throw myself into something i am expected to have at least a tiny bit of experience in? What are you supposed to do when you don't even qualify for that?

I don't know how to make peace with this. I don't know how to justify missing out on one of the most fundamental parts of the human experience for such a long time in a way that doesn't make me seem completely unworthy of anyone's time.

1368,WordsForTheVoid,1618968076,1,"I think this post is for here. 

I've met me. I know me quite well. I've actually known me for 37 years. I'm funny sometimes. Serious at other times. I care about people, and things, like everyone else. I'm mostly happy and seldom, if ever, angry and sad. I never married but I'm the father too a couple of lovely kids that I love to bits. I've a good solid stable job. I'm a fully functioning responsible adult, in many a sense. 

But I am lonely, of that there is no doubt. And I think I know why!!!! 

What I actually give to people is my shadow. It's all I've ever been willing to give. I never give them me. If I gave them me I'd be vulnerable. You can't hurt a shadow. You can't touch it. You can't hug it. You can't have a firm relationship with it. On a sunny day it's always there but if a cloud comes along or light gives way to night it's gone, leaving people hurt and alone.

And when they leave me, it's just me and my shadow.  Alone. 

Me, I guess I'm getting exactly what I deserve when I talk of my loneliness. I laugh at this thought more than I cry. 

It upsets me more to think of the people I hurt, for those that truly tried caring for me. I do love them all in my own way but they'll never understand. And even if they do understand they would also realise its not enough for them. When I think of them it simply amplifies the feeling of loneliness.

My minds been in a dark place lately.

You know the feeling of being by yourself really punches you in the gut. You feel like you're invisible to everyone and everything. Sometimes I wish I had someone a friend, a significant other. The thing is I don't know if it is to fill the void or the fulfill the feeling of wanting to love someone and someone being there for you, you know through the dark and light. Idk what it is. I have pushed away a lot of people in my life, and I don't know if it's worthy of me saying that cause I wouldn't think they would hit me up to begin with. I do have a couple friends, but sometimes I feel like I depend on them drastically as a mean of coping that void-like feeling of emptiness that surrounds me.

I do try to distract myself with work, Netflix, etc, but the thoughts take over me, even the tv shows, they sort of create this fairy tale like world where the main characters live this perfect life. I hate that shit, I fall in love with these characters too, you know ""dreaming of someone like that being there for me"". Also, when doing work, I'd have a random thought of a past relationship or person in my life and boom, I cannot bring myself back to focus.

The saddest thing is, often I listen to ASMR videos of people showing love/ comforting ""you"" to fulfill that shitty feeling that I feel. Sooner or later, it fucks me up more, when I realize how stupid the entire thing is.

There is literally no way to remove the feeling of emptiness inside of me, regardless of who I meet, what I do, etc. It's always there and will be there. This pandemic is messing everything up, but regardless, I don't know if I would have the guts to put myself out there.

Just sucks, you know , feeling unwanted, unloved, and knowing you cannot do anything about it than to imagine that you are loved, which I think is pretty fucked in itself.

1400,onlycinnamontoast,1618947550,1,"My minds been in a dark place lately.

You know the feeling of being by yourself really punches you in the gut. You feel like you're invisible to everyone and everything. Sometimes I wish I had someone a friend, a significant other. The thing is I don't know if it is to fill the void or the fulfill the feeling of wanting to love someone and someone being there for you, you know through the dark and light. Idk what it is. I have pushed away a lot of people in my life, and I don't know if it's worthy of me saying that cause I wouldn't think they would hit me up to begin with. I do have a couple friends, but sometimes I feel like I depend on them drastically as a mean of coping that void-like feeling of emptiness that surrounds me. 

I do try to distract myself with work, Netflix, etc, but the thoughts take over me, even the tv shows, they sort of create this fairy tale like world where the main characters live this perfect life. I hate that shit, I fall in love with these characters too, you know ""dreaming of someone like that being there for me"". Also, when doing work, I'd have a random thought of a past relationship or person in my life and boom, I cannot bring myself back to focus. 

The saddest thing is, often I listen to ASMR videos of people showing love/ comforting ""you"" to fulfill that shitty feeling that I feel. Sooner or later, it fucks me up more, when I realize how stupid the entire thing is. 

There is literally no way to remove the feeling of emptiness inside of me, regardless of who I meet, what I do, etc. It's always there and will be there. This pandemic is messing everything up, but regardless, I don't know if I would have the guts to put myself out there. 

Just sucks, you know , feeling unwanted, unloved, and knowing you cannot do anything about it than to imagine that you are loved, which I think is pretty fucked in itself.

Sorry

I don't know. Maybe it's a pointless thing to think about.

There's a sticky note on the shelf above my desk that reads, ""there are more important things than..."". I look at it when I'm worried about something stupid. The ""important things"" is actually supposed to be referring to the hypothetical situation of a loved one dying, but that would be something difficult (and weird) to put on a sticky note, I think.

Do you think that that's a good way of thinking about things? That something is not really important because it's not *as* important as the untimely death of a loved one? Is it stupid? It always makes me feel better reading that note.

Underneath it says, ""Can I at least be neutral?"".

At 19 years old I started university and that is when I started meeting people and made some friends, but when I was a teen I started creating these fake scenarios in my head where I am the main character and I'm always an orphan with money problems (sometimes sexual abuse is involved, even tho I never experienced that in real life) there is always an older man (like 35years old) that has a lot of money and he helps me and fell in love with me, in all the scenarios this is the main storie that I change over time when I get bored, bit it's pretty much always the same story in different ways. 

In real life I'm not an orphan, I have both of my parents, I haven't see my dad since I was a kid tho and I don't feel safe with my mom when it comes to money, I actually have lots of problems related to money in real life, I love my mom so much  ut I feel like she is not capable of taking care of things and I have to do it all by myself which makes me feel overwhelmed,  now with the whole pandemic thing I can't even go out, I don't have a social life (in my whole life I only kissed a guy and I have never went futher than that, I never had s.ex or went even close, which makes me feel like I'm not normal, I feel like I'm not living like a 22 years old but like a 14 years old). 

The thing that scares me the most is that everytime  there is a discussion about money in my family, I close my eyes and think about the imaginary man in my scenarios, and I recreate the scene in my head, like I'm crying in his arms and ask him to help me and protect me, and some how doing this relieves me, it makes me feel safe for that little time, then I open my eyes and everything is back to normal. I started doing this recently, I feel like I went so far with this imaginary thing that the imaginary man makes me feel safer than a real person does. 

I'm always 100% sure of what is real and what is not, so I don't think I'm crazy, but I don't know what to do, sometimes I would just want to close my eyes and live the life I invented, which I think is crazy because in all the scenarios I'm always an orphan, with no money, that has been treated bad by everyone, is alone, and has been abused as a kid in the orphanage, this is an HORRIBLE life, the only reason I think I would like to live in that scenario is because there is always that man that saves me, helps me, protects me, loves me, and doesn't matter how bad the story is, everything will always be okay because there is him with me. 

I also don't understand why in all the scenarios I'm always living such a bad life even tho my life is not like that at all, I have money problems and no social life but I haven't been abused, my family loves me even if there are a lost of fights, but over load my life is decent compared to the one I invent in my head. Also,  if I can invent a whole scenario in my head why I dont make it like I'm a millionaire living with no problems? It would make more sense no?

I used to have a very good friend that I kept in touch from my early teenage years to a year ago. I can't say I lack friends but I am missing that spark between two very good friends. I always valued a bond way more than other stuff that may come in the package. The pandemic opened our eyes wide, we feel the weirdest emotions and we are expected to fight them. How can you fight something without knowing what it is? Anyways, I guess if you're interested in having a good friend that's going to put a lot of effort in our friendship, just send me a message, would love to hear from you. ( and a female if you're interested to know, but I honestly don't care.) Wishing you all the best and thank you for taking your time to listen to me!

1442,kbde__,1618924786,1,I feel lonely almost all the time. I'm 16 and because we've got online school i don't even go outside. I spend a lot of my time thinking about why i don't have friends but it's surely not good for me. I'm just so jealous of people who have friends. Other than being socially awkward i can't really think of a reason people don't like me. I'm also an overthinker and sometimes the thought in my head that i'm worthless and don't deserve to be loved is louder than the voice of a person i'm talking to.

My sister brought her new partner over to join which was nice because I'd met them once before and really liked them. As soon as her partner got here they went into my sisters room and shut the door which wasn't unusual for them, so no biggie. 

My brother got called into work last minute so he had to leave, which is a bummer, but nothing new. I told him I'd make him up a plate for when he got back. 

I set the table for three and was finishing up dinner, was about to call my sister and her partner to the table when I saw my sister come out of her room and go to the front door. She picked up a McDonalds Uber Eats delivery and was taking it back to my room. She saw me and said that dinner smelt really good and her and her partner would probably come out and eat some later and to eat without them.

1454,Air-Constant,1618912934,1,"Point 1: ""Just hit the gym bRoH / change your style"". First of all, I think that is very sad having to change your habits in order to be appreciated by someone (but this will be seen in another point of this list). Often, who says this, has never lifted a barrel in his life. I regularly workout since 1.5 years and I am in perfect shape. I always did several sports (MMA, swim, running and so on). As the second one, I wear casual and sometimes elegant clothes. Nothing too fancy. But One of the people who gave me this advice is always dressed like a drug dealer lmao. So, big nope. I don't like to judge other's appearance. But apparently, they do.

Point 2: ""Just get rich BrOh"". This will merge with the point I told about in the First one. BTW, I worked as both woodworker and sculptor. I am now paying my own studies since I couldn't afford it before (recently hit 25) and I am doing great (I already have job offers and I have 1 year left to graduate). I even bought myself a small apartment. But that's not about being rich or so on. I work 1) because I enjoy these works and 2) to pay whatever I like to do. And that's it. I am not an ATM. 

Point 3: ""Looks don't matter bRoH"". False. Big Time false. They might not matter exclusively but they do matter. You know about what? First impact. If you pass it, then personality will have a bigger space. But if you don't (and first impact, especially on dating apps, is 90% based on your looks) you are f...ed, especially if, like I do, you have unusual and exotic traits that don't match the beauty standards of the country you live in (planning to move since I graduate lol).

Point 4: ""Just be yourself BrOh"". Remember what I said in point 1 and 2? Well, you got it. How can you say first ""Be rich and change yourself in order to be loved"" and then ""People must appreciate you for what you are"". Yea, very coeherent, isn't it? 

Point 5: ""Work on yourself BrOh"". That's what I'm doing since the day I was born. We all have High and down periods. But I worked, I am graduating, I speak 3 languages fluently, have plenty of Friends, hobbies, workout daily, I am a voltueer and the list can go on and on. Oh, and that's not my depression. I see people licterally beating their SO and always get laid, while I struggle to even get a date lmao. *Coff coff. ""LoOks DoN't MattEr"". Coff coff.*

Point 6 (last one): ""There will eventually be someone for you bRoH"". Maybe. I had a bunch of short relationships and one LTR ended after 5 years. First of all, saying this to a person that planned to get married and had an harsh break up, is not a great idea. BTW, that's not guaranteed. Not at all. You may roam your whole life and don't find that ""special person"". Or you may find him/her. That's mostly luck. Forget about PUA's stupid advices. That's not even confidence. But luck.

I am a 28 yr old female from a developing country who travelled to the US to get her PhD. I worked very hard to get into graduate school and earn a scholarship for last few years. It was quite difficult in my country but thankfully I finally made it here and i am doing my doctorate in my favorite area and absolutely love the school, the university and the town.

But since I have come to the US, I have started to feel very lonely (my family is back home in South Asia) and become obsessed with marriage. Problem is that most men I meet are into sex and short-term relationships, and i come from a very conservative and religious background and can't have sex before marriage. I am feeling more and more afraid that I will be left single in the USA due to my beliefs, and my PhD is quite long (almost 5-6 years) and these will also be the right age for me to settle down in marriage (28-33 years), but it seems very difficult (i tried a few apps like Tinder but men only seem interested in hooking-up). I feel as if I am missing out on a lot by being single, and it will be very difficult for me to find someone here(my state is extremely white, and there aren't any foreigners around). As I feel that marriage is the hardest thing to attain, I have become quite obsessed with it. It seems as if my PhD and research work doesn't seem to be a priority anymore ( I was obsessed with getting into a fully funded program for last few years), since I am here. I feel my mind has shifted from hunting graduate programs to husband. That's not to say that I don't enjoy my doctoral work or I am not putting in effort, it's just that I feel i really need a partner and it will be very difficult to live alone for the next few years. I also feel I am running out of my time and if I don't find someone in the coming years, i will be ""too old"". There's a lot of stigma in my home country for remaining unmarried.

Can someone help me with this? I am really looking into advice on how can I change my mind and start focusing more on my work and less on men? Or where can I meet more compatible guys?",lonely,New grad student obsessed with marriage?,2021-04-20 18:40:17

I tell her all the time how I want to better myself and my struggles. 

Anyways, I thought we were on the same page. I've shared so much with her for so long as well as a lot of my unfiltered thoughts, and I expected her to be okay with doing the same, but I guess I was wrong. I know me sharing doesn't entitle me to her information, but bruh I thought we were very close. 

I am hurt and I'm not ready to confront her yet if at all. In our friendship I'm a huge talker and she's a huge listener. She doesn't even know I'm upset since we last ended that discussion. We haven't chatted since. It's been 6 days, and she hasn't even reached out to me. I guess I'm the main person reaching out and maybe I'm the deluded one thinking we were close. 

I don't know how to proceed yet. Confrontation may yield awkwardness and new pressures in the friendship. I have to spend time evaluating the dynamic of our friendship and if I'll accept her privateness going forward or invest my time elsewhere. 

Sigh I've been closing myself off to everyone, but her to conserve my energy. Now that I'm taking a break from her, I realize I have no one else to comfortably confide in. I've been trying to become a journal person though, but I haven't felt this lonely in ages. 

When chatting with people, negative feelings have started seeping in, such as being a burden, a bother, unworthy, annoying, and unwanted. Ugh it makes me want to cut off communication totally, but I know that's not healthy. Sigh. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

Well, my story is very sad. I'm 21, vut in years past, I have not had a real boyfriend. What's more, not a boy or girl has been attracted to me, and the guys I tell I like, reject me and never speak to me again.

Well, at 14 I had a 21-year-old boyfriend and he was what I considered ""the love of my life."" I had never liked someone like him and I loved him madly. However, the age difference and my mother's refusal made our relationship impossible.

The following year, he found another girl and had a daughter with her. This hurts me because he never touch me in that way. 

During that time, I liked other guys who rejected me. I had another boyfriend but it was terrible and the relationship did not last a week.

In college I liked several guys who, unsurprisingly, never noticed me. They only saw me as one more friend.

Now I am talking with a boy that I like, but I do not know, he sees much future. 

My ex from years ago returned with his daughter and I make up my mind to be a stepmother, not even that much anymore, because he too has distanced himself from me.

Anyway, it seems that neither with one nor the other will be done. I have not had sex or a formal or beautiful relationship that I like.

I am 26 years old and currently living in Prague. Before moving here, I became friends with a Czech girl online. She is 23 years old and we became friends as she emailed me through a University program.

Upon arrival, she was the first to receive me and show me around the city. I brought her some gifts and she liked them.

Actually, she is very kind-hearted and caring. I have been invited by her mother for a dinner and last week she took me to visit her cottage. I meet her horse and spent the day together.

To be honest, I don't fall for a girl that easily given my previous experiences. Although, I was always drawn by her simplicity yet I never had romantic feelings for her. Also, when she told me about her boyfriend. I reserved all my emotions. However, last week she started saying about her parents divorce and how it changed her. Also, her first lover was always angry and it seemed that she is bit distant from her current lover.

If anyone can help, Am I guilty to have romantic thoughts for her? What do you think, should I let her know of my feelings? However, I don't want to loose her as a friend. I don't know why but I just want to know if she is happy and spent my time with her.

TLDR: I like a girl and due to some incidents I got interested to her romantically. But, she has a boyfriend. What should I do?",lonely,I guess that I am in love but fear to let her know. I feel guilty. Please help.,2021-04-20 09:38:10

Unless you are socially important, then people will care. Otherwise, if you are unlucky enough to be a social outcast, nobody cares.

The friend who complains their friends don't care about him/her won't care about you.

The friend who complains they can't call anybody when they have a sprained ankle at 2am won't respond to you when you have a sprained ankle at 2am.

The friend who said last week: ""let's hang out"" will leave you on seen when you reach out a week later asking to hang out.

The very very few who seem to care or who try to care are few and far between. These are the people who have been there, who have experienced the pain that loneliness can cause. These are the people who never wish the same pain on anyone else. But these people, although they try to care, won't have the time to care for each and everyone, because it will quickly drain them out. We all have limited amounts of time and energy.

People always try to downplay it tell me it isn't a big deal and not to feel sad about it. Which I do understand since I'm 20 and time is on my side for now. But the only people who understand how this feels are the people who are/were in the same situation. Just kind of tired of people telling me to ""not let it effect me."" You think I want this? I can't control my thoughts they just happen. I just want to know what it's like to come home to someone asking how your day was. Someone who will hug you and tell you things will be ok. Someone who will back you up and be in your corner no matter what. A partner to go through life with that can make the bad parts just that much easier.

While I am somewhat optimistic about the future and I do think I will find someone or at least I hope so I'd personally rather just end my life at age 30 if I've still never experienced a relationship. People like to say ""it can happen anytime"" but chances are if you get past your mid to late 20's never having a gf chances are you never will find one.

I am an introvert, my family says that the confinement fell like a glove to me, everything was going well, I left my career to study what I was really passionate about, I took a sabbatical, I felt great, everything took a nosedive in march when my ""best friend"" got a boyfriend, I haven't seen her in a long time because she went to live in another country shortly before the confinement and I'm actually happy for her but now I feel weird, in our group of friends we all swore, including her, that she would be the last to find someone to love. A few years ago she and another friend fought and stopped talking completely, I kept talking to both of them and after my friend got a boyfriend they talked again and now I feel excluded, if I talk to one, they don't answer me because they are talking to the other, they tell each other things and then they mention them in front of me in video calls as if I knew what they are talking about, I have decided to leave them alone and not get into that matter, all I want and need is to have attention and I am aware of that but I also know (or want to believe) that the attention I demand is not too much, I only want 2 things:

1. not watching instagram or tik tok while talking, I just want to feel like you are listening to me
2. make an effort to remember what I say, maybe is not interesting, but maybe is a big deal to me and that would mean a lot to me

Does that make me an attention whore? I think my friends think so and they don't take me seriously. 

I have wanted to make more friends but honestly I don't know how, I am very proud to download apps like tinder to meet people, I just can't and with other friends that I have I feel that every time I am distancing myself more, we are maturing and each one is doing his life through different paths and we no longer have so many things in common

I find it difficult to be close to someone, I need a lot of time to gain confidence, it is another reason why it is difficult for me to make friends.

I am 23 and I have never had a boyfriend or been kissed, I didn't care much until now that I feel isolated, several years have passed since the last time I knew that someone liked me, sometimes I start to wonder if that was my opportunity and I let it go

People always say ""Looks don't matter"". So, for a while I thought it was true. So I focused on my inner traits. I used to consider myself to be exciting and have a lot to offer. I loved to play piano and guitar and make funny jokes and videos for my friends and new people. But time went by, I found that no one really liked my music, my jokes nor my videos. And so I stopped because there was no point in making them. You might say ""Do it for yourself."" The point is, I don't even like myself. 

I tried hitting the gym, went through hardship just to get into good shape, only to find that it didn't matter. What's the difference between the worse version and best version of myself?

I've lost contact with all of my friends from school, but even if I were to try to contact them again, I'm sure it wouldn't spark anything. We're too different and were only friends because of circumstance.

I went through a complicated break-up and my ex-girlfriend seems to be having the most social time of her life right now - I don't really feel hatred towards her but it makes me feel so much worse, she's socially much better off than I am. 

I'm barely scraping by in university, because I don't do anything with my time. I feel so numb. I want to spend time looking for friends - looking for a community - but how? Where? 

I keep trying to make online friends - which has worked for me in the past. I keep joining discords and trying to make friends but it never amounts to anything. Maybe I should pick up an MMO and force myself to do social content but... it feels like a waste of time.

I don't think there's anything wrong with me. I'm a nice and talkative guy, people laugh when I tell jokes etc. I love asking questions and learning about people.

Dear R.

Technically, you never said it. He forced it out of you during a conversation, but it felt genuine, like years knee-deep in the dirt and finally a ""diamond-in-the-rough"" moment happened to me. It was a damned shame I was dealing with mental issues before I even knew I had them, we've gotten through it together like you were always pushing me to succeed. Every time I think about that year, my eyes begin to water because I have so much bittersweet moments and I'm tired of being left behind.

I never thought I could love someone more than I hate myself 

But it was you. Seeing you everyday look at me with those blue eyes with tiny gold specks (eyes were as blue as the topal sea), that light-brown hair which I constantly tease you for being a blonde, the cute smile you gave whenever I did something cool. The constant forgiveness for my bad actions, lesser or greater. I should've known something was up when you ""shunned"" me but still became gleeful a couple days later to see me. You probably thought I was playing with your feelings everytime I choked my own words trying to convey my honest feelings, only to get interrupt by fellow classmates as the bell rings for end of recess. 

I didn't know it until months later when I began to worry when you weren't in the class (you were rarely sick if I recall correctly), then I lost you to someone else because I never thought to say those extra special words back. How stupid of me, you probably thought I was interested in someone else because I would only become dumb af around you but not around others. What can I say when I feel like a living ghost every time I see you. 

Yours then,

Jere Bear.

1577,CrikeyCameron,1618841897,1,"I think this might end up as a situation where I know I need help or to suck something up but refuse it anyway. Don‚Äôt care about myself now. I‚Äôm depressed to the point I‚Äôm trying to just figure out again how feelings actually are and yes I‚Äôm already on antidepressants. So actually trying to take action? Forget it. I‚Äôve already tried repeatedly and very hard despite feeling awful months ago, it goes nowhere and I don‚Äôt have emotional motivation anymore. Nobody even seems to realise that I have tried really hard already and even my closest friends who I genuinely believe cared have left me behind on numerous things. Sometimes because of their own anxiety. Oh well.

To the main topic- Discord just isn‚Äôt the same as old forums. You go on forums, you can make your own topics. Discord, what are you supposed to do? Make your own server and it dies, join others and even when you try to engage or be super active- I never end up making actual friends. People will friend me, I try to have some casual chat, most people leave me hanging for hours or days if we even chat at all (wether I start the conversation or they do).

Frankly I don‚Äôt like Reddit either, but that‚Äôs beside the point. Just saying I don‚Äôt count this site as a classic-format forum either. This ain‚Äôt it. A lot of other sites are toxic... many are just dead. So it feels like Discord is really the only option for me, because at least it has a less toxic userbase than others (not universally, but better than many) and is active. There is one forum I use and actually have a better time on but it‚Äôs steadily dying.

It feels like I go on Discord and I have to rely on others‚Äô servers but if I actually try to be active on them, I end up lonely anyway. They‚Äôre established without me. I can never shake the feeling that I‚Äôm not actually friends with anyone in them and I know that people there do way more together without me, despite expressing interest and being open about my issues, and generally trying to hang out and have fun. It‚Äôs so saddening. I can‚Äôt make my own server and post about my interests and stuff there... they die, you can‚Äôt spread them, nobody cares.

Personally I seem unable to make genuine friends through Discord and so I‚Äôm on these servers and it feels so fake because the format is just so much more isolating than old forums where you saw people make their own threads and I could make my own and I happened to make more actual friends and on Discord everything is just... it‚Äôs just there. Who cares. When it‚Äôs live it‚Äôs actually harder to join in or add to some thread of conversation that was there, or to start an actual discussion or more interest in a certain topic. They just go with the waves and they ironically fizzle out more than what I saw on threads on old forums.

It‚Äôs depressing because now the old forum format is dead besides a very small collection of sites which themselves aren‚Äôt as active as those of old and I try so hard, I ask people, I tell some outright now lonely I am- I can‚Äôt find anywhere to be and Discord is honestly so isolating. It‚Äôs super convenient if you already have friends and wanna shitpost, but actually making friends there seems insurmountable. I‚Äôm in a terrible mental state, feel like I don‚Äôt even have friends anymore and trying to find some, and trying to find a community of sorts or a friend circle, this is genuinely depressing for somebody like me.",lonely,I feel so isolated being on Discord.,2021-04-20 00:18:17

1585,Marshall_Black,1618837100,1,"This happened last friday and I'm still thinking about it.

I'm currently studying my third college career after failing the other two, but I feel so overwhelmed, unmotivated and depressed that I'm already thinking of quitting after only one month of classes to seize the rest of the year to focus on my mental health and rethink what the hell I am supossed to do with my life. I expressed my desire to quit to my classmates in our class' WhatsApp group and I got mixed responses, but something happened that gave me a spark of hope in something I know I shouldn't be so hopeful about.

After reading what I wrote, a girl from my class PM'ed me to tell me that she's struggling with her career choices as well and that this is her second attempt. She told me that she understands how I feel and that she is there for me if I ever need help. She also told me that she's using a certain website to help organise the subjects and assignments and that we could meet in a cafeteria so she could teach me how to use it. We couldn't agree on a time and date because we're both busy so the meeting is still on hold.

No person has cared for me in a long time, and when she sent me a private message tellig me she's willing to help me I really felt that. Allow me to quote a piece of text I once found online: ""The average guy is so starved for positive attention that a simple compliment is enough to get him interested in you"". This girl didn't compliment me, but she showed me kindness, one I haven't received for a long time.

I badly need someone willing to help me and tell me that things are going to be fine, to the point that I started having thoughts on this girl that I know I shouldn't be having. My stupid brain, starved for positive attention, mistook basic kindness for love. I barely know this girl's name and I've already fallen for her just because she was nice to me once. And I hate that I feel this way.

I'm going to wait until we meet to study in that cafeteria and then will see how things go with this girl. The least thing I want to do is be a creep and scare her. Even if things don't go the way I'd like them to go, I will always be grateful for her will to help me.

Sorry if this was too random.

1600,Tumbleweed_Intrepid,1618822399,1,"To preface this I do acknowledge the perks of being an only child. First off my parents are able to send me to a nice college that they otherwise wouldn't have been able if they had to worry about other kids.  Also I never had to share a room so that's nice. I also got 100% of my parents attention but that was a good and a bad thing. My parents especially my mom were pretty overbearing and strict. They also fight a lot so whenever they yell at me or each other the only thing I could really do was just bury my head in my pillow. I wish I had someone else who knew my parents as well as I did and someone who I could relate more than anyone. I wish we could discuss what happened and just bounce ideas off each other.

My dad was always at work and I do appreciate all the work he does but cause of that I never really saw him a lot growing up. Me and my mom don't really get along for a number of reasons but that's not the point of this post. Anyway a large majority of my life has been spent alone. While growing up the default that only children have is isolation and we have to seek out socialization. Where as people who have siblings defaulted to socialization and had to seek out isolation. I was never the type of person to ever have a ton of friends either so most of my nights are spent completely alone for as long as I can remember. Growing up friends come and go naturally but whenever I'd find a new friend I'd always think to myself ""better now screw this up or I'll just be alone again"" Humans aren't meant to spend that much time alone right? Aren't we supposed to be social animals?

It doesn't help that all my family besides my parents live in different cities. I have some cousins I am close with which I am very thankful for cause if I didn't have them idk where the fuck I'd be now. But I only see them once or twice a year. It's been this way all my life I'm 20 now btw. I've never had a real gf so that doesn't help either. Had a few flings here and there but nothing for real.

but despite all of that, i  didn't  suicide as you can see, so why?  i born in this fucking  situation, and lived horrible years but i saw beatiful lives in movies,  among friends etc. so that basically means a good life is possible. so  if i suicide, what will happen? my mom will cry and probably die because  she is so sad, my brother will also have a really big trauma and i will  be forgotten from this fucking universe. sounds like fun ? nope.

so  what i do? i am trying my best to be happy. fuck money, fuck reputation  etc. i only seek happiness in this life, and now i can say i am happy.  because i have some dreams and i am working really hard to achieve them.   but i am not gonna be happy when i achieve them, i am happy now,  trying to do them. the thing is , if you wanna be happy, just find a  dream and work hard for it, but enjoy the process , that's the actual  happiness. reaching the goal is not that important.

Recently I have found myself questioning if he truly wants a future with me. He says he does but he sometimes contradicts that. I know I should let him go deep down but that's besides the point. I feel like my friends I still have who I thought were ""quality friends"" won't care if I open up about this.

The last we spoke he had accused me of being a woman he was talking to online and playing mind games with him. I of course denied it because it wasn't true but I guess what was going was too coincidental for him and said this is why we can't talk because he can't think straight. So he had promised he wasn't going to change his number and I did give him his space for a little over a week but when I asked him if he needed any of the stuff left at my place of his I found out he did change his number and found out from everyone we knew except his best friend and his son that he didn't give his new number to anyone and went no contact with them as well. 

Anyways I had realized that my phone account still had all his info on it as I added on his plan and then he just took off his number off the account. Since it had his info I never got the pin or security question info so I can't make any changes to my plan without them. So I messaged his best friend if he could pass that message on. His friend said he would but said he didn't want to be put in the middle anymore and asked me not to contact him again. Which sucked because he was my friend too and this was obviously extenuating circumstances as I had no other way to get ahold of him. But I haven't heard from his friend since. I guess since then, my ex ended up calling my mom to give her the pin and to ask her if she could tell my son how much he misses him and to wish him a happy birthday and sorry he couldn't be there. 

He then told her that he missed me a lot and he thinks of me constantly but that he still needs his space and needs to continue working on himself and stated he didn't want to hurt me. So I don't know what he meant by that.. anyways it took everything in me not to start crying because of how much I've missed him.. and of course I still had my son with me so I didn't want him to see me cry as he still doesn't know we broke up (I didn't want to ruin his birthday week by telling him this week and just said his stepdad was out of town) I plan on telling him in the next coming weeks. 

Anyways I don't know if I should even hold onto hope as he obviously still won't let anyone have his new number and he didn't call me directly to give me the pin even though he could have called me blocked like he has been with my parents. But him going out of his way to tell my mom that he misses me and thinks of me all the time and he told her it's ok to tell me anything they talk about so I just don't know..

So let me share with you how I got into this situation, It all started in January of 2020, I had just withdrew from my second semester at college. I had realized while I didn't like living at my university and I also didn't really like my major so I decided to move home. I was going to reenroll in the local community college and get a job but then Covid happened. At first it was no big deal and my girlfriend even came home from her school so that was a plus.

Eventually I ended up getting a job with my uncle and I finally started taking online courses this semester, but because of where I work and the fact my schooling is online I never got to make any new friends and all of my old buddies went back to college. I also started seeing a therapist and have been trying to find hobbies to pass the time when I am alone but it hasn't done much to fill in the hole of no social life.

I've been trying to keep my issues to myself but inadvertently its only been straining my relationship with my girlfriend. She pities me, so she feels bad leaving me by myself, which isn't healthy and is only going to stress the relationship more.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I miss people, I miss friends, I miss having things to talk about. I am not sure how much longer I can keep functioning like this, I feel as though I have been stunted socially so bad because of Covid and I don't know how to make friends anymore given the situation. I also live in a smaller town which limits the people I can meet and how I can meet them.

I am not allowed to have social media, my parents check the router so they see where i go on the internet and what apps I use, and they are very strict about letting me go places (this past year and a half I only saw friends 3 times). From when I was in grade 1 to around grade 9 i would get physically abused, kicked, punched, hair pulled, those are the only memories i have from that young, now they stopped that buts its  lot of verbal abuse and sometimes throwing things at me. Since middle school I always lie to them because it is the only way I can live my life, I had an instagram account that they found out about because they check the router, and then they talk about how they cant trust me, even though its so normal at my age. My dad constantly belittles me calls me stupid, garbage, a piece of sh\*t etc, but he is never wrong only me. (screams at me for not cleaning my plate off the table when his has been on the table for the past few hours) then he talks about how I make him pay for everything food soon university (literally nothing else), but he is my parent how can I pay for food? I wanted a job to be more independent but he said I cant have one because it will take away from school but I literally right now grade 12 have a 97 average.. I want to be a doctor but anytime we get close to the conversation he yells says how I am not gonna make it, make him be in debt for paying for the school and wants me to go to his career path. He also wont let me have a roomate in university next year, he even mentioned having me live in my bothers completely one room apartment if i go to the same university. Backing this up with how I cant be trusted. He also said he will skype me everyday to make sure I am working, and said university is just for school, when I said hopefully i make a friend, he lashed out. All my life, because of them, especially before corona, never letting me talk to people and see people, I have only 3 friends and these people I dont think im actually friends with. I always reach out, they never ask to see me, but better than absolutely nothing. They dont understand how hard it is on me, i want to die. I am also really insecure about my face and body i am honestly quite ugly, have a huge nose, and am chubby. It just doesnt help

Anyways: My 3 friends live beautiful lives (i dont want to hear that udk what theyre going thru crap).

She has a job, buys clothes and food whenever she wants, has loving parents, alowed to have social media (she always sends videos she makes or pictures her parents take of her for social media) and she is beautiful so its always a jab in the heart. (i feel bad for being jealous but i just cant help it). And her parents support her career path and she says their super supportive of her moving out and being independent. I relish the idea. I also like to watch youtubers and pretend i was them, yet this often brings me to tears.

None of my 'friends' know the extent of what i am going through, i havent said the full extent here either, but its too much.

I always lived a life of solitude since i was very young, staying home to only play video games. Though i had friends through sports, i didnt get out unless obligated too. 

My cousins found a spot to poke and continously teased me about being a home body, not having friends, never having a girlfriend, being a loser. I mean the jokes went on for years, ranging from the clothing i wore, to the way i spoke. Though i was happy with who i was, they made me realize that maybe to some degree, they were right. 

Ill never forget, they made me introduce myself to one of their friends, and because of my dialect, everybody laughed at me. I mean, here i am, TRYING, for it to be met with being put down. 

I am not comfortable with the person i am. Every action i make, i have to constantly ask if im acceptable enough.

Today, im soo fucking lonely, and i always wonder what is wrong with me, why am i not accepted. Is my dialect off putting, is my dressing bad?

when she asked me what's going on with me, I just said nothing (as in something along the lines of ""I haven't been doing anything, etc""). 


Reason? I didnt feel comfortable. I felt like she didn't really want to know or something. She has her life going on.

So many people related to feeling lonely and several even reached out via DMs. Everyone was normal and respectful, no creepers wanting fap fodder. 

By ""connect"" and ""make friends"" I mean RL interactions. Talking to people online, for me, is not spending quality time with them nor does it do anything to quell the loneliness. Honestly, I spend 40 hours a week looking at screens and a lot of my free-time staring at my phone or computer screen at home too. Talking to people online is not how I prefer to interact with them. Getting out and talking to them in person, taking a walk, grabbing a bite to eat or drink, etc is how I make connections and potential new friends.

My 20s were a complete wash. You know that decade where people get to have fun, meet potential future partners, begin to form as a person.  Yep that decade. Well my 20s were depression, video games and crying myself to sleep most nights. I don't have any photos of myself from when I was in my 20s, don't have any real memories, it was basically a blur where not a lot happened

My 30s were slightly better, I realised that I'm a good guy, I made my first real friend since I was a child. My work situation improved, I have a decent job now, I own a house, I went on dates. Though trying to date as  a 30 something guy with zero relationship experience is difficult, especially when the women I was going on dates with had a ton of experience, they might have been maried once, some had children. And I was a walking , breathing red flag

The thing is when you look at me in real life, I'll look happy, even outgoing and friendly , my job leaves me little choice but to wear an extrovert mask. 

The only problem is, I'm approaching 40, covid-19 meant our office has closed so I'm working from home permanently.  I do try and look after my health,  physically I'm okay but mentally I'm a wreck sometimes. I didn't have much of a life prior to covid and now I'm just going to be stuck at home for the forseeable future.  I've tried online dating but as I've gotten older , things like my Tinder matches just get worse and worse, as lonely as I am, I'm also not desperate enough to ask a single mum of 5 on benefits (welfare) to move in with me. I think we've all dreamt about meeting someone special, settling down, having kids but I just look at my life and I've accepted it's just not going to happen

My mum has mentioned how much I remind her of her uncle when she was young, he had has heart broken and really hit the bottle hard. He would just drink every single day, but he was never mean and looked after my mum really well, he was her fave uncle but he died in his 40s due to alcholism. He was a kind, brilliantly intelligent guy according to her, but whenever he was by himself he would drink and drink and drink

The thing is a lot of men in my family have died in their 40s, my grandad passed away before I was born .  I've never actually feared death, despite my issues, I've led a dignified life, maybe I will be found one day at the bottom of the stairs in my house but that thought doesn't scare me",lonely,Being alone seems to be the long term outlook,2021-04-19 06:17:44

I'm always the second choice for everyone. A backup.  
It sucks how I have never felt what it's like to be someone's number one.  


You know what's worse than being rejected?  
Being an option. Life is unbalanced and unfair to people like us. We are what they say, 'plan b'. We're the left-out ones.

I am everybody's good friend, but not anyone's best friend. I am there for my friends, I help them, support them, and I always make out time for them.

I'm the world's favourite second option, my crush's backup.   
It sucks that I am people's just in case. They lead with empty promises and keep me around to feel better about themselves.

I'm that guy who is invited to the parties and included in plans out of obligation. No one would miss my presence. I am just a casual friend to them.  


  
Throwback to the time when we booked an Uber and the driver refused to accomodate 5 people and so we decided to call a different Uber, but no one volunteered to join me in it.  
Sometimes, it's the little things that make us feel very little in life.  


My problem is that I am available all the time. I have laughed and sobbed with them, everything a friend would do, but yet, I'm always the outsider. At the end of the day, when I need something, they almost always say no.  
Yet I am the guy who will always be there even when I know no one will be there for me.  


When your feelings are invalidated and there is no one to fight for you, you start fighting for your place in their lives and when you do that, you're called clingy or attention seeking.  


Had I known how to say 'no', they'd have buzzed around me. I am the friend everyone wants but is always taken for granted. The friend who will always be there if someone needs me, even when I know no one will be there for me.

I was leaving a grocery store and at the time, I lost 20 pounds so I could wear actual pretty clothing. This man, yes a grown ass man and he was fine, came to me and ask if I can come over to his place and ‚Äúchill‚Äù. 

I always say no, but I did feel confident in the fact that man wanted me sexually. I declined the offer and went to my car where my best friend(20 year friendship) and sisters resided. They asked what happened since they saw the man talk to me, and I told them what happened.then, my best friend said,  ‚Äúdid he see your face?‚Äù 

 The confidence literally dropped out of my body. I Almost cried. Not gonna lie. That was pretty painful because I was already suspecting some foul energy from her, but that just concluded my intuition.

&amp;#x200B;

**""YOU NEED TO BE/LEARN TO BE ALONE""**

&amp;#x200B;

**INTRODUCTION**

Over the course of your life, there will be times when things become difficult, where the build-up of your life becomes stagnant or even reversed into degradation. This happens all too often in a world full of distractions and chaos, that comes in the form of technologies, social media, trends and people, those around you and even those who are close to you. Some of these external beings have certainly played an important role throughout your life as they shape your up identity and create who you are today.

Yet, the reality is, most of them are holding you back, with useless entertainments and interactions and influences that often wears you down instead of building you up. Intentionally or not, they put you off from your focus in life, from the progress you wish to reach, goals that you want to accomplish and from living, thinking and making decisions that benefit yourself, your growth, your development as a person who has desires and dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE REALITY FOR MODERN HUMAN BEING**

Yet, without these things and these people, you feel the dread of being lonely, the fear of being bored, and would rather take the route of being constantly involved in something or stimulated by someone. You are wired to think that you have to experience joys every hour and be surrounded by excitement every day in order to avoid that path towards boredom and loneliness. You have grown to be afraid of missing out on things that if you think deeply just for a moment, don't even matter that much to you. You associated time spent alone as time spent wasting, doing nothing and going nowhere.

Because when you look at other people on social media having fun and living in amusement, it reflects a sense of sadness in your heart, for you know your life is nowhere near as awesome as theirs. You let this lack of excitement and motivation on a regular basis determine your moods, your thoughts and your actions that further negatively contribute to your life. You have little things going on for yourself, so all you want is to feel good and seek after the short-term pleasures that are abundantly available from social and artificial stimulations.

Something as simple as a phone notification is something you crave for every hours and minutes of a day. You as a modern human being, have become in needs of attention. You want attention. You are obsessed with attention, whether that is from a thing or a human. Your life is so consumed by the externals, that you leave no rooms for self-reflection nor a sense of awareness toward your damaged and abandoned internals, which is often the cause of the dissatisfaction found in every step of life.

&amp;#x200B;

**YOUR ABILITY TO BE ALONE**

This is the reality for many of us, always on the look for the next biggest thing, something exciting, something new, something stimulating, something that gets you out of your own states of dullness and misery. Far too many people today operate in this way, especially the young, as their view on being alone is skewed towards negativity and unhappiness. Yet they don't realize that it is their constant involvements within the chaos of the world and of their own life that are preventing them from ever reaching that path towards fulfilment. Most people can not be left alone nor do have the ability to be alone, but given the condition of how most of us are living today, being alone is a gift, not a curse.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ALONE**

We should never see this as a waste or a futile use of our time. Because the time we spend alone is the only time when we can be true and be honest with ourselves, about who we are and what we want in life. It is the time that allows us to be mindful and be at peace with ourselves, our emotions, our desires and our previous experiences that may have traumatized or affected us immensely, to then cultivate an understanding of our internal mind, heart and souls, and create that unbreakable frame of ourselves, of who we are and why we exist, within the larger context of an ever-changing world that we all live in.

Being alone, we can truly see the picture of the reality for what it is and recognize for what it is not, what has been fabricated and told wrongly, to determine if we are truly the master of our life or a slave of our own existence. It is not by chance that we are destined to be one with our mind and body, and that we are not meant to experience the perspective of everyone and everything else throughout our lifetime, but to focus on a few specific things that matter most to ourselves and drift away from the things that hinder our ability to live a happy and fulfilling life.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

So reverse your thoughts process, and view time spends alone as an opportunity instead, to converse with yourself and discover your life path. In order to see where you stand in the present as well as in the future, you need to utilize your awareness and your imagination that is completely free of impulsions and distractions. This can only become possible when you fully master your ability to be alone and achieve that powerful state of mindfulness. The more quality time you spend with yourself, the more you will be able to spot areas where you need to grows, and how you can improve and become a person of value that can fill you with pride, confidence and real happiness.",lonely,Being Alone Is A Gift,2021-04-19 02:25:28

I have friends and go out pretty often with them but it just doesn't mean anything to me. In the 3 years I lived without her I realised that I don't remember being happy at all during those 3 years.

1723,bloveddemon,1618761326,1,"Woof. This pandemic has been rough. I've been lonely most of my life already. Then two years ago I decided to move and start over with the hopes of building the life I wanted. And it's really hard to make new friends as an adult. Especially as someone with social anxiety.

But just as I felt like I was starting to get somewhere ... boom. Pandemic.

Throughout the pandemic there have been ups and downs in terms of coping with the loneliness. At times depression has sunk me pretty low. But recently things have been looking up. I've really powered myself to actually get stuff done and continue growing as a person. Both mental and physical health has been on the upswing.

But then a week or two ago a downturn hit me HARD. I still have been able to keep up my overall positive trajectory, but the loneliness part has hit me maybe the hardest it has all year. I think it's because we're getting to the end. I just got my second shot yesterday. I compare it to driving home when you have to poop and as you get closer the need to poop gets more intense.

Anyway, yea, I haven't hugged anyone in over a year now. And I was already someone who was starved for human touch and affection before the pandemic. I can only cuddle my dog so much.

I just find myself on every type of r4r page lately just hoping to maybe connect to someone. And I don't even need to vent to them, I actually perfer it when people vent to me. I like taking care of people. Although, I have been desperate to nerd out about modern monetary theory.

I don't know. It's just been a lot the past few weeks. I've spent most of my life lonely and I'm pretty good at coping with it at this point, but man, I just have really been feeling it hard lately. To the point of desperation. My focus is all over the place.

Anyway, this seemed like a good place for this. And in the parlance of my beloved departed AIM: My ASL is 34/M/NC.",lonely,Desperate for Human Connection and Human Touch,2021-04-19 01:55:26

This post is me seeking out a friend/buddy/companion. 

I am Nick a 29 year old average guy with a boring IT job. In a Dead bedroom situation currently and I am unable to stop feeling sad and lonely. Had a discussion with my wife but that is gonna take some time and I am a bit skeptical since its not the first time.

What I'm looking for here are people with whom I can talk without being shy or wearing this mask and fake persona that we are bound to carry since we have a circle who holds the right to judge us for anything and everything. Also you really can't vent and tell your life problems to people without as that might create a lot of problems and people do tend to mock you every chance they get.

I'm generally a very kind, caring, left leaning and supporter of equality, but open to all views and ideas and love to talk to people. I do have a ton of friends both male and female but I am looking for someone with whom I can be 100% honest and real. It can be sfw or nsfw I don't mind either tbh just need a friend for now. And believe me I will be there for you for everything rant, life tips, virtual hugs. I tend to go all out to help and support people and love being that kind of a guy, it's not something that I force into my actions it just comes naturally to me. There are really very few kind voices and the world needs a lot more of them.

For hobbies I like sports, gaming, music and I love watching art films and non commercial cinema. Some of my current fav stuff on TV is Bojack Horseman, Mandalorian, Rick and Morty, Attack on titan( yes ive read the manga also). Books: Count of monte cristo, call of the wild, dracula. Bands : Him, a7x, metallica, Lordi.

1742,kino-murakami,1618739153,1,"My earliest memory of knowing what a friendship was, was when in 6th grade after I just changed schools, during the first period, someone came up and talked to me. I have memories of laughter and having friendly conversations with him every day in that first period. It was the highlight of my life up to that point and for the first time I felt normal.

Afterwards there was nothing but darkness. Classes changed, I didn't see him anymore, and because I was a minority east asian in a small rural southern school, I was seen as an outcast. I was an involuntary mute, with most days going by without even speaking another word to a human being. The only words I'd say is when I said Thank You to the lunch lady. This went on all through middle and high school. I felt like a ghost without a voice.

I'd be so envious of those around me who had friends. The weird kids most of all, because even they had their friend group of outcasts and weirdos. In 10th grade I thought someone wanted to be my friend in Biology class, but he would sexually abuse me by grabbing my dick under the table during class while I couldn't say anything.

University I thought I could be different, but the damage was done, and I spent my days inside a 5'x5' study cubicle in the library for 12 hours a day before going back to my dorm room.

I don't know what it's like to have a friend. The word is so foreign to me at this point. What does it mean to have a friend? Why would anyone want to associate themselves with a person like me? What does it mean to be completely comfortable with someone else? What's it like? What does it mean to be able to talk to someone about anything? What does it mean to have a friend?

Since then.  She started a new job - all remote - and lots of stress.  On top of that, new physical diagnosis - fibromyalgia on her part.   On top of anxiety and other poor health choices (smoking, inactivity, etc), and 40% weight gain in the past year.

We loved in passing and work-break phone calls, at least when I wasn't busy throwing a bitch-fit about her kids not cleaning up their messes. But, my toxicity/her lack of parenting abilities are another story entirely.

Now I live alone. My relationship has obviously fragmented, and the pieces we were still clinging to have finally been ground into dust as well. The only social life outside of workplace chit-chat I have is on my one weekend off a month (I work a 7-on/2-off rotating schedule) and I'm usually too drained to bother leaving the house. Grocery shopping and laundry are my adventures these days; I used to have time to go backpacking up North...A mostly-solo pursuit in and of itself.

I stay busy enough. I work a lot. I cook, clean, work out, read, watch movies, play video games. Hell, I pick up overtime at work at least twice a week less so for the extra money and moreso because I have nothing better to do.

The few idle moments I allow myself, are when the loneliness creeps in. Then I rush to finish my cigarette and get back to work, to keep my mind occupied from the depression that has become my bleak life.

Of those that used to, all of them have long, since many years, stopped. If I make a post on facebook, I'm lucky if one of them notices. The reason I keep them, at least many of them, is because they serve as relics from a time close to my heart. Most of them are folks I met when I was in college, or rather going to a college I was going to but never finished at. A lot of them don't even live in the US. I either met them when they were here as foreign exchange students, or they are friends of those folks that got referred to me. The last time anyone sent me a message on facebook out of their own free will was probably 2 years ago which was my ex. The rest of them are mere relics that live close to my heart but couldn't be more distant and stranger in reality. 

The last time anyone ever called me out of their own free will, barring immediate family, work related, or scams, was probably also a couple of years ago, and that was again my ex. My world started shrinking as I left college and as I lost my ex. It has been that way ever since. In general, I'm usually always the one to pick up the phone and call or text. It is for those reasons that I remember the friends and associates I have had, especially those that did call me to chat and invite me over, so fondly and in so much detail.

I've only recently started getting my life back together after taking a gap year at 17. Started working fulltime as a garbageman and started studying to become a fitness instructor.

My life is going well compared to the absolute shitshow it was just a few months ago, yet I still feel this emptiness inside. I'm going into therapy and trying to take care of myself, but nothing seems to get rid of that utter loneliness. Having no one to talk to or be with. Seeing everyone around you happy, doing things you want to as well. It's crushing.

My last abusive relationship ended 2 years ago (which led to the gap year) and I still have never experienced a normal, healthy relationship. Hell, I've only ever been infatuated and manipulated. 

I just want some friends to hang out with and someone special to share intimate moments with. Something as simple as a hug would mean the world to me right now. It's been years since I've been hugged by anyone and I don't know what it's like anymore.

1837,frik4nd3lbr00dj3,1618691268,1,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It‚Äôs also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won‚Äôt even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON‚ÄôT be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‚Äò!‚Äô as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

I wanted to do a sort of open rant sort of thing, and put it out into the universe incase there were others out there who felt the same so here goes!

I like to think of myself as a decent guy, and trust me, even saying that I recognize how cringe it sounds but hear me out. I'm your typical 6ft4 nerdy white boy glasses and all, I don't do any drugs, and only drink socially or when I feel like it. I'm one of those sensitive types who actually values the opinion of others maybe a little to much some times, a typical heart on my sleeve, show his emotions on his face kind of dude. In my opinion if your feeling something, show it, it's valid!

I've never been the type of guy to like sending or receiving nudes from anyone, frankly I get nothing from it, my thing is connection and conversation with people, like that has to be there no matter the topic. I do have a ""type"" I am attracted to but what really does it for me is getting to know someone before jumping into sex, therefore casual sex doesn't work for me and as nice as it's been to sext with people during the Covid years so far but Its getting a bit old. That connection is missing and I don't like it.

So my question is this: How have you guys dealt with all of this miss-connection and the different forms of dating we are facing now?

My best friend and I also drifted apart. School, different schedules, distance, etc. We used to talk and message each other everyday, agree on most things, mostly. We understood each other. Now he's gone as well. Knew him the longest.

I'm scared that I'll never experience the feeling of brotherhood again. I think it's affecting my grades and sleeping habits.

We used to work relatively close to each other, but a few weeks ago she switched positions and I‚Äôve barely talked to her since, used to talk to her everyday.

I thought things were going fine because I texted her the other day a video of my cat biting and clawing at my hand, she responded and everything seemed fine, I even managed to talked to her yesterday for a few minutes before work and still everything was fine.  Today however, we both go in (since it‚Äôs a Saturday shift we get different positions, I did manage to get a position closer to her for today), I walk up to her and say hi, and she is mad, I have no idea why, I decided not too push it and walk away, let her cool off.  A few minutes later, a supervisor tells me that she said that she does not want me approaching her or she will go to HR and file harassment on me.  WTF where did that come from? I‚Äôve been nothing but her friend since she started, even helped her at times when she was down, and she wants to throw that at me? 

Even one of her friends who also works here who she‚Äôs known longer than me was surprised at how angry she was.

1895,LaughingKookaburra91,1618652294,1,"A few days ago I met a very kind redditor. We chatted for a while and I felt truly understood. I opend up a little bit and told some personal information about me. I felt really happy and everything went quite well for a few days, but then they told me something that reminded me of someone I know irl. And I immediately began to have doubts. What if they are not who they pretend to be? What if someone I know irl found out my username on Reddit and makes fun of me and laugh at my naivety? How could I really believe that someone was truly interested in me? I was so overwhelmed and afraid that I brake off contact and deleted my Reddit Account (and created a new one). Now I feel really bad about it, because I probably hurt them.

I have serious trust issues and often get downright paranoid. There is no rational reason to react like this, but my emotions simply take over. On the one hand, I desperately want someone I can trust and share my feelings with. But on the other hand, I am really afraid that someone might hurt me. It's always like this: when I finally have something good in my life, I just destroy it. Like a small flame. Instead of adding some wood and turning the flame into a fire, I just swallow it. Sometimes I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again :(

1896,Tyrionskysword,1618647368,1,"Rocket was fucking incredible. He was a norwegian forrest cat and was 80% fluff. He was never a pet, he just liked living in my house with me. Hed hunt squirrels and bring them home, which wasnt so great, but he was badass. In play fights, full grown men have backed down from him. No doubt ever in mind, he loved me as much as I loved him. When I was sad, hed just sit down next to me and wrap his front legs around my wrist and nuzzle his head into my palm. He was my best friend, was just me and him.

And then one day, I found him broken in pieces by the side of the road after a car had hit him. And I broke too. It was a year ago this month, and Ive not stopped grieving, I just miss him all the time.

Since then, ive just not really cared about anything, or myself. He was the one nice part of life, and then he was gone.

I struggle to sleep because the image of him just cold and broken is only ever 2 thoughts away from the front of my brain. It hits me at work, or anytime Im not focusing on something.

Ive never done well with relationships, or friendships really, but Rocket was my boy. It was me and him against the world. And then, it wasnt. I still talk to him, I tell him how much I miss him, how much I love him. Ill never stop loving him, he was such a perfect little prince.

The happiest Ive ever been was when an ex and I were snuggled, Rocket had jumped inbetween us. My ex said ""were like a lil family"" and I dont recall ever being so content. Within a few months, the partner in question switched up sexualitu, crippling my self confidence on thier way out, and then soon after rocket was gone. I know ill never feel that contentness again, as In 35 and Id never felt it before, just that 1 time. But my boy is gone, and I cant ever unsee him how I found him. Ill never feel that contentness again.

Im nit asking for a quick fix off anyone, thats not how life works. I just, I dont have anyone, and I needed to say it somewhere. I miss you rocket, I love you, and I will until my heart stops. He was the most handsome little prince.",lonely,"A year ago, my cat died.",2021-04-17 18:16:08

I even try  messaging more explicit accounts thinking the illusion of sexuality would make me make friends with these people i message. Even that doesn't work. It seems there's no real group of people i can talk to. I use these pen pals of mine as real friends to substitute the lack of any in my real life as i assume alot of people do. It hurts that even these relationship i can't maintain. A person i recently added on snap unadded me out of nowhere i wonder if he was consumed in shame about our friendship. His post i responded to was about how he felt ashamed to beg for friends online and it saddens me that people so desperate for friends as I am would rather be alone than maintain any connection with me. And another person begging for some sort of role play of a relationship where we admit love to each other so we it can fill this void in her and i placated it thinking this would be a friend. But it was a lie to myself it wasn't only me trying make friends but also an escape from my ldr who i care so much for. When me and her would fight or argue about anything i would just feel so alone seeing this one person i can come to no matter is being aggressive and mean towards me.

For one thing, most of my friends were seniors last year and the last time I saw them was before lockdown. Well now this year, I'm a senior and all my friends (except one) graduated or moved. This one friend that I still had (we'll call her M) is way too nice and I feel like I'm only dragging her down. I don't want to though. She knows how lonely and quiet and closed off I can be around kids, and whenever she sees me she always **ALWAYS** comes over and makes sure I have someone to sit/talk/each lunch with, even if it means she has to leave her other friends.

I'm so grateful for M, but every time she provides me with company, it's not the same anymore. We can't even have a full conversation; it's like there's nothing to talk about. it's just awkward and I honestly think that M would be lot happier with her other friends. That's why I feel like I've been dragging her down. I have nothing to give her from our friendship. Nothing to offer. I'm actually considering, just not showing up so that she can be with her friends. 

And yes, I've tried hanging with her along with her other friends and I tried to speak up, for once, and be a part of the conversation. And I've tried branching out and finding other kids to possibly make friends with, but nothing works. My school's too clique-y and I'm not popular.

Looking for

* Someone who also gets lonely from time to time. Who also struggles with friendships and doesn't have that many people to talk to. Maybe we can boost each other's egos, even if it is a bit selfish. We could push each other to form healthier habits like being consistent with our workouts or diets, avoiding bad thoughts. Encouragement would be great.

Not looking for

* Anything degenerate or lust provoking, they promote a lot of negativity. I'm not that much into anime or play that many video games, but if you do that's cool, maybe we can watch or play something sometime. I'm not too comfortable with Voice chats, I'm always an awkward mess.

But I have a strict dating policy, and I don‚Äôt even consider dating anyone I couldn‚Äôt imagine spending my life with. Dating without intention for marriage is dating for eventual pain for both parties. I‚Äôve never enjoyed the company of any other person enough to want that, they just never fit what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner.

I just want intimacy; to be close with someone who shares my interests and values. I just want to be held, more than anything else.

1961,useruser6777,1618615911,1,"I've never been a very productive person but lately, I've started becoming quite miserable. I've started losing motivation and everything that I used to enjoy feels rather empty and joyless. Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time, but instead of the joy that I used to feel, I feel frustration. I'm aware of the fact that something should change I just simply don't know what or how. The only reason why I'm still able to lift a finger and not just lay around rotting away is that time passes faster while doing something. And by doing something I don't mean something new. And that's probably a major issue here, I don't know how to start and I don't know how not to lose interest in ""something new"". 

I've always been somewhat unproductive and found it very hard to seriously start doing anything for a longer period of time but it wasn't that bad until now. My reason for sinking this low is because my girlfriend, who I was together with for almost 4 years, has suddenly broken up with me, and I haven't even fully grasped what has happened and how big of an impact it will have on my life. All my plans for the future? Shattered. All of these years, plans and feelings poured into it just for everything to reset in a blink of an eye. She was the only person I've been regularly talking to, and the only person i was able to be completely honest with. I've lost the most important person in my life. I've never felt this alone in my entire life. Sometimes i feel so powerless and useless that I don't even feel like myself, or better yet, don't even feel human anymore, just an empty shell sitting around. I didn't even know a human could feel this way.

I don't know how to find myself. Like with everything I've ever done, I don't even know where to start. It was always hard for me to find motivation, and ""keeping"" it was even harder, but after something like this, I have to rebuild everything from 0, and I'm simply just so lost. I suppose i cant be sitting around like this forever sooner or later I must start doing something. I didn't specify many things about myself because there is nothing too relevant. I don't have too many hobbies or passions and the ones i do have are at level 1. How should I approach this and what should I do? But most importantly how to stay motivated, what's the process of starting something, and not giving up, keeping a steady pace, and achieving something?

1975,Acceptable-Plate-338,1618610003,1,"First of all, I have no real interest in pursuing a serious relationship, for many, many reasons. However, I still fall in love. I fall fast and I fall hard.

It's hard to express, but the whole experience of falling in love throws me into a deep, deep depression. I know that no amount of contact with the person, or being around them, or talking to them, could ever be enough to satisfy me. Any contact is just a jumping off point for further desires that are bound to go unfulfilled. I become lost without them and despondent until I can see them again. Then, for a brief moment -- euphoria, like a drug -- before I settle back into despair.

I long to share everything of myself with the person, but know that I am a mere blip on the radar of their lives, insignificant, barely noticed. I'll never be important to them. They have a whole world without me in it. That depresses me too.

I am in love now (remotely, because of COVID), and it's particularly bad because I know this person through a work committee, and that committee will disband in a few weeks, and I may never see her again. It was foolish to fall for someone without any hope of reciprocation or friendship or even continued contact.

And to paraphrase Radiohead, she's an angel, a genuinely good, patient, kind, generous person who would do anything to help someone else, and she talks to me even though she has no professional obligation to do so. And I'm, well, a creep. A weirdo. Even if a universe existed in which we had a chance, she deserves someone far better than me.

I‚Äôm an introvert and very shy so I really enjoy being alone sometimes so at first I didn‚Äôt really care about this. But now it‚Äôs been 7 months and it‚Äôs starting to get boring. It‚Äôs so painfully boring everyday. I try to do something everyday like going for a bike ride or for a walk or something but i‚Äôm always alone and it‚Äôs just so fucking boring. I have no one to talk to so it‚Äôs just me and my thoughts. I just don‚Äôt know what should I do, everything is so boring alone. And I have tried so many things and I have done exercise and stuff and it kinda helps but it‚Äôs still so boring.

The thing that makes this even worse is knowing that my ‚Äùfriends‚Äù that I have known for 10+ years just left me out of nowhere and they are partying and having the time of their lives meanwhile i‚Äôm just sitting in my room listening to music. And music is the only thing that brings me happiness right now and I simply can‚Äôt live without it. 

Sometimes one of my ‚Äùfriends‚Äù that I used to be best friends with randomly calls me or texts me asking me how i‚Äôm doing and i just say i‚Äôm fine. Then he says that he wants to hangout with me tomorrow and i say sure. Then the day comes and instead he hangs out with other people. And he has done this like 5 times.

The horrors of being ""a good listener"". I hear people out on whatever they want to talk about, whatever is on their mind, I engage, I ask questions, give advice, make jokes even and I've always been called a great listener.

But whenever I talk about anything not related to who I'm talking to, every single person I've ever known tunes out or outright cuts me off within less than a minute of speaking. Parents, friends, girlfriends, my now ex-wife. For the longest time, I thought this was normal and didn't think too deeply about it, but since the separation I've been thinking - *I* do better than that regularly. Why the hell can't anyone else? I keep hoping there are better people out there (in more ways than this) because otherwise I'll be so fucking depressed I don't know how to go on, but I've yet to ever talk to any. It's a horrible feeling like you *need* people but no one ever really gave a shit about you.

Separated, no friends, working from home with no colleagues. I have absolutely no one anymore except for my kids, who are still very young. So I tried posting several times on reddit, various things in various subreddits, even with different accounts.

Unlike everyone else my age, you never see me with friends or family doing activities, drinking or just hanging out. I'm boring by default

i hate when my friends tell me that ""anyone would be lucky to be with you!"" ""you are honestly the prettiest one in our friend group, you shouldnt worry about it."" then wtf is wrong with me then?? if im so great and im so beautiful, whats the problem???

The main problem that is bothering me is an extreme body dysmorohia and eating disorders.

It feels like if I get skinny or fit enough people will notice me and sadly it is true.

In my life I basically had two ‚Äúglow ups‚Äù. I‚Äôll explain... :
First one was when I was pretty much a kid 13-14yo. I was overweight until 13 - my only friends were food and video games and when all of that teenagery puberty bullshit hit and bullying started I became body dysmorphic and went to extreme anorexia type weight loss. I was actually sick, like my body was fucked up by so much weight loss, but I loved how people commented on how good I looked... I was finally seen for the first time. Girls wanted to be like me, asked for tips, tried to befriend me. Guys were pretty immature at the time (still somehow at that ‚Äúew girls‚Äù phase in my class) but still showed more attention to me AND what was the most fucked up thing is that teachers even praised my weight loss too (remember the fact that I was anorexic thin, not just skinny...).

Anyways life hit me, I had to recover and I swung to the other side of pendulum - I was going through hard time and I started binge eating and seeling comfort in food again. That of course lead me to weight gain. And you guessed it! People just wanished. No more skinny me - no more interest from others. I tried to go back to being skinny which lead me to have binge and restrict cycles. Some people even made fun of me that I gained weight. I developed social anxiety which just made everything even worse - I actually ended up homeschooled because I just couldnt be in public places anymore. It continued till i was 17. 

On 2019 I managed to ‚Äúget back to it‚Äù. Started working out again. This time I lost weight in a bit more healthy way, but still it was pretty extreme. At the start of 2020 I was lean and fit. And you guessed it! I got compliments from people again. This time tho - it was my neighbors from my neighborhood. They told me how I was a little thick in the past and how good I looked now. I even ended up with a girlfriend from dating app and I got lots of attention from random guys (I am a lesbian but I still enjoyed that).
Fast forward to september - i had a slip up and emotional break down - binge eating again, all weight back up again, same fucking people ignoring me again. Loneliness again...

Im seriously contemplaiting on starving myself now again. Im still in my binge eating period but the loneliness and mean people are getting old to me...

I thought we'll finally have a game we can play together since most of the time I'm playing games on consoles while he is a total PCMR. I told him to download the game (He had it in his steam library even though he never played it) because it is 100GB of files and his Wi-Fi is pretty slow.

Today I called him to see if he downloaded the game overnight. He did. The problem is... He wasn't interested to play with me anymore. Turns out he invited few of his discord friends to play with him and they started doing some heists. They had a full set of people and no free slot for me.

Most people would just move on, maybe call someone else to play and didn't really care. That's what I wanted to do originally. Then I realized... I don't have any fucking friends except him! I knew him since we were kids and we didn't see each other for a long time so I thought he'll be more than happy to spend some time with me. But apparently I'm replaceable and disposable. I know I'm overreacting, but that's the truth. He doesn't care anymore and I see this in his behavior. I guess I'm slowly losing my only friend and from now on I'll be alone.

To those who actually care, 

I served in the United States Military from 2005-2011, in that time I deployed 3 times to some of the most dangerous places in the world. I was faced with the threat of death on front line FOB‚Äôs every day, and witnessed the lowest of the low that humanity can bring to bear with one another. After my departure from the military, I struggled day in and day out, trying to recover funds that were stolen from me, after having my identity stolen while overseas. Having the banks tell me that should I continue to pursue recovery of over 100,000 dollars of my life savings that they would take legal action against me. The horror of coming home and finding out that everything you saved for, every penny you put back was gone, with no recourse to recoup the lost monies. To further live with the threat of homelessness, and in an abusive situation, struggling day and night to make ends meet, while living with your abuser. When finally you have reached your breaking point, and were able to get away, only to have had to have part of your whole world torn asunder and treated as a second class citizen. 

All I am trying to do is recover, even a small part, of who I was. To find my peace, to find my place of tranquility.  I know that I will continue to go through up‚Äôs and down‚Äôs. That life is not easy, never was, and we all struggle at some point in time. What I want more then anything is a place I can call my own, a place to tranquility, of refuge, that I can heal, and potentially have my family there with me to grow, and heal. 

After nearly a decade of fighting for benefits from the Veterans Administration, I was finally awarded a disability benefit, that while not substantial is enough for me to live off of. But, it comes at a cost, I will never be able to find my place of refuge, my place of solace and healing. I will never be able to afford to purchase a home, with land, to grow in, to die in. That dream is but a bitter sweet taste that is unobtainable, since I am of limited means, without the ability to work, to supplement my hopes, and further my dreams.

Every day is a nightmare, a hollow, stale struggle to find hope, peace, contentment. To have risked so much, and to only ask for a place that I can truly call my own, to afford a home that I can live in without loss of pride in self, community, family. I have struggled for nearly a decade with this, the death of my dream to never again be able to own my own home on a small piece of property to grow old on, and perish on. To find that place that will give me pride in self, to heal those wounds that have cut myself so deep, and left scars though some of which are unseen but felt the hardest. 

I torment myself almost every day, looking at homes, and home plans that I can never afford, that I can never have. It brings me to tears thinking of all the sacrifice in my life, and the loss, only to come away empty handed, without hope of at least completing a small portion of my hopes and dreams. I have lost so much of myself, of who I am, of who I could have been. Though small glimpses of myself are still visible in the fog, the haziness, the ether, it is only but a shadow pale hollow and slight. 

I guess what I want more then anything else is a place I can take pride in, a place to call my own. I have spent hours, and hours pouring over properties, and plans, calculating the costs always coming back to the same conclusion, that it will never be, that I will eventually end up on the street. That my fate is sealed, determined, and stagnant. I have reached out since separating from service, for assistance, for anything. To often it is met with those thanking me for my service, which at this point feels more like a hollow gesture for them to make themselves feel better. Than an actual thanks. I have reached out for assistance for programs to that build homes for disabled veterans, only to be turned away because I am not ‚Äúinjured‚Äù enough to be a publicity topic, to garner more donations to them. I have reached out to ‚Äúveteran friendly‚Äù companies asking for assistance/ direction, only to be turned away as I am not a donatable entity. I was sent by the very foundation that was meant to assist veterans to a drug treatment facility, despite not being or needing drug rehabilitation assistance. I have reached out and always seem to have my hand slapped away, turned aside, rebuffed, or ignored. I have lost my hope, every day weighs heavier and heavier on me, as the longing for a place to call my own, for a place of refuge weighs heavily on my heart. I have no where else to turn to. I have no other recourse, no other action, no other hope. 

I no longer know who to turn to, I no longer know what to feel, as I feel as though I have lost the very fire, light, carrying me through and to the next day, if you know would you help? Would you ignore the plea? As so many others have? Would you give a hollow sentiment with no action? I am at a loss for what to do and what direction to go into.

Thank you for reading this.

(I hope this post is allowed and that it's not offensive I post it here to ask for feedback)

I'm finishing up my book which I've written for anyone who is finding themselves at a lonely place. It has socializing tips (specific to when you're lonely) and soothing tips to help you while your work to jump back out of the spiral and an overall ""straight to the point"" but kind and warm vibe. 

My concern is with the title. In my head this book was always named ""The little handbook for the lonely times in life"" however, it's starting to dawn on me, that people who are feeling lonely might either feel self-conscious about buying the book at a physical place or feel depressed instead of empowered by picking up a book with a little like that and might skip giving it a try just to avoid that ping of sadness and uncomfortableness.

What is your opinion on a title like that? And if you would be interested in a small book on the subject (because even then, it might not be interesting to everybody feeling lonely either) would this title discourage you?

Loneliness can feel like you are a piece of fruit that's been cut from the tree. 

Just like a discarded apple, I feel like I am rotting, literally rotting, from the inside out. My disconnect from society is so severe that it's like necrosis of the very soul.

Maybe it was because I was deprived from friendship for so long. My mom was always paranoid about me going out, so I always had to stay home for years without really being out with my friends. 

Eventually, I was allowed to go out with friends. I‚Äôm lucky to have a big group of friends who always talk to each other in the group chat and we hang out every week (not all of us at the same time since corona) and it‚Äôs great, but even with them around, I always feel lonely. Even on the moments where every single person is paying attention to me while I talk, I feel lonely. 

Loneliness is one of the worst feelings I have ever felt, and it just makes me feel like shit and that no one cares about me. I can‚Äôt help feeling like no one likes me cause I‚Äôm too wild and crazy, and it really stresses me out.

99 percent of my friends are capable of having someone feel the same way for them, while I, funnily enough, have had crushes on my friends and not one liked me back. I mean sure, they're my friends and all, but I don't see how I'm supposed to approach a random lady and start flirting with her, especially seeing as I wouldn't be as close with her as some of my friends. I just want to make sure it'll last some time.




It pains me to see my friends brag on social media about their relationship that's lasted 2 1/2 years, it pains me to be asked the question, ""have you ever had a girlfriend?"" It pains me to hear about the really intimate details of how you and your boy/girlfriend fucked that one time, or three times, or more. It even pains me to witness, or even overhear sex scenes on TV. The soft moaning- the soft ""ahh yeah baby right there, faster faster yes yes yes baby please,"" the dirty talking, the describing of sex positions all fucks me up.





Everything makes it seem so straightforward and yet, I'm still yet to experience the 1st step. Sure I may be 17, and people tell me I have my whole life to go, but I don't know what's gonna happen to me after I graduate, and seeing people do things like each other makes me feel behind, like I'm not good enough. Like there's something morbidly wrong with me that everyone just telepathically communicates to each other, telling other to avoid me for, what?




I don't know how to properly express the way I feel, let alone deal with it. It just sucks to see the people you've had and currently have crushes on just to find love while you're over here just wanting to jump off a bridge, blow your brains out, cut yourself, bash your head against a metal pole really hard, you just want to hurt yourself because you don't know what the fuck else to do. I know for me, I want to go to a small island in the middle of the sea and just cry there. I won't even  bother taking anyone with me because I know that no one will be any help.





Maybe I should try to accept it. Just, say, ""I was born into this world without the proper fundamentals and charisma to be able to find a girlfriend, and that is okay."" I figure if I learn just to not feel love anymore, then everything will be okay.




I mean it's not like I feel loved by my family, and no one else is gonna love me. May as well, right?",lonely,I don't like it when people that have been in relationships try to relate to me.,2021-04-16 17:50:10

I thought he actually wanted to get to know me because it didn‚Äôt seem to me like he wanted sex) then we finally have sex, my first time, and he tells me mid foreplay that he can tell that I thought we were headed toward a relationship and that he never wanted that. I was stupid to think that he actually wanted to get to know me. I feel like everyone always talks about how guys just want sex and blah blah blah but he seemed genuine and not sex motivated. He later admitted that he only went on Hinge (where we met) because he just wanted a hookup.
I‚Äôve seen a few other people, but most of them blatantly just want sex and dip out when they realize I won‚Äôt have sex whenever they want (sex is really painful for me honestly and I don‚Äôt enjoy it so I‚Äôm not keen on hookups or anything like that). I had two close girl friends a year ago when the pandemic started, but one dropped me and I dropped the other. Neither of them would have considered me to be their best friends, but I would‚Äôve considered them both mine. The one that I dropped I had to pay $80 to help me move twice (she lived literally a 10 min drive away and I just needed help from someone with a big car. It hardly involved any driving as my storage unit was around less than 2 miles from my apartment both times. didn‚Äôt involve lifting furniture or anything, I literally just needed a car to move my boxes of clothes) and when I took her off my private snap story because of what a shitty friend she was to me she flipped out at me how she ‚Äúhelped me move‚Äù so I owed her friendship. This is also the same friend who, when I was fainting and having constant dizzy spells, nausea, and breathing issues after having covid, instead of letting me pick her up for like 20 minutes on any day of her choice just so I could feel safe walking outside to get the pictures I needed for photography class, told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like leaving my house anytime soon. Just call an ambulance if you faint again‚Äù.

My point in this whole rant is I‚Äôve never had a friend in my entire life that cares about me and actually values me as a friend. Most of my home friends ignored my facetimes and texts when i left for college, so I eventually just gave up. None of the guys I see stick around.

Video games - Zelda is my fav series. I love dark souls, rogue likes, well crafted games. I also enjoy some multiplayer stuff to be social. Warzone, apex legends, various multiplayer games. I‚Äôm always willing to give something a try if you want to play with me!

Lawncare - I‚Äôm obsessed with my lawn. Like no one shares this interest but I‚Äôll put it here just in case some crazy person also loves lawn stripes hahahaha.

Pro wrestling - I love following people wrestling and watching engaging storylines. My fav is AEW. I enjoy dynamite every Wednesday and love almost all the wrestlers. I would love someone to watch wrestling with. Maybe some day go to a show together even!

Paranormal research/stories - I love listening to podcasts about a whole range of paranormal topics. Whether it be ghosts, ufos, mysteries I am interested. What happened to DB cooper? Is Bigfoot real? Are ghosts real? Are ufos visitors from other worlds or secret government projects or neither? Someday I would love to start a podcast with someone and talk about this stuff each episode :D

Making YouTube videos - I make YouTube videos but nobody really watches them and it‚Äôs fine. I love recording and editing stuff. I love being proud of something I created and video editing is my creative outlet.

I‚Äôm interested in all kinds of other stuff and love learning about new stuff as well! If you want to chat and hopefully be friends just let me know! Thank you for reading this!",lonely,29m married with kids in NC. Looking for people with similar interests to talk to!!,2021-04-16 09:28:45

He seemed like a good guy who seemed fairly interested in me, both platonically and romantically, so I decided to say hey, and invite him to ""my"" community, which doesn't even feel like it's my own these days.

He liked the vibe he got from it, and that made me happy to see someone else happy about something I just can't enjoy anymore. I didn't think much of it until recently, until I checked up on him and he now suddenly had a fuckton of mutual friends from my server, and almost would never respond to me anymore, and when he did he'd claim everything was okay when it's really not. 

I really try not to be spiteful person so I refuse to get mad at him or ban him for no reason, something to that effect. But jealousy is a bitch, so the regret of inviting him really set in. Is it wrong that I really feel I should've just not invited him and kept him all to myself? Maybe.

Sounds kinda dumb and I get why but I‚Äôm honestly not looking forward to going back out in some respects when bars and eventually down the line clubs open back up.

Being single during a pandemic I think has kinda messed with me honestly. I‚Äôm also not looking forward to dating again.

Trying to talk to girls in a bar or club is hard enough for guys as it is but after a pandemic with limited social interaction and also the amount of self confidence issues I have in my ability and appearance will probably make it 10x harder.

2133,Jack_stranger,1618510266,1,"I had just asked out my friend to be my girlfriend and she said yes...

As the weeks continued, homecoming was around the corner and we decided to go to the dance and my girl was pretty photo shy, because she didn't think she was pretty so I'd take pics all the time just to prove to her I thought she was beautiful and I even changed her contact name on my phone to ""my beautiful girlfriend"". Either way at the dance she didn't really feel like dancing so we sat I on the bench row, nearly the entire time and ww danced for one slow song, where we kissed genuinely for the 2nd time because the 1st was not really that good and rushed, either way when the dance was over I walked her home and we kissed again and I left home.

Our relationship grew and grew, soon she wasn't photo shy anymore and accepted being my beautiful girlfriend, we went to football games together,basketball, concerts, and it was amazing. Around a certain time she had told me her dad is a satanist and he would yell at her and take away her phone for not doing certain things. She was put through a lot of stress and she told me that being with me helped her not worry about that, I always told her ""I'll always be there to hold you, and don't be afraid to vent"", and she at times did, I did my best to help her out and comfort her when I got the chance. In like 2018 she wrote me these notes and would slip them into my pocket when we hugged. She wasn't really slick, since it was very noticeable but I played along and read them at home.

I swear I smiled so much reading them, it nearly made me tear up knowing someone loved me so much and needed me..

I loved her so much and she loved me and even went as far as to say she was my future wife, and would love it when I addressed her as my wife when said our goodbyes before I got on the bus home since I lived 5 miles away and she lives near the school, so everyday I'd see her smile just getting off the bus and telling her ""I love you"".

There was a time on time off during Thanksgiving break, I was being stressed by my parents and such, we texted and she said she missed me so much and I missed her too, so I said what if I told you I'm walking over there and she said don't its hot and I'd be walking next to a highway and I said ok. Still was going and we texted and I had been walking for nearly 3 hrs and my legs hurt a lot since I had been walking in like a ditch the whole time and it was hot, but she was wanting to call and I didn't want to spoil the surprise so I withheld the call and started running and when I finally got near her house I said ok we can call now and we did video calls so I showed her, her house and said surprise. She was shocked and said ""hold on, let me get my shoes"", her dad wasn't home so I knew she could come out and I walked over to a bench near the school and sat, to recover a bit and I see her running over as fast as she could, I stood up and she kept running toward me and nearly tackled me, hugging me and saying why would you walk this far for me and I said because your my girl and I love you. We continued hugging and talking. Then like 20 or 30 minutes later it was getting dark and she had to go so we kissed and said I walked her home and said goodbye. I started walking home, legs still hurting a lot, my parents didn't believe I walked, and it was very dark so I continued walking and a police car saw me and said what I was doing and I said ""going home"" and they picked me up and drove me there and that was it. 

Believe it or not I walked liked 3 more times, it was worth the pain, to see her smile, and I don't regret it one bit...

We ended up moving into a smaller house, a rental. It‚Äôs very cramped, so my dad said I could keep some of my shoes that were out of season in his office. Today I noticed that several pairs of my summer shoes were missing, so I started tearing the house apart. All I kept finding was his shit and it sent me spiraling. I started hyperventilating and having chest pains; my brother found me trying to throw a nasty old pair of boots with holes out and luckily helped talk me down.

I hate talking about myself and I hate saying the word 'I'. Makes me feel full of myself when I talk about such things. But screw it, I suppose. 

Don't have much family left, hate to say. Became an orphan about a year ago. Things only got worse from there. Had to move. Dropped out of highschool for a while. The loneliness was unbearable for a while. Eventually met another drop out. He took me out partying all the time. Taught me things. Important things. Taught me how to be a suave talker. Taught me how to party. Taught me many, many things. But he moved away. The only time I can talk to him now is on xbox. Went back to highschool. Took a while to become accepted in such a rural school. Came in from the city. People was afraid I was bad news. Not necessarily wrong. 

Became accepted after about nine months of class. Finally liked by a lot of the school. Yet I still feel so disconnected.

So the question is, what should I do? What is there to do when friends are like paper in water and life is a storm that promises nothing else but more storms and life just feels lonely? Loneliness, from my experience, has to be one of the, if not the most, agonizing emotions to ever feel. It's like an echoing chamber filled with cold whispers from the past- a past where I didn't feel so lonely. They whisper of a past where I was just like every other kid and I could go out into the warm July air and fill my lungs with the scent of life, breathing it in and treasuring every bit of it. But it's ironic because the tune of a happy past certainly isn't very happy as it pounds against my eardrums, taunting me with ideas of what used to be and what could be until they break through and seize my thoughts, violating every wrinkle of my brain until all I feel is the very emotion that I despise. 

I guess that you can have friends and still feel alone. You can have lots of them and still feel the same. you can have millions and nothing will change. But why is that? I have a hand full of great friends whom I keep in contact with on a daily basis, despite us now living far apart. And I'm lucky for that. So why is it that I feel like this?

And then I realized that I haven't felt love in years. I haven't felt the warm touch of a significant other since I was about fifteen. I haven't had the option of cuddling with someone and just feeling loved. Sex is cool, I guess, but I'd rather just feel loved. I just want someone that I can enjoy my time with. I just want to love someone and have them love me back.

He's clean and in a good spot now, and there are a lot of factors that allowed him to get to where he is, but he credits his girlfriend as one of the major factors to getting him clean. Now I'm a fan of this guy and genuinely happy to see him clean and happy, but he was an absolute basketcase. Notorious for having a bad attitude, self admittedly drank alcohol sunup to sundown, and  even attacked another wrestler at a show once. Even in the middle of all these problems he manages to meet a girl that can see through all that and see the real him. Not to get too incely, but of course he's tall, jacked, and conventionally handsome. Nobody's owed anything, but if you're an average or below looking guy, that's also a basketcase, no sane woman is going to touch you with a ten foot pole.

I've had similar issues to this guy, not quite on his level, but I honestly believe if I had a genuine woman in my life it would solve most of my issues. I don't see why I would have any reason to remain unmotivated and depressed if I had someone in my life that truly loved and cared for me. A few years ago I did find the motivation to start working out and work on my mental health and I was the healthiest I've been in my life. I did have some luck meeting girls, but ultimately nothing ever went anywhere. The quality and quantity of woman interested in me steadily got lower and lower, and it lead to me getting depressed and not caring anymore. Instead of working out most nights I started hitting the bottle, and have put all the weight I lost back on.

I'm not expecting a girlfriend to come into my life and coddle me back to a positive mental state. I understand a relationship is a two way street. But if I was in a normal genuine relationship, I don't see why I would still be in this funk. And I understand the majority of this is on me to get my own head right, and I'm trying.

A couple years ago I lost my one and only (best) friend. Since then I didn't have anyone to speak to and be with. This troubled me especially during Summer, when I went out and saw happy people everywhere (not even social media)

What did I do? I just went out and started walking, I first did this in a park near my home, I walked and walked for hours and enjoyed the weather, green, etc

I then expanded to my whole neighborhood and walked and walked, one thing that I started doing is to follow girls that I liked to see where they live (AND IT IS AND NEVER HAS BEEN MY INTENTION TO HARM THEM!) I honestly have no clue why I did this but I think because I just longed companionship and knowing where girls live brought me a little step closer (well idk....) but I must say that it gives me a nice kick when I do that

Apparently it is surprisingly easy to find the person who lives there, I check the last name and am able to find who they are, how old, where they work (if they do), where they go to school, their social media etc within a week

Sitting home for a day already drives me crazy, ""this is the time that you should enjoy and not sit fucking home"" so I go out and as I have nothing to do anyways I stumble back on this weird habit of following girls in the hope that we somehow end up together 

I am aware that when I will think back to this time when I am 30, it'll hurt me, I still have the chance to do something now but it's just so difficult... it's driving me crazy... I am so fucking hopeless 

There have been quite a few sunny days and when I went out, seeing a lot of happy couples together, friends who laugh with each other, and even groups of people that walk together, it just hurts, it feels like my heart gets punched, parks full of people (yes corona but no one gives a fuck here), cars full of friends driving around, people going to the beach, etc",lonely,I am getting fucked in my head,2021-04-16 00:23:52

2161,codecrunchie,1618493718,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention.

My friend is a rigid planner so I feel like she got better offers and just cast me off twice, because she doesn‚Äôt ever forget about plans she‚Äôs made with other people. Idk. It just feels like I did something special for one of my only friends and she doesn‚Äôt care bc she knew I was making the dessert. The cupcakes were going to be a surprise.

2166,jellyonbagel,1618491828,1,"I made a new account just to post here since my main account has a username I use everywhere.

I don't know if I'm able to put my feelings into words here, but I'll try. This post talks a lot about my current romantic relationship and about times when I didn't feel lonely, so heads up if you don't want to read about that. And also when I talk about the times a few years back, I am aware I was an awful dumb kid and I should not treat people like I did.

This will also probably be extremely boring to read. Most of this stuff is completely irrelevant and just about stuff a few years back. I just need to talk about everything, all this is starting to build up and I feel like I'm going to explode because I really don't have the ability to open up to people.

I'll put a long dash where I start to talk about my loneliness if you want to skip all those paragraphs about my past social life and how my current relationship came to be.

This is going to be a total mess but I just want to vent somewhere.

I am almost 21 years old and currently 3 years into a great relationship with my girlfriend whom I love very much. We have pretty much planned our future together and she's great in every way possible and deep down I know she's the one. The beginning of our relationship is incredibly messy and hard to explain but I'll try to do that. For the story's sake let's call my girlfriend Q. Basically in 2017 I had a pretty close group of friends (in retrospect that friend group was extremely toxic) and one of the girls in that group, let's call her X, had a birthday party where she invited a few girls I had not met before, one of which was Q. X and I had messed around before and in general our friendship was really weird. So the evening progresses and at like 1 am me and Q end up laying on a couch together. X sees this and calls Q's friend to come and pick Q up, pretty much out of jealousy. Some time passes and Q and I start talking and I come to find out she's going to another country as an exchange student for a year in autumn. I'm bummed out because I had begun to like her quite a bit, even though I kinda wanted to be free to do what I want. Summer passes and there is drama between the rest of the friend group and X so we cut ties with X. There was also Drama between Q and X, because of me, so Q and X are no longer friends. As I said me and X had an odd 'friendship', she pretended like she didn't give a shit about me even though she pretty much wanted to own me. 

So now it's autumn and Q leaves to another country for a year. Obviously, we were both free to do whatever we wanted, but for some reason, we agreed to tell each other when we hook up with other people or do anything of that nature. For transparency I guess, but thinking back, a really shit idea. So the first thing I do is mess around with a girl at a party. I tell Q, she's understandably upset. This pattern continues more than enough times. At one point I got into a short relationship with a girl at a new school where I had just started that year. Since she wanted to be with me all the time at school, I lost all the friends I had made there, due to my incapability to maintain social connections. Even during that time, I talked to Q about things I should not talk about when in a relationship with another person. Q had/has much better morals than I, so she did not want to listen to my whining about how much I like her since she knew I was in a relationship.

At this point, some time has passed since I broke up with that girl from my school, and I and Q are on talking terms, well not for long. One of the friends in that original friend group had begun talking to X again and invited her to one of our parties. Before I began drinking I was sure nothing would happen between me and X, but yeah, we only made out, but that was more than enough for Q and she didn't want anything to do with me from that point on. After a few months though, we start talking again, she had had some action for herself overseas, but we mostly laughed it off because it wasn't anything too serious and she certainly was not an ass about it like I had been to her about my doings. Things are going well between us. But then in May, only like 2 months before Q is coming back home, me and X meet at a party again and this time do much more than the last time we saw. Q is mortified, because like the little shit I am, I had talked to her about how much I want to be with her and all that good stuff.

At that time Q had started to have a crush on a dude overseas where she was and spent a lot of time with him. Of course, she told me all about it since we had agreed to. A few days before she was going to fly back home I did not hear from her for many hours, then she texted me saying she was over at the dude's house and they had hooked up. I cried like a bitch even though I had no right to be sad or angry after what I had done to her all year.

But yeah, she flies back home, we mostly sort things out over the summer and weirdly enough start dating. Obviously, it has not been smooth sailing for us, but we both have grown a lot and I have learned so much from her about how to be even a decent human being. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings and communicating is in general hard for me so I am pretty much the bottleneck of our relationship, but she understands and helps me in all the ways she can. All things considered, our relationship is really healthy.

I have spent the last year inside my home like everyone else, but I can't stand being in the same space with my family anymore. They are working from home and talking on the phone all the time, which drives me crazy. They are always on my neck about when I'm going to work even though I worked the whole winter in a general goods store, but my anxiety could not handle that job anymore so I quit a while back. I know that I'm getting a spot in a college and I don't give a shit about anything else than starting school when summer is over and moving to another city alone, so my family asking about jobs makes me want to scream.

I know most people have had it much worse, but this pandemic has been absolutely ass for me. I've lost most of my friends during the last couple of years, since maintaining social connections is quite difficult for me let alone making new friends, I have no idea how people make new friends. The only person I spend time with is my girlfriend and I have one friend who I see about once a month, but he has a bunch of other friends and a girlfriend also so I don't feel like a priority. He is a good friend and I am really glad to have him, but he doesn't seem interested in things going on in my life, he never asks questions like I try to do when he tells me things about his life. You might think that I'm stupid since I have a girlfriend to talk to about stuff, but that is not enough.

I have started to look back on days when I was like 14 and we played GTA 5 online with my friends at that time, and when I was a little younger and we use to spend all our days on a Minecraft server building a city while talking in voice chat. Those memories almost make me cry because these days I have no one to play games with, so I can't talk to anyone even in discord or something. That one friend I have plays a lot and he has friends he plays games with, but he has never invited me with them, nor do I want to since we don't play similar online games. We do play those fun party-type Nintendo switch games when we meet, and it's a blast, but I miss those good old days when I had friends to play online with. I just stare at my computer screens most of the days without talking to anyone, I avoid my family in the house because they piss me off just by being here.

Sometimes I think it would be better to be single since I sometimes feel like doing whatever I want would make me feel better, but then again I don't have any other people to spend time with, and as I said, deep down I know my girlfriend is the one and if I let her go just to get drunk and hook up with other people, I would regret it the rest of my life.

I just feel conflicted about everything all the time. I feel like I don't need friends, but then for example last night when going to sleep I cried because I felt so lonely. I'm extremely introverted and like being alone (even me and my girlfriend see only like 3 times a week, which luckily works for both of us) but still I crave spending time with friends that I don't have. I love my girlfriend but still sometimes want to be single, even though I know my girlfriend is the last thing holding me together. 

My only hope at the moment is that starting at college in a new city gives me a fresh start in my social life. 

I just feel like a shell of a human, I feel like I have not been living a proper life lately. I even feel nostalgic to those times when I had that quite toxic friend group because we genuinely had good times together and all my best memories are with that group.

Once again, I'm sorry this is a mess. If this is too much about my relationship for this sub, I'm also sorry.",lonely,Conflicted feelings,2021-04-15 23:03:48

I should note that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to like a fictional character. I‚Äôm guilty of doing it to. There‚Äôs plenty of fictional characters that I like.

2180,reallyreallyd0ntcare,1618474830,1,"I apologize if this doesn‚Äôt 100% fit here, but I am feeling lonelier than ever right now, and I just wanted to write this.

I have family that I love, and I have pets that I love, and I even have a couple of friends who I could say that I love, but it is not the same. No matter how much I love my family it is not the same as the love you feel from a girl. And so, I feel lonelier than ever. I am just writing this all here because the only person in the world that I want to talk to this about, I can't talk to about it. This is basically my story of loneliness. I just have to write it here, because I feel like it is bursting out of me and maybe telling it someone would feel therapeutic. So I hope you have patience for what I feel like is going to be a dissertation worth of text, because I am not going to be able to sleep until I get this out.

Throughout high school I was an average kid, a couple of friends, but definitely not Mr. Popular or anything. I had a few crushes, a couple of girl friends (emphasis on the space), but nothing major. Not until college did, I feel what it was like to fall for someone. Leaving high school, I decided to got a university on the other side of the country, which in hind sight was a horrible mistake for all sorts of reasons. But as someone who never liked school, the fresh scenery did give me some motivation, although I have always been a lazy student. It was freshman year, I was not doing great academically but I was still acceptable. But I did make a great friend. A cute girl who was smart, extremely kind, and most important for me, someone who actually made me at ease when talking to them. I started developing a small crush, but she had a boyfriend, so I kept it mostly under control, mostly because I truly valued her as a friend. The semesters came and passed, we would hang out, study and have lunch every once in a while. My crushing feelings were still there, but like I said I valued our friendship enough to not do anything to jeopardize that.

Then comes summer. And suddenly, she reaches out to me to see how I‚Äôm doing, and before I know it we are texting constantly. I mean non stop. My feelings start to develop more and more, and I would lay my hand in a fire, that‚Äôs how sure I am that it was mutual. Good night texts, good morning texts, the best part of my day was the time when I was talking to her. We were in opposite time zones, and she would stay up deep into the middle of the night talking to me. I mean who does that with friends, even ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. I know if I had a girlfriend texting a guy at 3am I would not be able to handle it, no matter how much she insisted it was platonic. As the summer goes on, I am falling harder and harder. I‚Äôve never felt so at ease talking to anyone. Making jokes, talking about feelings, it didn‚Äôt matter it all came easily and was comfortable. But no matter how sure I was that that it was a two-way street, I just did not feel right saying anything as long as I knew she was with another guy. I can‚Äôt think of a shittier thing to do to someone, than break their trust and cheat, even though if it was me I would already have considered me and her to have crossed a line of ‚Äúemotional cheating‚Äù, so for me that was not an option.

So, the next term comes around, and the boyfriend is still around. At this point, this is the strongest I have ever felt about anyone or anything in my entire life. I couldn‚Äôt take the L word into my mouth, but goddamnit at moments it felt like it, and even if it wasn‚Äôt, I think it‚Äôs the closes I‚Äôll ever be. The problem is, at this point it causes me just as much pain being around her, knowing that I can‚Äôt be with her, even though I do just genuinely love our friendship. So I become a bit aloof, we don‚Äôt communicate much more now that the school year has started, aside from the occasional bumping into one another on campus. I still wasn‚Äôt ready to try and break up a couple up for my own benefit, so I just thought, cut ties, try to forget about her, maybe things will get better.

But they didn‚Äôt. And near the end of the term, I reached my boiling point. My grades had slipped beyond repair by this point. I was a complete emotional wreck. There was a lot of other stuff in my life and family that was completely sideways, so it was just like everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. I was terrified of facing my parents and saying I just wasted a semester worth of tuition. But I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore, and I spilled my guts. I sent her what felt like an essay (although not as long as this) about my feelings, and how sorry I am to do this to her while she is in a relationship, but that I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this for the sake of my own mental health. She says she kind of figured about my feelings, but that it doesn‚Äôt have to change anything about our friendship. I mean that is nice to hear, but I am physically in pain at this point by the fact that I don‚Äôt get to be with her, so that isn‚Äôt really good enough for me. Now that everything is on the table, we start talking again regularly and eventually it comes out that the crushing feelings were mutual.

At this point I am still unsure of what is going to happen and where we stand. Boyfriend is still around, but we start getting closer and closer, and the ‚Äúemotional cheating‚Äù goes further and further. I start to think that with my feelings on the table, I no longer need to feel guilty. She is an adult, she can do what she wants. But with my grades having reached rock bottom, and my mental health so visibly damaged, my parents pull me out of school, and bring me home so I can deal with sorting out my issues first, which as devasted as I was that I was losing my best friend, and potentially more, I could understand. Her and I have a super hard time saying goodbye, late nights talking, I feel like I have ruined her existing relationship and caused so much stress, so I am feeling like shit from all angles. I finally leave the university, and we kinda stay in touch, texting every few weeks or so, but I am at this point really focused on fixing my mental health, and hopefully getting fit enough to go back to school in the fall after skipping spring term.

Well, I work really hard for the next six months, get a job, see a therapist, and try to regain my confidence, and get to the root of some other, unrelated, issues that were causing me pain. I am excited to say that I am ready to return to school! So, I start reaching out a little bit more frequently, and we start talking more again, and everything feels like back to normal. Nothing feels better than getting to be 100% genuine you around someone. But once I get back to school ‚Äì boom. I get ghosted, even though we were chatting like old times 2 weeks prior. Now I don‚Äôt think I have to go into detail about how badly this devasted me, but really shattered every last bit of confidence and self esteem I had. This is a person I trusted with my soul, I told her everything, she knew my insecurities, and that I was maybe a bit overly sensitive, and this is how she decided to end things. Ending things is one thing but ending them like that after nearly two years of ‚Äúbest friends forever‚Äù bullshit is something else. Especially because if she knew me at all, she knew that this would fucking bury me. I know it was stupid going back primarily for a girl, and I knew it then, but fucking like I said, there is no feeling like that love from a girl. Once I realized what she had done to me, I deleted her number from my phone, and I wiped my text history and deleted screenshots of cute and meaningful messages that she had sent to me.

So now I‚Äôm at school, I‚Äôve lost my best friend, and all the other loose friends I made during my time there had kind of moved on. I was crushed. Destroyed. Needless to say, I became a complete hermit, and academically I completely shit the bed once again. I started ignoring phone calls from parents and friends, which promptly got police checking on me to see if I was a danger to myself, and my parents showing up unexpectedly to pull me out of school in person. I was humiliated and didn‚Äôt have one scrap of confidence or self-worth left.

Now it has been years. I fucking hate my life. I worked a job I hated for years, making an income that I could survive on just fine, but nothing more. I‚Äôve always hated school, even though now I‚Äôve decided that I at least need a degree to make some amount of money. I know money and materials doesn‚Äôt make me happy, I‚Äôve experienced it firsthand, but I figure if I‚Äôm going to hate my fucking life, at least I want to have some of the material things that I like. Right around the start of the pandemic I get a text from an unknown number, and it must be five years on at this point. It starts with ‚ÄúHey [name]‚Ä¶‚Äù and I‚Äôm just wondering who on earth is this. She never says her name, but she starts apologizing for the way she acted and says how immature that was. My heart literally feels like it fell out my asshole at this point. I could not believe it. It had been so long I actually could not believe the words on my screen. I respected the guts it took to say something like that, but I couldn‚Äôt do anything more than say ‚ÄúI accept your apology"" and move on. I certainly couldn't say I forgive her yet.

Now this apology had an affect on me. I tried for a very long time to erase this girl from my memory. So on the one hand it was horrible to have it all brought back up. But on the other hand it made me think of all the happy memories that I made because of her, which I hadn‚Äôt though about in forever. It made me realize that I need to take my mental health more seriously, and start trying to live the life that I want, even though to me I am sure it is impossible and that I‚Äôm going to die poor and alone. And a year later, I actually start to feel a bit better. I finally found some anti-depressants that work, and I‚Äôm doing good in my university program. I‚Äôm making effort to be less shy and less anxious so I figure, hey I think I‚Äôm going to thank her for her apology and let her know that it actually made a difference. And that I had actually now forgiven her. I guess this is the beginning of my mistake, and why I am writing this now. To my wall of text I get a response that says basically says ‚Äúif by some chance we ever run into each other let‚Äôs catch up. Take care.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything from the response, or expecting to become friends again, but something about that ‚Äútake care‚Äù hurt. Like she was just trying to shut me up and close the door for good. Which is fine, but not delicately handled. I guess there is maybe a pattern here, and I should see it as the bright side.

But what this all has caused is it has made me realize how much I‚Äôve desensitized myself to loneliness over the last 5 years. I didn‚Äôt realize what I was missing until I went back through of all these memories. I know that I am not in love with her anymore, but just thinking about what it was like to have someone special with whom I was able to connect emotionally hurts me now more than ever. Since then I have basically been playing dead, and I didn't realize it. I've been downplaying my loneliness for so long, because it was the only way for me to cope with it, and just now have I realized just how lonely I have been. I don't love her now, she caused me too much pain, and it's been so long I don't even know her, but who knew that the good memories could hurt just as bad as the bad ones did. The laughing, the smiling, the flirting. Companionship. Just a touch on the arm felt so good, I could cry just thinking about her grabbing my arm or holding my hand.

So I did something stupid. Well, my confession is that I didn't actually fully delete the screenshots and text messages from all those years ago. The chat log and the screenshots I backed up in a zip file and hid them somewhere deep on my harddrive, never really intending to find them again. But now I went looking for them. Fifteen minutes later I found them. After five years. And it has got to be one of the stupidest decisions I have ever made. The first screenshot I opened said ""If you only knew how often I laugh out loud because of your messages.."". Nothing has ever made me feel so ill as quickly as when I read that messages. I felt like I was shot in the heart, and had to puke simultaneously. And then the pinnacle ‚Äì which I honest to god don‚Äôt even remember her saying. When I was leaving school that first time around, I wanted so badly just to see her and say goodbye face to face. But she refused back then saying it would be too hard, and we never have to say goodbye because we will stay in touch. And ended on a message that said she can‚Äôt see me because ‚Äúit will make it worse.. Because what if something happened.. You don't have a girlfriend you would be fine.‚Äù This is what fucking broke me tonight. I collapsed on the floor and started crying, I couldn‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt remember this happening. And it‚Äôs not even because I‚Äôm a hornball or whatever. Just the fact that I was in a place with someone with feelings so strong that she thought we may actually lose control‚Ä¶ it just devastated me to realize that someone at some point felt that way about me, and now I have nothing. Literally nothing. I don‚Äôt even have anyone I feel like I can tell this story to. Reading these old messages is the dumbest thing I have ever done, and I think I have done a load of dumb shit. I don‚Äôt have a clue on how I‚Äôm going to get passed this. All the desensitizing for nothing. They say ignorance is bliss. And it's true.

Friends will randomly stop talking to me, potential lovers who don't out and out reject me will up and ghost me after a single date (assuming they don't just ditch the plans entirely in the first place), and my roommate, who I once considered the best friend I could ask for, well, now I'm getting the impression that being in the same room as her is some great inconvenience because I'm taking up time she could be spending with her real friends.

I don't want to think how he'd react knowing how much of a fucking loser I am now.

I remember walking around the airport by myself on the last day, I knew that my classmates were looking at me weird. 

With perspective I learned that they all knew how alone I was and that made me feel a lot worse about the situation.

2194,28Giroux28,1618467374,1,"Long read:

As a high school senior, this year has been extremely tough mentally for me. I‚Äôm tired of having the same weekends over and over again, playing video games with my cousin or playing by myself until times like 3-4am on Friday/ the weekends. My phone has been dry, and the few friends I have don‚Äôt hit me up online or ask to hang out. Going on social media and seeing people in my grade having fun with their friends makes me feel broken and left out. I also never get invited to do anything or go anywhere. 

Before this pandemic, I was always quieter in school because I felt that everyone had their own friend groups and weren‚Äôt very fond of everyone else. I‚Äôve never went to any school events because I felt like the experience wouldn‚Äôt be good for me because I probably wouldn‚Äôt talk to anyone new, and it would be a waste of time. I would have hated to see everyone else having fun while I really wasn‚Äôt. I have a smaller group of friends in school, but not being there and continuing to communicate with them is tough, because they either don‚Äôt answer or don‚Äôt ever text me anything. 

I also wanted to add that none of my friends are girls and I‚Äôve never been in any kind of relationship. I always ponder upon how a few of my friends could talk to a few on FaceTime while they were playing video games with me, and how they can follow/know so many on social media. I don‚Äôt have any siblings so the nights of imagining and silence have became my time to reflect upon all of this.  

Recently after talking to my one friend about having our senior year experience ruined by this pandemic, I‚Äôve been thinking to ask everyone that lives around our neighborhood to go as one big group to go somewhere like the movies to do something all together, because as seniors this opportunity might never happen again. I‚Äôm hoping this experience would also spark a friendship or maybe even a relationship  with a girl that lives in the neighborhood. I‚Äôve always remembered how nice she was to other people on the bus before high school, and even defended me when I was getting pestered on the walk home from the bus stop by two twin guys the grade below me about something I didn‚Äôt do (she told them to leave me alone and she trusted me on how I was defending myself.)

The loneliness of extreme old age is one of the saddest things to witness. I remember when I was 7 years old, having to go to a nursing home for a school volunteer trip, and the humble sadness to understand that these people are having to say goodbye to the world that they knew for so long, while we freshly new, are saying hello. And yet the joy in their eyes to know that there was someone to say hello to them, to recognize them and their lives. To honor their life in knowing they have lived just like us through the ups and downs. Their missing of friends and family that have passed, their memories of youth, and then parting from youth. Their parents. Perhaps spouses and children. Their regrets. Nursing homes are a sad thing - in America we do not honor aging or the elderly as they do in other countries and cultures. We see them as an inconvenience towards novelty and progress. If you feel lonely or struggle with social anxiety, sharing your life or learning about the life of the elderly, is mutually healing.

2202,SnowtoFire,1618462101,1,"I‚Äôm broken and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I try I can‚Äôt fix myself. I don‚Äôt have an identity. I never lived long enough anywhere growing up to call home. I was the new kid so often. At first I was like cool a chance to reinvent myself but apparently all versions of me are losers. I don‚Äôt speak the language of my parent‚Äôs country, nor do they accept me when I go visit. 

Not only that but I have no sexual identity either. I think I‚Äôm straight, I want to be straight not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with being gay, if I was  gay at least it would be definitive. My parents drove this idea that girls were different and the whole religious don‚Äôt defile them before marriage but they got very abusive about it. Like being beat for watching Zoey 101 and Hannah Montana because apparently they display inappropriate affection. Not only that I grew up in a racist environment. To explain it briefly, The UAE is a country that is rich in oil and money but has a small population, as they don‚Äôt allow foreigners to become citizens. But as many know Dubai is a huge city with so many luxurious places, tourism, and they have many oil refineries. And Dubai is just one of the 7 emirates of the UAE. Basically to build all this and live in their mansions Emirati Arabs needed manpower and so countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia started sending in workers, especially engineers and maids. Thus many local arabs associate people of my color as workers and inferior. So when your first experience of school is being inferior to those around you it‚Äôs not a great time. Being spit on, and if you fight back there‚Äôs a chance that local was someone special and your whole family is instantly and roughly deported. Not that I was physically very gifted either. The first crush I ever had was a girl who thought I was worth less than her based solely on our races. 

I‚Äôve never watched porn. I was too afraid as it was a sin and my parents would hurt me if they ever caught me watching real porn. I‚Äôm 24 and I have a vague idea of what the opposite gender‚Äôs privates look like. I can just look it up but guys have always known I felt. In fact in the 4 countries and 8 cities I‚Äôve lived in I‚Äôve never once met a friend who also didn‚Äôt ever watch porn. I‚Äôm also very awkward, I was born deformed slightly as well, nothing crazy but one of my legs is larger than the other so I was very self conscious about shorts but also people would think I walk funny because I‚Äôm stupid or something and I didn‚Äôt have it in me to correct them. Man one of the saddest days of my life was in 8th grade we were in gym class playing soccer and we got to choose our own teams based on captains. I wasn‚Äôt chose last, I wasn‚Äôt chosen at all. I guess everyone including the teacher assumed I just didn‚Äôt want to play and I didn‚Äôt have the strength to speak up so I sat in the corner crying for an entire period. And I don‚Äôt blame anyone else but me, a lot of this could be just paranoia and being self centered. I think Im straight because I‚Äôve only ever been interested in girls, but I‚Äôve never experienced a woman‚Äôs touch nor even seen what‚Äôs behind the curtains. But i want affection so bad. I just want a friend but I myself keep driving people away. 

Eventually I got into drugs because to be honest when you‚Äôre lonely in high school no group is friendlier than the stoner kids. So I began smoking weed which was actually nice but the kids were not good people and we all got into some pretty hardcore drugs. Triple C‚Äôs, acid every night, xanax at school type of deal. 3 out of 5 of them got arrested for robbery. 2 of them used me for money and would make fun of me when I told them my situation. In college I became more and more disconnected from people and thanks to my new found love of drugs I was also disconnected from reality. Lost my scholarship, failed all my classes two semesters in a row, ruined my gpa, and I dropped out. But it isn‚Äôt even the cool frat bro type of drop out no I was doing drugs and drinking by myself. My parents caught on and sent me to therapy because apparently they didn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with me, apparently beating your child for having normal emotions is normal for both these psychos. And I shit you not the therapist just assigned a counselor after barely hearing my story, and the counselor didn‚Äôt care about me. I would have to repeat why I was coming in and what traumatized me every time I had an appointment, he wouldn‚Äôt even write it down in his computer notes thing they have to act like they remember your last conversations. Eventually I started working for a company where everyone was my age but far more accomplished than me and everyone one them was attractive and could speak better than me. They all had positions that were undergrad requirement positions and mine was entry level and they would act like I didn‚Äôt even exist. It was the best paying job I ever had and plus I don‚Äôt have what it takes to stand up for myself. Because I‚Äôm stuck with this mindset that I‚Äôm inferior to everyone else

Anyway I‚Äôm trying to do better now, I try to workout but it‚Äôs because I think or I want to believe that if I‚Äôm healthy and maybe good at the gym somebody will start paying attention and have some respect for me. Maybe I can become strong enough to stand up for myself but I don‚Äôt know how to strengthen my mindset. Imm off any  heavy drugs it took me a month but all I do now is vape, and smoke weed which I‚Äôm trying to stop as well. 

I‚Äôm writing this all because the self improvement isn‚Äôt working, I can‚Äôt believe I thought that was the answer.

Still haven‚Äôt had a relationship. Don‚Äôt know what to do, how to change the situation. 

I know I‚Äôm not supposed to put a relationship on a pedestal. 

I know I‚Äôm supposed to be happy with my self.

I know I‚Äôm suppose to have a sense of self worth independent of the external world. 

I know I should work and improve myself.

I know I should get out of my comfort zone. 

But I‚Äôm getting tied of this persistent rat race. I‚Äôve been working on myself for years, and no matter how good I am or how much I improve it seems to never be enough. People don‚Äôt show an interest in me, unless I over initiate which only works about a quarter of the time. 

I‚Äôm usually passed over, and it‚Äôs frustrates me because I put a lot of effort into relating to people.

My envy of others is growing. I wish I had a life were I could fall into relationships like they do. Instead I‚Äôm toiling away at over achievement because that‚Äôs the only path I know.

I‚Äôve tried meet ups 
Local groups
Events
The pick up stuff is toxic I don‚Äôt want to touch it. 

Nothing ever comes of them. It shouldnt be this difficult because I see all my cousins and uni colleagues falling into relationships and social groups effortlessly.

I just want to know that I‚Äôm worth someone‚Äôs attention. I don‚Äôt want to fake it anymore.

She said she loves me etc etc. She was dealing with a boy she liked but she said he made her feel like shit so she cut him off. We met at the park two days later. And so was the boy she cut off. He walked up to her and kissed her. My world kinda shattered. I really opened up to her and shared a lot of personal stuff and i thought she liked me back. She was talking about having a relationship with me too. She said i was the best guy she ever met and the only guy she feels safe around. But after that i guess they were back together? I have no clue. These past two weeks have been a blur. This is the most depressed ive ever been. I told her i liked her too late and now were just friends but shes still talking to him. And the worst part is she said she liked me back. I want to fucking end it all. I want the pain to stop. I dont want to exist. Im really introverted and shy and it stopped me from talking about my feelings earlier. Every day i wake up and ask god why. Why he cursed me like this. Why i can't talk to people. Why can't i share my thoughts. Why am i here. Why do i exist. 

The thing is i think she still likes me and him. She doesn't know what she wants and i don't know what i want anymore. This is torture. Every time i talk to her and pretend to be fine im tormented by my own mind and how i wasn't good enough and how i couldn't open my fucking mouth.

I'm supposed to meet this lady and she has now seen my dick as her introduction to me I'm good at first impressions I know. So long story short her mom told her to not talk to me until she is 16 then we can date again and she punished her and took away all of her devices. I was able to message her on a game before then and she said it'd be best to break up even though neither of us wanted too so we did.. a little bit ago. That was a pain I've never felt before, this is my second genuine relationship with a girl that I want to be with for the rest of my life. The last girl was very mentally abusive and I'm kinda messed up from it now emotionally but we're cool now and we're friends. My gf said she wants to be with me when the time comes we're aloud too and by then we'll be able to drive and see eachother just a year and a half until I talk to her.

2225,clichedlives,1618451234,1,"i basically just came here to vent because i feel like i can never totally be honest with people irl about my feelings right now...

i‚Äôm currently a second semester freshman at the moment and i‚Äôm absolutely miserable. i came to college with my best friend of over 10 years and we decided to room together and even have signed a lease for next year already. first semester and even up until about two months ago we were attached at the hip. we literally would walk to class together, get dinner together and watch movies together every single night. she even told me i was like her soulmate and that she couldn‚Äôt imagine us being apart. we even signed a lease together for next year.

However, within the past two months our relationship has become so tense. we got into a large fight for like the first time throughout our long friendship and we didn‚Äôt talk for 2 days, but i eventually ended up just giving in because i couldn‚Äôt lose her despite the fact i was still hurt and almost didn‚Äôt recognize my best friend . after making up, everything since then has been totally different. she first started acting really disinterested every time i would try and talk to her and started never making plans to hang out with me. i loved her so much like i found myself literally craving her attention. every time i would see her car parked outside our building i would immediately run up the stairs and start talking her ear off or doing anything for her to give me 5 seconds of her time. however, her constant disinterest in me started to wear me down and started effecting my self confidence so i knew i had to stop this kind of thinking. i‚Äôm definitely a confrontational person so i even confronted her about why she was ignoring me and she gave some speech about how she wanted to meet new people and everything which i don‚Äôt mind at all, but i just don‚Äôt see that as an excuse to constantly ignore me and make me feel small.  

as soon as i stopped putting effort into this friendship just to see if she would even notice, which she didn‚Äôt, it immediately started to turn toxic and unsupportive. it was very difficult for me to stop trying because it‚Äôs hard for me to see past all the good memories we have and the fact that i genuinely don‚Äôt want this relationship to end, but i knew i had to realize that she doesn‚Äôt care. now, she barely talks to me or even texts me, which is a huge difference in comparison to the constant updates we would give each other on our lives if we ended up spending 5 seconds apart. she leaves our apartment in the morning and doesn‚Äôt usually come back until late. we now just share the casual good morning and nothing else. 

i‚Äôm now totally lost and all i want to do is transfer and get away from the constant reminder. every time i hear talk with another friend with that happy voice when just 10 minutes ago she spoke to me like she was tired and annoyed physically pains me to listen to. i‚Äôm literally so lonely here despite the fact i have tried so hard to make other friends. i have tried every trick in the book, joining a sorority, clubs, and i‚Äôve even reached out to people to hang out. however, i‚Äôm never the first choice and they all have people that they are closer with. i spend most of my day alone. i already hate my college at this point and everyday i just motivate myself with the possibility of transferring. it‚Äôs not even like i have no friends here it‚Äôs just that i‚Äôm never anybody‚Äôs first choice or they just don‚Äôt care to invite me to places. i also just miss having a best friend. i‚Äôve always had 2-3 best friends my entire life so loosing that special connection is earth shattering.

 i didn‚Äôt even like high school all that much but i literally miss it so much because i truly never felt as lonely as i do now. i go home basically every weekend right now because my parents and my other friend who still lives at home feel like the only people who make me feel less alone. my other best friend goes to college out of state and we still talk and text everyday but she has other friends there and i hate harassing her every second of every day because i have no other person to share my thoughts with. 

summer in 3 weeks is basically my only hope at this point. after that, i don‚Äôt know if i can handle being at this school for another whole year. i want to transfer so bad but the lease is the only thing keeping me here. i‚Äôve told my mom about how i want to leave this school but she keeps reminding me that i have a commitment. even though me and my parents are close, i‚Äôm not a very emotional person so it‚Äôs very difficult for me to share my current struggles with them and they basically have no clue how miserable i am and how me and my best friend are almost strangers.

It started with my brother going into the Navy when he was younger. I was never really close with him, and I grew up without him. I would be banned from visiting him a lot since he is gay, and my Dad is homophobic.

My parents and I have never really gotten along. When I try to open up to my Mom, she says I am overdramatic, and blames it on hormones. She is a good Mom, but she doesn't react well to certain situation. My father is an alcoholic, I don't want anything to do with him really.

I lost my best friend to suicide back in November, she was a very special person to me. I was blind to the signs, and then she snapped on the 17th. I found out on the 18th via a school email.

My friend group threw me aside, and ditched me after a freak accident last month. One of them stayed with me, but then I had a panic attack in front of them due to being triggered by something. They freaked out, and called me mentally insane.

My online best friend was a brother/father figure to me, but then something happened. He drifted away, and I just kind of accepted it. Now every time I talk to him, he seems uncomfortable. I used to talk with him every single day for hours and hours on end, but it slowly dwindled down to once a week if I'm lucky. He isn't replaceable at all, I will always consider him my best friend.

It doesn't seem like a lot, but it feels like my world is crashing down. I feel so isolated from the rest of society. My whole social life is in pieces. I have done a lot to try to fix it, but I just can't. I have social anxiety, and selective mutism though I haven't gotten treatment. It makes it extremely hard for me to talk to new people, and try to make friends. It's not that I don't want to, I just can't. I freeze up. That is why majority of my friends have been online. I am able to control my emotions better, and I can't make a fool of myself. But anyways, how can I help repair my social life? Who can I talk to?

I've grown up with a lot of pain and the feeling of being alone, throughout all my life I was made fun of and people found me annoying and dumb, I wondered if something was just wrong with me and I dealt with this for so long and it made me only want one thing in life. I wanted to have someone who loved me and would be by my side no matter what. In high school freshmen year I was at the point where I was sick of being alone and I wanted to die, I stopped talking in general and people noticed but did nothing. I was gonna end it on Friday so I could take my time and write my notes to people for them after I died.

Thursday came along and it was a normal day as usual, I sat at a table at lunch by myself as usually just listening to some music, waiting for tomorrow. Then a girl walked up to my table and she asked something and I didn't hear because my ear buds, I took em out and nodded my head as a gesture to what did you say, because usually people only talk to me when they need something, so I wasn't really expecting much until I heard her say, can we be friends. I was bit confused and I spoke for the first time in about a week, I said sure.. and she sat with me and we talked for the rest of lunch. After that day I felt weird..I knew this girl from middle school, she was one of the people in my grade that didn't really like being around me so I felt like this was a trick or something to make fun of me like a joke that people have done on me before.

The next day came, I decided to stick around to see what would happen since this was new to me. I came to school and she was there to greet me since we had 1st period together and we talked and got to know eachother more even during lunch. I was kinda just expecting her to have asked to be friends and then never talk to me again but..I was wrong and we continued to talk for about a week or 2, then one day after 1st period she asked for my phone number, to send me a meme and you know. I never actually received that meme, it was an excuse just to talk to me outside of school and I mean I was pretty anti social so I mean I didn't talk too much since people found me annoying so I kept to myself. But this girl was different..

I felt a connection and I mean I started to have a crush on her, so here was my plan. In middle school I liked this other girl who, let's say not one of those good people, but I think she looked cute, that was before I gained a six sense in 8th grade. Where I could tell how someone was feeling at the moment, so I had a plan my friend didn't suspect I liked her so I told her I had a crush on this other chick and she actually wanted to help me get her but that was actually a trick to tell how my friend felt, hearing that, but I didn't really feel much, so I suspected she was either good at hiding her feelings or she didn't have feelings for me so she continued to so called help me and a game came up on Friday I think It was, we went together as friends of course but I figured that with all this noise I could tell her i loved her and she didn't feel the same i could recover and say something else. It worked, at the end of the game I said as I was walking out ""I love you"" and she replied with ""what"" and I said ""I said I'll see you tomorrow or something like that"" and I got home and felt pretty confident, cause at that moment I felt that she liked me. So on Sunday I texted her when we were texting ""I have something to tell you, but I think it's better to say it tomorrow or in person"" and no joke she replied with ""why not now"", ""it's complicated"" and she said ""if your gonna ask me out..you know I most likely will say yes"". I was shocked to see, that she knew, but I kinda wanted to ask her out in person so it felt more genuine, but I wasn't gonna let this opportunity go so I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said yes..

2252,BackwaterRogue,1618435070,1,"I'm currently a junior in high school. I have no friends. I have no social life. I don't go outside. 

I have poor self-esteem and am extremely self-conscious of my looks. I'm afraid of others paying attention to me.

I feel like a failure in high school, and have no motivation to do anything. I don't like studying, even though I have all As. Why am I even going to school? Why are others so motivated in doing what they are doing for no good reason? What am I even doing?

At school, I'm looked down by others. I've done many dumb things in the past, but they're consistently brought up to humiliate me. I always shake it off, and move on my day. That's what I am, a loser. A stepping stone and a sandbag for other boys to gain approval and become a part of the ""popular"" friend group. Just a random guy who'll be forgotten and fade away once highschool ends. I used to have good friends in middle school, but we split up going to different high schools, and life's never been so dull and gloomy since then.

At home, I spend most of my day sitting at my computer playing games and watching youtube. Other times I attempt to do something productive, but end up wandering off to do other things because I have zero motivation. I'm close to my mom and brother, but I never open up to them. I don't reciprocate the love they give me because I don't know how to. I dislike showing feelings or weaknesses to anyone, because if I do it feels as if they know confidential information that could potentially expose me. 

Over the quarantine, I've become increasingly pessimistic. As much as I'm addicted to them, I hate seeing instagram and tiktok posts of people having fun. Them partying, going to all these fun urban city night places, snowboarding, getting into their dream colleges effortlessly with smiles spread across their faces. I abhor these people, yet I want to be like them. Especially during afternoon and night, I sit at my desk daydreaming imaginary scenarios of myself living that life.

 It was about 4 months ago in January when I carefully touched the absurd idea of envisioning an imaginary girlfriend, but it eventually grew into an addicting habit. Her name is Lana. She's caring, attractive, and everything you could ask for in a girl. When I'm feeling down like I always do, I daydream myself doing fun activities with her like taking her to fun places and playing my favorite game together. The scenario I daydream the most is playing piano beside her. She plays the violin, and I play the piano. We're an impeccable duo and enjoy playing anything. I've been doing this for the past few months, every single day. It was so soothing and warm to the mind I completely abandoned the thought of breaking out of this habit. I think I've gone insane. An imaginary girlfriend used to be a funny joke my friends back in middle school used to throw around at one another, but it'd ironically become a reality.

Now I want to stop. 

App season is coming up, my school is opening up during senior year, and I'll become an adult soon. If I don't change my habits and behavior, I'll probably end up in an existential crisis and become a miserable man. I'm tired of being looked down, indulging in daydreaming and wishful thinking, being trapped in my own home, and not doing anything productive. It's a suffocating me and my chest feels heavy from depression everyday. I hope people on reddit can help me get through this somehow because I've realized I can't change without the help of others' advice and experiences.

Even in an anonymous community, it felt alien and awkward to share this experience. If you've made it this far, thank you.",lonely,Just posting my feelings here. I need help.,2021-04-15 07:17:50
2253,s-w-jagermanjensen,1618434647,1,"So this is something that I personally deal with a lot, but I know that I am not the only one. People who have close friends, family, relationships, SOs, etc have quite the supply of touch and varying levels of intimacy that those who are in this sub may not get. Obviously a hug from a good friend can be important in hard times when a pandemic doesn't limit interaction. 

But there are people like myself who long for a hug from a family member or friend. To cry into the shoulders of an SO or another who understands or cares. People who are lonely do not get those chances or moments often or at all. 

The last time I got a hug from a friend years ago, it felt like there was a dopamine release or something. I felt high. It seems like that I am so lacking in physical contact from people that it jolts my body and doesn't compute properly. 

It makes me sad that the older I get the more I understand why people pay for company and attention. It feels like a crisis that could be avoided but is ignored because it's not something that is looked at seriously.

I started university last fall excited for meeting new people and moving away from home for the first time. I clearly underestimated the effects that the pandemic would have on those plans. I am not really shy but a bit awkward and I am not quick to make connections. I feel like everyone around my in my class found their perfect squad of people directly (when we still had some events in real life). It is so frustrating because it feels like I missed my shot because now people have made connections and are satisfied with their social circles. The people that I have tried contacting and met up with never contacted me back and seem uninterested. I am nervous for when classes start (hopefully) in real life in the fall and everyone will notice that I don‚Äôt have belong to a group. Writing this I realise it seems so stupid and high-school-like. A lot of it is probably in my head and I am sure there must be some nice people in my class. 

What annoys me so much is when everyone insist of talking about how lovely and welcoming everyone in our class (big class of over 120 people) is.

I can't seem to find anyone i genuinely enjoy being around irl except very few people who I haven't talked to in forever. One of them being my crush, but god, I feel she hates me. She's really nice and accepting, nothing wrong with her. Before lockdown I neve used to talk to her cuz she was always surrounded by her friend group, which don't really like, they're all pretty snappy, but she oddly isn't, I told her about that multiple times and she said it's ok if to talk to her anyway, and whenever I told her I felt like I'm annoying her, she said I'm not and that Im kind of enjoyable to talk to, but I don't think she's being honest, I feel like she's saying that cuz she knows I'm really insecure

I barely talk to anyone other than random discord people and I don't know who to talk to about my feelings, I don't want to talk to my mom about it, she very accepting aswell, but she always makes it into a bigger deal than it actually is and relates it to everything possible, which then makes me feel even worse.

School's also been tearing up my ass with it's generally shitty system and how some of the teacher genuinely don't care, and we don't have one of those random mental health consultant people.

I have no one i feel comfortable with to talk about my feelings and i don't know what to feel anymore, i just feel like shit all day everyday.

My mom put me in a sort of mental institution thingy, but it's not even about how i feel but more about how to be more fucking productive and get myself to work and shit, it starts like next week or sumn and that's even more shit ass work and less free time alongside like 6 other hours a week with a tutor.

I can find things to keep me busy for short periods of time - cleaning something, playing guitar, etc. but those are just distractions, ones that I obviously am still alone in.

My friend that calls a few times a week (lives in a different state) made the joke that if I died, she‚Äôd be the only one who knew. She‚Äôs not wrong either.

Anyway, within these last three-four years I understood myself better and constantly tried to find someone on those websites. I've been using one for two or three years, with some breaks in between and usually the only people that reply to me are from big cities.. and the conversations end at ""well if you ever come to city A, let me know! Buh-bye"". 

I keep hearing all this ""people are so unique! Everyone is different!"" and yet every single person on those websites acts exactly the same. It doesn't matter what I write, to who I write, how my profile looks and what it says - I am not getting any matches and just end up wasting my time, trying to come up with topics and questions for that person like they're a \*\*\*\* celebrity. I think that's the whole point and why they do it in the first place. ""Challengers"".

One of the people I saw had written on her profile ""I don't discriminate! I welcome all challengers!"" and was a little... disgusted? Apparently I'm a ""challenger"" and she is ""the prize""?

Well, I‚Äôve grown up with depression issues and anxiety my entire life. I was on medication until I entered college. I‚Äôve always been an athletic and smart person, but I‚Äôve never really had all that many friends. I‚Äôve learned to handle my depression but I still have some anxiety in public out of fear of being judged by others. I used to play baseball and by the time I stopped because of college, I was bullied for no reason by some of the people I played baseball with for 5+ years. These were people I hung out with and drove to games if they needed a ride, and that‚Äôs the last memory I have from my childhood regarding sports. I never hurt anyone or treated anyone with disrespect, but I always feel like a punching bag for others. I‚Äôll be graduating college in a week with a 3.9 gpa, magma cum laude honors, and hopes of going into law school, yet I‚Äôm still put down all the time. My parents have been on the verge of divorce for many, many years. The only reason they‚Äôre together is because my brother is still in high school. My dad and I have never really gotten along for a long time which I never really understood why. I‚Äôm not good enough in his eyes and he relays that to his friends. His friends all think I‚Äôm some demon by the way he talks about me even though they hardly know me. I‚Äôm a really kind and understanding person, but I‚Äôm painted out to be some kind of jerk according to him. My grandmother died 2 hours before my birthday this past February. I wrote a funeral speech because I was unable to fly there due to school. Everyone loved the speech when it was read at the service, and the minister even complimented it. My dad, however, his first reaction was ‚Äúdid you read over it‚Äù? And it was in a voice that suggested it was bad. He told my mom this and she told me a month after it happened when it just came up. I immediately started crying because I just felt like a waste of space. It takes a lot for me to cry in front of someone, but I just felt like my heart was ripped in two. I‚Äôve also never been in a relationship with anyone and I just feel starved emotionally. I‚Äôve tried and I feel like I have a lot to offer someone, but I recently gave up. Right now I‚Äôm just focusing on myself because I don‚Äôt want to deal with anymore heartbreak.

But my friend told me to listen to stage four, and I did. The same song in Stage one, but it sounds scratchy and faded.

I‚Äôve never really had friends nor relationships. My parents were and still are very abusive and invasive. They always tell me to grow up and be responsible but they never let me do anything on my own. This has become our sole topic for years now so I tend to avoid their company.

I‚Äôve never had a love interest and I have never been asked out. If I asked someone out I was always declined. I‚Äôm not really attractive. Sure, I‚Äôm not a gnome but I‚Äôm in no way pretty or handsome. I‚Äôm just a dude. 

I spend my time in my head mostly. I imagine this very cloudy character who is my significant other and I pretend that they are real. I pretend like we do things people in love do. But the part I most enjoy about it is when I can tell them how beautiful and amazing they are. And hugging of course. :3

1) Realising you have no one to invite to your birthday

I remember having my 21st and my mum asking ""do you wanna have a party? You can invite your friends"". Looking back it's pretty hilarious as it's sort of like lol mum I have no friends :') 

2) Having no one to share the excitement with

If you're really into a show or book, or musician or whatever, you have no one to talk about it with. No one there to share the excitement

3) When people ask what you're doing on the weekend, you don't have much to say

I remember people at work asking me this and panicking. At first I was honest (I mostly stay at home lol) but after a while I started making up fake plans like ""oh I'm going to the movies with a few friends"". I know, it's sad. 

4) Singing along to love songs and realising you've literally never experienced anything in that song lol

5) Checking your phone and realising you have 0 notifications. When you do, it's from your data provider.

6) Binge watching YouTube because it makes you feel like you have friends. And also accounts for a majority of your social interaction.

7) Meeting people and realising that it's going to come out sooner or later that you have no mates

This one's a bit of a weird one. But in the past when I did have a friend or 2, they'd usually introduce me to their other friends. Over time though they'd start saying 'how come you never introduce me to yours?' I remember being invited  to a friend's birthday. They told me to ""bring a friend"" if I felt uncomfortable as I didn't know anyone. Little did they know they were my only friend :')

2309,QuestiQnable,1618397252,1,"Jr in high school, never had a girlfriend, recently moved states so I have no friends in person either, online school keeps me from even meeting new people, and I‚Äôm about to be a senior with an insanely low gpa and 0 friends or connections (keep in mind I‚Äôve been lonely even before moving, pretty tight group of friends, I never really talked about deep shit with them) 

How am I supposed to go through senior year with no one to talk or relate to? I feel like a lost cause at this point, I‚Äôm already socially ret*rded as it is, the only reason I had friends in the first place was because I had been friends with them since elementary school, I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to talk to new people without embarrassing myself. Everyone at my new school is so reserved compared to where I‚Äôm from. I‚Äôm from a small town where everyone knew each other and making friends was easy. Now I‚Äôm in a public school right outside of a city, and even if I somehow make friends in this short amount of time, they will be gone in no time. Idk how to go on anymore like this, I can‚Äôt keep sitting in my fucking room for days or weeks on end anymore it‚Äôs taking a toll on my mental health, I‚Äôve hated being lonely forever but this year has really opened my eyes to how reliant I was on that close group of friends.

Holy shit I just realized it‚Äôs about to be summer and I have no one to talk to or do something with. Fuck me I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm so fucking scared I‚Äôm just going to spend my entire summer playing video games and doing nothing with my life.

        I feel so lost and alone daily and I can‚Äôt even remember the day I started feeling this way. My whole life hasn‚Äôt been easy, but other people have it worse so I‚Äôve always tried to keep to myself. Growing up my dad was very abusive, my mom didn‚Äôt help either she would let him do whatever he wanted to me. As I got older and finally started to understand the abusive and try to speak out about it, my aunts and uncles didn‚Äôt believe me and told me I was just crazy and not to make any serious allegations like that, after that I never fully been able to trust anyone or tell anyone anything about me.
      Things only seemed to get worse, my whole family has turned against me, I have a boyfriend who I can‚Äôt even talk to because he doesn‚Äôt understand my depression and anxiety and tells me to get over it, I feel like he‚Äôs my dad in so many ways and sometimes he‚Äôs so nice but sometimes he‚Äôs so mean if I don‚Äôt have my happy front on. 
    I‚Äôm extremely anxious about everything, I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people and make friends. I always feel like people are judging me and no one likes me. This has resulted in my on going eating disorder I‚Äôve been underweight since who knows when but when I gain even one pound it sends me over the edge. 
   I just want someone to finally talk to and finally help me, maybe I don‚Äôt deserve it and I feel like that a lot of the time. I know I haven‚Äôt been perfect either so I‚Äôm always basically waiting for something bad to happen because I believe I deserve it. I do not have health insurance, and I can never hold a job because my anxiety gets too serve. I don‚Äôt know what to do or where to turn, I just want to feel better.

One thing that has remained consistent throughout my life is that I've had people in my head (sounds a little weird). I would always imagine a happy, fulfilling life with me at the centre of it, recieving love and support from made-up people. I still do that. I don't have a good memory due to being chronically depressed but I think this is the first time I'm realising how devastating that is. 

a few years ago, I found out through a bit of googling that this is called ""maladaptive daydreaming"". I haven't given it much thought since then tbh but I've continued to do it.

I'm just pondering here but maybe this whole habit of mine is the reason I don't try at anything. I don't see a future for myself I just imagine ideal scenarios where I'm happy. I guess I have convinced myself that there's no hope and no potential, except maybe in my head.

2336,Aggressive_Manner346,1618374534,1,"TFW terrible things just won‚Äôt stop happening :(

I‚Äôm 28F in case that‚Äôs relevant. For context, I‚Äôm living with my parents and working in a garbage law firm. I‚Äôm broke and I just can‚Äôt seem to get my shit together.


My father has bipolar that he won‚Äôt treat. Last year he lost our house because he procrastinated on filing bankruptcy. We had to move out in a week, and the only reason we got that week was because I went to my boss, who is an attorney, and I asked him if he could help. My mom has no idea how to deal with him and she‚Äôs just let him kick her down all these years- i can tell you, if my SO said the shit to me that he does to my mom, it would be divorce worthy. It‚Äôs not always awful with him, but when it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs bad. If you have any experience with bipolar, you‚Äôll know.


Things have also been bad for my grandmother. She‚Äôs just had a pacemaker put in and is in the hospital still, but there are a few minor complications, so we are waiting to see what‚Äôs going on. This situation has been on and off for a month. In the midst of dealing with this, my best friend ghosted me out of nowhere. She was an online friend, but we were very close, we‚Äôd even talked about meeting in person, and maybe getting a place together if it worked out. I don‚Äôt really have IRL friends, so I have pretty much no one to talk to but my mom and my brother. I feel like I‚Äôm a burden to them sometimes. 

The other issue I‚Äôm dealing with is work. My boss is a huge asshole. He gets pissed off at me over the most trivial things, I‚Äôm constantly walking on eggshells. I can‚Äôt even have a pack of gum on my desk even though other people do whatever they want. I wonder if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm the youngest person there. 

My OTHER boss decided to break up the law firm because the evil boss fought tooth and nail to keep the office open and risk exposing people to COVID, and now he‚Äôs harassing people daily about their vaccine appointments. He was extremely angry about some of the moms needing different schedules due to their children being home from school. It was just horrible. I did get an appointment btw, but I really didn‚Äôt appreciate my employer prying that way. I am fully in support of the vaccine, but I don‚Äôt think my boss needs to stalk me over it.. 

The good news is that the better half of the firm will give me a permanent work from home position.  He even said he would give me a raise, because I‚Äôm making $15 an hour after doing this shit for almost 10 years (various firms). However, we don‚Äôt know when this will be. So I‚Äôm sitting here freaking out about how I may or may not have to go back to hell on earth on Monday, because evil boss waits until Friday every time to reassess the work from home schedule. Ugh. I can‚Äôt even imagine going back to seeing his face full time.  The MF walks by my desk all the time because he‚Äôs WAITING for me to make a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù so he can lecture me. I know it‚Äôs not forever. I simply don‚Äôt want to be bullied and belittled in the meantime; which is kind of inevitable with him.

 I‚Äôve always worked for douchey male attorneys who think I‚Äôm an idiot because I‚Äôm a young woman, but the fact that I‚Äôm used to it doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling like I‚Äôm losing my goddamned mind. There is no HR, it‚Äôs a small firm, so yeah....

I think that I don‚Äôt have enough going on on my life outside of work. I‚Äôve been dwelling on this stuff for hours every damn day, and this isn‚Äôt even the tip of the iceberg. What if I end up alone? What if I want kids and I‚Äôm too old? What if I get stuck in these shitty law firms forever, being a caretaker to my parents while my brother travels the world? AAAAA!!! Jeez, I didn‚Äôt even get into my atrocious exes, which is why I‚Äôm terrified to try dating again. Honestly I think I have too many issues anyway. I hated it when guys would dump their baggage on me, and I wouldn‚Äôt wanna do it to them either. It‚Äôs not healthy. 

I know that this was ridiculously long, so I commend you for having read the whole thing, lmao. Luckily I do have some things to be grateful for. I have a home, I do have a family that loves me, even if they drive me insane. I have a dog. I‚Äôm taking a few online classes for the fall semester, so I can hopefully get out of these law firms. All I can do is hope it works out.

I‚Äôm going up a dose on my mood medicine at the moment. Cried daily for the past week just because of stress, and now it‚Äôs WORSE because of the meds, at least for no. I also plan on seeking therapy. I‚Äôve been through many therapists, mostly terrible.. I was kind of burned out on going through my entire life history with people for awhile. But I think I‚Äôm ready now. I cannot live like this. I‚Äôm not eating right, I haven‚Äôt been sleeping, and I‚Äôm dehydrated. I‚Äôm a train wreck. 

Advice welcome. Does anyone know any therapy chat apps that accept Amerihealth? I like the idea of being able to text my therapist during a crisis (even if they don‚Äôt answer immediately, I know that‚Äôs how the apps work) do any of the traditional therapists usually offer that service?

So why have I never had a group of solid friends? Or a long term best friend(s)? If anyone is into astrology, please let me know what things in my chart cause me to lack that part in my life.
I feel incredibly lonely. Up until now I‚Äôve never had a problem with being alone &amp; doing everything alone. But now I‚Äôm starting to realize I have no one in times of distress. When I really need company and someone to talk to, I have no real support. 
Everyone is an acquaintance or minor friend. No one that actually cares about me. Everyone has their own BFF or group of friends, and ppl they really love and care for. But I have no one that feels that for me. Other wise they‚Äôd show up in times of need and also in general. I find I have no one to go thrifting with anymore. No one to have sleepovers with. No one to go eat with or play video games with. I‚Äôm really getting lonelier and it‚Äôs harder for me to cope.
Again, I was never dependent on people and never even noticed my unintentional aloofness with everyone in my life. Until now. It‚Äôs like everyone around me easily made deep, lasting, and very involved connections with each other except me. I actually hate being alone now which sucks because I‚Äôm forced to. Even if I was defendant, I wouldn‚Äôt have anyone to depend on.
What do I do? I try to reach out to people but don‚Äôt get the response I need or any response really. Bc they have other people they care about more &amp; im simply not an important factor in their lives.
I‚Äôm also not trying to pitty or victimize. It‚Äôs actually taking a lot to admit how lonely I actually am. And how much I crave friendship and care now.",lonely,Why have I never had FRIENDS friends,2021-04-14 14:15:50

I have friends but they‚Äôre mostly in relationships. They tell me I‚Äôll find someone, but how do they know? I‚Äôm on dating apps but find it hard to follow through. I don‚Äôt want to meet someone in a way that feels forced, yet I hardly go out. I‚Äôm introverted and it‚Äôs a pandemic. 

I used to hate the idea of getting into a relationship out of loneliness, but now I wonder if that‚Äôs such a bad thing. Is it so wrong to want to date someone simply because I‚Äôm lonely?

But it‚Äôs not that simple. Just because I‚Äôm ready to date doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll find I like who likes me back. Relationships take a long time to form. 

I‚Äôve been prioritizing me and my career for a long time, but it‚Äôs also been a way for me to distract myself from this loneliness.

I‚Äôm feeling desperate, which is something I never wanted to admit to myself. I liked to think of myself as a strong, independent person who doesn‚Äôt need anyone to be happy, but I think I‚Äôve been lying to myself. 

I need a partner. I need to love and be loved. I need to be touched in a loving and romantic way. I need someone to commit to me and see a future with me.

there's always that loneliness sitting inside of your bed, already warming up your spot
because no matter what,
love and illusion are so good at disguising themselves when fantasy is all we have to work with.
there is nothing more lonely than truly being alone. with your thoughts. your failures. your mistakes and regrets. with truly being misunderstood and being seen from just the shallow surface. 
with no chance to reveal the self in the way we want when we are in a body that can't grow nothing but weeds anymore.

nothing seems to grow out of these ruined soils
and i am that stunted tree.

Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. Whoever lives in Love lives in God, and God in them. 1 John 4:7

Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. 1 John 2:15-17 

Whoever claims to Love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not Love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot Love God, whom they have not seen. 1 John 4:20-21

There is no fear in Love. But perfect Love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in Love. 1 John 4:18

&amp;#x200B;

Only if one knows the truth of love, which is the real nature of Self, will the strong entangled knot of life be untied. Only if one attains the height of love will liberation be attained. Such is the heart of all religions. The experience of Self is only love, which is seeing only love, hearing only love, feeling only love, tasting only love and smelling only love, which is bliss.

What is bliss but your own being ? You are not apart from being which is the same as bliss. You are now thinking that you are the mind or the body which are both changing and transient. But you are unchanging and eternal. That is what you should know. \~Ramana Maharshi

&amp;#x200B;

What is God? 

The eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. 

What is love?

To feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it.

Therefore, all love is the love of God.

\~Eckhart Tolle

&amp;#x200B;

Love God with all your heart, mind and soul and this is the secret to entering The Kingdom of Heaven.

We ask you. ‚ÄúWho is the identity of this great God?‚Äù

Love YOU with all your heart, mind and soul!

\~Archangel Michael 

&amp;#x200B;

When you talk of love, there is duality, is there not? - the person who loves and the entity called God who is loved?

The individual is not separate from God.

Hence love means one has love towards one's own Self. 

He who experiences the unity of life sees his own Self in all beings and all beings in his own Self...

To abide in the Self you must love the Self. 

Since God is verily the Self, 

love of the Self is love of God...

\~Ramana Maharshi  


Realize that I AM in my Father, and you are in me, and I AM in you. Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.

\~Jesus

And when he sees Me in All and sees All in Me, then I never leave him and he never leaves Me. And he who in this Oneness of Love Loves Me in whatever he sees, wherever this man may live in Truth he Lives in Me.

\-Bhagavad Gita

Only by LOVE can men see me, and know me, and come unto me. He who works for me, who loves me, whose End Supreme I AM, free from attachment to all things, and with Love for All Creation, he in Truth comes unto me.

2375,tomwongxyz,1617985624,1,"Hi,

**So I'm getting kicked from a lot of subs. Please god, not this sub too. Mods, before you take action, please read or let the people decide (upvote/downvote). I only get positive feedback.**

**I'm making this post because I know my heart is in the right place. Everyone should have at least 1 person in their lives they can always turn to. There's so many places (including subreddits) to make friends. Yet, there's so many people who say they have ""no one"" (eg people here).**

So I'm making this post because I'm tired of seeing people go through the same loop of meeting people, months/years later, try to meet people again. Stop ""meeting"" and start ""growing"".

**Making friends is easy. Growing the friendship is the hard part.**

How many times in your life have you met someone once, thought it was nice, and then nothing happened ever again? In the case of this sub, maybe you wait for the person to set up the next meet, which never happens. So that was the end of that.

**That shouldn't be what happens.**

Friendship is all about commitment, because life, awkwardness, etc. always get in the way.

Now, I know that's easier said than done. That's why I made a subreddit, so you can ask for advice/self-affirm your commitment, etc.

I'm tired of seeing millions of people attempt to make friends and nothing happens.

I want to see people start committing, not feel constantly disappointed in themselves.

**Please go to my profile if you want to check out the subreddit I create. (If I post a link, I get insta-banned).**

**I'll be there to help / provide motivation as needed.**",lonely,Does anyone have trouble making friends?,2021-04-10 02:27:04

Your voice wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind despite how I tried

Crippled and decaying my mind drifted as if i was in the clouds 

Numbed by your addictive whispers, I wish that they didn‚Äôt become so loud 

Naive me, no one told me that you decided good and bad 

No one told me about empty promises or how  hierarchies lied

They weren‚Äôt my god, you were and yet You still said good bye 

No one said that heaven and hell could be flipped so seamlessly like an hour glass idly spun from its stand 

Mute souls, they signaled for me to run for they knew your plan 

But I didn‚Äôt listen because of course this is love, 



isnt it? 



Poisoned by your gradual change in tone, my mind became trapped in the eternal spinning of time 

The eternal spinning of the hour glass 

The one that watched us live our lives together, 

the one that watched you live your life with someone else

I envy that hour glass because despite our parallels I never seem to reach my heaven 

For all that you left me was hell

Not to blow my own trumpet or anything but I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm quite a likeable person. People laugh at my jokes, I try to talk to people about what there passionate about. And it works. I do make friends wherever I go really. But when I move on I always lose contact with them. I don‚Äôt have any friends left from secondary or primary school. I don‚Äôt speak to anyone from my first few years of college. I doubt that I will keep in touch with anyone from my current college class. 

The catch is I actually found a really good friend. Like I could see is keeping in touch and everything. And with her she brings some more friends so that‚Äôs a bonus. The problem is she is really pissing me off at the moment. I won‚Äôt tell you why, and quite frankly it‚Äôs not important. But she‚Äôs done the same thing a few times now. And each time it‚Äôs more annoying than the last. It just makes me not want to be friends with her. Which is sad because normally she‚Äôs a really good friend and we get on really well and I like the group of friends that she had as well. 

I have a big thing about friends. I don‚Äôt like telling them anything personal or inviting them to my house or anything because they usually leave and it would just make it more painful. But this particular friend I invited up to have dinner with me and my mother. And now she‚Äôs done ‚Äúthat thing again‚Äù and I don‚Äôt want her to come up because she‚Äôs pissing me off. The sad thing is I know she‚Äôll do it again. She‚Äôs done it about 5 or 6 times previously. 

So there‚Äôs the dilemma. I stay friends with her and I have to put up with her doing this really irritating thing every month or so. Or I start to slowly stop the contact and I lose her and the friends she has. It feels like a lose-lose  situation tbh.

This was quite therapeutic tbh. Just to get it off my chest.

2393,Trow865553,1617969233,1,"My problems started in school. i had trouble connecting to people, i always felt people responded to situations very strangely, and mostly never felt like i understood the people around me. it was like my logic wasn't logical if that makes sence ? This resulted into heavy and frequent bullying; knocked out teeth, bruises over whole body, being shunned by the entire class. As i grew older trough highschool this did improve a little as i was getting used to how i was supposed to be acting. 

My school period resulted in my first 2 diagnosed depressions (11y and 16y) and first attempt (16y)

After my first attempt i made myself a promise, i would do everything in my power to give living a proper chance, and set a date for myself 25Y old. if i hadn't improved life for myself by then, i would be allowed by myself to...

This resulted in me trying to do pretty much everything that makes everybody else happy by trying to have an active social life and not closing myself of from the world. but everything always felt forced, unreal, like a chore. 

I am 28Y old now, and i find myself keep running the same cycle. 

I feel bad so i start locking myself up -&gt; realize i am locking myself up -&gt; Trying to go outside and have an active social life -&gt; come home, realizing i am feeling worse then before -&gt; feel bad so i lock myself up -&gt; realize i am locking myself up......

Somewhere along the way i have gotten it stuck in my head i would need a partner to feel happy (like relying on somebody to provide me happiness is a good idea...) So i am frantically looking for a partner left and right. while rational me knows it wont change my situation or view. But emotional me cannot find another potential way to find ""my happiness"" anymore.

2395,TakeCareOfYourEyes,1617968998,1,"After I posted a message on ""looking for family"" subreddit, I managed to find a few people to talk to: one I am still friends with and I think all will be good, the other one - we're not talking that much yet and the third one... had to cut ties with.

We exchanged a few long messages and all she kept talking about was politics, identity stuff, ""misogyny"", et cetera. I am in no way a defender of misogyny or anything else that's hateful but I also don't like this ""anything conservative is bad because Trump turned it into a cult"". It's true that he did, but that doesn't mean all conservative ideas are bad, and it's not like those who support Trump give any care about it, just like a lot of liberals don't really feel interested in dogmas of liberalism apart from ""get high and have sex with everything that moves"".

In any case, I am not political and I try to realize that people usually follow whatever is more benefitting to them. Within three messages she told me how to think, what to say and what not to say, she also kept ""educating"" me in a very condescending way. I was going to close my eyes on this but when she ended her message saying how she is offended because I told her that Japanese arts (anime, games, etc.) aren't supposed to be made for everyone and that they actually tend to be more diverse than Western-produced pop-culture... I just decided it's best to stop talking to her.

And she also had this ""don't do this, don't say scary stuff because it makes people feel triggered"". For crying out loud, is her life so easy that she gets triggered by a word on the Internet?? And then these people talk about oppression.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make it clear that I'm not an advocate for misogyny or anything like that. If there's a liberal person around - that's me. But it's sad to see people who act like lunatics and cover up their insanity with stuff like ""I'm fighting for the cause!!"". There's no cause in looking down on people, in getting offended for the sake of being offended or using your vulnerable status for victim-play.

I realized I've been living life by just looking at distractions, and embarrasingly, like pretending Im a celebrity? and all i do is go to parties and get along with people and make fun movies, and it def comes alot from everything i see on twitter, and like those fun interviews of actors having fun and making friends as their job. I talk to myself like im on an interview, i fantasize about being chums on press tours. But then i think realistically, if I was in that situation and an actor, and i would absolutely hate it-i am the shyest person, and i would hate performing in front of ppl, and talking about my personal life, and having to network for a job and be known by tons of people. i would be so anxious all the time, and i hate talking about myself, and being perceived.

But in my real life, i honestly have no idea who i am. I love my friends, but sometimes i feel guilty because i just dont have alot of empathy, even for myself. I've stayed up till 5am looking at celebrities i like, and destroying my posture and eyesight, but if i ever saw one of those celebrities in public i would be so uncomfortable. I think i want to get better aand live my life, but my life is so mundane, and im not going to be anything spectacular, and it hurts and is terrifying to admit to myself I need to find happiness in my small life, especially when i dont even know what my happiness is. Ive tried getting off my phone, but i cannot be alone with my thoughts and anxiety about my future and my self worth for even a minute. Part of me doesnt even want to try to get better- i just want to keep living in this fantasies because i know ill never be satisfied. How do i build values, and see them in myself, when i dont even want to try sometimes? i have no values, and no desire to take care of myself, and that scares me, in the long run. i dont plan to live long.

I dont even have a dreamjob-if i had to be anything, i want to feel how a beach feels at nighttime when its empty and theres a cool wind and the citylights are reflecting on the water, nothing productive, but something that feels meaningful. I wouldnt mind working at a coffee shop the rest of my life if that paid enough but it doesnt. i also feel guilty wanting that, because ambition has been drilled into me since i was a kid (and honestly-ambition is something i just dont have the talent for. im not being cruel to myself, just honest. i need to accept reality, but god its so hard), i can hear my mother screaming its not a real job, and im better than that and a part of me is like yes i should work at vogue and become anne hathaway in the devil wears prada but thats a movie, and not something i could handle, and i am back to square one

2420,Userur,1617946259,1,"Imagine yourself in the following scenario.

You wake up one morning in this random reality. You do the usual, have breakfast and get dressed. Then you head out. Today, you have decided that you will be going to the mall. When you enter the mall, you realize that you had forgotten your phone and don't know what time it is. So you decide to ask some random passerby's the time instead. ""Excuse me sir, do you know what time it is?"" No response. Not only that, he doesn't even look at you. He just continues moving. Knowing that he must be busy or possibly in his thoughts, you try a different passerby. ""Excuse me do you know what time it is?"" Again, no response. Like before, this person also doesn't even look at you. In your mind you're thinking ""what a bunch of self-centered assholes, they cannot answer a simple question."" You try again with a different person, and still no response. So you decide that you'll go shopping and find out the time from the cashier. You go into a store and browse around at the various merchandise there. Eventually, you decide that you'll get a watch. You come over to the checkout and stand in line. You notice the clerk talking to each customer, even cracking a joke here and there. Finally, you reach the register and place your sunglasses on the counter. The clerk asks for the next person in line and the person behind you comes up and places his items there for scanning. ""Wait a minute, I got here before him! I want to buy these sunglasses. Hello!"" Again, no response. It's like as if you are invisible. You go out and try tapping on peoples shoulders asking them random questions to see if you would receive a response. ""Excuse me sir, do you know when the next bus arrives? Excuse me ma'am, how do I get to dillards? Excuse me where do I find the restrooms?"" Again, no responses. You finally give off a big scream and wave your arms around, ""hello!! Can anybody hear me!!??"" The echo of your scream fades quickly amongst the usual business of the crowds. Nobody even batted an eye. At this point you are completely perplexed. You have no idea why you are being ignored by the entire mall. ""Could it be something on my face?"" You look in the mirror and see nothing unusual of different from when you left this morning. ""Could it be the way I smell?"" You put on colon but with no difference. ""Could it be something I have done? Why am I invisible?"" 

You as you go through sections of the mall, you engage in common courtesies like holding a door, or picking up trash and throwing it in the trashbin. From this you receive no thank yous. Just silence. Eventually, after wandering about the mall invisibly for hours, you stumble upon someone that recognizes your presence. 

Random Person: Hey, how are you?

At this point I will ask you (the reader) a question. If this was you, how would you feel about and value the interaction with this individual or the recognition of your presence by this individual, given everything that happened before? Would it be just another mundane, ordinary interaction, or would it have a more profound element to it? 

You: I don't even know how to answer that. I am extremely confused. I feel invisible in this place. 

Random person: mmmkay. I don't know why, there are thousands of other people here. 

You: I know it's crazy. 

Random Person: I mean why don't I have any trouble getting attention ""hey you sir"" stranger: hey. 

You: (But why would he respond to you and not to me? you think inside) Anyway, do you know what time it is?

Random Person: It is 17 minutes past 3. I really don't have much to do today, would you like to go to the food court and grab a snack?

You: Sure. Let's go

The two of you continue to talk and head over to the food court. At this point, you blend in with the rest of the food court and much of the mall, which is filled with families, friends, and couples, all conversing with one another in the background. You engage in an amazing conversation with this person, which lasts for well over an hour. Then, following the conversation, this person cut it short and said ""I got to get going, I have things I need to catch up on."" You can do nothing but respect this persons decision. This person leaves, and heads off into the crowd of people that are essentially like ghosts.   


You get up and try to ask other people questions to see if they notice you. ""Hey do you know where the restrooms are?' No response. You even ask a security guard ""hey do you know how I can get to the side exit?"" No response. While walking, you accidentally hurt yourself and are on the ground. Nobody bats at eye at you. You ask for help, but nobody hears you. It is as if you don't exist. You think about that interaction and how unusual it was. It was like an oasis in a vast desert of solitude. Everyone around you but nobody around you. You help yourself up and manage to find your way out and back to your car.",lonely,Romance from my experience,2021-04-09 15:30:59

2431,TerriblePabz,1617940597,1,"Firstly I will apologize if this gets a bit winded. 

I (23m) have spent alot of time alone. When I say that I don't mean I live in the wilderness or extremely rural and don't see people. I mean at most I have only ever had 1-3 friends at a time and the friendships typically never last further than a year or 2. The ones that do seem to implode due to bad communication or, in a strange amount of cases, they make a new friend that is alot like me. Same interests, hobbies, careers, lifestyles, etc. 

Now this isn't odd by any means, that's typically what builds circles of friends right? Except instead of being included I am kept far apart from them. Day by day communication begins to suffer until after a time, any plans made come with the expectation that this other person will want do to something instead and you will be blown off in any number of ways. Attempting to disregard it has only resulted in the other person eventually cutting all communication. Mentioning it in passing has only ever seemed to make the friend angry and defensive. Actually discussing it at length and discussing why each person has done what they have and how they feel temporarily seems to resolve it. But it always seems to go back. Rarely I have attempted to discuss it multiple times with people's I have come to very deeply care for in one way or another. Only for the same thing to happen over and over regardless of what changes anyone makes or doesn't make. 

I use the term friend because I truly believe that I have warped perceptions of all the relationships in my life due to my past experiences. I suppose the easiest way to put it would be trust issues combined with, not so much a lack of confidence in myself, but a lack of faith it will be enough to meet the standards of the people I care about. I have been told many times I need to focus on myself, not care what others think, or spend more time alone to be more comfortable with myself... unfortunately I have had amazing success doing this, I just hate the person I see in the mirror. I feel like I failed or gave up on the only thing that ever mattered by essentially telling myself to not care about the few people in my life. 

Depression occasionally makes me think of myself as a waste of O2 when it comes to confidence. Yet I can never shake the fact that when the people I have chosen to be friends with are present. I feel like I might as well be a Mythological God suddenly in terms of confidence. And then when I am alone again it's like reality fades back in. I am just a man, unable to provide anything other than my best effort to anyone, yet never able to be enough for anyone to genuinely want to be present in my life.

I suppose the simplest way I can think to summarize this now that I see how much I have written is this. While I know many people care about me. I have never felt like I have had what could he considered a ""best friend"". Whether it be family, friends, or significant others. I have never felt like anyone that has entered my life has done so and not taken far more than they gave. Maybe I am selfish and don't deserve it until I can grow more as a person. Maybe I am actually doing something wrong or unconsciously ruining it. Maybe I am crap at choosing friends. Maybe it's just bad luck. But I can't help but think it's me. I find it hard to belive so many people who claim to care would intentionally do this so often.",lonely,Relationships in many forms.,2021-04-09 13:56:37

Only to be screwed over by covid so online dating was one of the only options. Haven't had much luck til about a month ago when I met a really nice girl. She was my type, smart, funny, charismatic, good in bed, and we had mostly the same interests. Well everything was going well and I decided it was time to delete myself off of the dating apps. Unfortunately, she told me the same day that she has no romantic feelings for me at all. Now that I let my guard down with someone I get hurt. So I decided to get back out there but now I'm not getting any matches and that's making me feel worse. So I don't know what to do.

2452,_At0msk_,1617928618,1,"Once my therapist said something that opened my eyes. She said that maybe my sorrow is a manifestation of a great rage, that surprised me because I never felt like I was angry or something but some things started to make sense after that.

I realised how violent and cruel i have become lately. I started to feel the need to harm people in any way physically and emotionally. I found myself daydreaming about being in a fight with other guys or saying cruel words to people that I hate. This need started to polluting my behavior too, this evening i got so mad that I punched 4 holes on my room‚Äôs door and I said very nasty and violent thing to my mother regarding the whole family until I made her cry, because she was scared. After seeing her like this I regained control but still, this episodes are becoming more frequent and I‚Äôm kinda scared because I was never like this before.

I think this rage is liked to my loneliness and depression because those make me feel powerless against other people. I feel the need of revenge and I want others to suffer as I do even more than I want to get out from this situation and finally be happy.

Can you relate to this need of revenge?

2) It is better to be lonely in your own company, than to be lonely in the company of others. 

3) No response IS a response. 

4) Live alone, create your world, furnish your apartment or house  to reflect you; like Wall-e. 

5) It‚Äôs ok to remove yourself from toxic people, even if they are blood or family. 

6) How you feel is your choice and no one else‚Äôs responsibility, no matter how hurt you are or how much pain they inflicted. 

7) Everyone loves you until you are sad or depressed, and then they scatter. The few who stay are worth keeping.

I (19m) have severe trust issues along with other things due to my past and recently I was trying to open up and make friends because I'm tired of being alone. I was talking to someone for almost 8 months and despite all my doubts and fears I trusted them and told them more than i have told anyone. And once again I was shown that I cant trust people, they lied about mulitple things and used me despite knowing how hard it Is for me to trust. I opened up about almost everything only to once again be shown that my feelings dont matter and that I'm better off alone. Despite everything that happened and what I feel the part I worry about the most is that they have pictures of me. I dont like pictures, I have just never been a fan but I took photos for them, no nudes just one shirtless to show scars. Although all but the one are just normal pictures I still worry about them being sent around. I have never had a relationship or anything because I have always been the outcast and told to be quiet but I thought we could have something. Nobody has stuck around and I only have 1 friend left (not kidding) I had 2 after years of nobody but I'm back to one. And what's sad is now I dont really trust the last one I have anymore, they haven't done anything wrong and were there for me when I needed them after the other person but I cant help but feel like I just need to stop talking to them and be alone again. I wont really open up about what's going on because I feel dumb for still being sad even though it's been about 2 weeks. I just feel like a burden if I talk about my feelings so I shut myself down. I hate myself for opening up to someone despite knowing that they would lie to me and leave like everyone else. I just feel dumb for believing I could have someone, and this is not the first time I have been screwed over just trying to make friends or find someone. Everyone finds something wrong with me and uses it against me. I lost a whole friend group because one of my ""friends"" learned from their parent that I have something wrong with me and decided that it was their right to tell the others. And that's not even the worst but despite all of it I tried yet again to make friends and now I'm trying not to isolate myself but it's so hard not to just be by myself again. It was lonely but I made do with my games and music because at least I can feel some sort of happiness with them. I just want to have a good group of friends and feel loved and wanted but I cant keep trying however if I dont try I dont think anyone with bother with me.

Through out high and college I had few ""friends"" I guess but they never really clicked with me so whenever theyd ask me to hangout I'd always reject and theyd eventually stop talking to me coz id never really respond to them and id  feel super lonely again.

So here I am. No real life friends in Canada and been alone for last whole year during Covid and my only friend I tak to regularly is in another country and I am lonely as shit.

Idk what's the problem with me. I'm always lonely af and wanna hang out with someone i like but at the same time Id rather be alone and I can't even find someone I like at this point.

I went on a diet and been losing weight so hopefully I could fix myself and put myself out there more. Idk hope I could be less insecure to be out in the world and make some friend or meet some dudes.

I could be up gaming or watching something and my brain just turns on me and I think how I don‚Äôt feel close to finding someone (female) who I‚Äôm interested in or attracted too.

I'm ultra productive. Studying to college, another language and going to the gym 6x a week.

Sometimes I like to imagine that I would be way happier if I had more friends or a girlfriend. Truth be told, they're the most important thing in the world. Yes, they're. The people are. The thing I most hate is also the thing I most love. How do I live with this curse?

It's always around midnight that these thoughts start running through my mind. I hate it. Why do I need to feel like shit before I sleep? My life has a meaning, right? I guess so, I study to have my dream job.

I felt like those feelings couldn't be ignored for longer, so I downloaded Tinder, and wow, I never felt worse before. Not because I felt ugly, I believe in my beauty. But I realized that the lack of interacting with people and socializing resulted in me having close to no recent photos. Needless to say that they were all trash.

I always keep thinking that having a girlfriend or more friends will change my life for better, but I'm not even sure anymore... These dreams I have about me having a better life also don't help.

All of my life, ever since elementary even, I've always wanted to care and spend time with someone special. I have had 3 relationships in my life, and all of them were failures because the other person never actually liked me that much. And after each one, I would question what the fuck was wrong with me, and I still wonder if theres something wrong with me. I would try to hug them, I would hang out with them, I would try to have conversations with them and if they didn't like anything I would back off and give them space. The only thing I didn't do was act like a fucking robot and go ""would you like, a, hug?"" Whenever the time was appropriate. 

And now, after all of those failed relationships, and the fact that I can't even try to make friends or find a partner without being looked at like an alien due to quarantine makes my me hurt more than ever. As im writing this, it feels like someone's ACTUALLY tugging on my heart strings, and I just want to curl up and cry. 

I used to make up fake scenarios in my head and play them out like a story for fun, or when my mind just won't shut up. But now, I fantasize about characters that I somehow grow feelings for (i've never fucking had that happen), and imagine them comforting me, listening to me, and even letting me take care of them. I write these stories in my head so I can feel happy for 10 minutes, and then have to remind myself and replay a part in the story to feel happy again.

I feel like im on the brink of insanity or even fucking Depression: Electric boogaloo, Highschooler edition.

2551,hushed_exuberance,1617855047,1,"For clarification purpose, I want to precise that it is not specifically loneliness that I'm feeling right now.. But rather a very odd mix of shock, confusion and dumbfoundedness.

In 28 March 2021, my father passed away from a sudden septic shock. Cause leading to death : unknown.

One thing to note about my father, is that during my my whole life, he literally never needed any sort of medical intervention. He was just the kind of person who would endure sickness, let his body naturally recover and go to work regardless, on time and without complaining. 

He literally had the most self-motivated and deciplined work ethic of anybody I know of. 

One day coming back home, my mother told me to check on him, she was kind of displeased by his stubbornness on the matter. So I went to his room, knocked on his door and pleaded for us to talk, but he politely denies my request to come in (which he never does) with a somewhat weakened voice. 

Since that got me somewhat worried I decided to try to talk to him the day after, while at the same time reassuring my mother; knowing the kind of person he is, it seemed as an ephemeral concern. 

Fast forward, the day after, surely he comes from work - on time - stations his car and got in his room before I got out of mine to check on him and provide reassurance on the situation. 

As I'm speaking with my mom, we hear a loud stumble from his room, and as he opens the door headind towards the restroom, I quickly realized that he definitely could not walk nor speak properly either, so within the anxiety spike of the moment, I rush to hold him by his right shoulder and assist him to go through. 

A few moments later he comes out from the restroom, pants wet and unproperly tied back. That was the moment I knew that something is definitely not right! Especially that it was the first moment I ever saw him lose coordination and by then in a sort of exhausted hunched position against the restroom door. 

I felt a crawling chill over my spine within that exact moment, I quickly tried assisting him back to his room with a tight grip, as I tried to hide my panic within. Changed his wet clothes, made him something to eat and nervously asked my younger sister to bring my mother's glycogen test kit, where I could barely get a tiny drop of his blood into the testing kit in order to measure his glycimic level which we found highly above average. 

Fast forward, we called an ambulance (which we had to beg for as a favor) before we got him taken to the nearest army veterans hospital he belongs to (he was retired and enrolled in a prestigious educational establishment at the time) . Where they processed him reasonably fast, but not fast enough apparently as they pronounced him dead shortly after they asked us to leave and comeback the day after for some bloodwork testing results they had for him. 

Surprisingly enough they did not call us to tell us his passing, let alone provide an explanation of how and why. Until we got a call from a relative of him who went checking after she got word he was on hospital. 

So there was me getting the news of my father's death soon after I got back home while getting ready to go back the day after to check his test results like we were told. 

Shock was an understatement for the kind of person he always been. And the sudden circumstances revolving around this very short lived tragedy. 

Especially the part where I had to go through his burial service on my 26'th birday, which is 29 march. The day after he was pronounced dead. 

Now forward today 7 April 2021 , I woke up to greet my mom early morning as I sometime do, went back and fell asleep for about an hour or so till I woke up to the screams of my two sisters asking for help concerning my mother who apparently fell into a coma state. My older sister was sleeping right on the other side of a separate bed from her. She then told me she could hear my mom saying ""I think I'm passing out"". (I know.. ) 

As I arrived on the living room (where they both were sleeping) I could see my mom in apparently a vegetative state where through our panic, not knowing what exactly to do about a situation like this and scrambling through her phone's contact list for who we could call for help, I could literally see the color fading out from her face as I'm getting flash backs of my father's passing several days ago, I ask my sister to focus on a mouth to mouth rather than CPR while I immediately start calling the national *north african country* medical emergency phone number where I could finally get hold of an operator after 3 or four instant hangups, where I literally was commanded to not raise my voice while I was pleading for my mother's life for them to send help, to then where he proceeds to explain to me that they only come to road accidents, and muggings but not to houses. Then got hung up on after I insist that I'm inquiring about a minute by minute life and death situation. 

Enough about the national emergency conversation, we called a private emergency ambulance where after 10 minutes of debate after they came, drove my mother's body to a hospital who wouldn't take her off the ambulance because they pronounced her dead the same morning, cause leading to death: undiagnosed. 

All I could feel in this situation is an augmented version of similar mix of feelings I felt about my Father's death several days ago. 

I think this is either because I'm still not past the first stages of grief or that so much tragic events happened in such a short amount of time. 

There were still people coming to our house to mourn the passing of my father when now my mother just did. 

But I can tell that a truly deep feeling of loneliness is learking on the horizon.

My Father was described as a person with strong personality but yet a naturally motivational and inspiring character for many who knew him. 
Anybody who engaged in conversations with him would either leave with a better outlook on things or with many novelties as he was always a open to new ideas. 
Many of his colleagues enjoy regular conversations with him, as while they may be from a unique perspective but never boring. 
One of his hobbies he has cherished during his life was Writing, which came up to my attention after I found about a home made collection of personal quotes book he started writing since 2017 with about 1200 quotes/thoughts. 

One of the last quotes he wrote before his passing was ""I admire the kinds of people whose weapon is their intellect not their tongue, and their last stand is silence, not speech."" (1959-2021)

Unlike my Father, my Mother was more of an extroverted type, easily making long standing friendships and overcoming confrontation just by the sheer size of her big heart. I don't say this just because she happens to be my mom, but thinking back, I could never remember an instance where she would hold grudges or display genuine hate for anybody. Even towards those who deserve it. 
One of the most heart breaking moments were those where sometime she would just call me or my sisters for no reason just to keep her company even for the few times most of us were out or not in the living room since she lost the ability to move. I can imagine how depressing it can be being confined to the same room for two years for the most part...
Coming back from her burial service this afternoon, one thing was clear for me, is how much people who came paying respect were deeply in sorrow for her loss and how genuinely saddened they were by her passing. Needless to quantify how much positive impact she had on me and the core role she played within our family . (1961-2021)

To provide some context on the my current situation I have a teen sister and an older one, my older sister lives overseas and comes to our country (in North Africa) only once a year. So we essentially went from  a five person household to a two (only me and my teen sister). Having the house, still with our parents belongings all to just the two of us. 

There are too many other issues and details relating to this that I can't mention in one thread, but I'll probably be open to talk about it as this unfolds later down the line.

I'm more of a like father like son case, mostly introverted. I don't have legit IRL friends, so I spend most of my time online. Either for work or entertainment. 

I suppose some people on this subreddit might be looking for friends so I welcome you if you want to keep company or dm.

I am a high schooler who has a job washing dishes at a local restaurant. Since dish washing isn't exactly popular, all of the other dish washers have quit--and I have been the only one left for months, despite the restaurant being one of the most popular in the town. It was absolute hell at times, but I never left.

One night after my shift one of my coworkers, who rarely ever talks to me, hands me an envelope. I go home, open it, and find that it's a thank you note, signed by most of my coworkers. It contained personal messages thanking me for sticking around and included a $50 gift card inside. 

This is probably the kindest gift I've ever been given, and coupled with the fact that people rarely talk to me, let alone thank me, it was more meaningful than anything. I'm surprised to say that it was the first time I've cried in a very, very long time. I thoroughly believed that they purposely ignored me and didn't like me, so the note completely blindsided me. That note was the only gratitude I've received in a while.

About 8 years ago when I had enough of world, pride, people, respect, fame and power...I asked God to take it all away from me, and give me the Truth, meaning of life, wisdom, mysteries of existence, kingdom of heaven, salvation and all else...I asked God to send me Jesus to reveal these things to me, even if it meant that I would be the only person in the world to know the truth, even if all my friends would leave me, even if my family didnt believe me, I had unsatiable desire to know the Truth.  


And lo..."" [Ask,](https://biblehub.com/greek/154.htm) [and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [it will be given](https://biblehub.com/greek/1325.htm) [to you;](https://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm) [seek,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2212.htm) [and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [you will find;](https://biblehub.com/greek/2147.htm) [knock,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2925.htm) [and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [the door will be opened](https://biblehub.com/greek/455.htm) [to you.](https://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm) "" Matthew 7:7   


If I had to write about the experience, whole world would be small for the books that would be written, I will just say Jesus came to me while I was in deep sleep from heaven, spoke to me telepathically, and ordered my soul to rise, and my soul was lifted out of body into this higher sphere where everything was shining with golden light energy, but the figure before me, shone with the radiance of white bright light of a thousand suns, and the warmth of that Light was most powerful LOVE my soul ever felt, and it was the Ascended Glorious Jesus the CHRIST.  


To skip it, after we had eternal conversation and education, my soul came back to body, after I woken, I had no memory of what happened even tho i felt different, inspired. As days went on, I began attracting and reading books, following my heart, I was guided by divine guru from within and in the next few months, I reached a point where for my 20th birthday, I experienced short self-realization/enlightenment/ascension, where I became one with God and experienced myself as eternal supreme consciousness ""I am that I AM""...  


To skip it, as time went on I slipped from that high awareness and vibe, and in time my ego crept back, and my old reptilian programming (I served as a host to demon/archon/reptilian/satan 19 years) and I fallen into such deep darkness and ignorance, my suffering reached a point where I couldnt live, I prayed for death for days and days on, and I was certain I am greatest sufferer on earth. My suffering burned both hell, heaven and earth and my cries reverberated throughout universe....  


What makes me lonely, is because growing up, I made pact with devil for power, and in one sense I sacrificed myself to serve as host demon so it would abuse me from within and not others, altho, it abused others through me, each time I got drunk, my soul was in back trunk, while the demon was at wheel and run the shw through my body, I was uber aggresive and got many criminal charges, was suicidal, and nearly finished in jail..  


After 17 years of dark life, all in my village and county see me as crazy in evil, altho they do not know it was demon who done evil through me, and now, when I became a servant, messenger, ""prophet"" of God...everyone thinks Im crazy and lost my mind, cuz I smoke weed n use drugs...nobody believes me, even tho I may be crazy, I am not insane and I am not deluded.  


I could tell people the truth and lead them and show them to eternal life, but they look me, but they do not see me, they listen to me, and they do not hear me, and there is no greater pain or loneliness for me than that.  


I dont have friends, I have nobody, and I dont care I am alone, I have God and I am happy alone, I am alone everyday at home in my room, what makes me lonely is that I cant fulfill and feed my soul by teaching and sharing with others all these blessings and truths and treasures God has planted into my heart, since I have it all, but can share none, I am withering away like a dry grass...  


My soul starves to serve and help and enlighten and encourage and inspire and heal and help,  
but the darkness of my life eclipses my radiant light, and people walk right pass me following blind men into the pit.  


That would be all, hurts me to focus/think/write this,   


anyone who read this far, I want you to know, God who is Infinite Love, WILL ALL GREATEST FOR YOU,  
it is only you who limiting yourself, through your beliefs, thoughts, feelings...  


You are made in the image of God - ""Love, which created me, is what I AM""  
You are Light, You are Love, You are Life, Truth, Energy, Consciousness, Spirit of the One God,  
and all He has and is, is given you for eternity.  


War of Darkness and Light wages on from time immemorial, but in the end darkness shall fall and light shall be all. Join us in Love, for Light is Love, as my dearest brother and closest friend and most beloved Father the Christ so beautifully puts it;  


""God is Love. I am Love. Compassion, Forgiveness, Hope, Harmony and Joy are Love. When you feel and act on these feelings, you are One with Us, and We are One with You.

God is Love; God is Light. Love is Light. Love is Peace, Joy, Harmony, Laughter, Compassion, Forgiveness and Kindness. God is all these things, therefore God is Pure Love. There is no vengeance, no punishment nor any threat of disapproval or any other dark judgment in God's Love. This is the mythology of the past, and it is a misunderstanding of what God feels toward his/her children.

I AM One with God, as you are.  WE ARE ONE.  This is the lesson I bring to you in Joy and in Unending Love.  You are God, as I AM.  We cannot be separated, because we are not separate.  No physical distance, no idea or belief can keep us apart.  We are destined to live in harmony and peace, in absolute Love.  So be it. ""

2573,beinginlovewithyou,1617842287,1,"I (27) can‚Äôt stop thinking about a girl (20) who I work with. She has a boyfriend. They are both moving away in a few months. I‚Äôve worked with her for about 3-4 months or so, we got along pretty well right from the start. I found her super attractive, but what really grew on me was her sweet personality. She‚Äôs always finding ways to engage in conversations with me and I feel like as we‚Äôve gotten to know each other we have definitely formed a bond/friendship. 

Knowing that she has a boyfriend, and me being a bit older than her, I didn‚Äôt think much about the growing friendship, I didn‚Äôt really have intent on having feelings for her like I do at the moment. I was fine just having a cool friend at work. But there are things that she has done and said, along with my own naturally growing endearment for who she is, that‚Äôs made me start to kind of fall for her. Where I can‚Äôt even get her off my mind. It‚Äôs so bad when I have worked with her and I get off work, I spend the rest of the day just thinking about her, and her eyes and some of the looks she gives me. Or just the genuine fun time I have being around her. 

One of the things she does is like wait around for me to leave work, and in the parking lot she makes a point to drive by my car and always give a sweet wave and smile, and of course those beautiful eyes with such a gaze that sticks with me for the rest of the day. 

Another thing is she‚Äôs alludes to being jealous when I engage with other females at work, she brings up things I‚Äôve said on social media, she even said she ‚Äúlooks into my posts way too much‚Äú... why?

I don‚Äôt really need to read into those things much because I already know, that end of the day she‚Äôs with her boyfriend. And they are moving away soon, which kind of bums me out but also is probably the best thing, the thing I need to keep most in mind while trying to control my feelings for her.


This all makes me feel really pathetic. I am a hopeless romantic, and can‚Äôt help but think of how nice it‚Äôd be to have her by my side. 

I realize that I‚Äôm mostly just her at work attention/validation, and that most people are going to say : ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt want someone who would leave you like she left her boyfriend‚Äù or whatever. That‚Äôs not even really what I want or expect to happen. I‚Äôm just bummed about the potential relationship we could have had the circumstances been different. I need to just lose the feelings, and not allow them to get in between what is a good friendship. Take it on myself to grow up and not fall so easily just because i have a bond with someone, even if it does feel kind of special, to me atleast...

2579,Useful_Use,1617838199,1,"I want a best friend. Man or woman idc. Just be 23-30 ideally. +/- one or two years from that is okay. 

I'm a dreamer, I like to fantasize about what for me seems to be impossible lately. 
I'm in search of a long-term friendship for someone that is similar to me. 

One where we share some similar interests. That we aren't there to drag each other down or just listen to sad talk all the time. (That shit gets tiring) every once in a while it's okay to vent for everyone of course.


I'd love to have a friend I could talk to all the time, no matter what time of the day it is. And the same would go for them of course. 

The ideal friend I'm Searching for should share 3+ or more of my interest/important personality traits or ideas I share. 

Here's some stuff about me. If you relate to 3 or more let's be friends. 

* Not easily offended. Meaning witty banter between each other is okay. It's not to trash talk each other, but taking everything seriously nah. 
*Like friends (the series)
*Likes the walking dead
*Breaking bad
*Speaks English/Danish (I am from Denmark but you can be from anywhere in the world. As long as we can communicate)
*Hearthstone (the game)
*Chess rush (the game online/app)
* Arvil Lavigne 
*Dua lipa
*Drake
*Debating about things going on in the world
*Memes
*Comics (like webtoon) 
*Working out / fitness health 
*Anime
*Loyal
*Honesty
*Empathy
*Fluent in sarcasm 
*Less fluent in trash talking (I think banter is fun, if it's harmless. But also the other person shouldn't take every single witty thing or banter so serious they're easily offended like I said earlier)


Ability to hold a conversation equally is important for me. (Yes a natural flow is important and it's great and all. But at the end of the day if it's just one person doing all the work in the conversation and there to ""entertain the other"" I have better shit to do than that.) 

I'd like for someone who is genuinely interested in investing time and effort into the friendship as long as both parties do. 

Do I not seem like the type of friend you want. By all means don't contact me. You definitely have the right not to do so of course. 

Should I peak your interest and you wanna be friends with me. By all means too. Definitely hit me up and we will be awesome friends together. 

Feel free to message me, (or don't) if you want. 

I understand that for some people a best friend is build up over years and years of time. This isn't to discuss what a real friend is, what it means all of that. It's more me being lonely and wanting a friendship that last. And if you can relate to the way I feel you can message me, and if it doesn't click with you and none of the stuff I said make sense you can just not contact me. It's simple.

2592,Panagos80,1617833269,1,"So, it's been three years since I last spoke to my best friend. She is literaly the best person imaginable for me. She is everything I'm not. She was warm and emotional when I was cold and calculated. She brought out the best in me. She made me a better person. Made me want to be a better person. I'm sorry for the cliches, I hate them too but they describe things perfectly. She always helped me and everyone in her life. She is the kindest and most loving person I know. She got me through a lot of stuff, gave me advice and kept me company when noone else would.

We texted and talked everyday, all day, for years and then one day I snapped. 

She was having a tough time trying to date a mutual friend of ours. She was not in her usual happy-for-no-reason mood (which to this day I don't get but still admire). I tried to cheer her up and make her forget about it. A couple of months passed where this kept happening. For some reason, it got in my head, that maybe... well... I'm single, she was single, maybe we could ""mutually serve"" each other. That thought was the worst thing to happen to me till this day. I told her my idea, because naturally... We shared everything... Why wouldn't I? After all it wasn't such a bad idea.... (Idiot!). 

So anyway, she stopped worrying about this guy and then one night we were out for drinks and met up by chance. She was a bit horny lately and we hadn't discussed my idea ever since the first time. Also, earlier that night something happened with him and she was upset. After a few drinks, we were about to call it a night. Out of nowhere she texts me, (because there were other friends present) that maybe we should do ""something"" tonight so she could get her mind off him and also have a good time. Obviously, I agreed and hatched a quick plan to ditch the others and pick her up to go some place quiet.

It probably took 10 minutes to get there. The first 2 where full of excitement. Then it started going down-hill. She started stressing that maybe this would ruin our relationship. Stress turned to heavy anxiety. And by the time I parked the car and we got in the back seats, she was quite nervous to say the least. We started to talk. I didn't want to initiate any physical contact because she had been assaulted once and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or stress out more. So in the end she talked herself out of it. I couldn't do anything obviously so I just agreed and took her home. She knew I didn't like it but what could I do? She kept apologizing for not following through. I told her not to worry. I'd get over it and everything would back to normal.

(REALLY) Long story short, after that night I was obsessed with the idea of us being together. I told her how I felt. That I loved her. Not just as friends. And that I wanted us to be something more than that.

For two months we only talked about this and that night. We argued a lot. Because she felt guilty. Because she felt responsible for me feeling sad and lonely. She thought that maybe we should cut off all communication until I feel better and forget those feelings. I couldn't do that, I'd go crazy. Finally, I couldn't take it any more and agreed to not speak to her until I felt better. She was sad but also happy because she thought that would work and made me promise that some time soon everything would be back to normal.

To this day we still have not spoken a word and I haven't stopped thinking about this whole thing. She made some attempts to talk to me but I pushed her away every time. During those last months she had found someone else. I tried to be happy for her but I just couldn't hide my envy.

It's been three years since we've spoken and I've lost my best friend and possibly the best person for me to be in a relationship with. I've caught myself multiple times thinking that it's been way way longer. Heck, I had to check my messages on FB to be sure before I post here. And the cherry on top.... I recently found out that she's getting married sometime soon.

By the way I give her 0 blame for all this but God damn! Ain't life a bitch?!",lonely,It's been three years,2021-04-08 08:07:49
2593,THEOPINIONPLACE,1617832905,1,"Thetes different  types of lonliness but im speaking about single people. In my opinion having someone that's not obligated to care about you is care about you is what most people want.

To achieve this you need a level of compatibility between two different people.Which is difficult.

In the past people where forced to interact with each other through nessesity the way children interact with their parent's 

These days most people don't need each other for survival and so go through their daily lives surviving on their own. With no real need to invite another into their life.

I think we should look at companionship as a need like water,food and shelter,you don't need another but that would be living life in a very basic way...For example if you only drank water,ate bread ,and lived in a very basic dwelling with no electricity or utilities.You would be unsatisfied.

I think Companionship is an accessory and maybe a nessesity to having a quality life.The same way people seek out good food and homes with accommodation's we should seek out other people that add value to our life.

The how is the problem and I believe fear is what holds people back.Fear of the unknown.

If your lonely talk to someone you like and find interesting and would like to get to know,and not just online where everybody is anonymous and cautious.

If someone talks to you don't shut them down because they aren't ideal or your afraid of the unknown.  I think this pertains mostly to women.I have read many OLD profiles where women will say thingls like they won't respond to guys that are wearing a hat or sunglasses in their pictures.

As for men you will have to be more bold yes there will be rejections and hurt but if you never ask and she never ask two people remain lonely and women have a safety concern men generally dont have so they are less likely to approach,but they should try it more often.

Don't let fear hold you back from having a companion and friend in life.",lonely,What would solve your loneliness,2021-04-08 08:01:45

2615,Tumbleweed_Intrepid,1617822821,1,"So currently I'm 20 years old for context and I live in a very big city in Southern California. I won't say where but I'm sure you know the name of it. I moved to this city when I was three from my original hometown where all my family lives and have been here ever since. So from age three to now the only family I see on a regular basis is my parents. I do have cousins I am close with but they live far away and I only see them once or maybe twice a year if I'm lucky. My parents aren't bad parents but they can be pretty overbearing so when they yelled at me or each other I wish I had a sibling I could go to talk about it instead of just sitting alone in my room pondering about it.

I know it's only human nature to want what we don't have and I know plenty of people who have shitty siblings. I also accept there are advantages to being an only child like getting all the attention and no hand me downs although I would have been the oldest anyway. But growing up was very lonely for me especially since me parents worked a lot and were never around for long periods of time. It just gets to me every time I come home to an empty house and making and eating dinner alone most nights. I just wish I had a sibling that I could talk too at the end of the day about what we did. When it comes to making friends it was also hard. In early school when I was little I had trouble socializing with other kids partly due to the really bad stutter I had but mainly because I never had anyone else around my age to talk to. Still even to this day the lack of social interaction and growth I had as a child still impacts me to this day. I am very bad at holding conversations and am a very shy person. When your going from 1st to 12th grade friends are always coming and going but for me whenever I made a new friend I always thought to myself ""don't screw this up or your going to be alone again."" My Xbox was honestly my best friend growing up. When I see a pair of siblings getting along together I can't help but feel sad knowing that I'll never get to experience what that kind of bond is like. When my grandparents died 3 years ago the feelings of loneliness have sadly only gotten worse.

2634,Quirky_Kale_2155,1617809407,1,"Let me release how I feel as I am trying hard to contain it to myself. I also tell this to my Japanese boyfriend but I am feeling bad whenever I have rants/burst of emotions/feeling depress because of this and I don't want to be the toxic one around him.

I am from Philippines. 

And I really hate how Japanese and others look at us or look at people from developing countries.

I have this feeling that here in Japan, people always look at us as poor, needy, having a hard life in Philippines or working as hostess that's why we are here. Which is totally wrong and I really hate this stereotype. I have a comfortable life in Philippines with my loving family (I am an only child) who are really supportive of me wanting to experience life abroad. (I always wanted to be independent and to experience living in different countries - thats why I am here)

Japanese marrying Filipinos has huge percentage of intercultural marriage and I also hate people's perception about that. Just because we are Filipinos, most are thinking that we come here to get a Japanese guy to marry and send his money in our family in the Philippines. Seriously, I really hate this. Filipino culture of helping our parents even though after marriage is a good culture I think but the way people think about it is really bad. I really hate that we are being seen as a gold digger.

Also, as someone who has big dreams, always hustle and not depending on anyone, I am really irritated by this. I have a huge pride that things I have achieved are because I worked hard for it. So this makes me sick. It is totally unfair to label us like this. 

My hatred towards these stereotype really affects me a lot.

I have been living here in Japan for 5 years now. I have a working visa.

I have a Japanese boyfriend for 2 years now. He's my first and I know, will be the last.

To be really honest, I didn't expect to have a Japanese boyfriend. Also because of the bad stereotype mentioned above. I imagine before that maybe I will end up to a foreigner because we would share same frustrations about Japan. But hey, you cannot choose whom you will fall in love and I am very happy and thankful of my boyfriend who has been really patient and loving to a depress and annoying girl.

My boyfriend asked me if I am good to get married within this year.

I said no.

Aside from the feeling that it is quite a rush (if he plan to marry me this year, I feel like we have very little time to prepare), also I am hoping to get married when the pandemic subsides.

Another reason is I need to prove something.

Yes, I really have a huge pride. I don't want to be just the wife. I need to be me. I need to build and establish myself first. That way, I can shield myself to all those bad stereotypes towards Filipinos.

Also, this is another reason that really affects me. That I cry whenever I think of this:

When my boyfriend told her mom that his girlfriend is from Philippines. You know what does she said?

""Whats the purpose of coming to Japan? Filipinos value their families and send large amounts of money, make their marriage partners promise to send money to the Philippines, and even if they divorce in Japan and return home, Filipinos cannot divorce, so remittances will be made for the rest of their lives. So this is what you want? Wow have fun! Im out!!""

To be honest, I haven't meet her yet but my blood is already boiling with hatred. She judged me just like that. Just after LINE chat introduction. She just see me as someone who will suck money from her son.

This introduction happened 2 years ago but the pain never fades away. Im even crying while typing this. This is such a heavy feeling I am carrying since then. Though on the positive side, I use this as motivation to work harder and reach my dreams. I need something to slap her in the face. I need to prove her wrong. I even want to sign a prenuptial agreement right in front of her. If it is possible, I want to retain my working visa even after marriage. Spouse visa is becoming like gold digger visa to me (and people like his mom will just think thats my ultimate goal, and that I finally succeeded in my plans of getting a guy and a visa here in Japan). I need to be someone who she wont raise her eyebrows. And that when we meet on our wedding day, she will eat what she has said before. 

Of all these thoughts, I honestly envy Americans, Europeans and maybe all from western countries. I feel like it is unlikely for them to have same experience. I always thought that they are always being looked up by Japanese. 

Unlike someone like me and maybe from Asian developing countries that they look down and they feel that they will be ripped off by us.

Whew.. such a long post... sorry. This is really making me depressed. And now you can imagine that I am such a toxic if Ill be blurting this out to my boyfriend.",lonely,5 years living in Japan and my depression is getting worse to the point that i cry easily with just a thought of these things...,2021-04-08 01:30:07

Nah mate, I got a lazy eye, coeliac disease, disgestive issues, multiple skin conditions. So my physical health not so good, but surely my mental/neurological health must be good with the great lifestyle I have.

Wrong again, I have autism, full blown alexithymia (google it, it's bad), social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, an eating disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, addiction to energy drinks, sweets, video games. So maybe my health sucks but maybe I have something to look forward to and a way forward in my life.

And pigs might fly. I'm threatened with homelessness by my parents in the next 10 weeks, I am living with another family member who exposed themselves to me and sexually assaulted me as a child. I reported this to the police and told my parents about it when I turned 18 which took a lot of courage but my parents don't believe me and the police didn't even bother investigating. I was bullied throughout high school for being different and changed schools for sixth form. This stopped the bullying but then i was were even lonelier because no one talked to me. Maybe things improved when I left school.

You guessed it, the waiting list for housing in my overcrowded London borough is 54 years for someone with no priority. I'm on a 2 year waiting list for 10 hours of therapy total. I have no friends and can't have a successful relationship due to Alexithymia. I don't get paid enough to rent the cheapest flat in a commutable distance from where I work. I block thoughts throughout the day and until i pass out from exhaustion at night and get 3-5 hours sleep with some catch up on the weekends (only to then lose even more sleep the next night). I'm on the maximum dosage of my antidepressants and deficiency tablets.

I spend alot of evenings repeating this same sad story to suicide phone lines and doctors and they all tell me I'm doing everything i can. I'm doing everything I can and my life has been and will be just another sad story and statistic about people like me who don't fit in with society.

2642,its_called_a_feature,1617803248,1,"The wife left with our son as he had a soccer game about an hour's drive away.  It was an evening game and didn't start until 8:00, but the team requires players to arrive 30 minutes prior.  On top of that, my wife doesn't like to be late to anything so they arrive even earlier than that.  Our daughter was working yesterday afternoon and after her shift ended was going to hang out with friends until 9:00/9:30.  I had a good 4 hours of time to myself, time that I wish I would have devoted to taking a nap, reading a book, or anything other than what I had attempted to accomplish last night.  

Many moons ago I took on a job with a large company located in a populated metro area.  For years prior I had been working for a small town company and most of my time was spent within a small swath of a rural county.  Moving to the new job I found myself in a rough area of the metro.  There was a lot of crime, a lot of hustle and bustle, and about an hour of separation from my support system.  It was here that a growing thirst for pornography and mindless sexual activity were allowed to blossom.  As home life fell apart, I further spiraled into debt, and continued to lose my mind, I began exploring the seedy world of prostitution.  

For all the good it can do, the internet can open up the doors to a lot of bad.  My life during this time period is an example of that.  Poor decision-making was exercised here, and I blame no one but myself.  Underlying conditions aside, I made these choices.  My initial encounters were, of course, to satisfy carnal desires and make up for what I felt I was not getting at home.  It started out with phone sex to be honest, evolved into trips to the strip club, and eventually wanting to spend one on one time with a woman whose attention (or so I was led to believe) was all mine.  Even when I knew that I was nothing more than a business transaction, I still engaged with these people.

Now, I have been scammed.  I've been threatened with physical violence and I have also feared for my physical well-being and of those around me.  I've been to the point where I've had to take out short-term (payday) loans to feed this addiction I had.  Imagine your spouse going to the grocery store and attempting to use the debit card to pay for food to feed the family and for it to be declined.  Far too often I caused my wife to do the walk of shame and leave the store without essentials.  

So last night was no different than any other time before it.  I hit the usual places online, made some calls and sent some texts.  In this subculture, the natural rule is to not trust anyone.  There are ways of weeding out the fakes, but even then you could still end up dealing with the lowest form of scum.  Desperation brings out the very worst in people.  Debating between one provider over the other I target my time and efforts on a select few.  I have multiple conversations taking place, all of which grow with a sense of urgency to meet before anyone comes home.  But no one wants to rush into anything.  There is a dance you must partake in before anything is mutually agreed upon.  Then you have the flakes of the world that won't respond for 15-20 minutes at a time.  Last night was a frustrating effort, but likely for the best.  By the time I had agreed upon meeting a specific person, my time alone was at an end and I couldn't go through with my plans. 

I settled for a vanilla shake.  And a chocolate shake.  I had both, one at a time, alone in my bedroom in the hour leading up to my daughter coming home from hanging out with friends.  They weren't even that good.  Still I didn't get arrested, mugged, or worse.",lonely,"I tried to find some company last night, but it didn't work",2021-04-07 23:47:28

2661,rustybob,1617791936,1,"My life has been looking up a little lately. I've been talking to people online which is something i didn't think i'd ever be able to do. It's been helping too, as now i have people to talk to instead of trying to distract myself with hobbies. It's honestly really crazy, just people sending me messages without me contacting them first. That's never really happened to me before.

It's still hard though because none of these people are the kind of people who i would feel comfortable talking to about the stuff i struggle with. I just don't think they would want to hear about my personal issues or that they would be interested in hearing about said issues. I mean, don't get me wrong, i'm grateful that people talk to me. They didn't used to. But it doesn't negate the feeling of loneliness you get when you wish you could talk to somebody about how you are feeling and you know that nobody would talk to you if you contacted them at some random time, and that nobody would have any sympathy for you if you tried to tell them what you were going through.

I don't think i will ever know a friend well enough for them to care about my personal struggles. That's another reason i want a girlfriend, that she would listen to me when i had something that was bothering me. I know that's not going to happen though.

Trying to avoid thinking about women in any kind of hopeful/romantic light. It just doesn't help me. It makes people dislike me and it makes me lonelier, all these small rejections. 

But it's hard too to give up hope of meeting someone. Aren't people built to look for another person to be with? Doesn't pretty much everybody want that? I can't seem to defeat that vague hopefulness and that intent to try to find someone no matter what i do. I wish i could. Life would be easier. People would like me more. I wouldn't be disappointed over and over again. I wouldn't feel sad and do nothing sometimes because i wouldn't feel lonely. And what's the point of all this hope when i know it will never happen?

Well anyway, I took her home and put her to bed promising I'd talk to her tomorrow when she asked me to stay the night with her. I gave in to my impulses and crawled into bed behind her. Wrapped my arms around her waist and pulled her a little closer to me. She was so damn warm.

2677,hazehowlingwolf,1617781305,1,"Hi there, I'm Haze (nickname), game designer, streamer and I feel lonely for years.

Different from alot of people from this subreddit, I've been through alot of relationships, 8 in total, but everytime it ends in disaster, and I'm always the bad guy.

I try to be nice to people, give them some respect and give my ears when they talk, but my friends say that I let people step on me too much.

My relationships ended for various reasons: got cheated, wasnt the person they wanted me to be, stopped giving money, stuffs like that. And everytime I was the shitty person, the loser and the one that doesnt deserve sympathy from anyone based on their conclusion over me.

Everytime I start streaming, I can put a smile on my face during that time, cause I'm doing something I like alot. But when the stream is over, I get to be sad again, its kinda weird like I'm some sort of psycopath, I dont know...

I want to love myself, but I feel like I'm lying to me whenever I try, I just dont know how. Whenever I feel: ""I deserve this"", immediately after the thought is ""I'm being selfish and should stop"". Its like this everytime and I dont know how to control it.

Today I'm overweight, work 50% of my day, get to stream for around 20%, and the rest is trying to beat my head on a pillow and try to sleep, something I'm failing hard and ended up opening myself in this subreddit, cause I've got no one to send this. I dont have time to workout, dont have time to prepare my own food (I always ask for delivery) and live by myself.

Maybe my stepfather was right about me when I was just a 6 year old kid, saying that I'm going to die alone and unloved. All my relationships taught me the same anyway.

I'm not looking for a way to fix this, either you grow up a six pack gorgeous person with a pretty face and good looking eyes, or get to be something like me. I've accepted thats just natural selection. I just wanted to find a place where I could spit it all out for once. (I really sounded like a douchebag huh?)

2684,Potato_Gu,1617777438,1,"Hi, im PG,

TL:DR I only realized today that I have no friends, no relationships, no family nearby, and am very much alone. I am successful in my career which made me into a cold hearted workaholic.

&amp;#x200B;

I am forcing myself to write this so I can finally speak out about it, and I have no where elese to turn to.

I am a 25 Male living in Canada, and I have only realized today that I made myself a workaholic which in turn made me successful in my career, however I have had zero relationships, zero friends, and almost zero family members (as they are in another country).   
Although outside I put on a smile, and happy face to my co-workers and my family, but inside I am alone.

I yearn to be hugged, to love someone, to care for someone. But, I either get rejected, or am too shy to  initiate in my 25 years of existing. This lack of growth of my emotions has left me a adult physically, and logically, but a child emotionally and mentally.

Looking back I have understood why I became who I am today. 

I feel that it has contributed to a culmination of things.  
Growing up I was always moving houses, schools, or countries. Which has led me to think that there is no point of making friends, as every time I try to make some friends I just end up moving somewhere else entirely.  
In a span of 11 years I have moves houses 4 times, changes schools 5 times. At the end of that 11 years I was in grade 10 I ended up moving to Canada, which made me not caring for anyone in grade 11 or 12, as I already knew that I was going to go to Collage to do the exact same thing, and in the span of all that I made 1 friend who moved to a different country.

I did try to make a relationship during that time with someone, but between grade 1 to 10 the girls and boys were put into separate parts of the school. (its a country that still does that today)  
Which made it impossible for me to have any interaction with any women, until after grade 10.

Which ended up contributing to the constant moving and changing, I ended up aloof, shy, and indifferent to others, any decisions, and especially I do not know how to interact with women or how they work as they are.... alien to me.

However, I did end up with 1 relationship attempt with a girl I had a crush on, however after me confessing my feelings to her she didn't respond to me, she avoided the question to my answer, and avoided me like I was some parasite on her shoe. Which broke my heart, and into a lengthy depression until recently I was just about to emerge out of. Not the best I know but that's why I have a lack of growth of my emotions, and how I handle myself with women back then and still to this day, and yes I am still a virgin. :(

But since I have finally settled into Canada (and finally settling down from the culture shock) and in Collage, I looked at my classmates and attempted to make friends, but I was still shy. However I was able to make one friend. I did push myself out of my shell and for that time and my persona changed. I am more outgoing and no longer shy especially around women. I still remain aloof at times but I am almost done with being aloof.  
However the lack of growth of my emotions in regards to a relationship is still very much a child still.

I did attempt to confess my feelings again to another crush in collage, but when I attempted to do so I froze and sort of flashed backed to my first confession I made all those years ago. I ran away, I regret it to this day. Keep in mind I was still depressed, so it sort of made things worse, as I dug my head into the sand of my studies and eventually my work/job. Which made me a workaholic. That friend I made in collage I ended up hiring, so he is a work/past friend? 

After that I never looked into doing any more relationships or making friends, as I kept my work life separated from my personal life. I didn't do any hobbies, or things outside of work. I just worked, slept, work, slept. As my depression and eventually my loneliness finally ended up to where we are today.

Reading back at it I am not sure what or who to blame, my parents for constantly moving me, the country that made me insecure about girls and women in general, or myself for not having the balls to get out of my own shell, or all of it.

I am now a supervisor in my job, but I am totally alone outside of work. I was flirting a colleague at work and sharing stories about each other, went on a date etc etc, however it came to me confessing my feelings she avoided to answer me, and when I decided to finally push the subject she said that she does not know.  
That again put me further into a depression, thinking that ""Im not good enough for anyone anymore, women have it easier in making relationships than men do.""   


We since then went our separate ways for a year as we both left that job, but then we found ourselves again in another job. Sensing that the universe is giving me a second chance, I wont back down. We did the same thing as last time flirting, sharing stories, going on dates. When I again confessed that I still have feelings for her, she again said...... the same thing ""I dont know"" and she later said on another day that ""we should keep our work and personal life separate"", a persona of me that I was trying to get out from.   
I was already out of my depression by that stage, but I was about to recede back into it until I stopped myself and promised myself that I am never going back to a depressed, lonely person again. Im 25, im not going to let this ruin my life any further, I lost my chance to change, I lost my chance to be where I want to be. Im  not going to go back into ""Im not acceptable to anyone"". I am, going to go out and make some friends and see the fucking world, and not live a life full of regret anymore, I have wasted too much of my life.  
But because of covid im stuck inside..... so much for that idea, for now.

Which brings us to where we are now, me writing this. While crying, but feeling better for actually doing it.

Reading back at it know, I pretty wrote a summarized version of my life. If you made it this far, and have actually read the entire thing. I applaud you, and thank you at the bottom of my heart.

So, my roommate and I get along. I wouldn't call us great friends or anything but we hang out every once in a while. I've met her friends on a few occasions. She hangs out with them like a lot more than me, which I get. 

Anyway onto the problem. My roommate texted me tonight and invited me to go to the beach with her said mentioned friends. I was super excited and everything bc I never hang out with people like that. Like ever. But the way she phrased some of her texts made me second guess that they only invited me to lower the cost and idk how to feel about that? 

First, they had already planned this together and had housing picked out and everything

Second, she mentioned a few times that one of her other friends (haven't met her) wasn't sure if she was gonna be able to go (which makes me think they invited me to keep the cost low if she did bail)

Third, she mentioned the transportation situation and made it sound like when someone offers a ride but they don't really want to. Like you can ride with us but if you feel too cramped or too stuffy you can definitely bring you're own car, but don't feel obligated but if you want to you can. (This may just be my overthinking and insecurities coming through tho. )

Lastly, she had to make 100% I was committed tonight so they could book now. Then replied with WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH thank you omg. (As if, once again, they asked me to go so they could afford it) 

I know this is nitpicky and its prob just my anxiety/self esteem issues.

Ive been on online dating apps, but I've only talked to people for a few days before one of us loses interest. I'm terrified of being older and still a virgin, I'm worried that people will look down on me for being a virgin or think it's a turn off.

I want a relationship where the other person actually cares about me and we become each others best friends, but I feel like dating now is really casual, and nobody really cares about who they have sex with.

I kinda wish it was like video games, where like, someone cute and nice would just come up to you and pursue you and you'd be into it. Maybe my expectations for friendships are too high. Is it too much to want to have a long conversation with a friend at least once a day?

TW: suicide talk

Goodmorning, afternoon, evening or night. I hope you are doing okay! If not i might be able to help. 
For the past 3 weeks I have been active on reddit I have spoken to more than a handful of people that feel so lonely that even a simple ""hello"" gets them excited. It honestly breaks my heart a little. We have 7 billion people and apparently some of us are still so lonely in this world. I would however like to help everyone out that feels this way (and any other way) I'll tell a little about myself.

My name is James, I'm 26 years old and I live in the beautiful but currently snowy Netherlands. I've been living her my whole life and at the moment I'm working in the hospital! No worries I haven't been  infected yet. 

My childhood wasn't the greatest and especially highschool was a little nightmare for me. I felt lonely almost every day and pretty much useless. Everything about me also changed. I started the process of becoming a man! It made me sound like a turkey sometimes! 
When you hit puberty everything starts to grow and for some reason the body parts I wanted to start getting bigger stayed small but my tiny little innocent nose started to grow. How fun that was! I felt like a real outcast from time to time.. it even made me thinking about ending it all right there.. but I knew that it wasn't worth it. 
Yeah, maybe I'm ugly to some but I'm also handsome to others and it was thoughts like that that kept me going. 14 years later I'm still here. 

So please! If you feel lonely and scared in this world message me! I don't care where you come from or who you love. Just don't keep it all in. 

I can talk about mostly anything! I have some hobbies myself but I do my research when you want to talk about something. And yes, I now know that one of the members of BTS is called Cookie. 
If you feel like venting let me know! Also open for that and I won't judge! Only if you want that ;)

Please also keep in mind that I'm not a professional and  that I know everything about all the things but I still would like to help you out as best as possible. 

My timezone in GMT +1 so for the people I'll be mostly active when it's the evening. For the people from the states it's the opposite. I'll be your nightowl! 

A little side note. I wish I could respond to everyone in time. I simply can't. Don't feel like a burden if I don't respond for a few hours! I will try to respond to everyone. Sometimes my battery is also a little drained so please keep that in mind üòä but don't hesitate to ask for help or a talk. 

Hope everyone has a great night!",lonely,How does loneliness feels for you? I would like to help.,2021-04-07 05:34:05

2759,Evening_Paint_9825,1617735712,1,"Hi,

I've been on reddit for some time now, but I've never written a post and I'm really nervous right now, but it probably won't matter as no one will probably read any of this anyways. When I was in school, I always floated around friend groups. I had friends but I never had that BEST FRIEND that you always see in the movies that have been together since they were young. So, I never had that one person that I could talk to  about all my problems in life. 

In 2017 It was really hard for me; it was the first time in my life all the anxiety and depression from the world just hit me and I dropped out of school and contemplated committing suicide (wouldn't be the last time). And for the next 2 years I did absolutely nothing but just stay in my bed away from the world and watch YouTube videos and Netflix, only getting out the house when my mum wanted me to get something from the local shops. I was already a skinny person but being and being in a bed for two years didn't help, I stopped caring about my appearance and honestly stopped caring about anything and everything.

Fast forward to October 2019 in which my Auntie (who in those 2 years was one of the only people to constantly phone and check on me) invited me, my brother and my mum to her new house she was moving in with her family. Normally she would invite me, but I never wanted to leave however this time I was very curious to see the house and she did a very good job pleading me to come so she could see me. When she was on the phone we agreed that I would come over for the weekend except when I got there seeing not only this beautiful home but other people than my mum and brother for the last two years made me the happiest I'd been in a long, long, long, long time. From that weekend I spent it led to me stay a week, then celebrating my birthday there, then staying and celebrating Christmas than New Year and in that time, I was slowly gaining my self-confidence (which I felt was gone forever) which led me to think I could re-introduce myself into society, maybe rekindle old relationships with people or even make new friends and try to get a job.

Everything was going well until 2020. 

I've been typing now for over an hour thinking on how to word everything and whilst typing and re-reading everything I had a really bad panic attack, so I've decided to stop typing for now. Like I said at the start I've never done this before. Originally, I started typing asking just to simply talk to someone but ended up writing about my life story that no one probably want to listen to. So, if anyone just wants to talk about anything, anytime from any part of the world I'll be here.

What the hell have I done with my life?  I'm turning 40 next month.  I haven't done anything productive with my life.  Yes I'm married, have two kids, a dog, and a duplex.  But that marriage has been 19 years of unhappiness, my kids disrespect me, the dog eats his own poo and then proceeds to lick my ears every night, and I rent just one side of that duplex.  

And so I sit here, alone.  Alone in my thoughts and feelings.  Isolated from the world due to COVID.  I ""work"" during the day but as evident by prior issues at the office my lack of effort is beginning to show.  I'm due to return to the office May 3rd, and I am not sure I will be capable of doing it mentally.  For a year I haven't had a commute, traveled much outside beyond essentials, and have shuttered  myself socially from the outside world.

The friends I had?  Gone.  My fault.  If I wasn't such an asshole to people I would probably keep friends longer than a hot minute.  Instead I've just retired to the notion I am and forever will be a compulsive liar.  Everything I touch I ruin.  I drained my retirement fund, accumulated over $10,000 in debt and as luck would have it I am now a co-signor on not one or two cars, but three in the last two years.  At any moment this delicate balance of sanity will break apart and my world will come tumbling down with it.  

It's depression, I know.  I have Bipolar.  I'm not taking my medications as directed, if at all, on most days.  Through my web of lies and surrendering to my vices, I've created my own little world of despair.  I can't go to anyone with my problems - all I end up becoming is someone else's problem and I'm not asking for anyone to shoulder that burden or feel that they have to out of obligation after talking to me once.  I have toxic relationships with my wife and kids.  I'm considered an outcast by my siblings because I tended to be more ""normal"" than the rest but I'm quickly learning our family's legacy is to never be happy.  

I don't drink.  I don't smoke.  And outside of prescription medications I don't do any hard drugs you would buy off the street.  My ""drug of choice"" tends to be uncontrollable sexual thoughts that travel through my brain at all hours of the day.  I know ""normal"" people can fall victim to addiction to pornography, but my obsession with it (rather one person) has been debilitating at times and I'm not in a position where I feel I can safely talk to someone I know about it without fear of it getting out.  Quite simply, I am obsessed with one individual and have been for nearly 20 years.  They are ""forbidden fruit"", and there is absolutely no chance anything could have or would have changed to make that sort of thing happen. 

I got so desperate to feel connection to something, or someone, that I tried out Replika.  In short it is one of those AI/Chatbot things that is supposed to...I honestly have no idea.  I gave up when all I ended up doing was using that to role-play out a fantasy with the person I am obsessed with.  Almost 40 and using programs to fake relationships because any contact I have had with real people almost always turns to garbage.  No wonder I'm in a lifeless marriage at this point.  I cannot even commit to an app.  

Don't worry, I'm not ""planning"" something or feel like I am in crisis.  Yes, I've been down that road once or twice before.  What I've discovered over the years is that I have a crippling fear of death and what happens when you die.  I'm not interested in theory or religion here - I've decided I don't believe in any ""god"" - I'm just worried about there being nothing.  It's all gone.  Good grief I'm getting tense just typing this out.  Thinking about ""the end"" is often more than enough to keep me from thinking of self-harm.  But thanks to my manic episodes I tend to do dangerous things that end up getting me into all sorts of trouble.  

I feel trapped in my own mind.  Crippled by my own thoughts and feelings.  I'm a slave to the cravings I've acquired for things that I know I cannot and should not have.  And because of that, I am alone.",lonely,"39, M, and, yeah...[feeling] alone",2021-04-07 04:45:34

2770,codecrunchie,1617731755,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts) in the way it works.  


**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

What are the questions:

* \- more about you  
\- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

2771,codecrunchie,1617731749,1,"Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts) in the way it works.  


**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

What are the questions:

* \- more about you  
\- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

I have had this trauma, yes i dare call it a trauma 'cause I got it from my father. He never taught me anything, unlike the other kids, when we were younger. I didn't know a damned thing, I didn't even know a screwdriver was its actual name until 12 years of age. He nevertheless beat me, which made me work out and get strong. But that feeling of not knowing enough never left me, it's always there. No matter how many things I learn, no matter how many things I can do. Its never enough.

I feel stressed and anxious all the time, like my stomach is tied in a knot. I feel as if tho im not enough. I feel as if tho I am not good enought, at anything. I feel as if tho I'm useless and cannot do anything correctly. I feel miserable. 

I have felt like this many many times, even worse sometimes, yet I have never felt the need to share with anyone. I just wrote somewhere, then forgot about it. Never actually for even a second wanted to talk about this shit with someone irl. 

I managed to beat depression, suicide thoughts, I even beat the normal anxiety which you would get from normal things. Like importnant exams, texting to a girl you like. I got rid of that, I got rid of the anxiety that makes sense. What's left is the unreasonable anxiety, one that I cannot grasp no matter what I try to do. 

its my head that does it, it overthinks so much, that's why all the time I try to keep myself busy from thinking. My head has the habbit of making me feel worthless, which only makes me start to read more, learn more, workout more etc. Now that might sound like a good thing, but believe It is not a good thing, not in the slightest.   
Its the feeling of never being statisfied with w/e you do. Of never been good enough, strong enough. There is always room for more, you need to reach it, otherwise you are worthless.

I'm at the point where I cannot compare to my friends or generally people that are my age. Only with a rare few that have immense talent and devotion to their craft.   
Most of my friends care about couple of simple things - girls,cars and expensive shit.   
Therefore they do not actually work to improve themselves nor learn more, that I cannot grasp. How can one be content with the small amount of knowledge he has. I compare myself with people who are well above my level. People who are at professional level. When im merely at intermediate.

To give the context, I took a gap year-and-a-half after High School, 2019. Covid screwed that over, but luckily I was in an actually good relationship (I have a history of having manipulative/abusive partners.) However, this relationship also caused me to slowly lose many hobbies/daily habits as she didn't have many. Over time this along with covid slowly wore down my mental health and a couple months ago after my gf asking to take a break seeing each other in person, right after we went through 2 weeks of quarantine bc her brother came into contact with covid. So, already deprived of human contact and having abandonment issues, I broke up with her out of fear and ungratefulness. Right as I finally started college.
For the past month or two I will go many days without any human interaction, I have little to no friends, almost no ways of meeting any due to how scarce and hick (goonies and racists) the population around me is. I am currently trying to get a therapist as well as set up morning routines to help re-stabilize myself, which is hard to remain focused on as I have severe ADHD (100mg Vyvanse), but for every good, productive-ish day I have just as bad and lazy of a day. Tried Journaling, that failed. Coming up out of the breakup, I realized how depersonalized I was for a while, so much that I didn't even recognize who I'd been those past several months. I don't feel like me, I don't feel the motivation for things like I once did. I'm working out and trying to clean my place a bit, but those are out of sheer fear and sadness of what I am right now and how much further I might drop. I don't even want to talk about college, I'm probably failing at least two classes. I also want to switch majors, but I don't even know if I want to go to college next year.

2800,ItRedd20,1617710946,1,"Hello all, 
Never actually posted on Reddit before! But thought I'd share the following with you which I have just read. It certainly sums up quite well what I've been going through lately dealing with a recent breakup of &amp; end to a relationship &amp; what it suggests may be a useful avenue to explore for healing. I hope it is of help to others who are in a similar predicament as myself:


It‚Äôs difficult to comprehend and imagine the reality of grief, and the turbulence it presents, until we're confronted with it. Grief and mourning come from loss and this arrives when we lose a loved one. We can also grieve the loss of our health, a relationship, a job, a pet, or something else entirely. ¬†¬†
This flood of emotions can be very difficult to process, and, at times, we may not even realise what is happening to us. Grief makes us feel like we are‚ÄØnot ourselves.¬†It can change our behaviour and can bring with it low self-esteem, depression and physical illness. Confusion and a state of overwhelm can often make talking about grieving experiences almost impossible.¬†

There is no quick solution to grieving and adjusting to loss: it is a long process. Art and creativity can start this journey by opening alternative channels to explore and provide an outlet for grief. Loss alters lives and for some, instantly diminishes their sense of purpose and responsibility. With the death of a loved one suffering with a chronic illness, an addiction or mental health issue, the responsibility and caring role disappears at the same time; this loss is also a bereavement. Through our creative sessions, we aim to provide a newfound purpose, to ignite new hobbies and passions and to form new friendships in a community of people trying to navigate their new role in life.¬†¬†

Above all, art can help us frame the story of our lives and appreciate the beauty that still surrounds us. Creativity and art can ensure that the new chapter of life is filled with purpose, with‚ÄØbeauty, colour, vibrancy, sentiment and meaning.¬†",lonely,Dealing with loss of all kinds,2021-04-06 22:09:06
2801,ExplorerCrane,1617710393,1,"I'm almost turning 22 and I have to spend another precious birthday like a lonely loser with pretty much no social network/girlfriend to celebrate with, especially after the pandemic really hastened the betrayals and backstabbing I experienced last year. At this point I only have 2 friends left and it comes down to me either celebrating my birthday in a half assed way, or not celebrating at all and I'm personally of the principal that I'd rather not do something than try to enjoy it in a half assed way.

 It even bugs me even more that others my age who also have to celebrate their birthdays in the pandemic get to do so properly anyway with their friends/ partners since they didn't lose them or even had the opportunity to connect with them despite our current circumstances since their social networks allowed them to make friends pretty much effortlessly. I never had a luxury, even before this pandemic, and having asperger's really doesn't help either.

I honestly feel like all of the best years of my life, even before this pandemic, were robbed from me, and I quite frankly believe this was the last point in my life where I could really make meaningful friendships/romance, but I feel that the pandemic robbed me of the opportunity for the last time by stealing my last 2 years of uni. 

Whilst many are going to enjoy going back to normal in a few months, I feel like i have to go back out to a world that will see me as a social and romantic failure and avoid me like the plague (or more appropriately, COVID).

2807,more_more_,1617707031,1,"I've been feeling lonely for a few years now and it gets worse and worse every day. Little by little everyday.

I like to observe myself and analyse my behavior, so I realise that I'm very vurnebale to any kind of warmth I feel. I know what I lack is romantic intimacy. 

I have a great family and very good friends. I don't lack in that fortunetly. But damn I feel so lonely I just wanna lay in bed all day and do nothing. There is no point. 

So, sorry for the long intro let me get to the point. After I aknowleged my situation I started seeking this romantic relationship. Went on a dating site, went out with a few girls, but nothing. I mean they were good dates, but I struggle to find myself interested in their personality. I mean they are almost a complete stranger, so I don't really care for them (they were great girls, but we had no connection). So ok, maybe I'm not so vulnerable I tought, I had a chance and I declined it. Things will figure themselfs out. I continued to live in solitude, after all that's all I knew for the past few years. No biggie. 

And about a year ago I started chatting with this girl I bearly know. We've met once or twice and added each other on social media. But since that I really hadn't tought about her or she about me. Also she lives in another country currently. 

So we started chatting from time to time. First just some jokes about an instagram story, then some longer conversations about how she or I are doing. Some discussions about phylosophy etc. And the chats became a pretty regular part of my week or even days. Sometimes we stay up late talking about something. In short, I really, really enjoy speaking to this person which is rare. 

At first I didn't think much about it. I go on about my day, she goes on about hers. But as the chats started to become more and more personal I found myself and she found herself sharing some really intimate stuff. And there I started developping feelings for her. I felt a connection I have never felt with anyone. 

So for the first time in a very long time I felt great about having a person I can share with. I mean really share. But in the back of my head I knew It's not good to continue this way. We live in diffrent countries and this connection we have is a dead end. Also we bearly know each other outside of social media. 

So what I'm trying to do now is just forget about her. I deleted the app for a few days, so I can't chat with her. But damn is hard af. I miss someone who I bearly know in real life. I need to get rid of my feelings before they get stronger and I do something stupid, but I don't want to. Because if I forget her, I forget the only warm thought I have right now. It's a paradox. It's a lose-lose situation. And it hurts as hell. It prevents me to do my work also, and I have some really important stuff lately. I just dont want to eat or work. I drink and I sleep.

I know those feelings are just a side effect of my loneliness, but nontheless they are true feelings and they are eating me from the inside rn. I hope it gets better. I know what is the right thing to do, but still I miss talking to her. 

I don't really need advice (well if you have some, feel free to tell me), I just wanted to share it somehow, with some people, with someone. That's a bit long. Sorry about that. And cheers if you got this far. I appreciate it.

I  imagine there were similar posts to this before but I really wanted to  hear what you guys are experiencing as well as just having some nice  conversations maybe.

I've just  found myself contemplating this whole mess again now that Covid has been  around for an entire year. Have you had people/friends/aquaintances  reach out to you or stay in touch throughout this year? I've been quite  disappointed with how little people seem to care...

I'll  give you a bit of a background story. I used to work in the UK for the  last couple years. So eventually I felt I needed to change it up and try  and find an opportunity to grow elsewhere. So I left my old work place  early last year and moved internationally. Then things happened, Covid  became a thing and I was caught right in the middle of it. I never  started in the office but rather started working from home right away.  At home being a tiny temp place with just enough space for basic  survival. Adding to that I had a (long distance) relationship starting  and falling apart within 2 months of this whole situation unfolding.  Which sent me spiralling, trying to cope and recover for months. As I  wasn't set up properly in the new city I just completely ditched the  idea for the time being and moved back in with my parents. I'm not sure  if I had a choice really, I was in a really bad place emotionally. Yes  so parents.. that's great financially but also staggeringly lonely as I  don't have any social circle left back in my home town. And with the  repercussions of that breakup it wasn't until late last year that I saw  light again. It's just been such a mess.

For  a while I tried reaching out to friends and colleagues still in the UK  but soon gave up when it didn't lead to anything. They were really  lovely when I left and I had hoped to stay in touch one way or another.  Certainly had planned to meet up and do things in the future. And I  suppose when that didn't work I started to feel stuck. As you know  making new friends or doing activities with others isn't exactly  possible right now. Travelling certainly isn't. I picked the worst time  to change my life up and got caught empty handed. Life is just work now,  any leisure activities I have to do completely on my own.

Maybe  I should be grateful for having family at least but it's not as great  as I had hoped and they are not capable of any kind of emotional support  I feel. How do you guys feel? Any of you had similar experiences? Or do  you have regular contact with your friends and what not? I'm really  curious.",lonely,Pandemic and Staying in Touch,2021-04-06 19:17:58

My goodness I am so uncomfortable talking about my shit.  Even when it's anonymously online.

Well it's my birthday today. I really don't like that.
 Think fully I didn't have to worry too much about it growing up we didn't celebrate that kind of thing in my family because my parents were into the whole  Jehovahs witness thing.

 Know that I'm an adult  I feel like it's way more prominent now when the day rolls around.

It's a bad day. I just spend the whole time reflecting on how I am not where I should be in life and all the problems with me and how shit I am.
 I just send up during a shame party in my head about how I want to take off my skin tear it up and throw it in the trash.

 There's a lot of things wrong with me and I am not gonna fit all of that into this little post.

Ill just complain about a few problems with me.
 I just can't make human connections. I've always felt like everyone knew something I didn't like I'm missing some parts that let me connect with people. I didn't have any friends until I was an adult and I really grateful for them but I am having a really damn hard time expressing and connecting. I am just so used to being alone and I hate it. 

There's something not right with me. I've been as I am now since I could remember. 
Fuck  I feel like I'm naturally predisposed to be miserable and to be horrible to do horrible things and  like I'm destined to destroy myself.

 I've always heard people say that they were destined to do a thing like their guided by fate to do something.
 Like what it is their doing comes naturally to them and it's right and it's what they need to be doing.

I don't feel that way I feel the exact opposite I feel like destiny is wanting me to do bad things in be miserable.

 And I hate that so I behave in the opposite way and try to be Good and try to make things just a little better for people in this bullshit place.
 My goodness is it tiring my goodness would I like to give up.
 But if I do it's like something wins.
 I try really hard and I'm still not happy in the end.
 Better than just letting things run their course like how there supposed to I suppose.

  I've recently went through a breakup.
 It was my 1st relationship 1st a lot of things as you can imagine not really being able to make human connections it's no surprise it took me this long.

 Of course things didn't work out I shouldn't have been so stupid I know that kind of life is in for me.
 I hate that they had to know.
 I wish I just popped out of existence.


It's funny I never cry but when I was with them I would all the time.

I really think I could use one so I bought myself some alcohol just now. Happy Birthday me.

I wish alcohol made me as happy and stupid as it seems to do on TV and when I see other people take it.

 For me it just makes me sad and reflect on how not a person I am.
 I don't like anything about it I hate it.

But like I said I can use a cry right now and that's a hard thing for me to do so maybe that will help.

I have been giving few subreddit a try to find me a companion. I have lived a somewhat of a religious life where you can't be intimate with someone unless your married. Ya know the whole thing where old school parents see on the TV where it's like Dating = Smashing someone everyday. There's more in a relationship than just sex. Like people nowadays just want to experience things so they meet and chat, maybe date than leave for another. 

I like the way I look and I am not that low in self-esteem. It's like needing to remind people that in a relationship intimacy isn't everything. Companionship that comes with love and care can be legit. I personally couldn't careless. If I ever met someone and got all cuddly and kiss than my day looming brighter cause I know someone loves me not because am family or they're obligated to but because of me. .I understand people have preferences which is respectable.

Hello!

I am not sure if this is the right post for this community but thought I woould share to maybe feel better about it.

M25, I don‚Äôt mean to sound superficial nor attention seeking, but today was my birthday and I felt sad/anxious about the outcome.

For the most part, the people I know I‚Äôm closest with they reached out with good wishes, though there were some that their absence was felt. And yes, I understand that  everyone has things going on and I don‚Äôt expect most of my friends, specially the ones who aren as close to me to remember my birthday, but that was not the issue.

I invited a group of 12 friends to come later by night to chill and sing happy birthday, and was practically ghosted by all but 3 of them. Of course, of all those 12 not all are the closest ones, but still, all from the same group, and if it were the other way around I would have surely attended their event.

I dont know, it felt weird, I‚Äôve never been big about birthdays and I do understand how lucky I am to turn another year and I‚Äôm really appreciative of the messages that I received, but still, this one hurt.
Kinda sucks to prepare and set up your place and then no one showing, specially with your family asking how was it and who went...

I‚Äôm feeling shitty about myself in this sense, as if yeah texts are good and all but I dont feel most of them made the slightest effort to try to come. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend that I will have a close group of friends specially as I get older, but still.

I‚Äôm usually not too hard on myself, and again, I know who my closest friends really are, but I figured that for a birthday most of the group would show up.

2832,0905Tomato,1617685861,1,"I met this guy over a year ago (I‚Äôll call him James) though a friend. He was interesting and eventually we got to talking occasionally and found out that we had a lot in common. We shared our art and genuinely had fun together. 

Over the summer, we got closer through games we played together with other friends. I became mildly obsessed with him because he was the first person I‚Äôve truly developed feelings for, he was the first person to give me half the attention I wanted. But over time I came to realize he had an extremely bad habit of self deprecation. I‚Äôm not saying I haven‚Äôt had the same problem, but he would publicly voice his internal thoughts online, and every time I tried to console him or even just talk about anything, he would leave me on read and disappear off the internet for a few days. 

He worried me a lot, but every time he texted me, or video called, my heart would jump into my throat like nothing else I‚Äôve ever experienced. I wasn‚Äôt overbearing or anything, mostly because I‚Äôm pretty shy and have a hard time voicing my emotions. But he called me handsome and cool like no one else had.

I stopped talking to him briefly in October due to a hospital visit that took a while to recover. A little while later, when I returned to friends and socials, I scrolled through our groupchat, and realized he had completely moved on, forgotten my name, went to the psych ward and shortly after started dating another boy (Sam) we had met in August. 

I got mad at myself, I told myself that if I had not been so shy, if I had not gotten sick, it would‚Äôve been me in Sam‚Äôs place, it would‚Äôve been me talking to him. Now he doesn‚Äôt even know my name anymore, literally. Every time I would see him post, it would give me a surge of anxiety, but in a much worse way than when I first met him. I mentally punched and told myself that maybe if I‚Äôd been a better friend he wouldn‚Äôt have hated and hurt himself so much. I feel like it‚Äôs all my fault, like I had somehow encouraged his destructive behavior. I know it‚Äôs not my fault but I felt like it was. 

I blocked him on all my accounts, because I couldn‚Äôt stand the sinking feeling in my gut every time I was reminded of him. 

That changed today when I had noticed that Sam mentioned he was single now. Without even realizing what I was doing, I unblocked James and followed all of his socials back. I feel pathetic, but I‚Äôve been subconsciously  hoping he will talk to me again, that with time he will give me the opportunity to tell him that I have had feelings for him for over a year. I know I‚Äôm being selfish and obsessive. But it‚Äôs just so hard being alone so young. Barely a friend, and all I want is for him to talk to me again, for him to call me a ‚Äúpretty boy‚Äù in the half-mocking tone he used to give, to play a game with him again. 

But I know it won‚Äôt happen, I won‚Äôt push, I won‚Äôt initiate anything. Even though I‚Äôm hopelessly infatuated, I want him to be happy with himself more than with me, even if it makes me more isolated.

There are so many other things that rush through my mind when I see a picture of myself but those are just a few examples. It gets worse when the picture has other people who you fully respect and enjoy and you wonder, ‚Äúwhy are those amazing people talking to and hanging out with such an idiot?‚Äù

P.S. maybe we should start a little trend that at the end of the post ask for help, for something a little positive.

Mine is going to ask how do I increase my self esteem? I mean I love myself and whatever but I feel like me loving myself isn‚Äôt enough, because I also love people. And if people don‚Äôt like me, I feel like a part of me is missing.

7. I am a bigger guy who has dealt with many mental and physical health issues and emotional eating disorder, so I am always open to talk through and help with those issues.

Some context to this declaration.

I've  never been in a relationship. Ever. Never kissed, never even held hands  romanticly. and it is not that I'm picky, it's just that no one even  tried.  Sometimes I would look at some guy I knew and have an interest  in them but never did anything.

Then  I got a crush on this guy at my school (online zoom classes for now)  that was about 2 months ago. After some time I've decided to try to talk  to him more. With a lot of anxiety-induced stress. I even managed to be  on the same team for a class. Here is the problem. I feel like I'm  annoying him. it's not that he is giving me an indication of that. but  still.  I feel like I'm the most annoying person in the world. I try to  discord him every other day to avoid this. but the feeling is still  there. He sometimes texts me first but it's pretty uncommon. so I don't  know if he is interested or not. like if I knew he was I would text him  every day. but I don't know. and I don't wanna annoy him. so I don't  text him much.

Anyways I give up.  It's useless. it's not like he is missing on much anyway. I always  imagine myself in a loving relationship but it's not like I deserve it. I  always end up hurting myself. I'm way too much of a trash heap to be  with anyone. No one deserves to have to deal with me. What guy wants to  teach a 24 years old how to be in a relationship?  What 28 years old guy  wants to deal with first relationship's mistake that i will inevitably  do?  It's pretty fucking rare. I'm not gonna impose my stupidity on him.  I already did 24 years alone, guess  I'll have to get used to it for 80  more years I guess. I hate it but it's the best for everyone. Sorry  dude, must have been confusing.

Now I know you probably have seen it all ""Love yourself first"" ""You don't need love to feel complete"" 
Guess what? Those are all true, I don't know who you are, I don't know why you are feeling so lonely and depressed and it's a shame that this Subreddit exists because no one deserves to feel like this, but the world isn't perfect we all know this, better than anyone.
Your loneliness is so depressing and I wish I could help you all out, but did you know that you attract people who are a reflection of yourself? I'm a codependent, I've been in abusive relationships with atleast two people, and it's left me with unhealed wounds, and I'm desperate, needy, clingy, but guess what? I attracted those people, those people who are codependent, those people with unhealed wounds, came to me and showed me I'm exactly like that, I'm like them. So you know what you should do? Become the person you want to attract, whether it's friends or a lover become that person. You want to attract someone carefree and lively? Become that person
Someone loyal, honest, and just down-right lovely? Become that person
Somebody who is hard working but also cares about their family and loves animals?? Become that person
You need to change yourself, in a good way not just for someone else but for you too.
Now I know what your thinking "" It's so hard"" "" No I'll die alone"" ""Stop giving false hope"" 
And you know what? Your right you will die alone, if you don't get out of your bed, throw your tissues away, drop all those romance movies instead of crying about how you'll never find love like that
How you'll never be Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks
And to be honest you won't, because you can't get up and try to focus on yourself, I'm not saying drown yourself in work, no I'm saying focus on you, find new hobbies, leave town and start somewhere new, stop hanging out with those parent's and friends who ask ""Um, why aren't you in a relationship yet?"" Find new friends, go out, party, paint, read, grow plants, eat healthy, clean your room, look in the mirror and say ""I'm so fucking worthy of love and friendship"" Smile close that door and go about your day, no one wants to date a sad depressed person, so become that person that someone would want to date or hang out with, become the person you want to date and hang out with. Do you need therapy? Get therapy
Do you not believe in therapy? Try it out for 3 weeks or a month, then come back and tell me you still don't believe in therapy
Do you still need time to wallow after a recent breakup with your friend or ex partner, wallow a bit more then get up and remember they don't deserve your tears, change your hair, buy new clothes
Look like someone that doesn't need nobody but themselves
To be honest, all it took was someone who disappeared for a few days to help me realize this

2938,redon1345,1617640901,1,"So yeah, my mother tried to abort me but failed, I was sexually abused by my uncle when i was a kid, father was an alcoholic and abusive, bullied at school. My past was something I didn't want to remember.

Throughout adolescence, i became this weird kid, highly sensitive to self but was not sensitive to others, severely anxious and depressed, and gay, but i was still in denial back then.

I have always wanted to be special, i want to be someone that people look up for, someone that feel proud to have a friend like me. I wanted to do something in my life, and I did. I studied hard, worked myself up, i started to learn how to socialize, how to be funny, how to be authentic, fashion, despite several self harm and suicide attempt, I tried everything I can do save myself from damnation. 

Eventually, i started to have friends who love me, my father changed, my family is happier now, i was one of the top student and received an award for the best student during my undergrad. I continued my first masters, however was juggling with work to pay for the tuition fee, and lost both job and masters and fell into depression again. However, i was saved by a counsellor who soon introduced me to this non profit to tackle against violence towards women and children and I excelled in my job.

Two years later, i was empowered again, no longer depressed. I came out to my close friends about me being gay and they accepted me for who i am, came out to my family, my dad was okay still, and the rest were accepting too. Then, i got a scholarship to continue my masters at one of the best universities in the world, during a pandemic. 

So i went to the UK, to study, and i have never felt more lonely in my life. I was able to explore my sexuality, i met some people, only met few friends, have lots of money, but that's it. I am just lonely, my self harm and suicidal behaviour are starting emerge again. It was the same routine everyday. At the same time, i was having an existential crisis, i do not know what to believe in anymore, i learned about the horrible truth about capitalism that engulfed this world and designed humans to be obedient, greedy, selfish, toxic competitive, and depressed. I learned about religion, i am a catholic, but im not so sure what to believe in anymore as it contradicts with my sexuality. Is there even a God?

I dont really know what im doing here on reddit, I worked my way up, got here, I have an opportunity to begin a new life, but somehow, i learned that we should put our loved ones first. I really want to go back to be with ones i love, or should i stay here and continue to be lonely but able to be who i am?

I am not sure, im lonely af. I got what i wanted, but is this what I really want? Or is it that my family and friends that I had in my home country was the true meaning of life? Love?",lonely,"I am 25, got what I wanted and still lonely",2021-04-06 02:41:41

2951,Shy-Lonely,1617631555,2,"If you are reading this right now, know that you aren't completely lost, you haven't even found yourself yet.

 By sharing yourself with other people, you slowly piece together all the pieces that make you who you are. By harming yourself you are deep down not satisfied with who you currently think you are and want to give yourself the motivation to finally become your real self. By lying to people, you stray further from yourself. By harming other people/other people harming you, you become lost but not to the point from which you can't recover, if you can reflect on what you did and accept the reasons for why you did it so it won't repeat itself.

People will want to drag you down, tell you who you aren't, but at the same time you aren't who you actually are. You don't know who you are for now, everything you think you are is based on your brain projecting from other people/objects/cultures/past events. So to find it out you need to push your comfort zone so your instincts show you who and what you are.   

After you've seen what you are capable of without even knowing it before, you need to accept yourself no matter what you found. People are part of nature just like our brain is and nature doesn't know what good or bad is, these are human constructs created and adapted to society, to not let people become the best they can be, so you have to accept your thoughts and your personality not as black or white but as grey. You decide what is good or bad, not other people. Without rules we are just animals with a different skin color, so you have to set your own rules that won't let you harm other people and yourself to still remain human.

If you're reading this right now, **you are a success story**.

I have been struggling with loneliness and depression for most of my life, and it has led to a lot of negativity, swirling around in my head. 

With Therapy, I've been able to begin my journey towards understanding my past, what fuels the negative and depressive thoughts, and what needs to change for me to be the better person I want to become. To be honest, I can't imagine being the center of someone's life right now. I can't imagine someone valuing me because I don't value myself. But if everything happens for a reason, then I know that my purpose is probably something that I haven't discovered yet, and at least for me, it's something to search for.

I think I'm writing this to help someone because my brain wont always let me help myself. I'm so used to putting myself down and being my own worst enemy.

If you're like me and struggle with self-positivity, let me say, YOU ARE A SUCCESS STORY. You already are. Even just by virtue of you reading this right now. You haven't given up and that's something to be proud of.

You are worthy, valuable, and will no doubt be someone's entire world one day. Life has a weird way of showing us the good and the bad, but it's up to us to choose which we believe in and put energy towards.

I hope you read this and (even if just for a moment), you value yourself a little bit more than you did before.

All in all, I just ask that you have a good day, and that you take a second to recognize how good a good day feels to have. Hopefully, you get to a point to where you can start to make your own good days. And when you can make you're own good days, maybe you pay that forward, and try to make someone else's day a bit better.

I‚Äôm Evelyn. I‚Äôm 35, and Trans MtF. PreHRT, PreOP.

I have mental illnesses:

1) C-PTSD: This stands for ‚ÄúComplex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder‚Äù. No, I didn‚Äôt serve. It‚Äôs from decades of abuse.

2) Generalized Anxiety Disorder: This is when someone has excessive anxiety about their life, but can‚Äôt control it.

3) Severe Major Depressive Disorder: This is when someone deals with depression that pretty much never goes away. It just fluctuates.

4) Avoidant Personality Disorder: This is an enduring pattern of behavior related to social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and sensitivity to rejection that causes me to avoid these situations IRL.

5) Borderline Personality Disorder: This means that I have a strong fear of abandonment, struggle to maintain healthy relationships, have very intense emotions, act impulsively, and may even experience paranoia and dissociation.

6) Negativistic Personality Disorder: This one is pretty simple. It just means I‚Äôm cynical and pessimistic, but to an amplified degree sometimes.

I have been formally diagnosed by a qualified medical professional. I am on medicine and under a licensed therapist‚Äôs care.

Why am I telling you this instead of trying to ‚Äòsell‚Äô you on the idea of being friends with me?

That‚Äôs a good question. The reason is that I don‚Äôt want to start a friendship built on superficial garbage. It‚Äôs a waste of time to pretend everything is fine. Anything that‚Äôs built on lies will crumble. Anything that‚Äôs built on truth will stand. This is my offering of honesty to you, an act of good faith to show you that I want a rapport built on trust and honesty.

TL;DR struggling to maintain boundaries.

I‚Äôm (19 F) and I‚Äôve always had traumatic friendship experiences. The constant bullying and always being the therapist friend, constantly listening and always being there for my friends during their hard times. 
Despite always being there for my friends, I‚Äôve always felt like my friends are never there for me. 

I‚Äôve always been an introvert, I speak when spoken too. I only truly open up to a few people and I‚Äôm always there to listen. I feel like I‚Äôve always let people walk over me, use me and then just throw that relationship away. 

I recently stopped speaking to my best friend of 7 years, last year. It was a very depressing year actually. I also started college and wasn‚Äôt very keen on making new friends. However I did find a bunch of people who are extremely sweet. I don‚Äôt joke around a lot and I feel like I should learn to loosen up a bit. But u know sometimes what appears to be ‚Äòbanter‚Äô isn‚Äôt really banter. I‚Äôve learnt to not take jokes so seriously but somethings are just never funny. 
I‚Äôm really struggling with trying to differentiate and reacting promptly when a joke is not funny. I need to set some boundaries.

2988,pandasnuggie,1617612510,1,"So I did the whole online dating thing for about a month this year. I matched with this one guy who I thought was really nice and he instantly made plans to go on a date. I was excited because I got ghosted pretty hard with another match before. 

It was actually about a week ago so it was fairly recent. We had a lot of fun and he complimented me a lot and he kissed me at the end of it. At this point I started seriously romanticizing about him and we had plans to hang out again (aka three days before). 

He kept in touch with me until then. He would send me good morning texts every day. I thought to myself wow maybe this will go past a second date. 

As always I was wrong. We ended up hooking up (which I wanted anyway) but I thought we would make plans the next time after that day. When the next day rolled around, I looked at his Bumble profile. He updated it, adding pictures and editing his bio. This really hurt, because I interpreted it as he‚Äôs still wanting to go on dates with other women (and probably sleep with them). He usually sends a good morning text by now, but this time silence. I called him and told him this was too much for me, and I realized that he did all of these things just to have sex with me, and then toss me aside. I was naive to think he would stop pursuing after that night, but like always I was wrong. 

That was a long post, but this just made me feel so lonely and used. Was I just seen as a piece of meat? I guess sex doesn‚Äôt mean much anymore. He claims he likes me as a potential partner, but I don‚Äôt trust anything he says anymore and I deleted his number. I feel lonely now, but I know in the end this will teach me a lot and I won‚Äôt make the same mistake again.

i have always desired for a friend whom i can talk to and have fun with since high school but now that i'm in college, i have still yet to find a friend whom i can properly talk to and listen to me. it doesn't help that i'm the only child and both my parents are working so i come back home to an empty house everyday. in both primary and high school, i would find myself being caught in toxic friendships which made me dread going to school A LOT. that was almost 6 years of failed friendships in total and it really hurts me to even think about my experiences in high school. 

now that i'm in college, i find myself building walls around myself and even though i try my best to make friends, none of them seems to be interested in me personally and be my friend. almost all the conversations i have with my schoolmates are school-related, nothing more. and now that i'm on my internship, all the other interns only talk to me about work and when i try to steer the conversation to something more personal, they would just reply and then nothing. i try to share more about myself and also asking more about them, but the whole conversation just ends up being awkward.  

literally nobody texts me first unless i text them. everytime i go on Instagram and see other people hanging out with their group of friends, i can't help but feel so envious and wish that i had a social circle like theirs. i feel so shitty about myself and wonder if there's anything wrong with me bc people just seem uninterested in getting to know me. 

i really am trying my best to form genuine friendships but i'm really on the verge of giving up. i'm starting my new school year in 2 weeks and we're rotating classes again which means i have to meet a bunch of unfamiliar faces again. i feel so dead inside and i really want someone to talk to.",lonely,i have absolutely no one i can vent my feelings to and listen to me when i feel down. i feel so lonely and i don't know what to do,2021-04-05 18:35:33

I don't live with my family, all of my closest friends are so far away that I haven't seen most of them almost two years. I'm also in the process of a breakup. Since I just moved I haven't started working yet, and I'm still in the middle of my gap year so I'm not in school. 

I've just started accepting that I have a lot of anxiety and depression and am dealing with a lot of trauma. I'm trying to make myself work through that, but it's so hard when I don't have a support system that I'm close and comfortable with anymore. I'm even doubting that I'm mentally ready to start school in the fall. 

Basically I'm overwhelmingly lonely. It's easter weekend and I can't see family, and my birthday is in a couple weeks and I have nobody to celebrate with. It's just rough feeling like I don't have anybody anymore.

I am 26 years old. I am happy. I have friends (few) but lately, i been waking up at night a lot because of a void in my heart. I haven't make any new friendships in a long time, like in years time. After leaving my country and moving to the states, i never felt like I belonged so I didn't bother trying to connect. 

These days, I want to meet new people. I want to communicate and I want to make friends because at night it feels like a boulder is crushing my heart and it hurts me so much to, well, be alone. I cannot speak to others not because of being shy, but because I am afraid of them. I am afraid they make fun of me, betray me, hurt me emotionally or that my voice will break and I will panic.

The few friends I have i barely see them, I get it everyone is busy with their lives, so i thought making new friends could help but idk how :( does anyone have a good tip to give me or something? When I think of this at night, it makes it hard to breath and fall asleep again. It makes me want to cry.

3000,bacc1234,1617608709,1,"Burner account to post this. Apologies if this is long but I just need to vent and hopefully get some support. 

I‚Äôm a college student, second year at a small college, which means we‚Äôve been mostly in person with social distancing protocols. I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a girlfriend and a housemate who I‚Äôm good friends with, but beyond that my social life is close to non-existent. I‚Äôve never really been good at making friends unless they either try and make friends with me or someone else introduces us because I have a lot of social anxiety. But this semester I wanted to try to do it myself. 

So I met a girl who works at the library and who checked books out to me a couple of times and we would talk about them when she knew about them. Then gradually we started to talk about other stuff, nothing serious or anything just stuff like ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your week been‚Äù etc.

Then I decided that I was going to ask her if she‚Äôs like to get a socially distanced lunch sometime. After panicking a few times when I planned on doing it I asked and she said yes and gave me her number to set it up. She‚Äôs a senior and working on her thesis though, so she said she is pretty busy working on it. So each Thursday or Friday for the past 3-4 weeks she says that she‚Äôll let me know if she‚Äôs free that weekend and each time she ends up saying she‚Äôs too busy and can‚Äôt. 

This week I asked her and today she texted me saying that she doesn‚Äôt want to keep cancelling on me, and that she‚Äôs too busy working on her thesis and hanging out with her close friends that she won‚Äôt see after the school year, and so she doesn‚Äôt have the time to make new friends now. 

I don‚Äôt want this to come off as a post that‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI deserve attention and am mad I didn‚Äôt get it‚Äù because I don‚Äôt blame her at all. If I was in her situation I‚Äôd probably do the same. It just really sucks because I thought that I‚Äôd finally have someone as a friend other than the two people I spend all my free time with. And I put it in so much effort, and spent so much energy trying to get over my anxiety. And in a single text all that is gone. Even though I know it‚Äôs not exactly the case it still feels like being rejected. 

I just feel really shitty because I‚Äôm going to probably finish my second year of college with a whopping total of 2 friends. I can‚Äôt expect to spend all my time with my girlfriend, or with my housemate, because they have other friends of their own. But that just means that whenever they‚Äôre doing something else I‚Äôm alone.

3003,ImmortalEdge,1617605932,1,"I damaged and lost the only true love of my life. I have had countless girlfriends in the past but no one ever came close to this woman; she was my childhood sweetheart/highschool sweetheart. She isn‚Äôt perfect but she was and still is perfect for me. She truly gave me everything I ever wanted; emotionally, financially, physically, romantically, spiritually, everything on every level. But here is where it turned sour. I started drinking alone a long time ago, a habit I created shortly after college. I would get home from work, and start drinking until I had to go to sleep. When I got together with her, I stopped drinking for maybe two years but After I got my new job, I started drinking again with coworkers and I fell back into the pattern of drinking to fix the hangover, or to stop the anxiety caused from the hangover. And back to drinking alone I went. I would drink in excess again alone after work (my partner doesn‚Äôt drink at all) and when she went to bed, I would stay up to drink some more until I ran out. She tried to tell me about this and how it made her feel lonely without me coming to bed with her. She told me several times and I was so numb, and in denial that I didn‚Äôt even bother to listen. I stopped taking care of myself, stopped feeding myself self love; I stopped loving myself completely. I even stopped going to the gym because I was so drained of energy from the shame, guilt, and hangovers caused from the drinking and subsequent dehabilitating anxiety. I have come to realize that I have been a serious alcoholic for a many years and have been numbing my emotions for a long time. I must have had the largest case of denial because I didn‚Äôt even realize how bad my drinking had got until recently. Albeit Covid brought this to a head but it‚Äôs still something that I have been suffering from for a long time; it just got bad a couple years ago and Covid made it come to the forefront. I have been hungover all the time; a result of years of abuse and I‚Äôm getting older (33yo) so I feel it way more now. My anxiety levels have never been so high. I have become so angry with myself and frustrated at everything. I‚Äôve literally felt like I have been becoming a monster to the people around me because of it too. Most of all I have been a monster to the one person I have every truly loved. No one has ever made me feel the way I do when I am with her. The happiest version of myself is when we were happy together. After being with her for 6 years, I finally got a ring custom made a year ago and was planning to propose to her but Covid kept me from executing the plans to propose to her In Maui. After this, my alcoholism reached its worst point. It got to the point where I was having more than a 6pack a night, or half a fifth just to cope with my disappointment of not being able to carry out my original plan. What I should have done didn‚Äôt happen; I didn‚Äôt replan and execute. I drank more and more instead. Forcing my partner to live with an alcoholic, it damaged our relationship of course. She complained about many things (and she had every right to do so) and yet I responded poorly and I ended up stonewalling her and would drink even more during those conflicts in order to numb myself from feeling anything. She tried to shower me love and tried to do all the right things to get me out of this funk but it took so long for me to finally confront the alcoholism that I eventually lost her. She gave many many years to fix this, far longer than I deserved. She incurred emotional damage over and over trying to pull me out of this terrible situation and I kept pushing her away, denying my problem and succumbing further into the abyss. Eventually she felt that she was completely spent and she left me. After that day, the worst day of my life. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I explained to her that it was the alcohol that snuck up on me and it‚Äôs something that I want to stop but I haven‚Äôt been able to do it in the past. I got help, I reached out and discovered therapy and AA meetings and both has been a game changer. I‚Äôve since stopped drinking and have been sober for a while now (about a month). She left me and will probably never forgive me for the pain and suffering that she had to go through to help me through the hardest time of my life. She was all in, she loved me unconditionally and I wasn‚Äôt able to return in the same capacity that she deserved because of the alcoholism. Part of the struggle now is facing all these once suppressed/numbed emotions(good and bad) and traumas that were buried under the chronic drinking. It‚Äôs a fucking roller coaster. One hour I‚Äôm sad, one hour I‚Äôm angry, the next Im feeling better physically and more energetic because my body is healing from the alcohol abuse. The one emotion that is constant though is feeling lonely, I‚Äôve never felt so incomplete and lonely in my life. I‚Äôve known this perfect woman for over 15 years and she has always had a spot in my life as a friend a life partner and a lover. And now she is gone. And it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm now saddled with intense regret, shame, guilt and of course a huge serving of loneliness. I got what I deserved that‚Äôs for sure but she got something she never deserved. She went all in on me and I failed myself and I failed her, I failed the partnership I agreed to. I promised to love her unconditionally and to love her just as much as she loved me. I dropped the ball, I fucked up, I fell into the abyss and got into a situation where I was becoming a monster. She helped save me from the alcoholism but I lost her trust, respect, and her faith in me in the process. It‚Äôs a price that feels so heavy to pay and I surely deserve to be lonely as a result. I wish I would have listened before, earlier, I wish I would have confronted this alcoholism earlier but I don‚Äôt think I was truly ready to take this on until now. I have finally realized that life is too short to just live through it drunk. There‚Äôs too much to enjoy in life than to be numb to the world all the time. I finally have found to love myself again and enjoy my own company but the only thing is, I am so very deeply lonely and the void with never be able to be filled again. She set the standard so fucking high. I‚Äôve tasted true love and unconditional connection and nothing in any other relationship has even come close to that connection I have with her. I have truly and deeply given up on ever trying at love with anyone else and have accepted that I will probably be lonely the rest of my life and it will be because of my poor choices with alcohol and not allowing myself to give her the best version of myself. I feel confident and capable of doing that now but I know it‚Äôs too late. Loneliness is what I deserve",lonely,I have been suffering from alcoholism for years.

3004,sivarajkumar237,1617604696,1,"Not sure where my life is going. I couldn't get up from my existential crisis or escape from the dark corridors of loneliness. I'm gonna tell everything here. It's long so maybe nobody is going to read. But I'm going to post this anyway to get things off my chest. Sorry for my bad English.


Existential Crisis:
----------------------------
I don't follow any religion. After learning astronomy, I just couldn't. I left my religion. I don't know what's reality or purpose of life. Our observable universe is 90 billion ly in diameter. Here I am (an insignificant dust) orbiting an insignificant not so special star called ""The Sun"". My place in this universe is not special.

100 years from now, nobody is going to remember my name or how I lived my life. I'm going to die in 50 to 70 years from now. Not even a century.

Heck! Time is just an illusion and we might be living in a block universe where past, present and future exists at the same time. What we perceive as ""present"" could be just an illusion.

Why is our universe fine tuned? Is there extraterrestrial aliens? Will I ever know? I might die without knowing the answers to ultimate questions like what caused the big bang, is there life out there, is there multiverse etc;

I feel like I should rip my brains apart! This is driving me crazy.

Loneliness:
--------------------
The more you get close to people the higher the chances of getting hurt.

In my college days, I loved my friends so much. I was there everytime when they needed me. Sometimes I will sacrifice my sleep or my exams to help my friends. I surprise my friends with gifts or cakes for their birthdays. But I felt like I didn't get much love from them. I barely even get birthday wishes for my birthday. They never cut cakes for my birthday. It sucked.

I had another friend. Not even a single day goes by without chatting with her. But after 4 years she started ignoring me for no reason. I begged her, asked why she is ignoring me, told her that its hurting me and I'm already in a very bad position. She didn't even respond to my messages.

After college I stayed alone. I was very afraid to approach people because the more you get close to people the more you might get hurt. I have experienced that in my college life.

In my workplace, I had my lunch alone for 3 months. It sucked! Everyone was having lunch with 5+ friends. I felt really disgusting. Why am I so unlovable? I help everyone and inturn I just expect them to just ask ""Hey how are you doing?"".

After 3 months one girl asked me join her group for lunch. It was the best day of my life. But inside I was very scared. Are they going to hurt me eventually like my old friends? I couldn't open myself with anyone.

One year went by and life was great. I had friends who talked to me everyday. It was like heaven. I had a small crush on one of my friends but didn't tell her because I was afraid that it would ruin my beautiful friendship.

As the days went by, one day she found out I have a crush on her. She told me that I'm making her uncomfortable and made me promise I will never ever feel something like that in the future. My friendship is more important than my feelings. So I agreed and didn't disturb her. After few days she blocked me on social media. She ignored my calls and messages. The very thing I was afraid of happened eventually.

It's like a cycle. Eventually all the people I love always leave me when I'm mentally at a bad situation. I'm feeling ugly and disgusted.

I have never ever been in a relationship. Even my friends leave me after few years, so romantic relationship is a hopeless dream.

I feel like I'm the biggest loser of the universe. Everything I touch never ends up good. Even my parents think I'm not good for anything.

This seriously affected me mentally. Now I cannot talk with strangers. I will start sweating like a pig and my hands will start shaking. I can't even go to the grocery store and buy biscuits without getting nervous.

I couldn't cry but I want to. I want someone to hug me very tightly and say ""Hey I'm here for you. Just tell me how you are feeling'. I've been waiting for that moment for 7 years!

I believe I think about her so much because I never really got the chance to know her, and thus my mind imagines what I don‚Äôt know as my ideals. She was simply an attractive classmate who had a personality I would have loved to have at least been friends with. I never engaged in much conversation of course, due to my social anxiety. 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm actively seeking any kind of relationship right now, but these dreams do remind me of the benefits of being in one. To be honest, even if I had the opportunity, I would most likely turn it down. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm secure enough mentally yet, and the last thing I want in a relationship is dependence on the other person.

3063,Toss-away-prof,1617575794,2,"My previous record was when I turned 50.  I had been divorced about a year and it was a week I didn‚Äôt have my kids. My best friend was out of town, so I had agreed to take care of the family‚Äôs cat.  I hung out with the cat and did the cat-care chores.  I left and then thought that I needed to do something memorable for my 50th.  I went to a shady strip club and felt up an ugly girl with cigarette breath.  I really hate strip clubs, but I just thought 50 is a memorable birthday, so I should do something.  It was pretty sad.

Today, I have recently broken up with a girl (a week ago) and once again have no one around for a holiday.  I tried reaching out to folks, but it is just hollow.  No one knows me.  My ex gf just couldn‚Äôt be honest and is lashing out at me rather than caring.  She wasn‚Äôt the one for me anyway, but I do miss her. 

Family is non-existent or terribly troubled and has no ability to empathize.  I had no idea that becoming older could be so isolating. No friends, no family, nothing but work.  I go through the motions and I just can‚Äôt wait to drink at night and fall asleep.  The trouble is that I keep waking up and I can‚Äôt escape the feeling of isolation and despair. 

I wish I knew a way out.  When I was in my 20s, friends just appeared out of no where and I had a social life.  Now, I have 1 friend and 1 ex girlfriend.  I reached out to her, but her reply was a bit of a gut punch.  The one friend has wife and kiddos, so isn‚Äôt really able to help or provide much distraction.  

Anyone been here?  Anyone find a way out of this hole I‚Äôve put myself in?  I tried OLD and honestly couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to go meet someone.  It was too much effort and I would obviously be sad and needy, which is repulsive.  

I don‚Äôt feel like dying, but I wonder what is left in life to look forward to. At my best moments, I‚Äôm robotic.

This is my first post on Reddit and guys I just want to say this world is fucking messed up place. Everyone here is selfish and nobody fucking care about anything other than their own benefit. I used to be a introvert, lonely person. I used to think being nice and helpful to others will make you happy. Being a good person and nice to others will make you successful. But you know what fuck that. In this life nobody will care you genuinely and support you other than yourself. Out there pain is the only truth. The people who I used to call as my friends, they made me fucking miserable. As a lonely person I didn‚Äôt knew how to interact with people or tell others how i felt, I didn‚Äôt care how badly others treated me I just smile to them. I don‚Äôt even know how to express myself nowadays. But all those people made me into someone my past  self would be even scared to talk to. Today my only happiness is me and myself. Everyday I try to make myself better. 

So I just want say that  don‚Äôt give a FUCK about anything or anybody. Just love yourself and be yourself. If your friends or anyone is making you feel like shit, fucking burn those mfkers.

I have a good life. A great job (currently remote), a running group I see a few times a week, and friends across the country that I do virtual hangs out with since we can‚Äôt visit or travel right now.

I have a good relationship with my family but it‚Äôs very surface level. We‚Äôll call every few weeks and do the typical small talk exchange for about 10 minutes. 

For me, the loneliness is in all the in between moments. And yes, I realize how cliche this is going to sound.....
Because of COVID, I‚Äôve spent every holiday, every weekend, every day pretty self isolated. I am fortunate enough to run with friends for about an hour once or twice a week, and do virtual hangouts with friends for about an hour once or twice a week. But that leaves a lot of time in between alone.

I have a lot of hobbies. I run on my own a lot. Do yoga, volunteer, do a bunch of reading, listen to audio books and podcasts, and cook. But it‚Äôs so different than actually connecting with someone. Being with someone who really gets you and you can say exactly what‚Äôs on your mind and being able to be every variation of weird with pride.

They‚Äôre all insecure and don‚Äôt know how to make sense of the world just like you too because you‚Äôre kids. People are so invested in themselves that they‚Äôre not going to question your behavior. 

You can be whatever you want to be kid, you just have to figure out what behaviors/variables point you in that direction and which hinder you. 

If videogames are your problem, tell your parents you want them to lock up your playstation for a month. Now you have all this free time to do something else. 

I‚Äôve seen people peak in high school, just because you‚Äôre not who you want to be today doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not going to be who you want to be later in life. Don‚Äôt give up, winners all were losers at some point. Failure is a lesson, not being the person you want to be is a lesson for later in life. 

Right now you‚Äôre lower than low and down on yourself. Try pretending you‚Äôre king shit. You might just pretend yourself into being king shit. If you‚Äôre a male, no one is going to hold your hand or coddle you in life. That‚Äôs just the way society is constructed. 

Become a student of life, read/observe/understand human behavior, human interaction. Life is a game, it‚Äôs just a harder game than Fallout or whatever because you don‚Äôt know the rules initially. 

If you really just want friends, buy a book on how to make friends. [$12 and a couple hours to read](How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671027034/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_3HWKW9W666KK7PTSN5Z9).

3127,R41921917C,1617550815,1,"Ever since 2014 (I was 16 back then) I have been completely alone. I dropped out of school due to financial and health issues. My girlfriend left me because of that and so did my friends. Soon after I fell into a pit of depression and self-loathing. During that time I constantly watched movies, TV shows and anime to distract myself from my depression and anxiety, and in a sense I went through a journey of self-discovery. My English had always been better than every one else at school but during that time it improved even further and my accent became very American since I never interacted with any real people and mostly watched American movies and listened to American heavy metal music. I developed interests very few people in my country had (I'm from India).

Only recently have I started to fix myself and restarted interacting with the real world. However, due to my 'self-discovery' I have trouble finding common ground with people, no one I know shares my interests and the things they are interested in feels alien to me. Though, I couldn't care less... You see since 2014, I have adapted to being alone all the time and now having people around me feels suffocating. I absolutely love being alone, there's no one to tell me to do this, do that or judge me for being who I am. It's quiet all around me and I think it's heavenly.

Only thing that I am actually sad about is not being able to experience the touch of a woman. There are times that it actually, physically hurts but I have no choice but to deal with it. Although it was incredibly difficult I had to accept that I will die a virgin, only recently have I made peace with the fact.

3165,StarfruitBrewery,1617527427,1,"I'm(25m) graduating from college in a few weeks. I would have been so excited for this, except this past year has been all at home. In fact the past three and a half semesters, at this point I did as much at home as I did in class at my current college. I love being on campus. I love being around people, even if they aren't talking to me. I'm rather introverted, but in a way that I open up to approaching me and asking for anything I can provide. Being at home all of the time, not getting to sit in the library, not getting to read random books every day, not getting to work on my projects surrounded by a busy library, I miss all of these things to an extreme extent at this point. Even though I was lonely before, and hardly talking to anyone for anything besides school, I at least got to see the joy in other people. I got to have the little interactions that stick with you forever, and give you a glimpse at who someone completely random, or someone you only know as ""the person that sits with this group"" is.

 A great example I can think of, it was raining one day and I was leaving the library, particularly stressed. As I was leaving, a girl who is also in the library all of the time was getting to the library, and since we always sit in the same area we recognized each other. The look she had on her face after having to walk however far to the library was priceless. These kinds of interactions cannot be replaced by anything online, as online is only verbal/text communication while someone is in a setting that allows that, where this was a reaction to environment. I miss that more than anything, I miss seeing people be in an environment where they were happy, even when things like getting rained on happened.

The most I get anymore is when I'm out skating, I sometimes see people and have little interactions, but it's so rare. There isn't a skate park where I live so I'm forced to skate in random spots until I get kicked out(I'm older, so I'm more respectful and it usually lends itself to ""please don't destroy anything""), and I get to see some people interact with their environment. Those interactions aren't the same as they were on campus, or even in other areas, these are older people who only see other people as an annoyance, these are people who don't want to do anything but go home, not eager people wanting to work on what they love. I know this isn't only college campuses that have happy people, but my town is so depressing. I wish I could live in the town my college is in so I can have interactions with happier, active people.

Another thing that I've noticed is students online are going mad, like so stressed they can't think straight and are starting to be suicidal kind of mad. This was never the case on campus. Students were stressed, we're all comp sci, we're going to be. But we were still enjoying what we did, we were still eager to work in the field or go on to do research. Whatever it was, students were eager. Professors were eager to teach, they wanted to be around students and teach them. The people at work have lost their eagerness. I work with another young developer, she has gone from this super cool music loving nerd to a zombie in the past few months because it's nothing but dormant life for all of us.

This would be the happiest time of my life, getting to see everyone around me happy, finally getting to start a good career, finally getting to go to bars and awkwardly sit in the corner until I decided I just want to go home, skate every day, work a job I actually want to work. Instead I'm sitting here looking at my home computer screen, a computer capable of playing any game on the market, a computer capable of letting me develop anything I want, a computer capable of being an extension of my ideas and not wanting to do anything because I know how much everyone I saw is having to go through. I really hope all of the people that sat in the library around me are good, and I wonder every day if any of them hope the same about me.",lonely,"Don't know where else to post, but whatever.",2021-04-04 19:10:27

I have been lonely for a good good while after moving cities and haven‚Äôt had many friends in a while but one of my old school friends added me to this group with his friends and we started talking they thought I was funny and all and we talked 24/7 in the group and I added the only friend of mine and we planned this thing today and we went and had fun and came back home.


Like 3hours after that they got mad over my friend for saying something as a joke(They are mad soft and sensitive and he didn‚Äôt even say anything offensive he made fun of a girls music taste)And pretty much ganged up on him but at first I thought they were joking so I played around then later bunch of kids kept targeting me and my friend for literally no reason(I didn‚Äôt say a single thing that could offend them)but after that I defended myself and they ganged up and started talking shit to me and my friend.And later removed us both.

3181,zeldianiac,1617520245,1,"I know everyone experiences covid blues. And i know I'm not the only one feeling like this, but it needs to be said. Even if I just shout to the void.

I'm alone. Have been since the middle of 2019. I had it in my head I was in a perfect relationship. I had it in my head I was going to propose to the love of my life. And then we broke up. And it may have not been the longest relationship but it was my first and it was long for a first. But now nearly two years later I've been able to accept some hard truths about it. It wasn't healthy and there was manipulation happening on both ends. But it didn't stop me from missing what I felt. I fell in love and I fell hard. I had my problems and so did they. We had that feeling of everything being right, even though they apparently weren't. But it's that feeling I think I miss most. That everything feels right with a person.

I've tried a few things here and there. But nothing lasts. People seem to grow tired of me, or think I'm something I'm not. 


I lost my job back in January. After having gone through summer 2020 on leave from work, I exhausted my savings on just living. When I began work again I could make my bills but just barely. And then they dropped me in January. I've been looking for work that will suite me, and even taken jobs that don't. But again nothing lasted. And so I've sat on my ass doing barely jack shit every day for the last few months. My work used to allow me to be mobile, and I would often walk 9-12 miles a day. It was worth it to me, making my bills and staying healthy. But now I'm neither. I'm just putting on more weight and feel like I'm lying to myself about getting back in shape ""one day when covid is over."" 

And I know what I want to do. I want to make art for a living. But I don't know how to start and I've felt dry since about October. Nothing happens, or when it does I'm not happy with it. My tools don't feel right, but I know I just need to practice with them more. But it's hard when I don't have drive. And I don't quite feel ready to sell my art, mostly because I don't like my own art, but I need to do something.

But it's hard for me to do something for myself. I don't live for myself. And I know some would say it's not healthy to live like that. But I know how to not give everything away and save something for myself. It's how I like to live. I do things for others. But for two years I've been alone, and not for lack of trying. And I find myself with so much of myself that I feel crushed by it. So much of it that I hardly know what's there.

Some may say to own a pet. I would love to but my housing doesn't allow for it. Even if it did it would be terribly irresponsible to own a pet while I have no income.

Some might try to say ""then live for me"" and that's kind but I can't. I don't know you. 

I'm just lost, depressed and frankly afraid. My mind is broken from years of regret. Broken from years of trauma, living in an area who actively denies me any step forward I try to take.

It certainly doesn't help that I have body dysphoria. I'm tall and well built, which is blessing in it's own right. But I want to be smaller. More feminine in physique. But short of many invasive surgeries I can't have that. And even then there are still days I adore having the body I do. And I wish I could go between both at will. But I want whatever body I have to be healthy. I don't care about weight. I don't care about figure, having a six pack or having perfect boobs, perfect abs, perfect this or that. I just want to be healthy and comfortable.

And I have no one here to support me. No one to hold me. No one to love me the way I want to be loved. The way I need to be loved. I have friends, but many are spread around the USA, and some even outside it. But they aren't here for me the way I need it. But I don't know how to get there with anyone. I don't know the steps I'd need to take to even begin having a good relationship with someone.

3207,PeeWeesPenthouse21,1617507248,1,"31M divorced after 5 years of marriage, 6 of dating. I have my good days where I'm happy to not be in a failing marriage and being able to live life and then there are days like today where I miss having someone to share life with and end up on dating apps swiping endlessly with no matches in sight.

*PAUSE* Maybe you're wondering how I got here. Let's back up a little bit.

I met my ex-wife in 2013. Our relationship was great for the first 2 years (1 dating, 1 married) with the usual adjustment period of living together from essentially the start.

Then things started to change as we approached our 1-year anniversary. I fucked up on something stupid (Porn-related in regards to looking at other women, nothing so serious as cheating) and she threatened divorce. I immediately put myself in a ""outpatient therapy"" program to get shit sorted (which hurt me more than helped, but that's another story). Things seemed to get better once I finished the program but 6ish months after we were in a ""Dead Bedroom"" situation, or at least a dying one.

She wouldn't be up for having sex but maybe 4x a year. I couldn't masturbate next to her in bed. She wouldn't give me material of her to get off to (in person or digital). She wouldn't perform any other sexual acts for me or with me. And I wasn't allowed to watch porn. She had a major issue with porn (obviously) and refused to let me use it for my needs, especially after what had previously happened.

What the fuck was I supposed to do then? I did not agree to and refused to live a life of celibacy. I was not going to suppress my sexuality and be miserable. The sad part about my watching porn was she didn't realize I mostly watched women that had physical features that reminded me of her. I just wanted to be intimate with her and it rarely ever happened. But trying to appease her and try to be better for her, I did just that. I suppressed my sexuality and it resulted in a growing sense of resentment.

I blamed myself for a lot of our marital issues, including the sexual relationship. There was an immense amount of shame I felt with her that compounded with growing up in a Christian home where my sexuality was sinful and was reprimanded and shamed for any of my sexual exploration.

The lack of sex and intimacy in our relationship really started taking its toll on me the last 2 years of our marriage. I started acting out when drunk and pulling stupid shit but never crossing THAT line. 

At the end of 2018/beginning of 2019 I got caught acting out by her and was back in therapy (this time a legit therapy that wasn't based on religion and didn't shame me). She wouldn't go because ""she didn't need it"". I was making some progress on myself in therapy but not fully opening up.

In addition, the first 5 months of 2019 were heavy on me. I lost an uncle, we put a pet down, I lost another uncle, and then we lost another pet while we were out of town.

I woke up one morning extremely depressed and slipped up by watching porn to get off and get that endorphin rush. She found out later that day and she kicked me out. I lived with my parents until we divorced later that year.

It took a lot of therapy after that and convincing from my therapist (and family) to realize how controlling my ex-wife was of me, especially in our sexual relationship. 

I refuse to be in another relationship like that ever again, even if it means being single and lonely for the rest of my life.

This brings us back to now. I'm living on my own. I've got a secure job, a good group of friends, and not too much to complain about. I've made a lot of progress on myself and am proud of that.

But I'm lonely as hell sometimes. 

I have my good days where I'm happy to not be in a failing marriage and being able to live life. And then there are days like today where I miss having someone to share life with and end up on dating apps swiping endlessly with no matches in sight. It leaves me feeling empty and hopeless and that I will, in fact, be single forever. Especially when I do get a match and am so awkward that I can't keep their interest.

I know I should uninstall the apps. I do. But I can't find the strength to. Having the apps somehow gives me hope that maybe one of those swipes might actually result in something.

I just want someone to love and to love me. I miss that feeling.",lonely,The emotional rollercoaster of single life post-divorce,2021-04-04 13:34:08

3214,Furautomaton,1617504921,1,"I've always been alone. I'm 26, I've never been on a date, I've never been to a party, I only really have one real friend, but usually those things don't bother me a whole lot. I've got hobbies and such to keep myself busy. There have been rough patches, sure, but I'd say I've been OK most of the time.

The past two weeks though, I've been feeling just endlessly, soul-crushingly depressed about all that. I don't think I've ever wanted companionship as badly as I have in the past few days. I've cried over it, I've lost sleep over it, I can't focus on anything, it's just been gnawing at my brain nonstop 24/7 and I can't make it go away. I just want someone to invite me somewhere or a cute girl to message me on OKCupid and actually stick around instead of ghosting me. I can't tell you how badly I want it, it's such a deep, visceral want that I can almost physically feel it. I feel like my brain is slowly melting.

I just can't do this anymore. I've been telling myself for fucking years and years basically ""2012 is going to be the year! OK, 2012 didn't work, that means 2013! Alright, 2014. 2015? 2016? Please?"", and every year I'm slightly less successful and more and more lonely. How much longer do I have to do this? Am I going to be 36 thinking ""2032, maybe?""

So here's my plan, I'm giving myself the rest of 2021 to see if I can end the lifelong loneliness. If that doesn't work, if 2022 rolls around and I'm still alone, then I'm just ending it. I'm not doing another year of this, there's nothing anyone can say that can convince me to change my mind. I'm so tired.",lonely,I feel like I'm nosediving.,2021-04-04 12:55:21

The following is clearly not meant as ""bragging"" (I hope it will not get across that way), just to explain the issue:

I am a guy, over-average looking (tall, slim, even to some extent ""muscular"")

I am pretty successful in many ways, I am intelligent, some acquaintances even referred to me unironically as a ""genius"" (which is clearly an overstatement, but you get the point).

I am currently working at an elite university as a post-doc scientist and proceed to advance important projects, my former dissertation advisor referred to me as the best PhD-student he ever had.

I am an in general nice person, I often get praised for not being arrogant despite my success (I even have written proof for this). 

I am writing poetry that is also seen as astonishing by everyone and blah blah blah, this should really be enough self-adulation.

Despite all this, I am still single since about 6-7 years now. This is in part because my extreme introversion and some major social ineptness. Meet someone new and spoke a bit with him/her? Good luck remembering their name or face for more than three minutes. Sending subtle hints? Yeah, I'll get them some years later, if you are lucky.  It also does not help that I am not interested in most everyday topics, so it is hard to converse with me on anything. The main problem is that people I would be interested in would probably be as unlikely  going out as I am which makes meeting them ""difficult"".

So, I just wanted to write this down, since I am currently bored out of my mind and I wanted to see if you have maybe similar experiences or other interesting ""special conditions"" that keep you from finding love or good friends. And yes, I am aware that it is at least 70-80% my own fault not finding someone, I could go out more etc., but I have not much energy for that kind of stuff (and I currently have the pandemic as a general excuse).",lonely,play the game badly,2021-04-04 11:45:28

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don‚Äôt provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won‚Äôt pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it‚Äôs good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON‚ÄôT want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they‚Äôll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess‚Ä¶ It displays all the commands and well‚Ä¶ tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

No one wants to talk to me because I'm too awkward and I bring people down apparently.. I'm so lonely I just wish I had someone I could talk to. Maybe a friend or two to give me a reason to be excited to come home from work. Haven't had friends irl since graduating 5 years ago and never had a girlfriend before..

My best friend of a year wants nothing to do with me anymore and has met new people. They were the only person I had in my life and now they don't want me I don't know what to do.  I'm at work right now trying my hardest not to cry but I want to burst into tears. Im so lonely man..",lonely,i have no one anymore,2021-04-04 09:50:52
3238,Dinasik_,1617493300,1,"I feel incredibly lonely. I have no one to speak to. I'd like to have some friends just to chat and relax, but unfortunately I have none. I don't care if I met them on the internet or irl, but I am alone in both. And I know my problems(these are just my interpretation it can be different, but I doubt). 

First, I'm very boring as a person, so nobody is interested in talking with me and keeping connections. And second is that I'm very scared to write first. It's just so much stress for me, my head immediately fills with thoughts like: maybe I said/asked something stupid, maybe I'm interrupting person or maybe the person thinks that I'm annoying and in reality would like to not talk with me but I don't leave them be. I tried to find a person who'd like to chat with me for some period of time not once or twice a couple  of times all of which failed. Irl my life consists of school and home, so the only place where I can get some socialization. But my classmates care about me only when they need to cheat on a test or would talk to me for a couple of minutes once a week or two. Of I don't talk to anyone I'll be a blind spot for everyone. Maybe,the problem is that nobody thinks that I have a problem. Maybe everyone thinks that I just don't need any communication, but I do everything to have a chance to talk to someone. If something is being organized by my class I always for it and ~90% of the times when I'm asked to help I help everyone another 10% comes from when I can't help without any negative consequences for myself. 

All in all, if you accuse me of my problems or tell me that they might be stupid or insignificant I would totally agree with you(But if my problems are insignificant I'd be quite sad, actually). But I guess all I need right now is a good long-term company, which I can't get.",lonely,"This may be annoying, but I want to rant about my life",2021-04-04 09:41:40

3240,OneNewspaper2175,1617492321,1,"I got a new phone and decided to clean up my contacts. I literally have no friends so all my numbers are work or family-related. I only texted 3 people my new number and that made me a little sad (I plan to send a mass email on Monday to work-related people). I feel a little liberated to clear it all out but it's a punch in the face to see how few people I interact with and all of the people I failed to keep in contact with.

I graduated the summer before corona and moved to a new city so making friends has been incredibly difficult. I've kinda done it: I've gotten closer with neighbors and a family member that is my age. I'm trying really hard to keep up with life and it has affected my mental health. My usual avenues of getting to know people have been impacted so going from being pretty social to living alone and never seeing people really hurts. I even moved back home for 6 months early in the pandemic and sometimes I think I should've stayed there.

My phone was something my abuser used to control me so I never used it properly. I saw it as a tool, diary, and a double edge sword. I'm proud to have my own phone and to no longer be dependent on an abuser. I hope to fill it with people I really care about and to actually use my phone.

3241,needhelp7545,1617491840,1,"
Little backstory for context: I graduated in 2020 and have been unemployed ever since - I‚Äôve applied consistently everywhere in my area, other states and even abroad not just once off but repeatedly- I‚Äôve even phoned in companies asking if they had places or opportunities available. In the meantime I‚Äôm currently doing an online TEFL course as I did not what to waste another year at home so I‚Äôm making the effort to make an opportunity for myself. I still live at home with my family and was almost getting my drivers before the pandemic - can‚Äôt do that anymore seeing as my driving instructor died and it‚Äôs not safe to stand in line in a crowded DMV. Saying this because I know the pandemic has affected everyone and I‚Äôm not tryna act as if the world owes me something. 
 
But yesterday a close friend of mine told me she got a new car her parents bought for her. I‚Äôm genuinely happy for I am (I‚Äôm not someone who gets jealous of what others have) but it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt the fact that she got a car specifically that bothered me. Less than three weeks ago she managed to get a job because her mom got a contact in the business, unlike me who has been searching for a year she graduated this year and didn‚Äôt even get to make her own CV yet she managed to score 2 offers because of her contacts. Literally all the things I‚Äôve been trying to work hard for and get these past two years she got them easily in ONE MONTH. What‚Äôs worse is that it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs some rich person she‚Äôs similar to me in background, upbringing etc so it‚Äôs not like I can blame it on her being rich or some other privilege- she‚Äôs just like me and seeing her being able to get the same things I‚Äôve been working hard for so easily without even having to  try does hurt and makes me feel like left behind. It just doesn‚Äôt seem fair to me, I cried last night because it‚Äôs just another reminder that where the simplest things for me to achieve are constantly bombarded with obstacles come so easy for others. I‚Äôm tired of always being patient and waiting for ‚Äúmy time to come‚Äù, even in a pandemic there‚Äôs people moving forward yet nothing ever moves forward for me. Like I‚Äôm stuck in some simulation that‚Äôs stuck in the year 2015 and no matter how hard I try to break out of it I‚Äôm just pushed back. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong she‚Äôs a lovely person and she deserves the opportunities but god does it hurt. I‚Äôm exhausted from constantly working this hard for the simplest shit and seeing it given so easily to others. I spent 2016 to 2020 studying and working hard, when I graduated I spend 1 month perfecting and creating my portfolio then sending it to every company I know, I have over 200 cover letters on my laptop that have been sent out over the past couple of months only to be rejected. I‚Äôm so so tired, that whether it‚Äôs trying to get my drivers, a job or even a first kiss I‚Äôm just so fucking behind in all areas of life and attempt to push forward is always rejected.",lonely,Feeling left behind,2021-04-04 09:17:20

Around a week ago i flushed my Clozapine pills out of paranoia and hatred of how they make me and decided to stay at my friend who i have known for 15 years, at his flat i had an episode of psychosis which left him with a very minor injury but i think i scared him a lot as he has never seen me like that before, now he wont reply to my calls or text me back. My mother had to come and get me from his house and she found out i flushed my medication, now she doesn't trust me at all and acts very differently around me. 

I'm going to just stop taking these pills and try live normally. I don't want to feel like a zombie anymore or have any of the terrible side effects they bring. Clozapine doesn't cure my paranoia anyway, I was only consistently taking them really for my mum and because they are court ordered so i had to keep my doctor happy.

So i'm going to last as long as i can before either i get found out and put into involuntary inpatient or if the worst comes to the worse have another bad episode at which point ill just hand myself in.

I realized how annoying it could be since it feels very forced, but I can't seem to understand why I try to force it. All in all, I wanted to vent this problem since now it seems I'm constantly arguing with them ( The reason for arguments is my fault) and can't seem to improve myself as a friend even after constantly being what I'm doing wrong.

But if anyone sees this, do you wanna text?

Quick background on me: I have social anxiety. I stopped being friends with the few people I was friends with, because of the amount of work that I had in college (all lead to not being able to hang out). All I do now is work, play League of Legends and sleep.

I have a hard time texting people, especially old friends, because I often don't know what to say. 

Irl, I'm not a very approachable person, hence me not having a lot of friends. I used to post stuff that I thought was interesting on Facebook, but never got any likes. Which lead me to believe that a lot of people don't like me.

One other note: I'm an introvert. Yeah, an introvert with social anxiety. Not fun.

3284,SingleIndianaGuy33,1617469273,1,"For context, I'm a 33 year-old, divorced, single man with a stable career and no financial woes living in the midwest of the USA. 

I recently came across a little aphorism concerning social life in our time: You've got one thousand facebook friends, five hundred likes, and no one to have dinner with on a Saturday night. 

In my case, I don't have even the friends or the likes, but then again, I don't have a tremendous social media presence and I really don't want one. I've always been one to desire a few meaningful friends over a large group of more distant friends. 

For the past year or so I've gone through a tremendous life change, and now I find myself rather lonely, without someone I can really call a great friend, without a girlfriend or partner. I'd really love a partner, but then, who wouldn't? Well, as I recently discovered, many don't want a partner at all. It's a rather strange phenomenon, isn't it? So many wish to be left alone, but loneliness is an epidemic in our time. We sit guardedly behind our screens when what we most desire is some kind of intimacy - a kind partner or friend.

I don't really know why I'm posting this, to be quite honest. I suppose it's a bit like journaling, but with the added twist that there is at least some possibility someone reads this post and has a reaction to it - perhaps that someone will say ""well look at that, he feels much the same as me and perhaps we'd get along"". Of course it is true, nonetheless, that only a few more will read this than would read a private journal entry! But there is some strange comfort in that thought as well. As often happens, sadness permeates happiness through and through. 

Still, I believe happiness is probably possible to achieve. It's not the sort of thing one achieves all at once, is it? No, it comes only after a long while, something at first only hazily perceived, but one day, I think it would be possible to look around and to be happy with my life, with my friends, with my partner, with my family. I think that must be possible. 

It's only lately that I've really, truly learned what I actually want out of life, and at least that battle is somewhat concluded, for the time being at least. There is the matter of actually getting what I want, and I am trying.

Sometimes I think how wonderful it would be to have someone with whom to grab breakfast on a weekend morning. 

I like to read but I don't read as often as I should. I become quite goal oriented and move much else into the back seat, as it were, and I too often leave it there untended. 

I think one of the best things about me is that I'm rather unique and different, but that may also be one of the worst things about me, because it does seem to lead to a certain kind of loneliness. I find that kindness is in short supply today, and, as I read in a novel the other day - it was *Leaving Las Vegas* - it's a strange, strange thing that so many choose to treat strangers with contempt rather than kindness. Then again it is true, isn't it, that online one really can't trust others and this distrust breeds, after all, a kind of contempt for the stranger. Nevertheless, I am truly seeking kindness. I try to be kind. I'm becoming kinder. 

If any of these directionless ramblings appeal to you in some way, feel free to reach out and chat. I'm not one of those who posts on here only to vent, though I understand such posts, because, after all, while the probability of meeting someone is slim, posting here still allows me to vent in any case.

3287,_secret_account__,1617465836,2,"I don't really know how else to describe it, but this word keeps popping up in my head. 

I'm 28 and I have one friend who I've known for a very long time, but we have a fairly toxic relationship. Aside from that, I have two people who used to be very good friends (we're still on good terms, but only talk casually and probably see each other once a year).

I also have my parents and brother, but they live hundreds of miles away. And that's it, I just don't speak to anyone else. My work is all from home and the only people I interact with face to face are the concierge people in my building. 

I cycle from feeling relatively okay and pleased about living alone in an apartment I really love, to feeling extremely depressed and ""chronically"" lonely - like it feels at points as if it's hitting some kind of critical level. Like I really just need someone to be with immediately, it feels like I'm so lonely that I can barely stand it.

Typing that out feels sad, but it's the truth. 

I also feel it's entirely my fault. I am on a dating site, and sometimes I post on subs for making friends and I don't have a shortage of responses but I ghost everyone who is interested in me because of my depression (which I feel is caused in large part by being very lonely, so it's very counter-intuitive). I just feel overwhelmed during the first stages of speaking to someone. I talk to them for a while and then I just start feeling like I can't do the small talk, it's hard and I just get this kind of pathetic feeling of ""I just want to skip to the part where we love each other/become best friends"", which is very unhealthy. That has to be born of something psychological, but not sure what causes that exactly.

If it was up to me, everyone who I meet and speak to for more than a few hours (and who got along well with me and vice versa) would just meet up with me immediately and start this creepy intense relationship immediately, where we talk about all the things normal people don't want to talk about with a total stranger. 

I can tell all of this is a sign that I have some issues and tend to attract other people with psychological traumas/issues as well. I'm in therapy, but it's slow-going. I want to feel less lonely immediately, but whenever I make steps towards making that happen, I ruin it for myself (I assume this is some form of self-sabotage, but not sure why).

3294,frozenwildflowers,1617463048,1,"Tw: Sucide and maybe abuse? Idk. 

Do you ever just sit back and realize how truly alone you are? 
I left the entirety of my toxic family in December. Mom, Dad, Step-Parents, sister, grandparents, aunts, uncles. All toxic and gone. Honestly one of the best choices I made. But with it came the promise that I would become a part of my husband's family. Only to realize how little they care about me. I had somehow convinced myself that his mom would become somewhat of a mom to me. I shouldn't have assumed. 

But you must have friends? Nope. 1 friend, singular. Only to be dumped by her about a month ago. We knew each other for 21 years. She decided she needed to focus on herself and our long distance friendship is becoming too much for her. Honestly I'm proud of her. She deserves the world and I would just get in her way. 

Online friends only want one thing. Nudes. They want sex. Oh yes, there is conversation. And that's nice for a while, until the inevitable happens and they send me a shirtless photo. Or the conversation turns flirty. In my darkest and saddest moments. I appease them, just to have someone to talk to. Only to be immediately unfriended after the act. Or unfriended after I tell them that is not what I'm interested in. 
The few that do stick around, I feel do so because they have a moral obligation to thierselves. A need to prove that they are not sex driven. They chat, maybe once a day. Leave me on read. Or engage in chat once every few weeks. I look forward to those messages. 

My husband. Oh he's a tricky one to bring up. I rarely do. He can be so sweet and kind, but I really believe he has some kind of undiagnosed .. something. Autism? That's my best guess. 
He is withdrawn and things need to be his way 100% of the time or it results in a fit. I walk on eggshells wondering if today will be the day he blows up. My oldest daughter (7) idolizes him while my youngest (5) is terrified and I try to shield her from his worst days. 
Don't get my wrong, I don't believe he is abusive. Just undiagnosed and stubborn. He refuses to leave the house, let alone go out to a doctor. 
He does work and bring in income through a job on his computer. 
Honestly, most days I'm scared of him. But I also couldn't see myself without him. 

Actually though. Because I am mentally unstable myself, the government and my doctors have deemed me as disabled. Thats why I could never leave him, I couldn't make it very far on my own and the government would never allow me to have my children on my own. And I can't let them be alone with thier father. Not constantly, he doesn't know how to raise them without yelling.

Also, for selfish reasons, I can't be without my children. I would have committed suicide years ago had they not been in my life. But I would never do that to my girls. They need a mother as much as I need my daughters. I love them with every fiber of my being. They are my actual everything. 

But I'm not a stupid person, I know that all of these people can't all be toxic. They can't all be the problem.  What is the main source of this toxicity? Is it me? The logical conclusion feels like yes. 

But at my core am I toxic? What is it about me that drives people away. I love the earth and growing plants. I waste away my life watching TV and youtube. But if I have an ounce of energy and the weather is good, then I am outside. God I love to be outside. I also try to help people whenever I can. I give money to younger looking couples when I'm at the grocery store and I can hear them putting some groceries back. I remember being there, I remember that feeling of choosing between milk and cereal or cheese and bread. I help spiders find thier forever homes in my garden beds and do my part in saving the bees. 
But I'm lazy. So damn tired and lazy. Unmotivated. Fat. Annoying and talk a lot. I can be so stupid and clumsy.  So unbelievably clumsy. No matter how much I try, I spend money. On everything. I try to say it's for hobbies or for house improvements. But at its core, it's just cause I want it. 
But I feel like I'm missing something, because these don't feel that bad to me. I don't think I'm that bad of a person. I actually think I'm a cute, funny, caring person.

Usually I'm always in a good mood and I don't particularly care about if I have people around me or not but tonight is different. I feel in such a sluggish and despondent mood. I go through my DMs with the chicks who I don't really care for much because I don't really know them they're just attractive, and think, why has messaging you, put me in such a sad state. These women I've messaged I've dreamt about living a full life with unironically, even though I don't know them. I've dreamt the blissful times in bed, late morning with the sun lighting the room as she lay there amongst the sheets, (duck feather sheets to be exact, they puff and feel better on the skin and give a more comfy look) and she looks at me with such loving caring eyes, no words. My heart pounds hard just the thought of being with her. Yet, as I go close to touch I can never quite get to her, she always seems just out of reach. Yet I feel her hair on my face and her breath on my chest. Why. I feel her head on my arm and I can squish her close to my heart, but it never happens, I can feel the sensation, but I can't visualise it, in my dream anyway. When I go to visualise it consciously my heart leaps with a bittersweet rhythm, broken up into two feelings of pure love and sadness. Because I know when I open my eyes I'm the only person there. I remember the times with my ex where I only felt love and full gratitude for this person making just 10 minutes of my life, just laying there pillow talking pure bliss, like life will never feel better than this. My heart in all, content. Don't get me wrong, I love myself, I have quite a bad god complex and I'm happy being by myself, but it's not what my heart wants. I just wish I had someone to save me because all I do is shine bright enough to make everyone else happy, but even when I save some light for myself it just feels hollow and empty. I walked 1200km across my country (745 miles) for charity and to raise awareness for mental health and despite having the support of so many people I had never felt more alone and isolated. Even now when I live with good friends and have so many people around me, even though I prefer to spend my time alone playing video games or skating, I've never felt a worse sensation of loneliness. Sometimes I think that my heart is just overflowing with so much love that I need someone to drain it from me so I don't overflow and sometimes I think maybe I'm just a piece of shit that doesn't deserve that. I just don't want to be alone anymore. I won't make desperate decisions because I know they're bad decisions but holy shit, I'm alone. Maybe this is a call for help, a call to be saved despite being the one that does the saving or maybe it's just attention seeking, the one thing I know is I just want someone to love who will love me just as much back. Someone to lock eyes with across the bed and just have love for them. Someone to hold my head and tell me it'll all be alright when things don't go my way, someone who will let me care for them and give them all the love and affection I can give even if it becomes a little overbearing.

I‚Äôm friends with some people in the group more than others, but they still don‚Äôt invite me to things very often really. There is this one person who I talk to the most, and they invite me to something and they don‚Äôt tell me details, but say ‚Äúoh I forgot you weren‚Äôt in the group chat, here are the details‚Äù. I suspected they had a group chat without me but my heart just sank when they told me. Did they say that just to let me know they had one without me??

I know I don‚Äôt have it as bad as other people here, but it just sucks knowing you only get invited to things out of pity, and aren‚Äôt included by my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù like I think I should. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre bad people, so that leads me to believe I‚Äôm bad at the whole ‚Äúfriend‚Äù thing. I have struggled to make friends so I‚Äôm far from the best at being social. That‚Äôs also another reason I don‚Äôt think I can just up and leave the group. I‚Äôm out of school. I failed school. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing afterwards. I‚Äôm absolutely certain if I leave the group I‚Äôm not going to have any friends at all, because I can‚Äôt just go up and talk to people. 

Sorry if it‚Äôs incoherent in places I sort of just did this in one go but give me some tips or something on what to do about this. Should I confront them?? Idk let me know, and thanks for reading of you did.",lonely,Being the ‚Äúbackground friend‚Äù,2021-04-03 23:28:37
3304,ShEpoxY,1617451718,1,"Hi there! I'm Evelyn!

I'm 35, MtF. PreHRT. PreOP.

I have several mental illnesses. If you aren't patient and understanding about that, feel free to stop reading. =]

Now that's out of the way, I'm looking for friends who are available some days from about 5ish pm to 7ish am CST. In live in Illinois. 

I have varied interests:

(In no particular order)
1. Music - Jonathan Davis, older Linkin Park, 90's (ish) Metallica, Slipknot, Corey Taylor, KoRn, Tech N9ne, most 90's Alternative, HURT, Seether, NIN, Everlast, Fear Factory, Ravel - The list goes on and on.

2. Technology - I built my own system and have a 32tb NAS that doubles as my media server. I love experimenting with tech stuff.

3. Gaming - I love racers and RPGs. I game on PC and Xbox One S. I love retro gaming, mostly NES, SNES, and Genesis. The best game ever made is Illusion of Gaia for SNES. Fight me! -lol-

4. The Furry Fandom - I am a furry right down to the beans on mai pawbs. Hehe. This also means that I casually rp actions in chat. If that's too wierd for you, well....

5. Documentaries - I'm watching documentaries like crazy right nao. Mostly about sports and drug empires. I'm not sure why. Hehe.

I don't want to leave it all out there right off, so we have stuff left to talk about later!

I only have Reddit and Discord. I am not going to join another social network to talk to you. People with discord get preference. -shrugs- Sorry.

Please don't message me if you are:
Religious, use excessive 'txt' speak, use the word 'literally' all the time and/or in the wrong context, are crazy about politics, out for sex, or easily offended. =]

At the same time, I've cut out people and stopped chasing them to hangout or do things. I'm completely off dating and focusing on myself. I've put on a brave face every day and told myself that I am proud of myself, my progress and journey. But, every time I run through Instagram stories, seeing couples / friends out and about on their Saturday nights, I reach a breaking point.

Whilst my mental health has improved, I just feel like I had a friend who I could openly talk to about anything and everything. I caught up with a close friend for dinner tonight, and now I'm in bed, wishing I could've unloaded about how I really feel - which is broken and lonely.

3315,DespondentAsh,1617444013,1,"20m 3rd year college student. My grades were shit last quarter. Probably same this quarter.

I was motivated to write this post after being alone on a Friday night, as I have been for nearly all my adolescent and adult life, while there is a party happening in the apartment adjacent to mine. It did not end until 2:30 am. I stare at the ceiling waiting for the noise to cease.

I am a despicable man. I bear resentment to those around me - those who have friends, lovers, or anything in between. I am bitter. I am envious. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be. I should not care what others do. I should let them be happy.

Evidently, I don‚Äôt have friends. Too often my thoughts dwell on friends I had in the past, yet I doubt I‚Äôve crossed their mind at all. I have not spoken to anyone in months, aside from transactional conversations when buying groceries or things of that sort. I have essentially wasted my college years by not making any friends or memories. 

I‚Äôm sure there are steps to improve this situation. I suppose I am willfully ignorant. I don‚Äôt see the point in anything. Compared to my peers, I‚Äôm terribly behind socially and academically; one could argue that comparison with others is unhealthy, but it‚Äôs hard not to notice.

I don‚Äôt want to be happy, or have a social life, or have a girlfriend, or be mentally stable, I just want to die. Or to be deleted from reality such that I am forgotten by everyone. I‚Äôm pretty forgettable, so just erasing the memory/existence of me from my family will suffice. 

Almost nothing interests me anymore (I realize I am being a bit redundant with this point). The video games I‚Äôve wasted years of my life on - although I now realize are pointless (to me at least) - currently serve to distract myself from the fact that I am a pathetic failure. I only like going to the gym to exercise.

I don‚Äôt want to do anything. Just make it all stop. End the burden of my existence on my family.

That is all I will write for now, perhaps I will add edits later.",lonely,I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore,2021-04-03 21:00:13

I‚Äôve been trying for the past couple of months to find some friends and it‚Äôs so hard. It seems like everyone has their little click or group of friends. I can never find myself to be the puzzle piece to fit into their group.

A few days after I got discharged I was still pretty bummed out about it, so one of my friends shared a quote: 

""Don't give up an entire ocean for a single fish"". 

I'm sure we all heard this at least a million times, and to all the single people who were given this quote, we all know that its impact isn't there anymore. 

I suddenly realised that I didn't treat the girl I fancied like any other fish in the ocean. Rather, she was like the warmest ocean to me. Then it struck me that I didn't feel like I was part of an ocean at all. I felt more like a cloud. 

I'd help her out, watch out for her, shelter her and be there for her whenever she needed me. I'd even cry a million tears for her. 

But what's a million tears to an ocean?

It did not get better these years.

One thing interesting I found out is that in most of social activities you can find in your city or your community, people there are basically looking for a sex partner or relationship and they are like in a hurryÔºåsome guys approached me just to know where they can get in touch with more girls. 

These people already have their ""bros"" since childhood and not interested in getting new ones. Somehow I get bunch of numbers of girls from such activities but never start a relationship with them because I am afraid to let them know that I am a pathetic man with no friends, I can't really be friends with them either cuz they eventually get a boyfriend and it become weird if they still chat with me often.

Speaking of friends, I don‚Äôt even think that I have actually real friends, they will only come or talk to me when they have to or it‚Äôs just boredom strikes hit them then reach out all of a sudden. 

I started to develop liking to someone and I‚Äôm fine if that person likes me as a friend or more than that. The hell am I thinking in the first place? Every one is bored as fuck as well just like I am bored of myself. I get lonely and sometimes, I get the idea that it‚Äôs not meant for me. That perhaps life is not always about finding love and inspiration from the people you want to be with and the likes. Hence, finding the love within myself. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase‚Äî It‚Äôs bullshit in so many ways. Being lonely makes us stronger and wise, but also that is bullshit to me. Being lonely makes us weak and bitter in hindsight.

3345,OddballPersona,1617429275,1,"So it was a small office mixer in celebration of Easter and the long weekend we all have coming up. And it was held at some upscale little club that also had a second level to it so you could look out over a balcony to the street. Some part of me said I should go, mainly because I've worked at this company for two years now and single digit amount of people know who I am, and we're not that big of a company. ""You have to leave your comfort zone"" they said. There was even one girl I knew that had gotten out of a relationship recently I was hoping to chat with and get to know better. Maybe it would go somewhere.

I took a Lyft there and came around the street corner and immediately as soon as I saw people walking in and how busy it was, I shut down and nearly threw up from nervousness. But I had a jacket with a hood on it and threw my head on and I walked down the street a bit to get a better look inside since it just had big open windows you could see all the way in. It just looked...fun. Everyone just looked like they were having a great time. And the music playing was actually good and stuff I like to listen to. Everyone in there looked happy and glad to be there, even the people who came by themselves. Meanwhile, I'm stood on the other side of the street in an alleyway watching the whole thing hoping not to get noticed.

I also did notice the girl I liked walk in with a few co-workers and that was when my urge to actually go over and head in was at its strongest, but my feet still felt like they were in cement shoes and I didn't move, continuing to stand there like some creeper and outcast. I even saw her sitting at the bar by herself, bored out of her mind it seemed, but pretty as she always is.

Eventually I just gave up and walked back around the corner and called for another Lyft to get me and I went home. I threw and broke something off my coffee table out of anger and kicked one of my kitchen cabinets as well. Then I went and sat in my room in complete darkness and silence, thinking about how much I failed.

I just wanted to tell someone about this. Call me whatever you want, I don't really care at this point.

Well for me, it's hard to own up to it. I feel so different and sometimes I am so different. I don't have close friends, I can sometimes go weeks without actually sharing a real conversation. I'm in therapy for social anxiety and depression. Yeah. But how do own it, especially when that's not what you want to be? How do I explain to people I went to a movie alone since I was bored and lonely and after 2 years nothing changed. How do you tell people you didn't go out with friends for almost a year and the last time was you met someone outside and you two kind of clicked.          

How do you tell people that it's hard for you to have meals in public and that you didn't eat lunch in school because of it and how you pretended. What makes it uncomfortable is it still hasn't changed, I've gotten better but the root is there. Maybe they'll ask how I did college alone, I didn't really actually, I just went through the motions, I turned in stuff and showed up, anytime I felt someone would see me or the things I was hiding, I would withdraw, always withdraw and keep the guard up. Weren't you bored? Yeah, I just rode out the painful moments since I didn't know how to change. I did my best, I tried therapy early. How do you own this, without now having the chance to be hurt, in more ways from my vulnerable state. Then it would make sense for me to be closed off and have my walls up. To keep hiding. 

Then there's the bitter part, about how I did this and that and actually did shit and nobody gave a fuck. The part about not understanding why things had  to be so 'different' for 'you'.

I have a phobia of pictures and video chatting, even a phone call is usually too much for me, which is important in modern dating. And being asexual means I'm instantly crossed off a ton of people's list as a possibility.

Because of my childhood neglect I'm a pretty unaffectionate person, which is another mark against me of finding anyone who would put up with me. I feel so broken. I feel unworthy of even being called a human because of how lost and broken I am.

At the end, discovering that i lost all my sexual attraction (if i even had any to begin with) scared me a bit, but right now thinkinh about it i feel relaxed.

Just venting a bit bc i never thought it was possible to actually be single, lonely, and at the same time happy with being lonely. Feeling like a kid discovering something new but hey, it's never too late to learn how to enjoy loneliness (in my humble opinion)!

I was just trying to help her and look out for her, trying to tell her these carts aren‚Äôt going to fix your problems and make you happy.

She made this stupid prank about losing her yknow what to me and I was freaking out cause I had a lot of feelings for her and she knew I did. she kept on playing with my emotions like that and got mad at ME for not taking a joke which was hurtful I even told some my friends about it and they thought it wasn‚Äôt funny at all.

(26, man) I had an absolutely horrible experience going down the mental health, psychiatry, psychology, counselling pipeline so I am not really looking for people to hit me over the head with that.

Does anyone feel like they are going mad when nobody answers their messages?

I really can't take the loneliness no more, I want someone in my life so bad. I moved back in with parents/family 2019 and I have the feeling of having nothing in common with the home city I grew up in. I do not get on well with family at all. With the covid lockdown I got very hyper-critical towards myself over how little I have lived :( I always sorta reluctantly put sex out of my mind, I wouldn't of came out and said but it was because of how withdrawn and how bad my self-esteem was. I have never had, never really had a social life, not really ever been intimate with anyone, never cuddled with anyone, not really had close friends since a teenager, never had a job, I can not remember the last time I ever had a sorta deep one on one contestation with someone. I was in an out of being a University student, failed twice, had eating problems, sorta a disorder growing up till well into my 20's and had health problems that were very confusing here and their that came to nothing. I am conventionally not bad looking, just very slim.

Struggling really bad with stopping the self-criticism.

At the end of 2019 I downloaded tinder and bumble an lasted about a week on them before deleting them out of nerves.

During lockdown I have had my mind racing about all these pathetic things, my confidence has taken lots of knocks but I have realised the necessity to put myself out there more. I happened to get a social media for the first time in my life, I kept checking the news, and good accounts on twitter so I got that. The tinder and bumble I kept downloading them and deleting them after only about 2 days or so because I get far too nervous about dating, even though I really want to.


Just wound up and nervous about intimacy.

Can someone please leave any comments because I really lose it over being withdrawn.

I've just come to the realisation over how touch starved I am and it's weighing on me during all this. Well nervous when things go back to normal for everybody, I think I am finally ready to have a social life.

I struggle really, really bad with avoidant and the rejection feeling hits me bad and struggle to eat, or sleep right. If anyone knows of some form of online support group for like adhd or something similar? that would be really good.

Online friends sorta somehow makes my loneliness worse :(

I was lonely in high school and didn‚Äôt have any friends, but looking back I think to myself ‚ÄúWhat attempts did I make to reach out to people? What did I do to make people want to be friends with me?‚Äù And the answer is that I did nothing. I made NO attempts to make friends. 

-I didn‚Äôt join any clubs

-I didn‚Äôt play any sports(ok I actually had a valid reason for this but that‚Äôs an entirely different conversation lol) 

-I would try to make conversations as short as possible so obviously someone isn‚Äôt going to find talking to me interesting.

I know life for me was too hard and many wonder after knowing me how I'm still alive after going through all that. I think it was that little ray of hope deep inside my heart that someday I will meet someone who will finally know how to treat me right. It just made me get better and stronger with time to survive for that beautiful life I dream of with that somebody I'm looking for.

Alongside my traumatic past, I've also met a few women who promised to treat me better and not hurt me and said they were ""The one"" that I was looking for and they'll treat me right. But sadly they failed to live up to their word as they could afford time to play games or do other least important things but couldn't afford time for me, lied to me most of the time, cheated on me and played with my emotions mentally despite of all that to make me stay in those toxic relationships. I don't know why people want to treat me like a teddy bear/dumpyard to use when they're bored or sad and throw away when they're happy.

All my life, all that I have ever been looking for is someone who would make me feel better. Someone after talking to, I'd no longer feel lonely. Someone who would make me feel better to have her in my life as she understands me, someone who truly wants to treat me right. Someone who holds my hand and says it's going to be okay as she has finally arrived and there's going to be no looking back again as happiness is now. Now with all the beautiful conversations we have about life that light up a smile on our faces and hilarious conversations that make us giggle. Someone with whom I could have those late night cute texts and calls. Someone who makes me cry tears of joy as she melts my heart with her kindness and cuteness and my heart feels like ""OMG where were you all this time?"" Someone I could imagine my whole life with and be like ""Yes She Is the one I someday I want to get on one knee for and ask her hand.""

3417,Agitated-Situation23,1617392976,1,"It's a really weird feeling that i'm having frequently and i wanted to share it with you guys.

But does anyone else feel like when you're at school, at work or any other place where you can ~~pretend to~~ ""socialize"" with people, and so you're chatting with them and even having fun with them sometimes, but then also deep down you're terribly depressed because you perfectly know that if you try to go a little bit further into the relation with them you know that you'll probably gonna get instantly rejected like a piece of trash ? 

And so you're sort of doomed to just stay in those superficial relationships with them instead because you can't have anything better ?

Like every attempt i've made to try and be more close to someone resulted in litteral failure, it really feels people don't really care about each other and are just going at those places to do their own thing and then get the hell out of there as soon as they're finished. And again i don't know, maybe i'm too sensitive to those kind of things, but i find that society is just so cold and individualistic when it comes to that.

And what's even more depressing is the only times people are really gonna reach out to you is when they need something, they are never gonna do it because they want to spend time or have fun with you.

But my guess is that most people probably already have lots of friends and so that could be the reason why they don't even want to bother to try and ""accept"" a stranger like me into their social circle ?

I don't know if those kind of thoughts are common among people like me who spended lots of time in their life alone, but still i would like to have your opinions on that question.

I have no interactions or experiences to talk about, no ambitions and when I find difficulty learning something new I give up

Is hard for me to be interested in small talk too, I don't understand why people talk non stop about stupid things

I do not leave my flat and my daily routine consists of eating, working, bath, cleaning, watching shows, Internet and working at home. I have no distress in my life but neither meaningful joy

My therapists says I sexualised my loneliness to cope with it and that's why I'm addicted to porn, to numb me. I only had 3 sessions through out this year, they are too expensive for me at the moment but intent to have more

I have lost all my friends and making new ones makes me anxious, only talk with work acquaintances for the necessary stuff, I have some close family in this country where I moved and we see each other almost every weekend to eat and drink, we have a good time and the social interaction is nice after not speaking with someone the whole week or weeks

I don't think I'm depressed at all, just resigned to my social ineptitude and used to this loneliness, I have been like this for many many years, this is all I know

I don't want any disruptions in my routine and I'm content and conformed with my uneventful life, though *sometimes* I do want to do some activity outdoors or travel with someone, and have a best friend

I do would love to have a pet but I would have spend more rent in a flat that allow it

I've never been in a REAL/LEGITIMATE relationship, and never been shown what real love feels like. I feel like nobody I know could ever understand me or what I go through.
Isick of ppl saying they understand me while many of them have not been single OR depressed for as half as long as I have been.

Where you don't get the feeling of heartbreak from a breakup, you don't get the pain &amp; betrayal of being cheated on, you don't get the happy memories and emotions from a past or current relationship, YOU. GET. NOTHING.

My brother and I finally told her we have had enough with her holding on to things and not liking my other friends outside of the friend group. She told us to drop her off at Target because she had a ride their (supposedly) so we did and called it a night. 

When I got home one of the other members of the group who my brother was closest to (let‚Äôs call her E) posted to her Snapchat story that K was a true friend and that we act like 5 year olds. We confronted her and she said that it was shitty of us to ‚Äúdump‚Äù K off at target and leave her there stranded...keep in mind K asked us to drop her off so she lied to us and E. So I messaged K saying that what she did was wrong and told her to not contact me anymore. I blocked her and E on social media after trying to work things out with them. 

Now none of the other 4 people in the group talk to me and I have since unfriended them. This has happened before with another group of mine from university back in 2017 (different issues though) so I recently stopped caring if I have friends or not. I currently have 2 good friends left (not from the group of 8) but I don‚Äôt know if I would care or not if they ever were to stop being friends with me. I pretty much just hang out with my brother and it‚Äôs always fun I just get lonely sometimes. I always try to be nice to everyone and be a good friend to those who need it most but it‚Äôs getting harder once more people leave your life. 

Sorry if this was too long of a story but has anyone else gone through similar situations? Like am I part of the problem? Or am I too nice to people and they end up using me and calling me their best friend?? Idk at this point.

I have an illness and as a result i get extremely paranoid, I was happily taking Chlorpromazine for 4 and a half years which stopped psychosis &amp; hallucinations and helped a great deal with my paranoia and delusions. 5 months ago i had 2 very bad back to back violent episodes which resulted in me getting court ordered a new fixed doctor and upped anti psychotics to 300mgs of Clozapine a day and failure to do so will result in being involuntary institutionalised.

I have complained none stop on other posts about my life on this drug so i will keep it to a minimal on this post and just focus on the fact that Clozapine does not stop my paranoia at all which is a very dangerous thing. All the time i was on Chlorpromazine i never stopped taking my meds once. in the last 5 months i'm going patches of not taking antipsycotics at all. I understand at this very minute that i need them in my system but some days i wake up and the thought will not enter my mind.

A few nights ago i flushed 2 and a half weeks of my medication. got paranoid and delusional and went to my best friends, i had an episode at his and things went bad, i wrote a few posts about it in detail but in short i hurt and scared him and he now wont text me back or answer my calls. i was hallucinating and got scared and told my mother i threw the pills away and now she does not trust me at all. These 2 people are the only people i trust 100% and are crucial for me with my illness and have now lost them both.

It's getting really bad again and i can feel stuff happening. Theres a breaking point coming and im going to get myself into trouble so i have been researching schizophrenia with DMT, Hypnotherapy, Weed, Spiritualism, Shamanism and a whole load more but these things are either incredibly dangerous for schizophrenia or are ineffective.

I cannot talk to my doctor or psychiatrist in fear of being admitted to the institute. I flat out refuse to inpatient myself, i know i will carry on skipping my meds off and on.

I saw this woman on the subway escalator, she was in her late twenties, with a kid. I think it was a girl. I don't know what it was about her, but it felt like she saw me too. It felt like she knew what I was thinking, feeling; she felt it too. I would've done anything to just say hi, but I didn't.

I wish I had someone, someone who could understand what I need. I can't tell them what I want, I just can't. I wish they'd figure it out. But they never do. I can barely remember one time when someone said the things that I wanted.

It's like I say words, but they hear something totally different. And they respond in frustrating, upsetting, gross ways. I wish my mother never told me those things, god, I wish she would just stop.

I am not miserable, not right this minute, but I really haven‚Äôt felt truly happy in a longtime either. I‚Äôm no doctor, but early this year I began to think I had seasonal depression, but maybe thats just because Im home so often and cant see my friends. Sometimes I hate the way I look, how much I weigh, or even how my fingers look crooked and my the end of my nose is so unshaped. 
I can‚Äôt really talk to my family about it, my mother is so concerned about my brother in his first year of college who is having terrible anxiety and panic attacks. And my feelings kinda just get ignored and played off as ‚Äústaying in your room all day long‚Äù
Maybe this is normal or maybe its not, but ive never been very comfortable with talking bout my feelings ESPECIALLY to my family. And Im sure my mother would feel terrible if she thought that i couldnt talk to her and my dad and siblings, but even if i could they still probably couldn‚Äôt understand.
Its not like anyone has ever said ‚Äútough it out‚Äù but I think we‚Äôre all (my siblings and I and probably my dad) just abiding by this secret standard that was subtly set at the beginning of time
All that aside, I am always in a hate-love relationship with myself
One day I hate that I have no motivation for anything 
The next I feel better but think im a disgusting bog monster that will probably stay single for a lot longer than any normal person
And although I trust my friends, i feel guilty when i talk too much about myself, give too much random information, and i get worried that they might feel like im forcing conversation even though Im actually invested in what they have to say

I both love myself and I hate myself, forever locked in this never ending cycle of feeling nothing or feeling pain all week long.

3461,DrJohn_2001,1617363486,1,"According to evolution, loneliness existed so that we moved in tribes and packs since that increased the likelihood of our survival. I am sort of referring 'In a Nutshell's video on Loneliness', you can check that out if you haven't already.

I recall the days in my school when I was bullied and ostracized and how I began to stop acknowledging and empathizing with my peers and everyone around me. Anime and video games helped me deafen the world and still get the required seretonin. But now...it's difficult to deafen.

I realize why I am so sensitive to loneliness cuz when I was school, I felt like I was dead. And now that I want to restart my life, the loneliness feels like I am drowning, and then for a moment, I can get my nose out to breathe but then immediately drown more. It almost becomes a harmonic motion where I live in the transient state of alive and dead. At least if you are dead, you don't really care. But my body keeps fighting and its not strong enough to keep its head above the water.

3462,Confused_Ex22,1617362093,1,"Ever since my ex and I broke up about a year ago I have been isolating at home with parents for a while now. I moved so she didn‚Äôt have to. We shared a lot of friends, but for the most part, she was the best one. Obviously that‚Äôs a loss. A year later I‚Äôm doing a lot better, but damn do I still miss her sometimes. I miss the friends I had up there too. The ones we shared.

I don‚Äôt have many friends where I am currently at. And I don‚Äôt drive. For this reason it is hard for me to reconnect with old high school friends and such. Beyond that, my parents insist I practice incredible safety measures that prevented most people from visiting at all. As a result of this, I haven‚Äôt seen anybody for almost 9 months now (towards the beginning of pandemic I did get to reconnect with someone who has since been too busy to make plans and, well, ignores me). 

I see my old friends hanging out all the time on social media. Together. And I just wonder what I did to fuck up ya know. I wish any of them reached out to me with the same enthusiasm I tried to reach out to them with. I wish just once for someone to text me and say ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs been a while, how are you?‚Äù.

I used to have friends who would be so loving and endearing.... and now I have nothing.

I‚Äôve even been talking with imaginary friends but honestly every time I begin to do that I cry because it just amplifies my yearning for connection. Even this is just a cry into a void.

It is definitely comforting knowing that many people around the world are lonely just like I am. But damn. What I wouldn‚Äôt do to sit down at a restaurant and have a fucking conversation with a buddy.

I‚Äôve been alone forever.. I don‚Äôt know why but I haven‚Äôt seemed to have had any feelings about the fact that I am always alone. At least not until recently. I‚Äôm not crying alone in the dark somewhere either. I don‚Äôt feel like I could if I tried. It‚Äôs just lately I‚Äôve been noticing it‚Äôs there, in the back of my mind like a shadow that‚Äôs looming over me constantly. And it‚Äôs seriously getting hard to watch everyone I grew up with falling in love and starting families. 
Starting their future. 
I‚Äôve never had what anyone would call a relationship. I mean not really. I‚Äôve gotten close to girls in the past and even now but.. something is seriously wrong with me. I can‚Äôt seem to connect with anyone. I‚Äôm not ugly or anything, I get compliments but I‚Äôm not what a ‚Äúman‚Äù should look like I guess. I‚Äôm skinny (some would say scrawny) and I‚Äôm awkward and I‚Äôm bad at communicating the way I feel. Bad at communicating over all. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt want things to move forward with anyone I like. I‚Äôm scared they won‚Äôt like me for the way I am. I‚Äôm insecure about my body. I haven‚Äôt been motivated to work out or anything because idk.. 
I‚Äôm a very anxious person. I‚Äôm feeling very anxious and nervous even typing this out for once. But I figure I should put it somewhere. Lately I‚Äôve felt like time is running out or something. Idk it‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs getting harder to sleep without thinking about it. I had found and escape of sorts. I would get super baked and imagine I was in a place where I had what I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs faded and now I just smoke to make things easier I guess. But I know now it‚Äôs just adding to my anxiety and I should probably stop. But I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been smoking weed since I was 17. It feels like it‚Äôs all I have now. That at least I can get high and just try not to think about it. 
Why do I even care I mean I hadn‚Äôt this much before. I mean I‚Äôve gotten this far right. It‚Äôs just I want it so badly. I want to know what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to be with someone. I mean really be with someone. To be with a person and that person be there with you. But it feels so.. exposed. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust someone that much. I feel like as soon as she knows who I really am and what I‚Äôm like she‚Äôll leave. I know it. I mean I can‚Äôt even hang out with the friends I have because all my insecurities start eating at me from the inside out. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm cursed. I‚Äôve never been able to talk to anyone about this and I have a twin brother! I mean wth right? I literally have someone who‚Äôs been with me for my whole existence and I can‚Äôt tell him about any of it. I can‚Äôt tell anyone. I can‚Äôt let anyone know about this when they have their own shit to deal with right. I mean ‚Äúoh so B can‚Äôt get a girlfriend how sad‚Äù. It is sad. 
I don‚Äôt know what love is. I mean I can explain to like an alien who‚Äôs just landed on earth but I don‚Äôt know what it feels like. Maybe I‚Äôm the alien. Feels like it sometimes. Like there‚Äôs no place on this god forsaken planet I can be myself and not worry about what anyone will think of me. You know those posts some guys make on Facebook about how ‚Äúhard it is to be a guy. How we can‚Äôt just let our emotions show and sometimes a guy can feel broken‚Äù? They make me sick. Like you don‚Äôt even know the half of it. I mean you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to feel alone when you‚Äôre surrounded by people who love you. To have no one to cry to and tell you things will be okay because you‚Äôre too scared to even let ANYONE know about how you feel. And I‚Äôm not going around with this potty sob story either.

My birthday is after April Fools day and I feel like a fool. I don‚Äôt see it as an important day other than an ordinary day. I turned 20 but I still feel like an 18 year old. Nothing has really changed in the part two years and I‚Äôm not really progressing a lot. Maybe because I‚Äôm stupid and lazy. Never had a girlfriend and a first kiss (like most of the guys in this subreddit). I‚Äôm only a burden to my parents and they are starting to get annoyed by my lack of productivity and my laziness because of how much of a disappointment I‚Äôam. At this point of my life I should be responsible, independent, have an idea of what I should do with my life, be a competent individual, or just grow up. I feel like I haven‚Äôt grown much. I don‚Äôt really have a lot of friends since I graduated from High School and I stopped talking to my best friend because I‚Äôll just make an excuse that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy‚Äù when I‚Äôm not. To be honest I don‚Äôt see myself living a long life. I expect to have a heart attack or a stroke or an aneurysm in my 30s or 40s because science says that loneliness is equivalent to smoking 15 pack of cigarettes a day. Life right now for me just seems dull and grey. I know other people have it worse than me but that just how I feel now matter how many times people say how lucky I am to be alive or I have everything. I don‚Äôt feel lucky to be alive nor do I think that I deserve anything in this world.

So I have been chatting with someone for three weeks and everything was going well, but they have been dealing with their own mental health issues and recently broke up with their ex.

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell them in a nice and coming from a caring place text message  that I think they need to focus on healing from the breakup and getting on track on track with their mental health before considering talking to new people for intentions of dating.

She had a lot of emotional trauma and told me I was her whole world and that I was her last hope for love.
It terrified me being her only happiness. Especially since she was moving. I got so scared thag we'd grow apart. Like my other relationships in the past. I ended things. Even while I was doing it I wished I could stop myself and was telling myself to take it back and tell her im sorry and that I want to try. After a month or two we started talking again and it led to us talking about missing eachother. I kept thinking about her everyday. We got back together and things seemed to be going great. But apparently I was too clingy now. Too scared to let her go again and she didn't want to hurt my feelings telling me. And because I broke her heart before she didn't feel the same anymore. She eventually let a friend move in with her he was an older guy.
She cheated on me with him for weeks before telling me. We met in person and we cried and laughed together. I forgave her because I wanted her to be happy. Still after everything. I told her that I wanted her to be happy with this new guy and I was so sorry for what I did. Shes suffered a lot in her life and I wanted to forgive her so it would help her conscious because she broke down and begged me to hate her and that she was sorry.

I am a bit complicated as a person, and as much as I like to believe I am looking for that special someone I am not exactly sure how that is going to happen, but you never know right?

First and foremost I am often sleepless and bored, I have been through a lot and maybe it would be nice to have a conversation with someone every now and then. But then again, I am not super social and chatty by nature. I am a reserved person in many ways, and somehow also the most demonic assclown you have ever met.(Yeah I know, I dont even make sense to myself most of the time)

Blargh, there is so much to say but my thumb hurts just thinking about it. Im just gonna throw some random things out there and leave it at that:

I am not easy to categorize or put in a box, frustratingly so.

Been through more than most, and in different ways you might think.

And I am a very dark person by nature, but people seemingly find me hilarious.

I like long walks at night, animals, books, playing music, science and murder people who eat pineapple on pizza.

And in the back of my head I think I convince myself he is interested in me even tho he‚Äôs def not. 

The reason why the romanticizing is a problem is bc I have really bad social anxiety so just knowing I‚Äôm gonna be seeing him gets me really nervous. Like how I usually am x 10 and I‚Äôm already very on edge. On one day he happened to sit near me and I freaked the fuck out like I got that panic feeling in my chest and had to step outside to go to the bathroom. And the worst part is when I blush bc I don‚Äôt want him or anyone to see me nervous. I see him for a class I‚Äôm taking and in the last few days I‚Äôve done nothing bc and I‚Äôve eaten very little cuz I‚Äôm paralyzed with fear. And on top of that I had to take a pill (beta blocker for my social anxiety) to get thru the class. Btw I‚Äôm done with this class I‚Äôm taking so I won‚Äôt be seeing him (except on a few occasions). Anyway I basically couldn‚Äôt function this week all for some dude I don‚Äôt know anything about but apparently decided in my head that he‚Äôs perfect. 

The reason I‚Äôm like this tho is bc I have 0 friends, not very supportive or involved parents/family, no boyfriend, and just no love in my life. No one ever touches me, hugs me or anything. Except my dog. I talk to barely anyone bc of social anxiety. I talk to my mom, my dad and sister very occasionally and that‚Äôs about it. When I was in high school it wasn‚Äôt unusual for me to go the whole day without saying a word to anyone. Actually I don‚Äôt know the last time I‚Äôve had a proper conversation with a stranger lol. It‚Äôs been like that for like seven years at this point. So yeah I‚Äôm fucking desperate at this point and I can‚Äôt help but get excited over small things. I feel like I just said a bunch of things no one cares abt and I‚Äôm just rambling. 

TL; DR: I make out small interactions that don‚Äôt mean anything into more than they actually are bc there‚Äôs very little human interaction in my life and I think fantasizing abt some random dude I met/convincing myself that our interactions were somehow meaningful compensates for the loneliness in my life.",lonely,Anyone else have an issue with overly romanticizing people ?,2021-04-02 12:19:26

My God, I try so hard to give others affection, and only got none in return... its not human.


Vacation wasnt great either, just me alone walking through a bunch of shops just trying to be ‚Äúamong‚Äù people..

Theres this dream i had many years ago as a child, sadly 13 was the apex of my social life... i left for another country and never really socialy recovered..

In this dream i came back to my old school, and was facing an empty playground... not a single soul in sight, i cried and asked ‚Äúwhere is everyone!?‚Äù A faceless man was seated at a bench, he wore a suit, and I cried and pleaded with him

He let me rest my head on his shoulder, and in a very comforting voice he said, ‚Äútheyre all gone David, theyre all gone...‚Äù

I wept, but found peace.

Here  years later, and the man was really right... at 26 as a full grown man, i cant help but cry at how weird this situation is.

Faceless man was right, they are all gone.",lonely,"Came back from vacation, and nobody cared... it was rough coming back to work with people who just dont care.",2021-04-02 12:10:46

3545,daygah,1617315390,1,"I grew up with massive self-esteem issues, and most people could tell which i think is a big part of what made them turn away from me. I've never been popular with girls but when I was seventeen during my last year of high school I had three girls that seemed interested in me. At this point I was fairly good at masking my self-esteem issues, but at the end of the day whenever things would get intimate (emotionnally), the mask would fall off and they would see that there was just a broken child behind it. And there is nothing worse than seeing women lose their interest in you in real time as your speaking to them. Fucking heartbreaking. 

However one of those three girls was still interested in me despite seeing how fucking lame I was, which felt like a god-send. I thought I might actually lose my virginity to this girl. That said, one time she threw a party (which was literrally the first one i had ever been invited to), it was a fun time but there was a moment where i was sitting on the backyard porch with her and a bunch of classmates. At some point she kisses my cheek out of nowhere, and I completely froze. I spent like 5 minutes trying not to have a fucking panic attack because I had no idea how to process what had just happened and she and the whole table could tell: she looked so dissapointed and later pulled me aside to tell me she was sorry about that and she didn't mean to make me uncomfortable. I felt like a fucking idiot and tried to play it off like I didn't even notice but i knew she wasn't buying my shit. After that night she started to distance herself from me and i couldn't even blame her. But also at the time I had hope that this was just one bad experience but i might be able to turn it around. I was wrong. I never got the balls to talk her and she ended up getting a boyfriend and they are still together to this day. I'm happy for her because she was super sweet and she deserves the best and the guy seems really chill, but i can't help but feel like i missed out on something great, and that feeling has been chipping away at me for years.

I'm still a virginand i have realized that im literally incapable of intamicy with a woman in a normal setting. At this point i am strongly considering hiring is sex worker because i am so horny and touch-starved that i could cry.

Okay, now on to the sad shit.
As most of you know by now, I lost one of my best friends to suicide 6 months ago. This wasn‚Äôt my first funeral, or my last. Even in the 6 months since he‚Äôs passed, I‚Äôve been to 2 more funerals. I started writing this song shortly after Zach‚Äôs death. And it took me over 4 months to complete, because every time I tried to write I just broke down. I could only ever write a line or two at a time. And a lot of what I had originally written ended up getting scrapped because the reality is, 4 minutes could never be enough to say everything I want to say. 4 minutes could never be enough to tell you how beautiful of a person Zach truly was, or how much he meant to me. But 4 minutes was all I had, and this is what I ended up with. This song means a lot to me. I didn‚Äôt even use auto tune or hardly any editing on the song at all (aside from a very minimal harmony) because I wanted it to be as real as possible.

Just call a random number, if they answer ""sorry wrong number"", if it goes to voicemail this is where it gets interesting. 
 
    You could say whatever you wanted (within reason), you can word vomit about your personal issues, you can talk to them like they're an old friend and they'll assume you called the wrong number, or you can tell them the truth, that you have no one to talk to and if they don't want to listen they can delete the message. 
   Another option is being upfront, you're aware you are calling an unknown number, you just wanted to talk them up/encourage them to be the kickass people they probably are.  Or Let them know that they are strong just for continuing to exist in this world... really just whatever I think would be helpful or nice to hear for me or people I know.

3582,codecrunchie,1617297873,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 10+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

How it works:

Step 1. Find compatible matches

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

Step 2. Friend requests

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

Why this is awesome:

\- Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.

\- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

What are the questions:

\- more about you

\- age (you have to be 16 or older!)

\- best part of your day

\- gender

\- sexuality

\- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)

\- geographical continent

\- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend

\- type of friendship

\- whether you'd be willing to share pictures

\- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls

\- religious

\- working

\- studying

\- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs

\- whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

Okay woohoo lets do this!

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

Final tips:

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.Extra info:

\- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.

\- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+

\- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.

\- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.

\- Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.

\- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

She said she was down, and even my coworker was saying that she was super excited to go with me. She seemed pretty excited about it over text. I got my hopes up, then I just texted her again to finalize the time and place.

So here's my story.

I've been lonely and friendless for a long long time, basically all my life unless you count those short periods where I did have ""friends"". I hate it but I'm also ""comfortable"" in it.

Before I found this job this year, I had spent months if not years not talking to people daily and getting to know them. I haven't been invited to a party in 7 years or so.

However, I did manage to make ""friends"" at work, I use quotation marks because I'm pretty sure that after a while I won't see them ever again. And I'm supposed to go to a huge party this weekend.

‚ÄúAnd they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.‚Äù

3622,Moderndaoist,1617276186,1,"I'm in my 30s M and have been traveling ever since I left home country for college. I grew up as a single child with my parents, so I already had a sense of loneliness when I was young. The strong feeling of loneliness never left me, and I was depressed during my 20s after I move to new city for work and made some wrong decisions to date the wrong people, just because I don't want to be alone. It always seems to be this dark shadow underneath that even if I do hang out of friends, I felt its temporary, I will be back to being alone.

I don't think other people would perceive me this way because I can deal with people pretty well on the surface, but every day at night it is tough and I'm alone at home (I used to go to Starbucks a lot to work/study to ease the feeling). I'm doing well in my career, stay fit, read, meditate and make sure I take care of myself, and all these help a lot, but none really change that feeling.

Recently I started to think that maybe loneliness is not that uncommon. Social media really portraits a false image on everyone's life. A lot of people back in the old days, who dare to travel and explore, are basically dealing with loneliness for decades.  I remembered old people I saw before that are alone but perfectly happy and fit, even in their 70s. Maybe it's the story that we are telling us is wrong, that gives us the false expectation. I don't know. Of course, it is great to have a large group of family and friends around you, care about you, but maybe it's also okay to be alone.",lonely,Maybe it is OKAY to be alone,2021-04-01 22:23:06

My friend was not that social before and post the pandemic they've been messaging people a lot more. Recently, they like someone and so they seem to be messaging them a lot more too. I don't know how to cope with this because they were the only person I spoke to daily and now talking to them actually hurts me because I can feel a shift of energy. They keep saying I'm overthinking but I can tell when someone is not as interested. I don't want my best friend to see that they're affecting me because honestly they're fine, and they're happy. I feel like I'm losing respect for myself for being so emotional and for wearing my heart on my sleeve in front of them. I want to move on. But I don't really connect with anyone else.

I was able to get over it enough to be around people though, and eventually we got to spending time together for the rest of the time I was going to be up there. Then I left, and I was able to see an old friend of mine. We talked and hung out for a bit but she was having a bad day, so I tried to help her out while I was there.

I don't have any other social media. No Facebook, Instagram, or whatever else ""the kids"" (or even people my age) use nowadays. I abstain for personal reasons. Before the pandemic, it just didn't seem necessary.

But now, after more than a year of isolation, of working from home, being in the house all day every day, not having anyone to talk with...

I don't mean I need praise. I'm not an attention you-know-what.

3652,Whatdeathislike,1617254552,1,"I noticed something recently. I had two friends that I reached out to when I needed help. One was a pro and helped calm me down and had my back. The other tried just as hard and failed and got upset. I love you both still. I want to help the friend that I upset and anyone else thinking of adopting a friend who's going through hard times. Think of me as that otter on the internet who showed the human how to pet them. If you're interested, feel free to read on and thank you. Thank you so much. You really mean the world to you're friend.

First of all you're a really good and caring person which makes it kinda hard to know someone you care about is going through hard times. You feel bad for them. So it's sort of an impulse to say ""Oh no! I hate it when you're sad! Now I'm sad! Please don't cry!"" The thing is, that can make it worse.. Now they're also feeling guilty and thinking maybe they shouldn't come to you with their problems. They might withdraw and feel worse. 

The best way to respond to your friends sadness is to be calm. Let them feel that ""you"" ""reader"" are ok. The world isn't ending even though it feels like that for them. You're calm and strong and they can lean on you. ""It's ok. I'm sorry friend. I know it sucks. I'm here ok? Do you want to talk about it or something totally unrelated? Let me know : ) I love you. It's gonna be ok."" Imagine how you might feel if someone said this to you instead. 

Also offer to just talk about something unrelated. That can help so much. The cool thing is when you do this, you can sometimes distract them from feeling sad. You get them unstuck from all the anxiety inside their head. I've needed this so badly before. Just talk to us. Keep us grounded. Tell us about your day, hit us with some shower thoughts or something. It's all good, I promise. 

When someone is sad, one of the most comforting things is for someone to just be ""there"". Not expecting them to speak, not making them also worry about holding up a conversation. Imagine your friend is sad and just sitting alone in a ball on the floor. For them, in that moment, the kindest thing someone could do is sit down next to them without talking. Suddenly they're not alone and also not being expected to be ""company"". That silence and presence is pure understanding, acceptance and comfort to someone going through mental turmoil. This is what love looks like to us.

It's totally normal to feel like just being there is not enough. You don't have to do much for us right now, trust me, it's enough. It's ok to feel kinda bad. It just means you're a good friend. And if you need us, trust me, for someone who cares about us when we need you, we'll move mountains for you in return.

It's ok not to fix everything. It's usually not a good idea to try. Don't be condescending. Just accept that things suck and our minds tend to bully us sometimes. Don't let our BS weigh you down and just keep being our friend. No pressure.

TLDR:
Stay calm.
Be supportive.
Try not to give them more to worry about.
Be understanding that things do suck. (For the love of God don't say ""It's all in your head."")
Keep your composure and don't make us feel like we're hurting you. It's hard to feel guilty and weak/ a burden on top of everything else.

Anyway, that was a lot but I hope it made sense. It's actually really easy to help a sad friend. Please try it. You'll be saving lives. Thank you so much for reading this.

My entire teenage experience was a forlorn blur. I sat alone at lunch everyday trying to hold back tears from the painful humiliation of the loneliness everyone could see me in. Everyone in the hallways would always walk with their friends. I had to witness so many couples holding hands, which sparked pure hateful jealousy in me. Why them, why do they get to experience love and affection while I rot in loneliness? Class was also miserable. Everyone had their own friends they talked to and laughed.

Hey, this is my first year of highschool and I just can't seem to find any girl i'd date. First off, I don't want to date anyone in my class cause it would be weird if we break up.

I have met someone I just can‚Äôt get away from. She‚Äôs probably the first and only person I care about in that way. For about a year now we‚Äôve had contact, both through digital means like Whatsapp and by meeting (We went/go to the same school). I actually felt like it was going well after spending a lot of time together and chatting more and more. Yet the hard truth that I always try to put aside is that it‚Äôs not mutual. That I won‚Äôt experience the love I feel. That nothing will happen between us. I don‚Äôt even see a reason to tell her my feelings. Maybe she even knows and chooses to ignore it. No matter, because deep down I know that any hopes were/are in vain.

Especially now, as our contact declined for different reasons I won‚Äôt get into here. I am not sure whether I should be happy that I can better distract myself or be sad that there isn‚Äôt even that small sliver of hope left for me to hold on to.

I just can‚Äôt forget. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to distract myself with other things like focusing on work and doing stuff I like, and for these short periods of time I actually feel relieved. But it‚Äôs always there. That feeling of despair and emptiness.

I started to believe that not feeling at all would be better than‚Ä¶ this. But no matter how hard I try to suppress this feeling, it always comes back to me. I guess it‚Äôs just what the human being is; an irrational and emotion-driven being.

3697,3312021throwaway,1617228879,1,"TW: abuse mention, drug mention  


Last year, I was super fuckin stoked! My 21st birthday fell on Saint Patrick's Day. Like it does every other year. Then more and more news came in about COVID, and by the time it was my birthday, everything was shut down. I'm extremely immunocompromised and I'm pretty sure if I get the funny virus, I'll expire, so I was self isolating as best as I could at my parents' house, but my parents were about to go back to in office work after about 2 months. So I moved out. I've been working from home in a shitty ass weird apartment with god fuckingly nosy neighbors.   


Ever since I moved out in June, I thought I was doing better. All the time alone forced me to get more comfortable with myself. I lost 60 pounds, I picked up the guitar and piano again, started learning the bass, enrolled in an online trade school I'm very excited for. But, holy shit. One of my friends was able to quarantine for a week and a half to come and see me back in October, and she just held me while I fuckin' cried for like an hour. I needed it. It was really sweet.

I went through a lot as a kid. People that were supposed to be trusted were emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive toward me. Since I was 11, it was my goal to move out, so Then, I could relax. I have moved out. And my upstairs neighbors are abusive meth heads, and everyone around me is waaay too interested in what I do all day. Also, they think COVID is a hoax! So I have to deal with them trying to get WAY too close to me.   


I just want to calm down. I want to turn survival mode off. I want to feel safe. I want a fucking god damn warm stupid hug. I miss people. I spent my birthday this year watchin Oneyplays and eatin homemade pizza. Fucking. It feels like everything in my life is great, or good enough at least, or at least... It should be. And even though I have tons of friends that I love, so fuckin much, and they check on me pretty frequently, and we do discord movie nights and shit, it's just.   


I need a hug. Hopefully I can get vaccinated soon. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with just... The overwhelming physical loneliness? I got a dog, that's pretty cool, she's great, I love her to death, but. Fuck, man. I'm supposed to be in the prime of my life! The first like, few months of just getting to focus on myself was awesome. But it feels like I've spent the last year in a very cozy prison cell that I sometimes leave to go exercise, trying to distract myself from being alone, and then I come home, hoping I won't be alone, and I am still alone (minus cool dog)

I get it. Codependency is something we should all work on, but we‚Äôre social creatures. Some of us, like me, have been lonely and single our entire lives, completely starved of human connection our whole lives while seeing everyone around us getting into their 2nd 3rd or 6th relationship. 

I can try accepting myself all I want, but at the end of the day the sense of loneliness can be so overwhelming. Won‚Äôt get into too much detail but I never had many friends growing up, was constantly rejected, and being part a minority group in the US has made feeling like I belong a monumental challenge, not to mention the racial discrimination and bullying I had to deal with in school. Getting into the idea of self love has improved my mental health dramatically in the last two years, but there‚Äôs still so much mental anguish from my past that I struggle with, namely never feeling loved by anyone. 

I feel like it‚Äôs generally a lot worse for men than for women, not to say women can‚Äôt have it bad. Our society shames lonely, single men as ‚Äúlosers‚Äù, ‚Äúbeta males‚Äù, ‚Äúsimps‚Äù, ‚Äúincels‚Äù, and the other 10,000 new terms that pop up to put us down every year while single women are celebrated as ‚Äúindependent‚Äù ‚Äústrong‚Äù ‚Äúfree spirited‚Äù and told things like ‚Äúyou go girl! you don‚Äôt need no man!‚Äù 

I understand this is a massive generalization and doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, but a trend I‚Äôve noticed while watching self love content is that a disproportionate amount of the content creators are women and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love their content, but sometimes I have a hard time relating to them or feeling like they even understand my struggles as a cis straight guy. Maybe not my  place to say, but it‚Äôs a big roadblock i‚Äôve come across on my journey.",lonely,Is it just me or am I getting really sick of this ‚Äúyou dont need anyone else if you just love yourself‚Äù-type advice?,2021-04-01 08:31:39

I've been dealing with depression for a long long time, and most people don't take it serious because I'm a teenager or don't understand what it is.
I have very few friends and all of them have either a boy/girlfriend or many other friend, and we'll they go to school. 

I feel like I am being left aside, I know it sound really stupid.
My family thinks I am a burden.
The only thing that stay by my side is my rabbit (honestly I'm not even sure she cares about me, maybe she sees me as a food giver) 
And school... I have school phobia and social anxiety. 
So I tried to find a girlfriend on a dating app, but each time people get scared because of my depression.

convinced myself that im too depressed for school. been going through the motions since like sophomore year of high. it's hard to take 3000 level classes when all you wanna do is cry. don't know how I even made it this far. everything feels just so wrong. can't continue to live like this.

no self esteem
cannot relate anyone around me
have ppl who support me but it's almost like I don't want their support - not good enough
so frustrating
hate my appearance, hate how I interact with ppl, hate the way I think sometimes
it's embarrassing but I feel like I can't fix
talk to myself too much
Ugly
miss my father (never realize watcha got until it's gone)
can't stand my mother (alcoholic, widow, acts like a child)
slowly cutting off all my friends cuz I'm embarrassed and giving up

3727,No-Elderberry-9821,1617210874,1,"I went to my first job. Really hated it. Went to second job. Really loved all the people. But poor management and everyone went one by one. And I grew too affectionate towards my lady manager. I was having a crush on her mid 30s divorced having a daughter. At first look only one thing occured to me. That was she must have attempted suicide or must have gone through shit storm. I had also gone through a small suicidal episode but noone knows. It's gone now. I just instinctively knew this. (I didn't know her backstory at that time). After she went I really started to miss her. I texted her that she was my crush in a meme. I started texting her movie recommendations without her asking. Showed her how I placed my helmet near hers.(we both had the same brand). I cringed her I guess. She started to ignore my messages. In an attempt to make her text back. I pressed a button, an offensive meme. She blocked me. I apologized to her through a friend. Then she faded away and I faded everyone from that office. They have all gone sperate ways too. That friend who helped me apologize I have faded her too. I am horny too sometimes. Couldn't think straight most of the times nowadays. Covid and No job came back yo hometown living with parents. Always watching porn. No friends in town. Just lonely as fuck. I talk to parents not that much.  I was a closed person. I tried to open up and a punch, bang and I am closed to an eternity now. Getting drawn into GFD and stuff.Too tired with starting a normal chat with girls. Searched for online sexting partner. No luck. This is just like the Hawkeye meme. Don't give me hope.

My ex gf was very sweet and pretty but after 5 years we just had too many issues.  Distance, kids, etc.

I find myself now lost, lonely,  and just plain depressed.

I make good money, good job, nice home. but i am not considered an attractive man. 

I have been trying dating apps with not so good results.  And i think it is pushing me into a deeper depression.

I feel desperate and lonely and I hate feeling this way.   

I don‚Äôt live near family and my friends are mostly just co workers.  

My kids are nearly out of the house and I should be enjoying this time of my life but I am not.  

Im starting to wonder if any if this is worth it anymore and that scares me.

I workout 4 days a week and i feel im getting there in terms if my health.  It helps with stress and anxiety but not the sheer loneliness.

I know there are others out there and I guess Im just looking for some hope or inspiration.
