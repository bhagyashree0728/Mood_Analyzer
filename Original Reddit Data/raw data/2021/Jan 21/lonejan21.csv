Nothing ever lasts. My experience with friendship or any sort of involvement with people has never been truly meaningful, and at least when it was, it never really lasted.

Currently just having a terrible time so I need to get some things off my chest. I am currently a college student and will graduate this May but my one of my roommates and my best friend already graduated and accepted a job in a different city and will be moving out and leaving in 2 weeks. 
I have always had social anxiety and have been diagnosed with anxiety and this friend has always helped me thru things and pushes me to actually go out of my comfort zone. I’ve known them since I was born practically and this will be the first time in 23 years that we won’t have the ability to just call each other up and see a movie, hangout or all that other stuff.
We love all the same movies, games, tv and they are just a constant way for me to talk about all the things we enjoy together.

28,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1612078765,1,"Hi there! I'm a 31 M from the Midwest. To be upfront, I'm looking for a friendship first. So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships. But this pandemic has changed the landscape and I've considered exploring the online route. 

What I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens. 

Some of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

41,daisyshire,1612074055,1,"You know how some people say they have “no friends” but actually have quite a few friends? And I mean actual friends, not acquaintances. Well, I’d say I have one friend...Or, at least I think I do. I consider them to be my friend but I’m not sure if they consider me one. 

Having one friend can be difficult sometimes, especially if you don’t know if you are their friend or if they’re just yours. (And yes, there is a difference.) I think the worst part about it for me is the realization. When I actually sit and realize I only have one *maybe* friend. 

If they *are* my friend then I must really annoy them because I’m talking to them 24/7. If they *aren’t* my friend, well, that freaking sucks because that means I don’t have any friends. Not having any friends means I’m talking to myself every waking minute because I’m too shy to talk to anyone else. It means I’m trying to find the joy in eating by myself *all the time*. It means I’m still cherishing the interaction between myself and the 79yr old cashier at Trader Joe’s. It means I’m constantly chatting with the sun and venting to the flowers. 

But it also means I often feel like I’m incapable of maintaining a friendship, or that I smother people. Or maybe that I overtalk when I get excited and people do not like that. It means I sometimes feel afraid that I’m not good at friendships, I don’t nurture them like I should or maybe I over nurture them like I over water my plants. 

And all of that can make me sad and it sometimes does. I think the worst part about it is the *realization* that I might just be on this earth to be a loner or a person who just gives. To give love, to be a friend, to have positive interactions with people, to be that smiling face for someone else. Perhaps I am only meant to be a giver, which I guess, is okay or at least it will be if that’s my purpose.

I’ve since seen doctors, went to the hospital got a diagnosis, and put on medicine as well as take it. The one thing that got me though is telling myself once I hit the real world all of this stupid shit is squashed and dead but I don’t think it is sadly Iam 26 now and I don’t know why but this young couple was in front of me at the store and I HATED IT for some reason, I want a relationship not only for sex but I just miss the touch of another persons hand, the hug of love and acceptance, just feeling wanted and I mattered, the embrace of somebody who knows me, loves me, accepts me for me, and who just enjoys being in my presence. When I saw that right in front of me I just wanted to smash that guys head into the wall and storm off I didn’t though I waited paid for my stuff and left, I never really liked seeing it I more often then anything hated the gifts I always thought “good for y’all being together go celebrate and fuck each other already just not in front of me you assholes buying a fuck’n six foot teddy bear fuck’n GO !

  So incredibly lonely.

But depression sets me back
I have no energy 
Breathing is exhausting 
So the thought of th3 same small talk ""what do you do, where are you from"" its beyond exhausting.. and all for what ? To realize in the end we want different things? Because people care more about a quick fuck vs falling in love ? Or if they want to love they don't believe in marriage? Or don't want a family ...

So in the end I breathe .. find the God forsaken energy to small talk .. get to know someone and end up here again ? But this time the weight on my chest is even heavier because I know ill be alone ? So I dont try . If you're a nice guy ill most likely stop the conversation once the small talk starts, if you're a dirt bag ill probably send u my onlyfans link because if all im seen as is a quick fuck then I should make a buck .

74,Essaya90,1612059168,1,"I've (30m) had social anxiety all my life so I'm always shy and quiet. I've always done things mostly by myself. The few friends I did have over the years we have gradually drifted apart. I work full time, and spend my evenings and weekends at home, gaming, watching tv, painting or changing lights out in my new house.

I dated a girl for a few months at the beginning of 2020. Due to distance we ended it and it wasnt too bad, I think the distance helped. I dated another girl from Nov until a couple of weeks ago. We were talking again for a few days this week, and now shes ghosting me again since Thursday. I'm not sure if she just doesnt want anything to do with me, or she has rough stuff going on right now, as she claims she does ghost when she hits hard times. But she used ghosting as a main way to break up with me earlier this month also.

I wasnt in love with her, but I could see it happening if we stayed together. We got on really well, and could text all day, talk for hours, etc. For me with social anxiety, theres not many people like that that I can be that open with. Shes super easy to get on with. I really miss talking to her and being friends, and I do miss the affection and cuddles and stuff too.

I rejoined dating sites but I'm sure you all know what they can be like, especially in a small city of 16,000 people. It doesnt take long to finish swiping and not match with anyone.

I'm trapped between trying to remain friends with my ex, and try and be there for her if she is going through a bad time, or trying to tell myself to say screw it, shes messing with me again, and just walk away. But I know that will be really tough. I think tonight I'm going to send her a message saying to unfriend me on FB if she doesnt want to talk to me anymore, if not, I'll be here for her when shes ready. Then maybe I'll atleast know what to do, if she even reads my messages right now.

I have no friends. My workplace and what I do for a living isnt something you make friends at. I dont have hobbies that involve meeting people. Theres not a lot of activities in my community to meet people, especially not with Covid right now.

She was attracted to my humor and it all started because some guy on our team said it was hard to get me to smile or laugh. I was surprised she was so into me. She became insanely obsessed with me (Which faded and she left). Like every detail about me she was pointing out. The crow's feet in the outer corner of my eyes when I smiled. The pitches in my voice that she began to hear more of while I started opening up to her. All of my facial expressions. She hauled off and made out with me and said I love you 1st and all of that. She was my 1st everything and that I'll never forget. We constantly had intimate sex. She was surprised that I wanted to be with her at 1st too. But somewhere in there, somehow she realized she didn't want to be with me anymore. Just completely lost her attraction to me somehow. I became upset and it seemed like she was ghosting me. So I begged her not to ghost me and to just tell me her intentions now rather than later. She didn't want to hurt my feelings, so she probably lied to me about the reason for leaving. Idk if I'll never find a relationship again. I hate my awkward, anxiety induced self. Now some acquaintances from work try to get me to talk to women, but you know what happens when I fkn try?

Precursor: I'm in a shit mood. I'm angry and sad and depressed and on the verge of crying at work when I just want to go home and drink until I fall asleep so I don't feel anything anymore. (Not tw: suicidal, I just want to stop the feelings I'm having at present.) People reading this will judge me and I've accepted that I'm not the greatest person due to my choices, but there are shit reasons why I made them. 

Precontext: 
Part 1: Married for near ten years. Husband (H) is a recovering addict who hasn't fully relapsed since before we met, but it's made our lives a living hell and he's had a few close calls that made me give ultimatums of getting his shit together or watch me and our kids leave. He's not the sappy type. He's the worst nightmare of the love languages book because he doesn't do any of them. There are a lot of times where I feel like I have a roommate not a husband. I've been open about these feelings with him and he says he hears it but does nothing. We work together (but in different depts), so we're in the same general vicinity most of the time, but never spend real time together there or at home afterwards, despite my attempts. 

Part 2: I've been a shitty wife. In that I allowed a flirtation at work with a co-worker (M) to evolve to an affair. He's married, but in an open marriage. The wife knows about me and supports his choice. My husband obviously doesn't know about this. I've made the mistake of letting myself get attached because he has given me the attention I was lacking. The unfortunate part is we're sneaking around doing it during work because we realistically don't have the opportunity to see each other outside of work hours most of the time. 

I was supposed to see M today for a weekend project we'd both been planning on. I allowed myself to get excited and I took time in dolling up because I knew I was going to see him. We were going to have time alone where we didn't have to be sneaky. But something came up and now I'm mad that I allowed myself to get excited about having a moment to enjoy that got shat on. I'm mad that I tried to spend time with H last night and he was standoffish. I feel angry that I'm trying to be present in two separate relationships and I feel like I'm not wanted in either right now. I'm angrier that I only let myself sneak around with M because I feel so unwanted with H. 

I'm tired of not being enough for someone to fight for me. I'm tired of being 'good enough to have around' in my marriage and when the time works out with M.

123,Appropriate-Extent68,1612028670,2,"21M. Ever since I can remember, I've been very introverted, solitary, and shy. I went to a small grade school (class size &lt;20), so I always managed to have a few good friends; one or two of whom I would consider my ""best friends"" at the time. 


I never really felt respected by my main best friend in grade school. It was the typical situation where they made it very clear that they couldn't care less if the friendship ended, and they often would threaten to stop being friends with me, stop inviting me over, etc. over small things like deciding who has to use the controller with the broken buttons. Tbh, I think him always making it clear I was the ""lesser"" one fucked with my confidence a bit from a young age. 


We eventually fell out, and I found a new ""best friend"". I was friends with him throughout all of high school, and it was more of the same, at least in regards to him making it clear that the friendship, as well as my social life (since he knew that he was the only one I socialized with), was at his mercy. I eventually got tired of it and cut him off the summer after senior year. However, that decision, along with my ex girlfriend breaking up with me around the same time, left me walking into adulthood with no friends. 


I went to my local university for a period of time, and I didn't make any friends there either. To be honest, I never really made an effort to talk to anyone. I'm not sure if there's a more specific word for this feeling (other than ""rejection""), but I hate the sensation you get when you put yourself out there, end up getting rejected, and you feel ""taken aback"". I hate seeing it happen to other people too, like when someone is happy about something, tells someone else, the other person responds in a negative way, and you just see the happiness drain from the person immediately. Because of this (and, yes, I know I need to get over it), I typically avoid trying to strike up a conversation with anyone. I suppose I'm a little on the sensitive side, granted I don't show it, so I can't take it in stride like most people do. 


I've worked a couple of jobs since leaving high school, and I honestly made more enemies than friends. To make a long story short, I basically ended up getting into three different confrontations over the course of working both (shitty) jobs due to different guys (all much older than me) attempting (key word) to bully me or harass me. One ended with a full-blown screaming match, one guy getting between us, me trying to get around him, all the while I'm yelling at him to ""Shut the fuck up"". 


That leads me to now. I'm almost done with my degree, so I'll be starting a career (if I'm lucky enough to get a job) relatively soon. I have one friend who I met at my previous job. I haven't seen him in person for over a year, but we do keep in touch regularly. I've invited him over many times and chilled, but he's never reciprocated. All he wants to do is aimlessly ride around in my car, and I've already told him I don't want to drive forty minutes to where lives, pick him up, drive around, waste a ton of gas in the process, and go home. He's possibly on the spectrum (at least, he said his parents mentioned something about him having it), so it's difficult for him to understand social cues. 


I'm exactly sure how I'm supposed to make friends? I've obviously talked to different people at my previous jobs and stint at my local university, but I never really found anyone I could connect with. I'm never comfortable in public, so I resort to being pretty quiet and monotone. Along with that, I'm pretty solitary, I can't drink alcohol anymore (due to a stomach condition), and I don't really like going out anywhere, which is basically the polar opposite of most people my age. I do have a lot of hobbies and interests, but none of them are really things you go out and do. I know people say it gets harder to make friends as you get older, and I feel like it's only going to get harder for me once I start an actual career.",lonely,Anyone else feel like they're too weird to make friends?,2021-01-31 04:44:30

Ever since, I dreamed of having a happy family on my own, because if theres something that I love the most, is being nice to people, understand their point of view and look for a way to co-exist. But everyone here knows that this is impossible.

I've been in some few relationships, but every one of them ended in disaster: being cheated more than once, not giving gifts enough, not having enough money, or enough time, or not being more interesting than the new guy on the college. As much as I wanted them to be happy, even after the breakup, they all wish me go to go hell or worse if someone mention my name.

I play a MMORPG regularly called Final Fantasy XIV, I run a casual guild full of people who work all day or study in college and get some time to play a little, like myself. Then depression kicks in and I dont feel like doing all the amazing stuff the game has, and I dont feel like doing anything at all.

Some girl of the guild yelled at me, saying that shes tired of calling for my personal attention or something. I felt bad cause I didnt noticed anything, and said that I was sorry... But, maybe its for the best, all my experiences showed that I'm a horrible person of some kind.

I tried to explain to her that, if we get close, my image would be of something really bad, and I dont want to hurt anyone. She replied: ""What image? You dont have any!""

Well fast forward two years and I still hadn't found anyone, and to make it even worse, the pandemic hit, which eliminated any remaining chance I had.

Now I'm about to graduate at the end of this semester and I get to enter the real world just to grind for eight hours a day with no chance of finding love since I won't get to be around anyone young.

It's not like I haven't tried - I've fallen in love twice, but failed to get to the point of having a relationship in both cases. It's the worst feeling in the world to have your heart broken without ever even being in a relationship.

 It's not like I'm unattractive either - I've had girls show interest in me on multiple occasions, but they always seem to lose interest after a few weeks. It doesn't help with how shallow and sex obsessed most people have become.

Is it too much to ask just to be loved? I know I have a lot to offer someone in a relationship, and I know that they could make me happy too. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong anymore.

I’m just tired of trying to figure out people’s intentions. I’ve had someone befriend me on here then they told me about another social media app only to force their unwanted sexual advances and desires onto me which eventually lead to me blocking them. It sucks because I THOUGHT this person was different but apparently not. I just don’t want to be vunerable and then be taken advantage of.

My best friend thinks I should be meeting guys IRL but I think I find a certain element of “safety” by making connections with people I’m not likely to meet in person. 

I love feeling butterflies when my phone alerts me to a message from the guy. I’ll also find myself going through past messages in the hopes that I can find a sign that they may be into me too.

I’ve made three connections in the past year on three separate occasions, all of which have resulted in me developing feelings. The first I admitted my feelings for and they responded saying they felt the same before ghosting me weeks later. I haven’t admitted my feelings for the other two guys because I’m scared of rejection. The second guy I feel like I fell hard for but now it feels like he’s been “bread crumbing” me and the third I’m still in contact with but the communication is dying down (naturally).

158,bibyebitch,1612001983,1,"I am introvert with pretty intense social anxiety.  Just before covid hit, I was really starting to overcome and cope with my social anxiety in healthier ways. I was starting to be happy with myself, and truly, I believe I am happy with myself. I have mostly online friends, or friends I met in person but are now long distance friends due to going to different schools. For the most part, I've kept in touch with these people and my family, but after conversations or phone calls I just can't help but feeling more lonely than I was when I joined. I haven't hung out with any friends in person since late February, so.. almost a year. Typically, I was the type of person to socialize with a friend or friends outside of work/school about once a month and I liked it that way, but again I remember that feeling of even more intense loneliness when it was over. I feel like no matter how good of a friend someone is, I always still feel some lack of connection, or like, I am not their best friend if they are mine. Always the friend on grass when the group is on the sidewalk, or the one in the back in an odd group. I feel as though every friend group I've ever been in, I become the laughing stock, the one that shouldn't be happy. I find it so hard to feel complete.  

I'm currently talking to someone (in a romantic sense, I think.. I hope) that will be attending the school I am in the fall and for awhile, I felt fulfilled with that. We are flirting pretty hardcore, (I know they are interested.. but I say ""I think, I hope"" because I have been lead on and let down so many times before, it's so hard to let myself think this will actually turn into something real.) But now, when we get off a call, I feel the same empty, lonely feeling. I just don't know how to escape this feeling of perpetual loneliness, even when I shouldn't be. Of course, being touch starved doesn't help.. but even when I've had physical relationships, mind it has been quite some time, I always desired them.. yet felt too awkward for them to even see that way or for them to touch me too. I know this isn't the case, and genuinely, I love myself. I'm a motivated person, I exercise almost daily and have plans for the future that I don't need to fit anyone else into for fulfillment. I wonder if next time I'm with someone, things will be different and I've just been with the wrong people, or if I'm doomed to feel that way always and it's something I have to work to overcome in some capacity. 

I know often these feelings can do with have low self esteem, but I've been working for years against my low self esteem. As I said, I love a lot of things about me and am typically fairly content being alone, I think I'm awesome and I know if the situation came about where someone I really liked got to truly know me and have a genuine connection, we'd both be so happy. I guess I thought my constant loneliness and social isolation would go away slowly as I solved my inner issues. But that constant pang in my heart and soul of just knowing I could be happier and just feeling like I will never get all the way there because of something missing in me, my social anxiety, my awkwardness or god knows what. The constant feeling that I am incapable of anything that will truly make me undoubtedly happy, even if it does make me happy in some sense. I can't help but feel like everything (friendship, relationship, connection of any sort) I've ever been in is always just SO close to being enough, but instead it feels like a knock-off... leaving me feeling empty and even more lonely than I was when it began. I know this is a rather long rant, but if you read all of it, thank you, it really made me feel better to put it into words and knowing someone might read all this is a huge help. I'd like to know if you relate to this in any sense or if you have any advice for overcoming this perpetual and chronic lonely feeling that always seems to hold back any sense of relaxation or happiness from being its fullest potential.",lonely,Chronic Loneliness or Extended Rough Patch?

I don't expect anyone to respond, but I guess it feels better than typing it out in a notepad that will be deleted almost immediately afterwards. Sorry if this is long, skip if you want to read something even remotely interesting.

I used to have friends. Kind of. Internet friends with whom I'd talk to nearly every second of every day. I don't know if I liked them much or if they even liked me at all, but it felt nice to have messages to wake up to.

I feel like I desperately want friends, but I also think I just want to stop feeling so sad. I don't even like people and I prefer to be alone. But I'm still lonely. Or maybe I just tell myself I don't like them because no one actually likes me lol. I know my family loves me, but I'm fairly certain even they don't actually ""like"" me. I don't socialize with anyone aside from them and it makes me feel lonely as hell. Then again, I was lonely even when I had a ""reliable"" internet friend group. I tried to get in touch with them recently, but everyone was older and different and didn't seem very interested.

I could go out or something. Maybe go to church, or get a job. Snatch up some friends and bazinga! Problem solved. But I'm pretty much incapable of actual socialization with real people (aside from my family, but it gets weird even with them) at this point. Like I'm just socially an absolute moron. I'm probably too stupid and immature to even handle a real job. I'm already 16 and I still feel like a toddler. I probably have the intellect of one.

But there's always the internet! I can text people and no one will know how socially inept I actually am! Ha, funny. I don't know how to make friends like I did when I was but a wee child. Now I just put up this persona and act like an uninterested asshole no one would want to hold a conversation with for longer than a minute. I start acting like the exact kind of people who I dislike speaking with and it feels like it's not even a choice. The way I'm typing right now doesn't even feel genuine, but at least it's not like ""bruhh k whatever 😤😓😤😓🤑😓🤑🤑😔🤑😔🙃""

I'm ill and I will need to have a major surgery that may possibly remove parts of my reproductive system. Depending how bad it is, I may not be able to have kids and go into an early menopause in my life. I am 21. 

The one person I need more than ever doesn't care about me anymore. I broke up with my ex a few months ago and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. We cried together for two hours that day and didn't want to give each other up. He was my best friend for so long. I can't blame him for trying to heal and move on, but I resent him for not being there for me anymore. I feel like he only valued me when we were a couple and that he doesn't care about me as a friend or a person.

Yeah well now im all grown up in my early mid-20s as a loser lonely men and is pretty much game-over, is impossible to somehow overcome my social awkardness and extreme anxiety, almost 25 years of being autistic and shy having 0 social experiences, no woman will ever want me because im not confident, im inexperience, i dont even know how to kiss, so what now? Im just on a self-destructing behavior, i never finished high school because of my anxiety i just went walking around the block alone never went to class, i dont talk to mt family nor do i have friends besides 1 loser like me but we barelly chill, i dont know his family nor does he know mine even tho we live in th same block.

but also is not only my fault or my mental illness faults, is You too, all the bullying, the sexual abuse, the neglect, toxic masculnity is real and i was hurt becauze of it, but it aint a man vs woman thing, you guys are a political agenda pushing garbage, you dont care about oppressed people.

As far as i remember girls were just as much part of it then male bullies, they just encouraged it, laughted at me, made me feel ugly, joked thst they were into me to make fun of me even sexualy haressed me because i was one of the only guys who never hitted on them because i was shy and not that interested in sex.
The emasculation was way worse than getting punched in the face, and it just destroyed my personality, my will to grow up, to enjoy life as it is.

I have trouble joining communities. If you are reading this, you might too. This isn't an advice post, because... well... I don't really know any advice beyond ""Just do it."" Ha ha!  
It's more of just a thing I have to get off my chest right now because I feel super depressed about it.

I haven't really fit in since grade school, and I didn't super fit in there either. The thing about grade school is that at least everybody is so fucking weird that nobody cares that much. But then I moved to a new town and I liked comics instead of sports, so that was that. My anxiety and depression came on in full force, and it never recovered.  
Finally, after a couple years of college, I started to connect with some people. Then I moved in with some very outgoing, socially popular people and lived in a party house for a bit. I started playing weird music for weird music people and they really liked it. It was pretty fun! I wasn't the closest with people but I went to a lot of parties and knew enough of people for them to say hello on the streets.

Did I feel lonely? Absolutely. Was I fully immersed in a community? No, never. Just sitting on the edges, but having an okay time. I missed a lot of connections that were right in front of me. Just didn't know how to seal the deal. Didn't know quite how to get a lifetime friendship or romance the people I really wanted to. But it was okay.

But then I found somebody I thought was the person of my dreams. We had so much in common. Unfortunately mental illness was one of them. We triggered the worst in each other and eventually I had a full on breakdown. I got out of there. My life crashed and burned.

So now I don't have friends. I don't do the art which made me really, genuinely happy. I have nobody to blame but myself for this.  
I've done therapy. I've gone through meditation. I try to be a better person than before. Don't drink in large quantities, or use alcohol to calm my nerves. And that stuff is good, I guess. It's better for me, personally, though I do miss the fun and excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, now I feel too old to join a community. I go on internet forums sometimes and look around and there are all these people interacting. I think, what's it like? Could I slide in? But I don't. The rules seem hard. I think to myself that anything I do will probably get lost in the shuffle anyway, so what's the point. So mostly I just sit in my bedroom, feeling depressed and lonely. Trying to get the attention span to watch movies.  
I even thought about posting a nude picture to a ""normalnudes"" reddit, but then was like... This is mostly for hot women to post on. That is probably screaming into the either and will probably make me feel worse about my appearance and myself.  
I just dunno what I can do.

Every connection I make is very surface level. My roommate and I don't talk to each other because she is even less outgoing than I am. Basically I'm alone and lonely all the time and I wish I had someone that I could just casually hang out with, without feeling like a burden/nuisance. I feel like I'm missing out on my college experience because I don't have friends.

What's worse is that there's no one I can vent to about all of this. I am apparently incapable of being vulnerable so even when I am falling apart I won't tell anyone. I feel like I have become disconnected from my hometown friends too. I want to reach out and I know a few of them would be willing to listen but at this point, I am so consumed by loneliness that if I were to talk to one of them I wouldn't be able to have any other normal conversation while my mind only thinks about how much I'm struggling. Is this selfish?

The second-most likely outcome is that your situation will be intentionally made worse. That's right, you have a better chance of some asshole coming along to try and push you to your death than you do getting help on r/suicidewatch.

What about the moderators? Shouldn't they be handling this? Well, the moderators don't really seem interested. When people come forward with concerns about the hotline, the comments tend to tell them not to use the hotline, and the moderators don't care to disagree. Your suicidal plea for help met with nothing but ""boohoo""? The moderators seem fine with that.

Rewind. About a year ago I m(22) was at my peak self-destruction, exhibiting all the symptoms of a depressive alcoholic + significant drug use. I was in my (second to) last semester of college and things were just getting out of control, and it seemed like none of my friends were concerned or even recognized this issue-although I did make effort to hide stuff/play it down. Any-who I landed myself in the psychward, went to a program, took time off school, and then went back feeling good! I got over the hump after detoxing and really focusing on my mental health, which made it easier to ignore/beat cravings etc. 

But then my sphere and I graduated and are scattered thin across our respective state. I decided to move in with some closer friends in a new city which is going great, but I've been having an intensely difficult time socializing with newer people. I choke on my words and feel under pressure every time I try to start a conversation. I dread that moment when I randomly end up next to one person alone and I just trap myself in my head. Its worse when everyone's drinking too (addiction wise I'm fine around alcohol and whatnot, really!) but from a social perspective It feels like i was kicked out of a club but am allowed to peer through the fence at everyone. 

I don't like how this creates an empty feeling inside. I feel broken and alone because every time someone new figures out my deal I can see their faces change as they think about how to approach me, like I'm broken. It just spirals and I feel sorta just there sometimes and it sucks.

Well 2 days ago I made a joke out of his comment ( which I thought that it wasn't hurting anyone) and he left the discord call saying that he can't listen to me anymore . I messaged him and he basically told me that he can't stand me anymore. I told him to msg me when he wants to but he said that he wont.   
I honestly don't know how I feel because I've been high for the last 2 days because I'm scared to face my emotions. I guess that I am alone once again.

254,MugWithHotChocolate,1611944052,1,"during kindergarten and up to 3rd grade i was a social kid that always hung out with people both during at school and outside of it. but when i switched schools and soon enough hit puberty, something shifted. i became supershy, and was afraid to make new friends. i was never bullied or made fun of, but i remember saying to my teacher that i felt invisible. i made two friends that stayed with me during middle school and half of high school (until last year when one of them suddenly stopped talking to me). 

when i started 10th grade at my new school, i wanted to start with a brand new canvas and finally get my shit together. i was optimistic at first about my new class (the last one i had was crap) and that showed in my academic performance. i was active during lessons and always initiated convos. but then i noticed how everybody in my class always hung out with each other outside of school. the more popular girls hung out with each other, and the more “lowkey” girls with each other. while i get along with them at school and they claim to appreciate my presence, they have never asked me if i wanted to join or anything. i’m basically a filler classmate. like yeah, a convo with me is ok, but anything below surface level is too much. i have no idea what to do. i tried making myself as approchable and kind as possible, but i feel like these ppl want something i simply don’t have",lonely,never seeing the light,2021-01-30 05:14:12

277,frik4nd3lbr00dj3,1611924703,1,"It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) **(private message isn't the same as chat message!).** The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

**!link**: Links chats between two users.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: What would this do…

**!changelog**: Why would you care about this?

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to.

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**",lonely,My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖,2021-01-29 23:51:43

I miss the telltale dip of a mattress followed by the heat of a lovers embrace. The rhythm of breath, the lub dub of a heart, the rumble of a familiar voice heard as my head rests on a warm and inviting chest. Laughter. Lips. Love. Ecstasy. Enmeshed lives, shared futures.

I hate the loneliness of it all. I have a good relationship with my friends but they’ve all got their lives to attend to. I’m still gonna be in schooling for years and years.

Was never the best student so I tried to make up for it in college by never going out to parties or making new friends. Just come home and study for 4 years.

I’ll never get to date. Never sexually experiment. Never get the girls I want because of my ethnicity and height. 

Life feels like a big joke. And it feels like if I was white I wouldn’t be lonely. Which is racist as fuck but it feels true. Most of my friends are fatter and have way worse socioeconomic standings than I do, but aren’t a kissless touchless like I am, simply because they’re white or tall.

I know that everybody is accepted here, so I might as well throw it out that I'm a white male.

I am lonely. I try to write, but recently it is hard to find joy in storytelling, as it is most things. I am taking a creative writing course this semester, but it is hard to focus on it or any of my other classes. I want to go to the library, but they're all closed for the pandemic.

What are things I can do to help? Are there any platonic chatrooms or the like I can use? I'm not sure how to use Reddit, but I see it has a chat feature. The thing is, I am so unsocialized that I am a little afraid to talk to people, though I want to form connections so badly.

I've been trying online dating for a couple of years now on and off hoping that at least I'd meet someone. I haven't had a lot of success...

I got this realisation during one of their fights, while I was reminiscing about a heated conversation I had with a fellow redditor trying to help me, while I disrespected his father who is suffering from a serious ailment (a fact he shared with me in good faith, while I abused his trust). I know it's a jerk move to do so. The following day I apologized to him for my utterly rude and disrespecting behaviour.

Here's an excerpt from my apology-

**I am sorry for yesterday's behaviour. I deleted the comment mentioning your father. I realised today, how much of an asshole I was, mentioning your father who is suffering from such a dreaded disease, knowing it would upset you.

I don't know what it was that took over me yesterday, that made me such apathetic jerk. I was shocked at my own ability to inflict such hurt and pain. Maybe it was the malice buried deep inside my heart developed due to living in such s toxic environment, that wanted to hurt someone to feel in control or maybe I am an evil human being, like my mother always says. Whatever it was, it doesn't justifies the type of behavior I displayed.

You didn't have to forgive me. You have every right to be furious.

You must be thinking, what had forced this entitled piece of shit to elicit an apology like this. 

It was nothing special, just my parents fighting as usual throwing vulgar abuses and obscenities. I am so used to this scene that now it doesn't make me feel emotional, just irritated. 

But today while they were fighting and I was laying on my bed I got a realisation that I don't love my parents. I don't love them as a child love his parents. I have general empathy for them as complicated humans, but as a parent I don't love them. As a parent I have only hate and anger for them.

 I don't understand parent and child relationships and view it as a transaction for taking care. Today while reminiscing about my behavior, I realised that I felt envy and jealousy from you(I don't know why but writing this line made me tear up). Maybe this is also one of the reason that's responsible for my despicable rudeness. I have no one that I truly love. I am just a emotionless robot, as my mother says. So, watching you writing about how fiercely you cherish your father, made me confront the void I have in my heart. I have no one to cherish so fiercely. 

Whatever may be the reason be, I apologise to you for insulting your father and you. I hope you both live long lives getting enough time to share with each other and make memories that last an eternity. 
**

As you read, writing above apology made me realise that I have nobody whom I truly love. I am just a husk of flesh without the ability to love or being loved.

It made me realise, that even after living with such noisy family, the silence of lonliness rings the loudest.

I am sorry for writing such a long post.",lonely,An Epiphany,2021-01-29 04:10:48
375,codecrunchie,1611853602,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a long post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reason my friend [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ spent over 8 months working in their spare time on a friend finding project. Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28Qs, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. It's basically this info:

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Concerns:**

A few people have concerns about the above - but you can (and probably should be anyway) be completely anonymous if you choose - just use a throwaway contact info, and also there is a very simple and short privacy policy as well. And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) and mine as well.

**What is the final result?**

The algorithm searches over 4000 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches (active in the past 2weeks)** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

**Final tips:** I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with notifications recently - but these usually get fixed quickly.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

It just she has alot of guys hitting on her and as she is a good friend I'm always in loop with her life. I felt like what if I'm just another guy who falled for her. So one day I was drunk so I texted her and told her that I feel this way. The sad part was she didn't even denied it, I feel so stupid thinking I finally have a real connection and I even considered her my soulmate. I feel so alone I am binge watching all day just so my brain doesn't get time to think about this because it gets into overthinking mode when I not doing anything and that hurts bad.",lonely,I feel so stupid for falling for someone.,2021-01-29 01:40:55

I feel so lost.

I'm having a tough time, i can manage to stay positive but for the smallest thing i crumble down.

I am losing someone important, he is everything i have always wanted, and in this situation i realized how broken i am as a person.
I can't handle my emotions well, I can't be a good partner because i never let the other person close, i never let myself be with someone.

I grew up so lonely, my parents just hate each other, my sister is almost non existent and my brother lives in another city and never calls unless he needs something.
When i was ima child my father was extremely abusive and violent, my mom didn't protect me much and my siblings were older than me so they considered my fault that my father was angry for a child tantrum.

It has always been me and myself.
I grew up like that, i felt my little friends could know what was happening home because it was too heavy for them and i was so ashamed.
I was so shy and lonely, praised to be the good girl in class
""You don't even notice she is there!"" My teacher praised me with my mom.

I wanted to be seen
I wanted to not be alone, held close, safe
When i meditate i see this little girl, she is me, and she is so lonely and in pain, i am the only person she has in the whole world.

I got so used to live like this that now i am not able to have a proper relationship.
I mess them up.
I can't really take care of someone else, i only think about myself and trusting completely the other person is so hard for me.
The smallest mistake makes me feel a failure and i have pure terror of abandonment

Yet i set up for failure, i do everything wrong and people abandon me 

I am so tired of being lonely, it's so painful guys, so tiring.
I wish i was born in a normal family, i wish i had good and close friends. I wouldn't be perfect either but at least it would be easier.

I wish i could make him happy, i wish i could make my loved ones happy. Often i do not see how all this made me very self absorbed.

I wish i could disappear, 
i have this image in my mind where suddenly i collapse onto myself and then the ground swallows me, not in a bad way, like it's calling me back, like we are becoming one. 
and there i stay, sleeping peacefully, things starts to grow out of me, things that live but do not think or suffer. So i can live through them but without suffering anymore. 
Everything is peace and i sleep.

I just want to be loved, to love and make someone happy. I wish i had an house with a family and friends coming often, and joy and happiness.

Every time I've ever tried to talk about this to someone I care about they've left, but I guess the point of this is to be able to say things you wouldn't normally.

I've always known I was nothing special since I was little. My family had an unhealthy dynamic and they were verbally abusive. To them, you were either talented or you were worthless, and that made me worthless to them since the earliest I can remember. My sister got all the special treatment growing up, and my parents just look at me like I'm this massive failure. In school I never got picked for anything, and nobody has really paid any attention to me. I haven't had a problem with it until recently when a girl asked me on a date. We dated for about a year, and I guess we were pretty serious, but she just left me last week. Over the course of the past few days she hasn't even looked my way, and that's when I realized that nobody does. Not a single soul wants to look at me, or talk to me, or as far as I'm concerned, even think about me. There are about 3 or 4 people that I've known for a couple years, and they'll talk to me occasionally but I could still disappear for months and they don't even notice. I just wish that I had even one person I could call a friend, but I'm awfully average. And I have this paralyzing fear coming over me because I'm only about to leave high school, and everybody notices everything in high school. It's such a small world there, but what's going to happen to me when I graduate. The world's just going to get bigger and I'll be forgotten.

My ex was my everything. I used her so that I wouldn’t be alone. So that i wouldn’t feel lonely. And it worked. But I was too possessive of her. I realize now that relying on one person isn’t healthy. We couldn’t live like that.

It’s hard for me to make friends. I feel like I need to put in an effort though, even though I’m afraid to put myself out there. I’m afraid of being rejected and I’m afraid of people not liking me. My self esteem feels fragile. Something else I need to work on.

When I entered this sub, I saw that thousands and thousands of people belonged to this sub. So thousands must be lonely, too. And that’s a funny thought to me, because there’s so many people on this planet. So many different kinds of people. Yet there are so many lonely people. Maybe social media has something to do with it. Covid does of course, but even without covid, lonely people exist.

In the past 8 months, I've just been dealing with a lot of aloof men. The conversations start off well over text/messaging, I've had a couple of really great video chat calls that lasted almost 3-6 hours, and then the trail starts to go cold. No more ""good morning"" or ""good night"" texts and the replies take longer and longer. I'm the only one initiating conversation until I finally give up and that's it, I don't hear from them anymore. Out of 6 different men I've talked to, only one had the guts to give me an excuse before he stopped talking to me.

I try not to take it personally because I know I'm a catch. That sounds obnoxious but minus some health issues and the occasional episode of the sads, I'm pretty great and it just confuses me why all the people I meet lately just don't seem to have the attention span to really get to know me. It makes me feel so deflated so I delete the apps and I try to be ok with being alone, but I want to be loved and I've got a lot of love to give. If I'm not putting myself out there, how am I ever supposed to find love? But I'm so tired of putting myself out there and dealing with these constant false starts.

I have one bestfriend that's been around for most my life, and that's about it. He's the opposite though, he's always talking with other friends, and it seems someone is always interested in how his life is going. 

We hang out with lots of other people, but the entire time I only feel like they look at me as ""his friend"" and not ""their friend"", which really hurts. It sucks when you're around so many other people but you know deep down they don't care about you. I've tried so hard and I put in a ton of effort, only to be left in the dust...

I'm not the type to get jealous, but it really hurts to see him always having someone text him, or call him and ask how is day is going. I never really enjoyed attention, but lately I've been craving it more than ever. I put 100% of effort into friendships to only have them never give anything in return. We have some mutual ""friends"" but it sucks even more seeing them always talking to him but for someone reason I'm not good enough to start a conversation with?

I just want someone to consider me their friend, someone to talk to throughout the day, someone to send me crappy memes we both can laugh at, someone who is actually willing to hangout and do stupid shit with it...

Bringing it back to the title, me and my bestfriend are both extremely similar, but why is it 10000 times easier for him? Why does it seem like I'm not ever good enough, no matter how much effort I put in? Why do people only look at me as ""his friend""? What the hell am I doing wrong? Why does everyone want to hang out with him? We are practically the same, But Im not good enough.

She's amazing and very supportive of my inexperience when it comes to relationships and intimacy. Despite this, I still feel like I don't deserve to be with her, and I'm terrified of messing up and hurting her.

I've had a few negative experiences in the past, getting myself hurt by relationships that never happened. Falling for a girl on the other side of the planet, then being led along (sort of) by a friend; that friendship feels odd to me but she seems fine.

I believe this has made me feel insecure and have very little confidence when it comes to relationships. I don't feel ready for a relationship, not sure I ever truly will, but I don't want my faults to affect my relationship.

I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way and believe these things about yourself.  I'm going to make some guesses about your experience. 

* You believe that to get close with others will inevitably result in rejection because you're not really worth being around and feel you have nothing to contribute. 
* You're convinced you're boring and no good at making conversation. 
* You want to feel valued but don't think you have much value.
* You know that nobody has any reason to be interested in you as a person.
* You feel that you're somehow different; at times almost feeling like an alien. 
* You feel like you don't really belong anywhere.

If so, it sounds like you operate with a ""Social Isolation"" schema.

""An early maladaptive schema is a pervasive self-defeating or dysfunctional theme or pattern of memories, emotions, and physical sensations, developed during childhood or adolescence and elaborated throughout one's lifetime, that often has the form of a belief about the self or the world."" 
- Wikipedia

Below is a link to a page describing the Social Isolation schema in detail

https://app.securenest.org/c/schemas/social-isolation-alienation-schema

The good news is that recovery IS possible and you don't have to feel this way for the rest of your life. A trusting relationship with a therapist is the quickest route, but there are others. Self-therapy is a thing depending on the strength of this schema.

Take care. You are worthy as you are and deserve to create a better life for yourself.

P.s. I highly, highly recommend Jeffrey Young's ""Reinventing Your Life"" for detailed insights and instructions for changing these patterns of self-rejection.

P.s.2.If you want to, pm me your location and I'll find you a list of schema therapists. Many work on a sliding scale if you're uninsured. I know it sounds impossible to imagine, talking about yourself and how you feel to a complete stranger. Don't forget that they've seen and heard it all and everything is 100% confidential by law. It absolutely improved my life.",lonely,"Read this if you identify: I'm boring, bad at conversation, and don't fit in anywhere.",2021-01-28 08:26:47

545,runofthemill27,1611654729,1,"
I have i father who is emotionally and verbally abusive to my mother (she is both victim, enabler). Over the countless times I’ve tried to speak to my mother about the way my dad treats her, she has viciously defended him despite him abusing her. She believes that the abuse is a normal part of ANY marriage and told me explicitly that abuse is normal in a relationship or marriage. She believes that a woman is weak if she leaves a relationship because of emotional and verbal abuse and that “if you can’t handle/endure that type of treatment then you’ll never make a relationship work out”. Obviously I know this is wrong and being a victim herself she can’t see right from wrong but why really hurts me is that she’s supposed to be my mother and protect me and tell me that in a healthy relationship you’ll never be abused, she’s supposed to empower me and tell me to stay away from men like my dad. How can a mother tell her only daughter and child that “it’s okay to be abused because it’s a normal part of marriage”. 

My dad has slapped her once a decade ago but I still remember it. When I bring it up and call her a victim she gets angry at me telling I’m “Idealistic”, “you’re an idiot” for wanting/believing that a relationship without any type of abuse can exist. I asked her once would she not get upset if I married a man who treated me the way dad treats her and she said “well that’s marriage”. She even says things like “we’ll see what kind of man you’ll bring since you’ve got such a big mouth” and “we need to be thankful that your father doesn’t hit us or cheat or gamble” as if his emotional and verbal abuse towards her is some kind of small price to pay.

Ive started therapy but the things my mother said are constantly recurring and triggering me. I’m terrified I’m gonna be in an abusive relationship despite knowing its wrong and knowing which red flags to look out for.

It’s incredible lonely and isolating existence living in a household that is constantly trying to crush your spirit, who try to convince you that abuse in your life is inevitable. She actively mocks me bc I say I won’t allow myself to be abused and scoffs at that as if she’s trying her best to make sure I start believing that her damaged and distorted views of love and relationships are the right ones. She genuinely thinks her relationship with my father is a healthy one yet anyone rational can see that it’s abusive. I’m just sick of having a mother trying to convince me that abuse is okay and expected. I’m an only child and currently living at home (unable to move out) so I’m always alone. Idk what I expect from posting this I guess I just want to be reminded that she’s wrong and that healthy relationships do exist.",lonely,Normalising abuse,2021-01-26 20:52:09

I tried to get a job at target and they made me seasonal even though my old job was a permanent target position. I couldn’t make friends at all. I’ve been so isolated especially with Covid that I just turn to my boyfriend on FaceTime and I’m so mean to him because I’m so sad inside and I don’t even know how to express anything in a nice way. My parents aren’t always nice and they drink a lot so when they come home all drunk it makes me feel worse and sometimes I just get so lonely and upset because my sister is at work no they’re gone I try not to scratch at my skin because I do that when I get so upset.

I don’t have friends, I never really have. I think my mom just thought family was enough, and thought I’d make friends on my own. 

But here I am lol, on a lonely subreddit. I feel like online is easier to make friends, but idk where to look. The places I see like this? Or makeafriend or whatever it’s called. They don’t seem to help at all. I feel like you just find broken people who are desperately trying to find someone to fill the hole/holes in their life. Which people can’t do. And so they keep looking and keep posting. And you just have a bunch of people who are looking, but they aren’t really gonna find anything. They don’t know how. They don’t know what they’re looking for. Or what they need. And maybe I’m like that to. 

I almost feel like these places, subreddits, are unhelpful. That it’s more helpful to find friends in places that you’re interested in. Like a game community or something like that. But it’s difficult because, you don’t really find deep friends. Or in my case, I feel like they aren’t looking for that and I am. So I would come off weird or desperate. Which leads me back to places like this. The hole. An endless loops of people not knowing what they need. And venting to strangers.

565,Cloud_ZVela,1611640884,1,"It's so easy for me to avoid any attempt anyone would make to befriend me. 

I've become so good at it that I managed to go to college without saying a word to anyone for a whole week. Sitting in the back of the classroom, being such a dork while talking with someone, listening to music, pretending I'm sleeping while skipping classes, rejecting every invitation to do something minimally amusing. That's how I've kept myself ""safe"" from social interaction.

But even if despite of all those barriers someone insist to be my friend I would just put minimal effort to the relation so they would eventually leave.

Don't know exactly how, but I'm getting my shit together and now I feel like a shitty, horrible person. I'm so lonely and I deserve it, or more like I'm just facing the consequences of being so mean all those folks who wanted to reach me out and be friendly.

I'm craving not only for social interaction, but for actually a deep connection with someone. I just want to be kind and build a bond with a person. Unfortunately being kinda ugly, boring, awkward and afraid of opening myself up to others won't help me to socialize. I don't even know what people would think about me.

This year has taught me that life is going to throw you curve balls. Just when you think you have things going well, life can take it all away.

The only thing keeping me going now is my dreams. My dreams and the clothes on my back are essentially all I have at the moment.

It's either like I'm bothering them with the weight of problems that shouldn't be theirs or they don't actually want to talk, they just felt obligated to be nice. So here I am. I am actually going to straight out vent for the first time in years. Instead of directing all of my problems at somebody, this is like throwing them at a wall so passersby can stop and look if they so choose or just scroll on by. If you actually read this, I apologize, this will really long since it's been building for awhile, and also you must have a big heart or be really bored. 

I don't understand why I feel so lonely. I live in a house with five other people and I don't make enough money to move out and rent my own place. So I'm stuck living with my mom, sister, uncle, gma, and gpa. I am just super fed up with all of them tbh which is rude but also just how I feel so whatever! My grandparents are at that old MEAN stage so they are a buncha jerks. My uncle treats me like I'm stupid and my mom and my sister are just pissed at me most of the time for petty stuff. My mom and dad are going through a very drawn out (like, two year) divorce and I am stuck right in the middle because I have a big heart or something and I love them both even though my mom and sister hate my dad and diss him all the time. Therefore my mom gets pissed at me cuz I love my dad and miss him cuz he lives like four hours away and I rarely get to see him. My mom is always blaming my dad and saying he's a narcissist and don't get me wrong, he is. But she ALSO is, she just hasn't acknowledged it. I don't even know why I love my parents, they both abused me to the point of me being a mental case. Cmon guys... My dad would physically abuse me and they both mentally abused me. My mom still likes to tell me how controlling I am (unprovoked mind you, like she'll be driving, park and then go ""You just hate it when you can't control everything"" and I look up from my phone where I was minding my own business and be like ""wut?"") and how the fact that I am suicidal is my fault. I got shut in an asylum when I was 17 and she blames me to this day for it. (21 for ref) When I am having a bang-up day and mention that I want to die she rolls her eyes and tells me how what happened is not a big deal. I dunno if any of you guys have depression but if you do then you know it is never about just the last bad thing that happens. That crap builds for years.

My sister is kinda my only friend but she is also so ready to throw me under the bus if I say the slightest thing against her or my mom. She gets offended for my mom and it's the darndest thing cuz them I have two people yelling at me instead of just the one I offended. With all the stuff that happens in my family life I love my long 12 hours at work. My coworkers are great and we get along well enough. Unfortunately I am really bad at making genuine friends for some reason. I haven't had a real friend since I was about 13. I've only had school friends and work friends were you talk and enjoy their company while you're there but if you leave you will never see them again except for in awkward passing. I kinda idolize having a relationship but I am demisexual and since I can't even make friends, I've never been on a date in my life. Because of all the abuse in my life I tend to wonder if maybe I'm just not worth anyone's time. Like I'm not worth loving. My self-esteem is lower than a doormat, I feel like trash. I look like trash. I can't tell if I look like trash cuz I feel like trash or because I look like trash but I really don't care.

I want to move into an apartment and get a little personal space and me time. I share a room with my sister, it's cramped. But I can't. I can't drive, I don't have my license. My mom won't let me schedule my drivers test because she says I'm not good enough but like, whose fault would that be? My mom's job is to teach me how to drive... I also don't have money for a down-payment on an apartment since my mom has decided I need to pay her 60% of my paycheck so she can use it to buy a house. I have give my mother 10k dollars since April of last year and yet my sister only has to give her 3k cuz my sister and no more. Right... cuz that makes sense. I am saving my spare money for a car and also using it to buy myself healthier food then I get at home. I am also a stress shopper and I get stressed a lot in my current situation, so I buy a lot of dolls cuz that's what I like. They make me feel a little happier for some reason.

My best friend in the whole wide world n forever is my cat. She was a gift from my dad when my depression first got really bad. I love her so much and she makes me smile. I like to watch tv and play video games while she snuggles with me. I really wish I had human friends though. What I want more than anything in the world is a friend who cares and is actively interested in my hobbies. I love drawing and writing (also listening to music while doinf everything). It's like my zen. I've never met anyone who likes my drawings or even wants to see them. And it is rare to find someone who cares about the fact I write and passionately wants to read my stories and talk with me about them.

Though I guess most of all I am sick of myself. Why am I so unlovable that I deserve to be abused and ignored. I take multiple medications everyday just to make it through. The only reason I am alive is because of the stories I write and the characters I draw. I created them in my head starting at the beginning of high school and I love them. I don't want them to die with me so I am determined to write all their stories down before I die. I want to get them published so others can read them and fall in love with them as I have. Once I reach the end of my stories I might as well reach the end of my life.

Whatever it is... You are smart. You are pure. You are beauty in it's purest form. I've never felt the energy of a radiant and exquisite human being until you came across this post and read it.


How to feel better one day at a time:
(It takes a bit of work... But remember that you're always doing your best.)
1. Make your bed (everyday you procrastinating little nugget)

2. Keep looking on the bright side. Tell yourself you are beautiful and deserve respect and love.( Even if you don't believe it!!!)

3. EAT FOOD! Your body NEEDS IT!!! You are beautiful No matter how big/small/brown, black, white, curly haired or pin straight! EAT 3 MEALS.

I cried making this post because I feel for you. I cry with you because I want you to be happy. I want you to feel safe and loved. I can't express how much I care for all of you but please. I beg of you please. Take care of yourself. It's never to late. I love you ya little peach. Have a good night/morning/afternoon and...






YOU BETTER EXCEPT MY VIRTUAL HUGS AND KISSES NUGGET!!!







EXCEPT THEM NOW!!! 




WITH CONSENT BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU AND YOUR BODY!!!

I'm very quiet and awkward, and when I do open my mouth I'm repetitive, slow, and stumble over my words. When I'm around people, my brain simply doesn't work, but its not like Im an intelligent person on my own. Oftentimes I don't take part in conversation because sometimes I don't fully process what is being said. And even when I do understand the conversation, its more than likely that I don't have anything to say. Part of that is because my mind is blank usually, which I hate. I have no sense of humor. I act so seriously in every situation and I’m so socially inept. I’ve come to realize that there’s nothing I’m enthusiastic about. This makes me so boring and thus adds to the issue of not having much to talk about. 
   I have friends but I'm not sure why they keep me around. I don't feel close with anyone and I've lost the desire to meet new people and make friends. I've become very apathetic. I feel like less than a person.

Some perspective on Breadcrumbing and the benefits of giving up hope

Just come quick context: I have developed a huge crush over one of my friends. It happened gradually, and then all of a sudden i find myself always thinking of her. Always looking forward to our text conversations about all kinds of stuff, from surface level convos to really deep stuff. The problem was that..we mostly communicated through text. We hung out as well, it’s just wasn’t as frequent and the vibe was kinda off. She gave off that I was a ‘friend’ vibe in person, but would sometimes flirt thru text - classic breadcrumbing. She would cancel plans to hang, even though I knew she was free, and didn’t make the effort to be with me in person. But when I didn’t talk to her after a couple of days to a week, she would initiate conversation thru text and be really nice and enthusiastic making it seem like she could potentially like me. Another thing, she got out of a long relationship last year and she said it was kinda rough - like she didn’t get the closure she needed. This made me think that she might be emotionally unavailable and it was kinda a red flag. Unlucky for me, I had my rose tinted glasses on and ignored it. For the past couple months I’ve been trying to ‘win’ her over and at times it would seem like it was working, but I have recently decided to drop it and give up. I feel like shit and it sucks a lot since I really liked her (still do) but let me give some points on what I think is crucial to learn for anyone in the dating world

1.) giving up hope makes you more in touch with reality. I have a bad habit of imagining potential futures with people that I like, and sometimes it can seem more real than real life. The emotions these imagined futures can be really visceral and seem great but it’s important to get a grip of reality and know that this hope for this imagined reality can sometimes be detrimental to well being. It can make you so attached to something that will not happen. Giving up these imagined futures means that you are willing to accept the harsh reality that we live in. It’s an act of courage.

2.) It’s an act of self love. If you are being breadcrumbed, it can be quite easy to go mad over the person you’ve fallen for. I would spend countless hours trying to decipher her mixed messages thru researching dating sites online and on reddit. “What does it mean when she initiated conversation?” “What does it mean when she sends one word messages?” You get the idea. I felt like I was going crazy trying to figure out what her intentions were. It became clear to me that this wasn’t healthy for me, for my mental state of mind and well being. I was distracted, and would get anxious a lot. It shouldn’t have to be like this. You have to look out for your future self. You have to love yourself enough to be able to let go so that you can be okay again. 

3.) being able to let go speaks volumes on your confidence in yourself. If you are able to let go of unrequited love means that you trust yourself enough that you can find someone else. Someone that can make you feel the same way. This is incredibly tough to do, especially since our self esteem was just wrecked by the realization that our ideal partner in our heads reject us. How can we have confidence if the person we hold dear to us doesn’t feel the same way? It must be to some degree our fault. Right? Well no, you are who you are and you shouldn’t give that up to be with someone. This ties back to the self love concept. You must know who you are and love it in order to move on. It’s like a scale. Does your love for this person outweigh the love for your real self? If you answer honestly, then only then can you start to know what to do with your breadcrumbing situation.

This is just some insight I’ve had over the past month looking online and seeing people in other situations as I. Also this has been in my mind nonstop since I’ve had to officially let go. Now onto to the worst part, the sadness and grieving that comes with letting go. I shared a lot of myself with this girl, and I truly fell for her. Letting go of her also means that I have to let go of the part of me that fell for her. Our memories, inside jokes, little quirky things we did, all of it. I have to let it all go and it really fucking sucks. But I have to do it in order to find someone who’s actually down to be with me for real and not breadcrumb me. I deserve it and you deserve it too.",lonely,My perspective on Breadcrumbing and the benefits of giving up hope,2021-01-26 13:40:00
598,armchair-legion,1611628418,1,"I’m so lonely and so desperate for human contact that I end up messaging all kinds of people online/through dating apps/zoom events and I’m a female so all the dudes I happen to text think I’m interested in them romantically. 

so that just fuels a ton of anxiety because then I get freaked out that they’ll be able to track me down or something even though I never use my real name or give out my number or anything.  

then I start panicking!! like, what am I doing with my life? I could be reading or playing music or something, but I’m so starved for social interaction that I just can’t stop myself from continuing to message/talk to people for the social benefit, even if they give off creepy vibes!!! 

Like in my right mind I would never even start convos with people that make me uncomfortable but I’m just like “we’re all human eh” and that’s not true there are some really fucked up people out there and I feel like I’m losing control of my rational mind.

I will be the first to tell you here. People correlate good personality with good looks. Now obviously a good looking person can be very nasty personality and people may not like him. But various studies and my anecdotal experience shows that pretty people are loved and ugly people are shunned.

I consider my friends as close as a family to me and not being able to be social with them is the main factor in the loneliness I can’t even bring myself to zoom or Skype them anymore as I can’t stand the horrible feeling when the call ends and I’m left alone again.

I know people are dying with the virus and I’m so lucky not to have anyone I love affected by it I feel horrible even even posting this as I know people are in a much worse position than what I am in at the moment but I feel like this isn’t living anymore",lonely,Covid isolation,2021-01-26 10:57:04

Good looks don't count much for men unless we're socially on top of it as well, so I'm pretty much just a good looking bum, I mean I have a good job history working in robotics and computers, but I'm still unemployed, growing cannabis and riding my unemployment checks to the last drop tbh. I wish some young lady would show an interest in me. I'm the most lonely romantically, though I also want friends just as much. Online dating has been an absolute money pit of misery, and I'm awkward as hell in real life unless I'm on a ton of adderall, so I've pretty much given up on dating. What other routes are there? Genetically clone a partner? I could probably do that more easily than talking to a girl and getting her to like me, to be truthfully honest.

I made friends online but I’m tired of streaming. I’d only be happy for a few hours then I’m back at square one. I have no love life. Not really interested in dating anyone. I just want to get my life back together. I have work experience. I like to dance. And I like to play any instrument.

I keep pretending that everything is going to be okay. It’s so hard for me to focus in my classes lately. My thoughts are too heavy. 


I also have no choice but to quit my weekend job. My HR is probably going to be upset since I was already full time and switched to part time due to school but this is best for everyone. I don’t want to get sick. (I really don’t want to phone in).

I'd go out to meet new people, would even drink an underage drink or two, but no one wanted anything to do with me. Guys have never wanted anything to do with me.

636,rotcomha,1611611140,1,"Tomorrow, i mean in less then 12 hours i go to my school again in purpose of finishing my finals (Senior year, finished most of already), after few months i didn't. To be honest, I don't want to. Not because i will fail them, but because i don't want to leave my room. I want to keep being in my bed moving on to the chair back and forth 24/7 with some brakes here and there to eat or go to the restroom. I showered once a week during this lockdown because i didn't do anything that would make me want to be clean. I did shower because i started to discuss myself.

You know, few days ago I've been asked by someone i know when we were talking (and that means he spoke and i nod) about some philosophical stuff what is my dream. I said some made up bullshit i always say when people ask me that just because im there (new classes and shit) that I'd like to be the CEO of a nice company. Idk how, he heard that I lied. Then he asked me again, what is my dream and demanded me to be honest. It was already late and I didn't sleep well so i told him the truth. The truth I've only been keeping to myself because i don't want to admit it even to myself because im not edy and i hate to be that kind of guy. What kind of guy? The guys whom been asked what's his dream and he replays with ""i don't have a dream"". I did it. I simply said ""i don't have a dream. No, like, really. The closet thing i have to a dream is not to wanting to be homeless.""

He asked me what im planing for the future, as a reference to what i asked him before and instead of saying the usual bullshit, i said ""i want to be a teacher. Not because it's 'fun and fulfil', but because it gives me just enough to be considered as a person with a real job without taking to much effort and attention. Just enough money to live alone in my own small house, maybe a studio apartment, the most chip, listening to my music and looking at my own memes. Yes. These are my plans. These are all my plans.""

So I don't want to go tomorrow, I apologise, 11:30 hours from now to school because I don't want to leave my room. Where I can be alone with myself. Doing the same as I did 40 minutes ago, ling in the bed, listening to music and watching my own memes. I don't want to show my face to others. I don't want others to show their faces to me. I don't want to have small talks or a whole conversation about something stupid and meaningless because let's face it, everything is meaningless. I don't want to prevent from myself signing becuse I have such an awful voice. I just don't want. but I need to. Why? Because the other option is die. And as much as I want the ground to swallow me me alive, I can't make myself die knowingly. Even tho I know it'll happen somewhen. And the God Im to lazy to help in knows how badly I prey to this day to come soon.

This is funny, isn't it? There's literally nothing that can make me happy in this situation. Not sad ether, because when we die we just stop... We just stop. So nothing to make me happy and nothing to make me sad ether. Guess I'll stay numb and just be waiting hopeless and helpless untill the time will come, and my mind will surrender to my body time will guides them both to bed just to relive this hell again over and over and over untill my soul will surrender and i will finally fulfill this pice of meat and bones'es purpose and die, just to give the worms and germs down there in the ground the hope of having one more thing to eat before it's all over.

I've since realized that while all of those feelings still exist, usually their source is some sort of fear, usually the fear of being alone. Like, I feel anxious, as a result i feel stressed, i feel scared and sad and alone.
Sometimes I would just cry for hours, or get to a point that I breath so quickly that I feel like I'm going to faint. It's just... horrible. 
I've never been abandoned, and yet it's like I have abandonment anxiety. 
For no real reason I start spiraling ""they are mad at me"" ""I'm horrible"" ""they are gonna leave me"" ""everyone will leave"" ""I'll be alone forever"" ""I'm horrible""
The worst thing is that while its happening, I really can't talk to that person. I feel like if I share what I'm feeling I'll just impose myself unto them (feeds into the ""I'm horrible"") and annoy them. I cant keep being annoying and make people deal with my insecurities, itll just make them leave sooner. I also feel that sharing would be percieved as a way to seek validation and ""fishing for compliments"".

643,peckius123,1611609038,1,"Just wanted to post a story about this kind of interesting thing that happened to me recently. It's my first post so don't judge;). So everything began one year prior when I started to go to a debating club in my school. I just strived to be better at speaking publicly and defending my opinion. I started working pretty hard, sacrificing many hours writing, thinking, working with my team. Then one time in  a beginners' tournament we had a pretty fierce debate against these 3 girls: the first one spoke very fuckin fast, like a machine gun, the second one was pretty nice and not that experienced at that time and the third one was pretty good. She was with short hair, dressed somewhat boyishly and yeah, we lost that debate, but I started to talk to her more. We went to a cafe a couple of times, just chit chattin, normal stuff. We even had this kind of competition where we wrote difficult words in our language and the results had to show which one is better at it. I won. But it wasn't until we won a major tournament with our team of three (me, her and another boy was in it) when me and her started to be something like best or at least pretty good friends. None of us wanted serious girlfriend boyfriend shit cuz friendships suited our needs the best. We chatted and hanged out a lot, rode bikes, spent the whole summer talking and it was just perfect. I hadn't had such a relationship in my life. Just cannot describe it good enough four you. And as I recall the last brief meetup of ours was on 31-st of August, the last day of summer holidays. My friend joined in, we bought this delicious cake with curd. We even purchased these kind of ice fountains and tried to light them up when it was raining. It was awesome. She was awesome. One thing the girl didn't have was the outer beauty. But that didn't make her whole image worse. She was understanding, witty, sensible etc... And there is one moment that sometimes until now pops up in my mind before we move on to the climax. We were sitting with a kind of cool boy in our school preparing for a regular debate after lessons on a Friday afternoon. And the talking somehow shifted to friends and then the guy said: ""I cannot belive you are still talking to those average people."" He was reffering to students who she was friends with that didn't go to the whole debating thing and simply others that are not that into politics and stuff we analyze. And she, like a normal person, answered that you will not say with who I have to be friends with and with who shall I be not. The girl was simple, sincere at that time. But then the Autumn came with the second wave of C-virus which made our learning more difficult. My schedule was very cramped and the free time I had didn't coincide with the time debates in school took place. So I decided not to work that hard on that and just concentrate on learning at school and grades. And then I felt it. When I met up with her after a long time, I just knew she had changed. Writing to her didn't feel the same. Suddently the conversations, when earlier they were so easy to start and continue, became hard, heavy, I couldn't even tell a joke without feeling awkward. Maybe the essence of our friendship just ran out. Maybe it was meant to be that way. But the strange coincidence: me exiting the debating thing and she just starting to ignore me, makes me remember the guy say his words about friends. Didn't she became the one that has those refined friends who know how world works, whats better for it yaddle yaddle yaddle. Didn't I just become a number in the statistic of all of the average people? For me it seems pretty phenomenal that a person can change like that in such short periods of time. By the way, I'm writting it here because I feel pretty lonely now, she was basically my only good friend and a person I could talk about anything to. And now I have just a piece of paper into which I have to write down all of the feelings and chemicals in my head. So yeah, thanks for reading.

I’m not ignoring, belittling, or negating what you (we) feel, but let’s face it. The world will never move for us, we either move or we get swept up with the current and we’ll still be here 10 years later. I’m not even going to ask if yall want that. No one wants that! It’s not time to man up, its time to face facts like a human being. There are people out there who live in the lives we want, and whose to say we can’t live like that in the future. Our lives is what we make it to be. Don’t tell me I don’t know what you guys are feeling, i fucking feel it and I fucking hate it. I hate being lonely, alone, sad, depressed, powerless, and hopeless. 

I didnt make it ‘out’ of this thing we call loneliness, im still neck deep in it. I keep getting overwhelmed about the sheer pressure I put for myself - getting rich to live independently and maybe a little lavishly, meet the girl who understands my weaknesses and loves me more than I can imagine, have my future all settled. I get overwhelmed by all of this. But now I keep thinking:

One step at a time, slowly but surely. It doesn’t have to be perfect and doesn’t need to be perfect. Just do your best, hope for the best, and leave it to rest. We can’t run without learning how to walk first. We cant walk without learning how to stand. We cant stand on our two feet without learning what it feels to stand on all fours.

667,codecrunchie,1611593033,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a long post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reason my friend [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ spent over 8 months working in their spare time on a friend finding project. Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28Qs, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. It's basically this info:

* more about you
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Concerns:**

A few people have concerns about the above - but you can (and probably should be anyway) be completely anonymous if you choose - just use a throwaway contact info, and also there is a very simple and short privacy policy as well. And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) and mine as well.

**What is the final result?**

The algorithm searches over 3900 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches (active in the past 2weeks)** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

**Final tips:** I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with notifications recently - but these usually get fixed quickly.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

672,Kratos_Hashtag_0373,1611587116,1,"Hi Everyone. I am a 21 year old guy who's kind of at the rock bottom currently. I am a 4th year college student studying physics in a 5 year integrated programme.

I have lost my academic scholarship previous year because of my poor academic record. I lost most of my friends which I made in college and all of this happened because of my ex-girlfriend( she dumped on my birthday). I did so much for her and she dumped my ass because of her insecurities and issues. 

Losing friends and breakup would have been okay if atleast my academics were okay but ever since I lost
my scholarship I have been going in a downwards spiral. I feek guilty for now asking my parents to pay my college fees. 

What is worse is that I now I think of myself as that failed sibling or a burden since my elder brother started his Master's at a well reputed University. He is getting a handsome scholarship. With his experience and academic record, he'll probably get a well paying job at Google or Microsoft. He has a girl girlfriend and is going to start preparing to marry her after he lands a job.

Meanwhile, I have not progressed much in any of aspect of life and Instead I went downhill.

After my girlfriend broke up with me, I got addicted to porn again. During my the time I was with her, I was okay but as the relationship started getting toxic, my academic performance went down and I couldn't get out of that relationship because she made me feel guilty for it. She was a very manipulative and controlling person.

I am about to start my Master's thesis in August this year. I won't get the projects I am interested in because of my poor academic record. I now have to stick with something which is not even related to my subject because of my past. That bitch really ruined my life.

I can't talk to my friends about this because either they are busy developing their career or busy in with their relationships. Tbh, I have noticed that most of them can't even relate to my problems. I think I may emotionally drained them with my problems. Now they don't even want to make a get together plan with me. I have realised that it's not fair to bother them with my problems again.

I can't talk this with my family because they never understand. I have 3 siblings and parents are still there yet our family dynamic has never been like that we are allowed to express our problems. We are not even allowed to express our anger at a sibling or anything because it goes against the idea of ""family"".
In summary, My family is not supportive. I am not comfortable enough with them to talk about all this.

I have been lately talking to my Institute counsellor but there's only much she can do. I am at my home for this semester. Online meetings can only do so much.

Right now I am terribly lonely, miserable, sad and failing at life. I just don't know what to do about this. Who can I talk with now? I can't pursue a relationship again because of the horrible experiences with my last one, so It's not possible for me to have any kind of emotional dependency/vulnerability with someone. The few friends I had are busy with their lives and don't need me in their life as much I want them in mine.

I plan to get into a PhD programme after this. I have always wanted to do research and get into a research profession. But my poor academics are now holding me back.

Video games used to be my life but this is not the case anymore due to the fact that it is not enjoyment for me anymore despite me wanting to play games. I kind of feel like like lost.

Moreover, I literally do not have any friends irl aside from one who I play and talk to sometimes.

Lately, I have been longing for a girl who could be on my side and give me hope as well as tell that I am ok when I sleep late and these things/desires get too intense when I am on bed trying to sleep.

679,the-new-user,1611582640,1,"Hi all, 

I’m currently looking for someone to be the focus of a short documentary about finding the balance between being Indian and British, which will be pitched to Netflix as part of their ‘Netflix Documentary Fund’ programme.

The documentary would be 8 -12 minutes long and will explore what might make a British Indian feel detached from the two cultures and what finally happens to help them find harmony between the two. The story will revolve around a British Indian talking about their life and how being a part of two cultures shaped their personality. 

We are a team of 6 consisting of 2 Producers, 1 Director, 1 DOP and 2 camera assistant/cam ops. We have recently finished our 2-year course at the MetFilm School in Ealing Studios and are eager to break out into the world of documentary. In 2 years, we have collectively filmed 4 short films, a feature film and 4 documentaries, one of which has 25 thousand views on YouTube. We also have one short film and another feature film in the pipeline.

I came across your song ‘Dark’ in the TV series ‘Suits’ and thought this might be something you would be interested in. It would be great to have a chat with you, to hear more about your story.

I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards,

Also I am talking from the perspective of a heterosexual, male-female relationship. Over the past couple days I have realized that I am truly fucked when it comes to dating. For some context, I am 22 years old and I have never had a girlfriend or even been on a date. Never even kissed a girl at any point in my life.

My lack of success in online and in person dating has shown me one very important thing. I am ugly in all aspects and always will be. Because of that I will always be alone. I will die having never known what it’s like to be wanted by another person. Never knowing what it’s like to be intimate with another person. Women only know how to hurt and tear me down. They are all awful in my experience.

I am finishing my degree and I have that to hold onto. But for me there’s no real point if I don’t have anyone to share my life with. The only real companion I will ever have is my bitterness and my self loathing. Women are their own unique breed of awful in my experience. I am filled with so much bitterness and anger because nothing I do is good enough.

I have lost 60 pounds, I’ve cleaned up my skin, gotten new clothes but it’s still not enough. I will never be good enough for any woman and never will. I am glad that I finally truly realized this.

I've been out of high school for almost 7 years. I was well-liked; I'd still say I am. I was just always the ""weird"" friend. I dressed differently, had completely different interests to my friends etc. I feel like people appreciated it to an extent, some clowned me for it - I just never had friends that were like me. I'm in my mid 20s now and I still don't, aside from a handful of mates I'd made at university that live all around the country now. 

I still have the same friends from high school mostly. I just never really found a group that my interests aligned with. I won't change my style or anything for anybody; I'm confident in how I dress and all. However, that self-confidence only goes so far. I don't really have many people that I can talk about my interests to. I've always sought out romantic partners for that but I'm single and obviously none of those relationships worked out. I don't think it's healthy to do that either.

This past weekend kind of solidified for me that despite being pretty confident in my interests and style, I just don't really have many like-minded friends that I can enjoy my hobbies with. It sucks having passions and interests that I have to indulge in all alone. I'm not great at putting myself out there on the internet or in real life.

After I found out I ended it, I couldn’t take the mental stress everyday worrying about her and her actions. She proceeded to harass me for the next four months, begging for me back, even begging me to just have sex with her. Last night I ended things completely, 100% and she sat in my room crying and once again giving me a sob story that made me feel like I was the one who should feel bad. After she left I started talking to a mutual friend who let me in on some information. Apparently this entire time she has begged me to take her back, begged me for sex, begged me for another chance she was sleeping with three different guys, one being her ex, and even had to be tested for herpes. Keep in mind she has two great kids but apparently she doesn’t care. I understand we weren’t together so I’m not saying she cheated on me with those guys, I’m disgusted that I have spent MONTHS feeling like a bad person, hating myself, crying because of how bad I felt for not giving her another chance and to top it all I feel physically sick that she was here last night touching my arms and rubbing my back. It’s taking everything in me to not message her and tell her how angry and hurt I am, I wanna know if any of it was real, I wanna know how long my trust was taken advantage of, and most importantly I want her to know how fucked up she has made me. I will never trust anyone so willingly again, and that’s a shame because im sure there’s a girl in my future that truly deserves it but I will always second guess things. I’m not suicidal and I want to make that clear, I’m hurting and I’m just not okay. I have no clue on how to get out of it all, I can’t process this. I have nobody anymore, I don’t have someone that I can spend time with, I don’t have anyone anymore and it hurts. I feel like a fool for putting up with some of the crazy shit that I have during the course of our relationship, I look back and see times that I could’ve ended it but didn’t because I made an excuse for her every time.

I grew up in a broken family, so sadly family isn't a choice either. I worry for my future a lot; if i can't make a friend, how will i ever have a romantic partner? Will i eventually just succumb to my depression and rot away alone? Will my story end with my suicide? At this point, i just want to rest.",lonely,I just wish someone cared man..,2021-01-25 21:11:13
691,Sukleen,1611568069,1,"My thoughts and my feelings are in shambles man. 
Last year i came across this amazing woman, she so smart, funny, beautiful, she has the softest heart anyone can ask for but she doesn’t show it but it’s there and I’ve seen it, she is everything that i am looking for in a partner, we so so much in common you have no idea except seafood and broccoli, she loves those and i don’t lol. 

I am in love with her with every cell thats in my body, she makes me smile and happy, whenever we talk, whenever i see her name on my phone i get the butterflies. But it breaks my heart that she doesn’t feel the same way. We’ve had this talk her and i, she has had a very bad past. I explained that i am not here to hurt her, i love her. She just want to open up but i am a patient man. She sometimes sends dry text messages and it bothers me because i love talking to her. She said that she enjoys talk to me more than anyone else in her friends list. she said that i make her smile and feel god about herself. She has told me the deepest secrets that she barely tells people. Some people would just leave her be if they heard that but i am still here despite her flaws or my flaws even, i care for her. 

From time to time she says she likes me in an indirect way. And i do believe her. But she is too afraid to open up. I comfort her and i tell her im here for her and that i am by her side always no matter what the situation is, i guess that’s not enough. Our friendship or relationship is undefined, so im not in the friendzone which is good. 

The lonely part is when she chooses other specific  people over me, she chooses people that arent even loyal to her, she chooses people that easily keep her on “ read “ or forget about her or replace her. Why doesn’t she realize that i dont do that to her, shes the only perfect girl for me. 

I keep telling myself she’ll come around, i have faith and hope that she will slowly but surely. I just dont know anymore. I dont want to stop talking to her and i dont want to lose her. I dont want to annoy her or make her mad at me. 

Im sorry this is a long text i just feel alone right now. And i didnt know who to talk to.",lonely,Have you ever loved someone and felt lonely at the same time because she doesn’t love you back?,2021-01-25 20:47:49

697,hugenuggets,1611563675,1,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this. Sorry if it isn't, let me know and i'll move it.

This is a long one so BIG thanks in advance to anyone who reads it. I won't blame anyone a bit if you don't have the time though.

I'm a guy in my 40s, and outside my family i have one friend. Makes me feel a bit pathetic even writing that, but that's how it is.

I've known the guy since we were early teens so there's a long history. We went to hobbies together, school together, parties together, got our first cars at the same time, worked the same job together... All of it basically. Sounds good, right? It was.

At some point during us working together, he got promoted and became my supervisor. I was fine with it, he was fair and didn't abuse it. Eventually though he was demoted during a company restructuring, but retained his higher salary for some reason. Meaning we worked the same job again but he got paid hundreds more. Not cool, so i tried to correct it with our bosses with no success. I quit the job a bit after that, and learned he had actively been trashing me behind my back so he could keep his pay. It worked, that's why they wouldn't pay me more and i had to leave.

This obviously wrecked the trust, and i actually cut ties with him for a few years and moved to another city entirely. Later i contacted him again, and he was overjoyed for it. We never talked about the work thing after that, i figured i would just let it go. But i always had trouble trusting him again.

Now.. I don't even know where to begin telling what's wrong now, years later since reconnecting with the man. Everything, i mean literally EVERYTHING is competitive. It's like i can't have thing X without him having thing Y to topple it with, to one-up whatever i'm doing. I won't claim i'm flawless here, i've joined him in this stupid game on occasion. It's just that every time i stop it, he keeps going. And yes, i've confronted him about it, quite a few times. I would get promises or change, but it always comes back to the same.

A few practical examples of this behavior from over the years, not in any particular order:

- I went on a vacation with my wife, sent him a pic of the coastline, figuring he'd guess where it is. He wouldn't, so i told him where. The response was ""Oh that place, been there done that, it wasn't much."" It's okay if he didn't like it, but i would never say it like that to someone who's exploring a new country for the first time. Just not cool. It didn't ruin our vacation but i was a bit downed about it for a moment. Oversensitive maybe? Goes to show how important his opinion was i suppose.

- I'm often trying to grow my beard, but it's kind of a hit-and-miss so i'm a bit insecure about that. Something a real friend would support you with, not change their profile pic into some dude with an insanely patchy beard, then showing off their beard product collection and sending a pic of their own, impressively thick beard. That's what he did. I'm not usually very thin-skinned but come on, is that necessary? Or am i just whining for nothing here?

- I work in a school, which is a bit stressing during this pandemic, especially since i'm in a risk group and my tasks don't allow working from home. My friend also works in a school, but he can do his from home, so guess who reminds me of that at least twice a week? I wish i hadn't mentioned i was worrying my ass off, he'd probably be quiet and not send pics of him ""sleeping"" on the job on his couch. If i didn't believe this was done with malice i wouldn't think anything of it. Just idle banter.

- He got a new phone a while ago. I was like, cool, tell me about it and so on, and he showed off the camera etc. A month later i got a new phone which has the exact same ram and storage, and camera because i love photography, but my phone is inferior in some other areas. My friend basically ignores it, except for suddenly researching how UFS3.0 is superior to 2.1. Mine has 2.1, obviously, and i didn't think it would matter one bit. But apparently something had to be dug up since now i had a good camera too.

- I sold some old PC parts online, and got a whopping 50€ for them, which i jokingly rolled into a ""joint"" and sent him a pic of it, see how stacked i am now, ha! He sent a pic of him holding 800€ which he got from his ""forest investment"" or whatever, and said ""I got money too so shut the fuck up with yours."" I can usually tell when he's saying something in a humorous way and this seemed like genuine annoyance. I liked to think he just didn't get my joke, but thinking about it later made me realize money has always been a sensitive spot for him, ever since that salary debacle.

- From money we go to cars. I used to be a car enthusiast, i always had older but powerful cars. His wife didn't let him buy them so i used to pick him up a lot and we'd go cruising, i often asked if he wanted to drive too. He did. I never, EVER, made fun of him driving a regular, sensible car. This i am sure of because i knew he wanted them too. At some point he did finally buy a turbocharged car, and believe me - he couldn't stop talking about how it was half a second quicker from 0 to 100 than my car at that time. He didn't focus on how nice it was to finally have a fast car, only how nice it was that it was faster than mine. Years of resentment manifested. I have since moved to sensible cars, and he sold his ride as well. Anyway. Next.

- Before my kid was born, he used to tell me to never have kids (he's got 2) because you never have money (there it is again), never have time, your wife stops sucking your dick, and you'll just be generally miserable. Well, i have a 3yo now and it turns out i'm not miserable because of my kid. I'm not rich financially but doing quite fine. Me and my wife are doing great in and out of bed. We both take personal time off occasionally, it's easily arranged - just talk with your spouse! Conversation and connection is the key! I'm miserable because my only friend outside my family considers me his Number One rival. Mentioning any of the above, which i intended as support, resulted in him lashing out.

There are waaaaaayyy more of these but this is already a mile long post.

I'd like to think that with a good friend, you can talk about almost anything. But i can't talk about family things. I can't say if i have a problem at work, or myself like my beard, because it seems like he often uses things i say against me. Money is an obvious no-go. Hobbies too, because if i mention PC upgrades he just goes ""I don't give shit about that, i have a 3k€ Mac and a 60-inch TV."" Everything goes back to money. I mean, i know how much he makes in his job, i saw the ad before he applied to it. When i told him i saw the ad, the first thing he said: ""I negotiated a +30% better salary than what the ad said."" What i'm saying here is i know his and his wife's families pay for some of their things, he doesn't afford the things he has otherwise. I don't care about that, i just wish he didn't have to pretend otherwise. I'm never mentioning this to him though, that would make me... him?

I titled this post ""how much is too much?"" because i don't know how much more mental abuse am i going to take from him, but i would really like to hear an honest opinion: Is it just me? Am i bitching for nothing here? Suck it up and grow some balls?

I realize this is a one-sided story, and like i said i'm not perfect here. I've pushed the wrong buttons too because at times i've just been too fucking annoyed to be civil about it.

This whole thing feels like i'm swimming in a pool of shit but i don't want to drain it because then i got  nothing to swim in at all. I wish i had an actual friend.

There have been girls I’ve liked as more than friends, but they never seem to like me the same way. This has been happening as long is I can remember going back to even when I was a kid. I feel like there is something wrong with me, but I don’t know exactly what it is which is so frustrating for me. Many Girls have expressed that they find me attractive, but whenever I try to make a real move I’ve been shot down so many times. Personality wise - I am really nice, but also not a complete simp. I can hold a conversation pretty well and I’m not awkward. Looks wise, I am not a supermodel or anything, but I know I’m not ugly either. I am mixed race (black/white) 6,1 - 6,2 with some muscle and well trimmed facial hair. I do my best to look attractive for girls I like. Anyway, I know I’m young and have time to find “love” but I’m also tired of feeling lonely without a real connection to any females. If anyone has good advice, or ideas to why girls never give me a real chance I’d love to hear it. Thanks everyone",lonely,"Lonely, angry at myself",2021-01-25 15:41:02

I'm super lonely. I mean I am desprately lonely, I got to bed wishing I could just cuddle with a nice woman and be cared for and care for another. This has been something very rare in my life. Well a while back I had a friend who was a woman, we met online and only knew each other online. We talked often and got to know each other and well.

There is no non-gross way to say this. We would voice chat with each other and watch porn together. Yeah, I know, I guess I'm a perv, but fuck if that didn't help me cope with the lonliness. Just knowing someone was there ....was really fucking nice. its been a long time since I had anything like that, and I miss it. I know its messed up that I miss it since its probably not exactly a healthy dynamic. 2 people being like that cause they are both lonely and just want SOME sort of connection with another person.

Things after this night were never the same. Vibes were off and she was never flirty or engaged after despite saying she still liked me. I tried all i could to show her i care and tried making up for it. Offered many types of cute actually fun dates and facetime stuff but she always made excuses. 

slowly over time she snapped me less and less. Eventually we just weren’t talking at all. she said she wasn’t sure how she felt about me anymore. and then we stopped talked for like a month and around christmas i told her i missed her and wanted to try and fix whatever issues we had but she said she doesn’t feel the same way and doesn’t wanna fix it. 

so then another month went by and i hit her up last week and basically. she said when i talked to her again she was sorry for pushing me away and that she still likes talking to me and all that good shit, but it seems like that was total BS because she left me on deliver for hours at a time.

with each day, the loneliness I experience eats at me more and more. I sit around and obsess over questions like: does everyone in my life hate me? why don't I have a best friend? why doesn't anyone like me? how do others have so many friends, so many people in their life that love them, and I have no one? 

i'm smart. i have goals and dreams. i'm doing well in every other area of my life - so why is this the shit that eats away at me at night? all I want is for someone to talk to, to listen to, to care for. I want to know what about me and my personality drives everyone away. 

i'm starting to look for a therapist to try and cope with what i'm experiencing, but I wonder if they'll even be able to help me.

22M here, still a virgin and never had any relationship. This is not a motivational post, it's just some serious advice, specially for man.

Unfortunately today we live in a society and a overly sexualized culture where sex and relationships give you some sort of ""status"" which for me is totally fake. In my opinion what gives you status is your ambition, your purpose, how you carry yourself and your values as a human being. Don't be a part of this brain-washed culture and don't let the external control your inner happiness. This is all a matter of mindset.

Until a few months ago I had a lot of issues with being a virgin and never having been on a relationship, it was on my mind 24/7 and I thought less of myself because of it. I basically felt like shit. That all changed when I decided to start improving and working on myself, I started working out everyday, meditating, taking cold showers, studying and learning new things everyday, practicing nofap, not watching any porn or any sexual content, etc.

Nowadays I can say that I'm very happy and confident about myself, I'm living my best life doing the things that I'm passionate about, just being geniune and authentic and taking good care of myself. People just notice it and respect me for it, but most importantly I respect myself now. The fact that I'm still a virgin doesn't even bother me anymore, I don't feel less than other people of my age for being a virgin and for never having someone, I actually feel superior to them because I can be happy and live a great life without the need for pleasure. A lot of people today base their self esteem on how much sex and relationships they get, so please don't be like them, don't let the outside control your inside. If you just focus on your passions and work on yourself, you will find the right person for you, and you will be so awesome that he/she won't even care if you're unexperienced. Don't crave for casual sex, that won't fill your void. Crave for a healthy relationship where you can grow with a person who also wants to grow with you. Start your own self-improvement journey and greatness is coming! I promise you! I feel like a different person and I'm sure I will find someone to love soon. If you want any tips feel free to DM me, I may not respond quickly but I'm willing to help! Stay strong!",lonely,Self improvement is the key!,2021-01-25 06:05:03

810,izzzy12k,1611506910,1,"My wife cheated and eventually left me for someone else, back in 2015.. At the time, she blamed every possible flaw I had as the reason.. For her wanting to be with someone else. First off, I was caught completely by surprise. I thought things were good. Second, I carried that burden for almost 2 years.. We had been together almost 20 years and had 4 kids.

Fast forward, and over the last 6 years now.. I've let the pain, the anger go.. I have got myself into a much better place emotionally. I'm actually doing good. My now ex-wife, has apologized numerous times for her screw up and tried to take back much of the hurtful stuff she said.. Hell, we've even hooked up here and there.

But, on my own.. I have only had 1 real dating partner back in 2016.. but it didn't and wasn't gonna work out, cause of some deal breakers on my end from her mindset. 

Anyways, no matter how much I try.. Be it, one app or another.. I've gone out a few times, but it seems no matter where I go.. Nothing but couples or dudes be there. I live in the SD area, but am raising 2 kids (and at times, it was all 4) As soon as I mention I have kids and, actually raising them.. I pretty much get ghosted. I might get some talk about that's great that you are doing your part for your kids and similar responses.. but it's generally at that point.. They begin to fade away.

I hear of how other guys say, ""being a single dad, was like the best lure to get women interested"", or ""When women see that you are single father, that's gonna generate interest easily"". Well, it hasn't done nothing close to that for me. It's been the nothin but the opposite.

As a single father, I'm not able to just splurge on dates and maybe that's it.. But I've gone on dates, and then find they only wanted to be treated out, but have had real no intentions of getting closer.

I do try my best to do what I can when I do go out on dates to eat and what not. Not like, I don't.. But I sure can't afford, anything exotic or fancy. 

I was in decent shape before the pandemic, although I had gained a few pounds.. the corona being stuck at home diet, added more.. of which, recently have been trying to undo.. even without access to a gym. It's just been a slow process, and lately have been losing motivation. It's like, what's the point.. Not like anyone has had any real interest anyways.

I'm about to be 50 soon, maybe my days of feeling the warmth of love and intimacy are all behind me now. I am generally a pretty positive person, in always finding that silver lining withint situations. But lately, it's been just all just a mirage for me.

Now I live in an apartment away from my hometown. I’m a regular employee with a not really a high paying job. I also have a boyfriend, that I love dearly.

This pandemic taught me that being alone sucks. For most months I’m all alone in my apartment, though the good thing it taught me was I learned how to exercise, that’s just it. Most of the time I cry, missing everyone that you can actually talk to face to face. And since I also have limited close friends, I also don’t get to talk to them more often. Although my bf is always there, I still don’t get that feeling of being full. There’s always lacking.

After lifting the lockdown, most of the time my bf sleeps here in my apartment. But I’m again in this situation right now that I need to isolate myself because someone in our apartment got tested positive and I don’t want my bf to be coming here (he lives with his family) so that they will not be too much involved. Thankful still that we have no symptoms. I had a swab test 4 days ago and still no results.

These past few days made me had the lockdown feels again. Worse part is, I wasn’t able to prepare supplies, both my kitchen and lav sink is broken, I would order food rather than cooking because the water supply here also sucks. I don’t know what to do. I’m kinda stressed out because I can’t go out until I got my results being negative. And what if I’m positive? It’s hell for me. My bf also is hella worried but he can’t come here.

I’m really not okay. I know there’s a lot to be thankful for, but I can’t stop crying thinking about my situation. I hope I’m not positive cause a lot of people, my work will be affected.

i have always been lonely at heart

I have always felt, in a sense... disconnected. in a room full of laughter and brilliant thoughts, filled with bright minds and beautiful stories, the feeling of not belonging would suddenly hit. unexpected. surprising. frightening, at times. to think that in a planet with billions of people, in a galaxy with billions of planets, in a universe with billions of galaxies, and in a room with people i undoubtedly love and cherish, i could somehow still manage to feel lonely, was indeed scary, and unfathomable. and it still is.

to lay with the moonlight watching over me was, most of the times, not consoling at all. instead it felt heart-wrenching and, well, lonely. the feeling of loneliness in itself was hauntingly desperate, be it at day or night. when the turmoil of the inner distress and chaotic meteors colliding inside my mind would quake and produce deafening sounds, no one heard a single thing. and i think that that's probably the most terrifying thing of it all: the inability for someone touching you, holding your hands, whispering to your ear, to ever hear all those internal monologues and sad fireworks. even if i opened my mouth, even if i screamed at the top of my lungs, i would only be able to echo the remainders of the big bangs inside.

i have always been lonely at heart

it was always hard for me to feel connections, to relay what was happening outside to the inside, to translate the loud shrieks of the outside world to the silent deserts inside my inner one. it's weird, quite honestly. sometimes the world and i are one, the skies and i are none, and the moon and i were thousands. sometimes i felt like i was too much for this body, like heavens and millions of earths have somehow merged and converged in my soul, like i loved as no other person could, like i could never be lonely with all the people i could squeeze inside my titanic heart. but at other times it felt like those worlds converging to my soul were deserted, like i could hold heaps and fill millions of people with my love, but all of that love was left for me, as everyone disappeared, as everyone was absent. and what use were heaps of love and appreciation when i couldn't shower myself with a few compliments at such times?

i have always been lonely at heart

i have no clue if this resonated to you, but at some point i thought that, no matter the people in my life, no matter the laughs and the sorrows, no matter the love and the experiences, the minds and the souls, there will always be this barrier, this obstacle holding people from merging into each other, the impossibility to fully understand someone else with his differences and similarities. there will always be a blockage. and as depressing as such thought could be, i guess it could explain why i would refer to art as ""a way of translating one's soul"", to music as an entity that ""reaches its hand into one's soul"", and to literature, hard work, passion, as ""an embodiment of the desires of one's soul"", even if at the end souls aren't meant neither to be understood, nor translated, nor embodied. souls are meant to be. and in their being, perhaps were they deemed to reek of loneliness.

i have always been lonely at heart,

but the thought of being someday understood still dazzles me. the thought of warm hugs and hands held, hot chocolate and theme parks with friends, passionate conversations and cute stutters, brings me a sensation of connection, of energy vibrating from one's soul to another's, of spiritual bonding and profound understanding. the mountains and constellations inside one's world, the nebulae and rivers inside another's, could perhaps fuse and create blinding beautiful northern lights in a sky watching over a planetarium where both people watched the stars, announcing the start of one's quest to understand another.

i will always dream of that.

but please don't pity me. i am definitely okay, or at least i try to be, even though i have always been lonely at heart.",lonely,i have always been lonely at heart,2021-01-25 00:31:51

I hate talking about it because it freaks me out and I feel like I’m too dramatic but today it finally made me come off as a halfwit Asshole in front of my friends.

The three of us were discussing an essay due tomorrow together and telling each other what we were working on. Because of my depression I find it hard to work and I was behind and still unable to come up with a topic.

Today I finally did come up with a topic and finished making all the notes and told them and it ended up that I had accidentally chosen the same topic as my other friend.

He had even explained it to me and I remember making him explain to me because I really wasn’t able to understand what his point was that time. But the thing is, I don’t remember a word of what he said.
I can remember the event but nothing of what he said so I somehow in the span of a day totally forgot his topic and ended up working on the same thing. 

I feel so pathetic and humiliated. I’ve been also having a fight with my other friends which has made my depression worsen because I have no one I really trust to talk to right now.

I feel like such an idiot and I left our group chat and personally messaged my friend telling him about my memory loss and trying to say I wasn’t trying to be an asshole but I feel like I’m just being pathetic and sympathy mongering by explaining to him. 
Any excuse to not admit I’m actually an asshole.

I feel so so embarrassed and also worried about my memory loss. This isn’t the first time I’ve had this problem. 
I also have a period of time where everything I remember seems really hazy because I was on antidepressants that didn’t suit me at all. I’m scared they might have done some kind of damage to my brain because of how blurry that time is and how my short term memory has gotten a bit worse since then.

I’ve also upset my crush and other friends by not remembering things they had just told me recently or important conversations because it’s completely erased from my mind and I struggle to remember it.

I tried hanging around my cousin's older dad friend that came and just watched him play pool. I think this is why my gf left me. I couldn't be the guy only she got to see, but with other people. I can't help but remember how my cousin kept saying he was glad that I decided to stay here instead of moving states. Although I feel lame and boring for some reason, my cousin doesn't mind.

I always reached out to my so called friends asking about them, their family, their work but not once someone called me or texted me asking me how I was.   
It's even funnier that even when I used to call/text and ask about their well being, I used to get that they are doing great but they didn't even care to respond with ""hey what about you? are you fine or not?"" And it's not like I didn't confront them that why they are ignoring me, why they leave me on read or why they don't pick up my calls. The answer I got was that they forgot to text back or they didn't see my call. And no it's not like they really forgot because it can't happen every time right? it's just that they didn't think I was worth replying. Well at least some of them said that to me directly rather than lying. It hurts when people who you thought as friends ignore you and then lie to your face while laughing.

I don't even remember last time someone called me on my b'day while I always used to wish them by calling, not a cold text message but call. Hell ""my friends"" didn't even care about asking me when my birthday was. And despite all of that I always called them years after years and yeah I don't have any social media so I remembered all of my so called friends' birthdays.  


I always had people who came to me for help and I didn't even think twice before helping them. That's why everyone calls me a ""nice guy""(not the one from r/niceguys) But now when I needed help and reached out to them, everyone ghosted me. My texts were left on read, my calls were unattended.

I maybe be overreacting but then I don't have any anyone to talk to and it's driving me crazy.   


Talking about my romantic life, well I have never been in a relationship. never been kissed or hugged leave about anything else. I never cared about it until now but now when I don't have anyone to talk to, I have realized that maybe it is too late for me to get into a relationship too. If I can't make friends then how will I be able to make gf. Also I am 29 years old so guess it is too late now.  


I am just going though what one can say ""midlife crisis"" and hope I recover from it as soon as possible.

857,CaringFriend1000,1611477359,1,"Hello, I want to give you some encouragement and hope. Loneliness, sadness, depression, perpetual shame of “there’s something wrong with me” - these feelings can often be overwhelming. 

When dealing with mental health, think about this. it can sometimes feel like being in the back of a cave. The back of the cave is so dark, the air is stagnant. And the voices in the cave remind you of everything that is “wrong with you”.  But two things are true about the back of the cave, 1) everything you hear is the back of the cave is bullshit. 2) everything is temporary. 

There are days that you are at the mouth of the cave and you can see a little more clearly and breathe a bit easier. There are those days that you are miles away from the cave with a 360 degree view breathing clean and pure air. 

There’s two things which get us out the cave a bit quicker. 1) a compassionate, and kind narrative to yourself. Not only in what you tell yourself but in giving yourself grace for what you are not able to do, taking rest if you need it. 2) to push yourselves a little - and make yourself a little uncomfortable making the unsafe safe. 

My name is Lee, I’m a psychotherapist who continues to wrestle with depression, shame and loneliness myself. If you would like a friend to chat to then you are welcome to connect. 

Love yourself today - I promise there is beauty within you!

I am well and truly alone and I don't know what to do. I only have (Had? I don't even know anymore) one friend. We were super close, talked about everything down to the sandwichs we didn't like, to our crushes and personal details that no one shares. All of a sudden that stopped when she got a bf, not even a hello outside of school. I didn't know if I did something or if it was him doing that or anything. I always tried to talk to her and there was almost no conversation. Then they're relationship started getting rocky and she started talking to me again, about everything but especially her relationship. Eventually they broke up and she went distant again while I tried to keep talking I just got ignored alot. Then we started talking again recently started opening up like we used to, now she admitted to her crush she likes him and they are dating now and now we don't talk..I don't know who I am but I'm definitely don't feel like an option for conversation even tho she was always my first or second (rarely)

Around the time she got her bf I got my gf (first major relationship) who I guess in alot of ways was like my friend. We were super close, did as much as possible together (long distance relationship) but it all came crashing down after 3 years.

Now here I am, writing this post, my friend hasn't talked to me in months and I haven't spoke to anyone outside of school about anything...I've tried making friends but I guess I'm just not friend material, and it is hard to get closer to people when nobody even wants to be a friend..

I don't doubt I'll fall in love, date, maybe even get married. But after a series of recent events in my life, I can't bring myself to believe any of those will actually be as meaningful as I hope them too be.

890,Assembled44,1611463994,1,"It’s just tough to keep going. Life is like a book and everyday you write a new page. The only exception is you don’t get to revisit chapters.

We try to write character into our lives for a while by bonding with them, in some cases loving them, yet it only lasts for so long.

Yet sometimes because of what we did or who we are, those things become impossible to do.  I wish I could go back and edit those chapters of my life, change my story, yet I can’t.

As a character, my biggest flaw is also my biggest strength, I care about people. It should be no surprise that I love stories. This is the reason I love to bond with people, I adore getting close and hearing the stories no one else has ever heard. Sometimes, if we get close enough I even get the chance to be part of there next grand adventure. 

We are all the protagonist of our own lives and any English teacher can tell you that there is only one protagonist in a tale. How often I wonder if Luke or Morpheus ever got lonely.

I would always ask him if we were just the same person. It was amazing. And after everything I was still so scared to just take the one step he needed me to. Not just scared. Literally traumatized. 
Because of that I’m afraid he’s completely lost trust in me and I’ve lost that relationship forever. I can’t stop thinking about it no matter how hard I try. I feel like a new person and I don’t know how to go back.",lonely,I hurt him. I didn’t mean to.,2021-01-24 15:32:46
893,Fabulous-Advantage,1611461010,1,"I am in college and I don't have any friends. But yet I don't want them that much, I like time alone, I do want people next to me but I don't think I can really hang with them, I have to work on myself first (like I always have, no matter what I do it's never good enough). 

But I am traumatized in the process. It's the second time it's happening. The first time was last year someone realized I didn't have many friends and began to take advantage of it by excluding me, talking behind my back, planning things without telling me. I worked with him in club leadership and I was messed with. I went to the adviser too late and they were telling me not to, and nothing was 'wrong'. That I was reading the situation wrong. I still don't know what's wrong, even bringing it up to professionals they didn't side with me. I was really worried about seeing him and when I heard people talking, or approaching me, I would hear his voice, and get super scared I would look up and he would be with a friend and he would see me with a smirk on his face, knowing he got me. He would see me alone, maybe on a weekend, or at night and know I didn't have many friends. And he would say ""hey \_my name\_"" in a fake concerned way, like others have done to me. 

The situation is over now since I stepped out of the club and kept communication professional, but he didn't stop to mess with me until the end. Yes, it's sad, I figured I wasn't getting paid for it so, y'know. But one professional did have me consider what if. what if I could stay as a leader. What if I could open up about this. What if. But at the time it was making me all insecure to handle. 

Now it's happening again. A job now, and my coworker is behaving similarly, dismissing what I say, blatantly not responding (and not afraid to let me know it's on purpose) that's a huge red sign. So I reached out quick to the supervisor. I had to ask her twice which makes me uneasy. And wants us to talk it first. I don't think he's going to stop doing what he does, they don't until you show you have other ways at power. But I was alone again in public, and I started hearing his voice, scared he will see me and be like, yup he's alone and insecure/low self-esteem. I can mess with him more. He wasn't there but I felt it. 

How can I stop living in fear of being found out? I can't hide forever but when I opened up, I was used. I feel traumatized since I feel like both supervisors didn't care that much. And how can they, when the other guy churned out quality content and probably made them feel better too. When I'm left with anxiety and possible depression to make ends meet? This isn't going to end well. 

All these things did to me was make me stop trying. I didn't give up, but after it, if that was how people viewed me, and if I tried so hard to be normal, either it's extensive amounts of therapy, or it's something else that's going to get me to start feeling and behaving in a healthy way.",lonely,Living in fear of being found out,2021-01-24 15:03:30

I have had maybe 3 true dates in my getting on the years life. I had a on again off again relationship in my mid 20’s even engaged, I gave everything I had to her and was always there while due to some issues was with others. I had only one friend at this time and had moved many states away. When my relationship ended I was so worried that I would upset her I moved back with my friend. Now I know some of you will rightfully say “wait you had a friend and a relationship? You have no right to talk on her.” I probably would agree on your shoes. After another relationship that showed me how little people ever wanted to be around me, including work, The Army when I was in and lost my only friend due to this relationship that was doomed. She ended up swinging then bi then cheating with many men and women after I helped her through college, a high profile job and making sure any holiday or event was as special as I could give. I then moved again and actually 20 years later reconnect with the first woman, yes married but abused mentally and physically. I helped her get back to her family, a job, place to live, college, an apartment and all of me. And now my pattern revealed. Once she was on her feet a year later what was to be my first birthday celebrated per her as being important, when I called her to confirm the plans she had forget it was my birthday and hooking up with a couple guy after I was engaged to her a second time, more official this one as well. Then my mother had a serious attack and hospitalized and unknown if she would survive and when I went to call her to check on the pets and some emotional support she was with another guy. Never gave a reason why she decided to leave. I have found I am a tool, as in people only interact with me if I have something to offer them such as money or support, but once my usefulness is gone I’m thrown away as a disposable piece of trash. I have no friends, no chance anymore for love. I have a high stress job in the medical field but no one at work would notice if I disappeared. I help people with my job but no one ever sees me. If people are not criticizing me in public then I am just invisible. I had 3 serious attempts on my life in high school and was picked on even by teachers. At one point offered money for a plane ticket to anywhere as long as I never came back. When your nothing but a tool to people then left as garbage, I thought I had love to give, only to find no one wants it, they only want things and nothing else.

He made the invite a couple of times, he even asked for my phone number and invited me to attend his birthday! He got TOUCHY with me. There was AFFECTION. When I tell you I was crushing on him...he is the definition of ""man crush"". A friend you want to stick with.

However, he has been resenting me for some time now which is very confusing as I dont remember doing or saying anything offensive! Like what is the matter? Just last Sunday we were dinning (he invited me out), everything was well and when I bumped into him on today and proposed to grab a coffee he told me off and he was being RUDE at that! Out of the clear blue sky! ""Stop bothering me, I've got way too much to do all day, I dont have time for this!"" Man, last time we talked you were UNEMPLOYED. Youre sitting in your apartment all day and rarely ever leaving your spot. What is it that youre so busy with?

How are you gonna invite me out a couple of times and on the very next day youre acting like Im a pain and not worthy to be around your ass? What did I miss?

The only thing that comes to mind that might have pissed him off is that Ive offered to help once as he is struggling and Im REALLY worried for him...he is giving me ""heavy depression"" vibes, hes got a drinking problem and Im really concered for his health! I even proposed to borrow him money so he can pay rent and get his shit together...but then again, what person would feel offended over someone offering help. Oh well.

As an international student, we have to pay three times as much in tuition fees, and yet we're being denied over and over again for a job opportunity in the States due to our non-resident status. It's such a huge annoyance when we're also being told to get a job experience in home country, at a much lower pay rate. Sadly we didn't even get proper acknowledgement from the university once we graduated, other than a quick, monotone virtual ceremony, as a polite way to tell us fuck off.

I thought things were going to be better once I've returned to my home country and started Master's degree in my home country. But I was dead wrong. All classes were conducted in online. I didn't even have a slightest bit of motivation to get things done anymore. I don't know who to talk now, because I decided to walk away from all of my so called ""friends"" I've met during my university years. They were toxic, and they are certainly not good for my mental health in the long run. I can't even go out to meet my old friends, because my country is still in lockdown for god knows how long. Staying at home 24/7 makes me feel crippled. I don't know if I'm suffering from survivors guilt?

This is my alt account, but my main account is the moderator of multiple subs. I am looking for some creative, entrepreneurial people with a passion for or experience with online communities.

Please realize also, that I am not entirely looking for help with moderating either. There are subs for advice with moderating. There is a reason I chose this sub. I view this as a challenge, that should be thought of similar to any challenge that a business may face at some point.

To go there I had to leave my old school, almost everyone there hated me, but it was also where my only friends were. As I struggled with self harm and mental issues my “friends” all left me, but I think they didn’t really like me anyways and that was the last straw. I only had two really great friends left, then one started stealing from me and trying to come onto my girlfriend. Then I had one best friend, and now he lives in another country. It’s been this way since COVID began, it’s the loneliest time in my life. Now it’s my senior year and I have my girlfriend and she’s wonderful, but I can’t function on just her, a person needs friends. And she has her own friends, so I’d rather be doing something myself instead of waiting for her to come home from her friends houses. I’ve taken to the internet to try to make some friends, but it’s been impossible since. Everyone online is just so negative and mean, I’ve met a million bullies and no friends.

I’m around 40.  I’ve been married a long time.  I have kids.  I’m a long-time recovering sex addict, and I still slip and mess up.  

I have a long history of trauma in my life.

So here I am.  Because of past indiscretions and mistakes, my marriage has been on the verge of collapse for years.  I love my wife, and I know she loves me.  But, it feels like things can never get better.  Too much damage - too much hurt - almost all my fault.  And I feel hopeless most of the time.

I’m not severely depressed, and definitely not suicidal.  I guess I just want to feel loved and appreciated.  I want acceptance, and I want to live without guilt and shame and fear of retribution.

Don’t get me wrong.  I take responsibility for my life and my actions.  I know what I’ve done, and I know it’s wrong.  I’m eternally sorry, but I’ve never really felt forgiven and most of the time I don’t feel worthy of it.

I’m posting this here because I really do feel lonely.  Besides my therapist, I don’t have anyone to talk to deeply and honestly about my life.  I crave true intimacy and friendship, as well as many other things that continue to bring guilt into my life 🙄.  I’m a living contradiction.

1007,SamMoritz,1611386089,1,"I'm in my 40s now and I've come to the conclusion that I should stop trying. Hope is only useful if there is something backing it up. Keep thinking that maybe this week I'll make a friend and it never happening really grinds you down after this long. 

When I try to make friends I often think of that quote ""If you run into an a-hole in the morning, you ran into an a-hole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the a-hole."" Not that they're a-holes or I'm an a-hole, but if I can't make friends with anyone, maybe it's my problem.

Things were good early in life. Being clever and friendly were good traits in the 80s and I had a good number of friends. By the time I was a teenager, at my school intelligence was something to be singled out and I spent several years being bullied daily. 

Things picked up in college but three were a lot of people drifting through my life until they found someone better. I thought I had some close friends, ones I helped a lot with their coursework, but as soon as we finished college they were always too busy to meet up. This was back in the days before mobile phones so it's really stuck in my mind I had a summer of phoning someone every couple of weeks and then waiting for them to call me. That call never came. 

I stupidly thought I'd made some friends recently but that went wrong when I needed a small favour from them in 2019. I was doing some charity volunteer work and needed a couple of personal references (I've done a lot more for them over the years). My 'friends' were sarcastic and unhelpful and I ended up needing to ask relative strangers instead. It effectively ended our relationship. It was mostly how awkward I felt after - like I'd asked them to do something completely unreasonable - so I stopped talking to them. They never got back in touch. 

Then 2020 happened. During lockdown there were some people online saying reach out to people you've not spoken to for a while to see if they're OK. I did to a few people and was either ignored or got a brief reply before they vanished from my life again. Unsurprisingly, nobody reached out to me. 

Recently I tried to make some online friends, something I've tried many times before, and it always follows the same pattern. No response, or some early positive messages before ghosting, or some early positive messages leading to them replying with 50 words, then 25, then 5, then it's ""lol"" and emoticons. 

I think it's time for me to move on. A lockdown and pandemic is not the best time to go on a personal adventure but I think I'm better off without social media. I'm too old for it and it creates this false hope. Maybe in a year I'll be a better, more interesting person but whatever happens, I hope I can finally accept I have to manage without relying on people. I'll delete my social media accounts when I'm next on computer (they make it hard from mobile apps deliberately to try to keep you). Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

1015,ccaitgames,1611382641,1,"I’m feeling kind of depressed right now for a silly reason... I need to get it out so hopefully I don’t ruin my weight loss.

So, I have no friends. I don’t have family that regularly contacts me. And none of them really share my interests anyway. So it’s just me, my husband, and 5 year-old daughter here.

I get kinda frustrated because my husband and I are both nerds, but expressing our fandoms are really one-sided. Literally, sometimes gaming is the only thing that keeps me going sometimes. Having no one to really discuss it with, I just usually talk to him. I am really open to learning about things he likes, and listen contently when he tells me about them. I’m an introvert, so I don’t really care about putting input in there. I think it’s cute to listen to him tell me about these things. It just seems that he doesn’t see it the same way. He gets kind of annoyed when I tell him things about my games or try to show him. But it seems more than that. He seems annoyed if I tell him anything I know about, factual or fictional. I don’t really know how to express that this hurts my feelings. I literally have no one else to tell but the 5 yr old. So I kinda just usually clam up. But it’s getting to a point I don’t really know what to talk about, because he wants to talk about things he knows/is interested in but I can’t really talk about my own interests. I am just venting, because I love him to death, but I just wish I had a chance to talk about things I like too. Maybe because we have been together for 8 yrs, that’s just what happens. But it kinda sucks when you don’t have another person to kinda share things with. Forgot to mention, I am a stay at home mom without a car (I did have one but it broke down on me last month with expensive engine issues). So I’m just here with my thoughts all the time. So I guess that’s why I decided to put them here, because I really have nowhere else to I guess. If you have made it this far, thanks for reading..kinda shocked you did.

1019,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1611381381,1,"Hi there! I'm a 31 M from the Midwest. To be upfront, I'm looking for a friendship first. So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships. But this pandemic has changed the landscape and I've considered exploring the online route. 

What I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens. 

Some of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

Everyone starts talking about all of the vaccines and autism shit, the talks about privilege and all that, and I just don't want to hear it. To me, Reddit has been a sanctuary. A place I can go when I'm feeling down that can help me turn my frown upside down. But now I'm starting to have a bad feeling that it'll turn out to be a toxic environment like everywhere else.

I've always felt like a kind of different person, with barely any good friends throughout my life (I'm 21 atm). A few years ago I did meet someone, but we ended up in an unhealthy relationship. It did last for smth between two and three years, but I didn't notice during that time I focused my all onto the relationship. They were my only real friend I've ever had after all, how could I not?
Surprise, it didn't work out. I've found a new relationship by now, but every now and then I find myself in a heavy depression due to loneliness because I simply have no good or best friend. Noone to share my hobbies with, even though my partner and I share some things we don't yet cover my main activities. Noone for late night depression talks, of course my partner is usually there but as soon as they're unavailable I am alone.
The worst part is, I have a tendency to reconnect with toxic people from my past when I get this lonely. Which of course does not make me feel better long term, but it's just so easy to let yourself lull into those sweet words..

- I'm afraid of having sex, because I don't have any experience, which is unusual for people my age. I think that I'm not a good catch and that any woman deserves better because of that. Even though I'm dating right now (or at least I'm trying), I hope that this whole sex thing won't come too soon (pun intended).

- I sometimes cry when I see people kiss in romantic movies, because I also want to experience this kind of sincere happiness. 

- I'm constantly jealous of people who are more successful with women. I know it's dumb and a bad character trait, but I can't help it. I try not to be jealous and be happy for them instead, but it's not always working. 

- Somehow, I think experiencing love is the most important thing in life and if I can't get that, everything else doesn't matter. I know that's wrong but at the same time this thought makes total sense in my head.

All of the above makes me a cliché and I hate that. I don't really feel like a loser, but I'm sure a lot of people would if I told them this. Somehow it bothers me more what other people think of me than what I think about myself. That's not good for me, but I have a hard time to change that. 

Like I said, I'm trying to get better and to finally be honest with myself and others. This vent is a step towards better times (I hope).

1050,flisherman666,1611363007,1,"Always there, never there. Thats how its been all my life. Im always there, they never are. They, as in people in my contacts who make the bold claim to say we are friends, we arent. 

Im always there. Always. Im not doing this anymore. Stay on the shelf and find someone else to vent to because Im not going to be used anymore, its disgusting how some people can act this way. Ive listened for years, every single time, but when Im in trouble (and I am often) they are nowhere to be found.

Im fine with this. I knew it was happening, called them out, etc. I knew they werent my friends for a long time, but wanted someone to talk to, you know that feeling of relief you get when you have someone to text or call on the phone right?

It blows my mind that this person can claim I am her best friend, but the only time I hear from her is when she isnt feeling well. Well, I removed her from my contacts, same with the others. I wasnt even trying to pursue her romantically, I was just trying to be a kind and helping person. Im done treating others like I would treat myself. 

This has gone on since I was 17-18, so about six years. I always kept faith, hoping eventually they would change their ways. I was in denial plain and simple, and it does hurt. What keeps me going is knowing that I am a better friend, kind, and loving person than they have been. I give myself a pat on the back. 

The saddest part is people who dm me on here asking to be such a great ""friend"", yet they go and do the same thing. Its all talking about themselves, and I sit there and nod my head, tell them what they want to hear, hoping that at some point in time they can ask me how I am doing.

1051,scienceguy67,1611362698,1,"Sorry in advance if this is all over the place. 

So I am a senior in college and super excited to graduate here soon. But I have been pretty lonely lately, like really lonely and it’s starting to make me depressed. Most of my friends have graduated or are doing internships or student teaching so they are no longer on campus. So when I mean I have no friends at school, I have none they all are gone. I live in an apartment by myself which probably doesn’t help either. I am a dude in nursing school, so you can imagine many of the students in my class are girls and the very few guys that are in my class aren’t in my clinical section, and because of COVID I don’t get to see them at all, I’m not friends with the guys but I thought if maybe we were in the same clinical group I could maybe start a friendship that way. And because of COVID all of my courses are online, I have no classes face to face. 

To make up for the lack of human interaction I find myself studying for hours a day, I am talking like 9-10hr+. I go home, go to the gym, and eat the same thing for dinner every night and study some more. I watch 30 minutes of Netflix or a YouTube video and then it’s bedtime. I do this 6 days a week, the exception is on Saturday I stop studying around 2p. I am sure this is adding to the depression. The only thing I have to look forward to is the summer. I have a pretty cool job and have a ton of friends there, which I plan to move to once I graduate. 

I have thought about joining a club, I really enjoy road cycling. I reached out to the club president, but they said they weren’t meeting right now because of COVID, I am hoping this changes when the weather gets warmer and we can cycle outside again. 

I am sitting here, alone on a Friday night. With no one to talk to but myself.

It's so embarrassing that this call I just had was basically the only contact I've had with someone outside my family for so long. I'm very embarrassed because I even opened up about how I lost connections with my old friends (I didn't divulge this much but I'm extremely lonely) and I struggle so much with ever opening up like that. It's awkward because this person is a volunteer, it's not like they're my actual friend, but I feel like I rely on them and even that amount of talking and opening up makes me emotional. At the same time, I get very socially anxious even for these simple calls... It's like I simultaneously really appreciate the calls and dread them.

1093,Air-Constant,1611332388,1,"I am tired. 

I am tired of being ignored by everyone.

I am tired of all the people that say: ""I love you"" or ""I care about you"" and then proceed to ghost me in the exact moment when I show my sadness / have a bad period.

I am tired of acting like everything's ok, because so many things aren't.

I am tired of hearing: ""You must be confident and love yourself first"". How am I supposed to love myself if all I get is being mocked and ignored by everyone because I'm ""weird"" (fun fact: most people say that weird people are not conformed to the mass and are original and cool too. The only problem is that they're the first ones to mock you behind your back, saying that you are not normal). 

I am tired to be used by many people. They always give me the illusion to be genuinely interested. But then they always dump me as soon as they've got what they needed (having a brilliant Academic career sometimes sucks too).

I am tired of being love starved. 

I am tired to see happy couples saying me: ""Well, you are hot and clever. Enjoy you Life as single, that's not that bad"", knowing that my only long term relationship crumbled after 4 years this Summer and all the other ones were super toxic (I've been cheated on like 6 times).

I am tired of this society obsessed with looks, fame and Instagram.

I am tired of fake friends that call me ""Bro"" when we are toghether and then ignore me in other social interactions with other groups because ""MUH, yoU ArE ToO OlD FasHiOnEd and NoT CoOl"" (obvioulsy I f...ed 'em off).

I am tired of being rejected by 9/10 of the girls. The thing that blows my head is that those same girls told me that I'm handsome (had sex with some of them too), but still, they didn't want to engage a relationship with me and I am still lonely af. Is it too much asking for love and not only sex? Because sex alone without true love is not that big deal.

I am tired of being depressed. That's debilitating and as a man, 9/10 of the times the only advice I got is ""Man up"". What the f of confidence is this?!

1096,codecrunchie,1611331294,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a long post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reason my friend [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ spent over 8 months working in their spare time on a friend finding project. Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28Qs, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. It's basically this info:

* more about you
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Concerns:**

A few people have concerns about the above - but you can (and probably should be anyway) be completely anonymous if you choose - just use a throwaway contact info, and also there is a very simple and short privacy policy as well. And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) and mine as well.

**What is the final result?**

The algorithm searches over 3900 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches (active in the past 2weeks)** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

**Final tips:** I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with notifications recently - but these usually get fixed quickly.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

1108,getyourhead1nthegame,1611319343,1,"I know you should never self-diagnose, but sometimes I think I got PTSD. Sounds weird, because I'm not a soldier coming home from war or so. I don't know...is it possible to get PTSD from a relationship or something similar. 

This has been going on for over a year. I have this guy-friend/dude-that-i'm-in-love-with/relation-undefinded-person and he always says that he is interested in me and wants a future with me, etc.. He is the only ""friend"" I have and we get along very well. But he lies all the time. He dates 6 different girls simultaneously at all times. Every time he said there were no other girls and I found out that actually there were, I confronted him and begged him to just be honest with me. Somehow he can always convince me that he will change. He never does though. It just happens again and again. To the point where every time I see an Instagram post of some of these girls or I find out he lies (about anything not only girls) or I think about the possibility of lying and other girls, I start shivering uncontrollably and my heart is racing, I can't move and cry for at least 30 min. Even when I have one of these attacks in the morning, I can not sleep the following night. I wake up once every hour. My guess is that my body is convinced I'm hiding from an enemy and wakes me up, so I can check whether I'm safe. I don't know...is that PTSD?

On top of this, I have always dealt with social anxiety and now I'm in a deep depression hole. I lost a lot of weight, bc I have no appetite and can barely get out of bed or take showers. Lately, I have not been seeing any future for myself. I'm a very goal-driven person, therefore it's difficult for me to keep on going when everything seems like a blur. Every day goes by and I'm not doing anything. I'm not really here anymore. I just observe. It's like sitting in an empty cinema watching myself. The last few days I have been thinking about ending things. The loneliness gets to me. I have noone except for this guy i described above, but he doesn't really care about me ig. Having no one to talk hurts. I can also not turn to my family. My younger sister is struggling herself. My mum is a narcissist and mentally abusive and my dad is idk he has schizoaffective disorder and is dealing with his own stuff.

I think I should start therapy again. A couple years ago I was in therapy for 4 years and had 2 different therapists. I want to go back to my last therapist. She was great. But last time I was underage and didn't have to arrange therapy. Now, I would have to do that all by myself, but I don't know how to. I know I have to message her, but what do I say? If I straight up tell her how bad I'm doing she might suggest going to a hospital, but I don't want that.   

Giving up seems to be easier than ever.

1116,jhinniee,1611314287,1,"I (19F) have always been introverted, at school it always felt like that feeling you get when your parents' friends are over and you're made to sit there and listen. I always use to just go on my phone, stare outside, or think of little stories with characters. I don't have that day dreaming thing, I just like to make up stories helps me sleep or zone out. I have always found it hard to trust people, I was slightly emotionally abused as a child by my mum and just a lot of shit happened. I never really talked about my private life with friends, especially near the end of high school. I became very withdrawn nearing the end of my final year, and I was just tired of it all. My two best friends got a boyfriend, my closest best friend moved to Canada when we were younger, and my other friends I just sort of felt judged me a bit. After I graduated I distanced myself from people I just felt were draining me and thought hey I'll meet new people when uni starts, I even somehow convinced myself to join a club. I tried my hardest and then week one starts and lockdown is announced. I was then diagnosed with endometriosis and I just realised I wasn't number one in anyone's viewpoint. 

Is that selfish of me to want that? I really just want to be thought of, remembered. Like when you send a tiktok to a friend, you find that so funny and you go hey \_\_\_\_ will love this. What really hurts I think I was used. I met a new person through one of my best friends and he was amazing. He just had a bad breakup and I was there to talk about it with him. I think that's why he talked to me, because I would talk. If he texted me I would usually answer quite quickly and no matter the time I would just keep talking because in a way I needed it too. I was lonely and he would actually answer me back. I didn't have to start the conversation all the time. I think he flirted with me and I won't lie I had a crush but I don't want a relationship tbh. I want to focus on my mental health. I told him that and then slowly he texted less, started talking to another girl I knew. This sounds weird but I'm hoping that I was just annoying, I'm overthinking or I did something. I didn't want to be just used to deal with a break up, I wanted to be talked to because we're friends. I wanted him to talk to me for me not because I was a good distraction. I don't want the reason for him to stop talking to me is because he realised I wasn't a good distraction or I friend zoned him or something. I want the reason to be I'm annoying or exhausting to talk to, or I did something wrong or I'm just overthinking everything. It's not like I expect I'm the only one he can talk to, I meant why did he go from talking every day or two to just one a week and snap chats so quickly? I really just want to be the arsehole here and just be overthinking.

My best friend doesn't really talk to me either. I understand she's busy and dealing with a lot but I just want to know she's ok. I probably hear from her once a week and I get worried because she works night shifts and she's being dealing with a lot of shit. I just feel like I did something wrong to cause this, that I was too annoying, too exhausting, so I've just decided to let her be the one to text me when she wants to in case she needs space too. The only person who talks to me regularly is my friend in Canada, and I talked to her friends a couple of times but theres a timezone difference and it just feels like we've both changed a bit. I even tried talking to some of my old friends but it's just the same, I text them first we talk then silence.

I feel like I just have even more trust issues, more cautious of other people' and more self conscious about the way I talk to people. When my grandma died in the start of December, I wanted to be consoled by my friends but I just felt then they would just talk to me out of pity, not because they wanted to talk to *me*.  I think I'm just gonna stop messaging people. If they want to talk to me they will. I just want someone to tell me I'm overthinking this, I'm overreacting, I'm being a freak but I also want someone to tell me my doubt is real and it's valid. I want someone to tell me I'm wasting energy on caring these people and I should walk away. I just want uni to start I really like uni just learning things I want to learn about, meeting people with similar interests and ideas, it's fun. I want to go to my club to learn about politics and meet people with similar political ideas or to learn new perspectives. That socialising isn't exhausting to me. It makes me tired but the type of tired that makes me sleep well, not the one that keeps me up. 

Sorry for the long rant I think I got it out my system. I've been wanting to vent but I think I didn't want to accept the doubts I had.

1119,delicate-snowflake,1611311903,1,"Not sure where to begin..  
I will just drop down whatever I wanted to say since this is the first time I feel like venting here.  
I am feeling lonely and at times I also feel depress. I am living alone, go to work alone, and rent an apartment alone without any roommates. My family live in other countries, I only talk to them on phone after work. Other than that, I would say that I  really don't  have a friend who I can hang out with and talk about everything without worries.  I wish I have someone that would spend time with me though. Especially at my age , 29 ... I think that I might end up alone forever without any real friends in my life... I feel scared to think about dying alone as I grow older. I also try to stop myself thinking negatively, then play some music/ watch some tv shows , just to forget the loneliness. People always says that I am a strong person who can handle to live alone, without any families/ friends... but honestly, I hate to hear that..  :/  I do really wish that there are someone who will talk to me and take good care of my feeling, even though I am good in pretending that ""I am fine"". I mean I do wish that I could make a friend with someone who knows how to read my mind well through my words or feel something wrong with me without me telling him/her.   
However, there is a contradiction to what I have written above, I feel lonely and yet I often think that I hate ""people"". People always hurt people, they come and go...

1120,wanderlustmirage,1611309228,1,"I’ve never had a birthday present, at least for the past 20 years. The last time I got something for my birthday was when I was 5 years old and my mom got me toys and a pair of shoes. After that, my birthday became just another day. My parents were always fighting so they simply “forgot” when my birthday came or just didn’t care. I remember when I was in elementary school, I saw my friends getting a lot of gifts from their parents on their birthdays. I came home and asked my dad why I got nothing for my birthday, just to get scolded for being disrespectful (for asking that question) and demanding, and that I shouldn’t ask for more than what my parents already gave me. I’ve stopped expecting birthday gifts or gifts in general ever since. I associate people giving me something with them having bad intentions, like trying to take advantage of me. I grew up with that mindset. After I graduated and got a job, my mom told me now that I could make money to buy myself what I want, I wouldn’t have to wait for someone to give me stuff anymore. So I just save up as much as I can to give myself experiences I've never had. I saved enough to buy a new phone and treat myself a nice dinner on my first birthday after graduation. I get myself flowers and other little things when I feel like it. I go shopping alone. I do everything on my own.
The thing with me now is I get anxious when someone is a bit overly kind to me. My brain tells me not to believe in kindness for no reason. It's even to the point where I'm weirded out by people saying happy birthday to me because I feel like those words are all fake.
So yesterday was my coworker's birthday. She got so many gifts, including a very nice cake and 2 huge flower bouquets, from her husband, family and friends. Another coworker of mine is searching up and down for the perfect present and talking about his plans on throwing a party for his daughter’s birthday next month. Thinking back on all these years, I always spent my birthday alone. I got nothing, no cake, no flower, no birthday card, absolutely nothing. My birthday was last October and all I got was an automatic hbd email from HR. People around me did not care enough to even say or text me anything. I didn’t think much of it until today. I don't feel jealous. I feel sad. I feel like my presence is unnecessary. I exist in this world just because I do. No one needs or appreciates me. I feel sad for my mom too.  My dad never got her anything for her birthday or their anniversary (I really can’t understand why she still stays with him). In my famiy, celebrating a birthday is ""too expensive and unnecessary"". My dad even says we have birthday every year so why make it special. But then on my graduation day, which is NOT an annual event, he refused to be at the ceremony because he ""ain't got anything to do there"". I didn't expect much from him, but that time he was straight up heartless.
In my head, I hope people don't remember my birthday so there won't be any empty wishes coming out of their mouths. In my heart, it does hurt a little seeing others getting so much love and joy on their birthday. I guess even though I live in denial that I can do very well on my own and I don't need anyone, I'm still a human being with emotions.
I feel so cold and lonely tonight. I don't cry when I'm sad anymore but tears are uncontrollably falling out of my eyes as I'm typing this.
I have no one to talk to so I desperately need to vent this out somewhere. Thanks for reading till the end. I hope all of you will get/got a lot of love on your birthday.",lonely,I always know my life is sad. It just hits me a little harder today…,2021-01-22 20:53:48

I remember my parents, teachers, coaches, and authoritative figures all cared and watched over me. Now I don't need mommy to take care of me anymore but I remember always having someone there to rely on made me feel secure. Now as an adult I can't find anyone that cares about you outside of your girlfriend/boyfriend or kids  (if you have them). 

Your boss doesn't care about you, your coworkers don't care about you, and people in public sure don't care about you. Maybe I'm being a little too dramatic but to me it's a cold world out there. The irony is I think the people who aren't that nice feel exactly the way I do! They're probably sad and lonely to and  it shows in their behavior towards you.

I'm not coping well at all if I'm being honest. I stay up super late for no reason, I wake up super late for no reason, I fuck around all day doing nothing cause till I get the vacine I'm afraid to work (I'm high risk). 

This is where I get into the real talk. I miss connecting with a woman. There was this girl I got to know online a while back,and she just was this amazing person in my life for a while. We knew it could never really go anywhere cause we lived a long way from each other, but we spent a lot of time at night talking. We would up late at night talking about life, our emotions, our feelings. Not hiding anything. 

There was another aspect to it though, we would sometimes inteact in a sexual context. I didn't know how to feel, I had done similar things with women in the past but this was diferent. We would be talking to each other, and kinda move into it and it was just so personal, so...caring. Even though it was through a computer screen, just hearing her voice was amazing. The fact that this pretty woman WANTED to be open an intimate in any way with me was amazing. More than that it was relaxing, we would just kind lay in our respective beds talking to each other, sharing clips of ""videos"" we liked with each other until we had finished.  Her smile made me want to melt. The way  she wanted wanted to be there for me (and for me to be there for her) when lonely, the way we could just be ourselves. I fucking miss that and have no idea how i would ever find it with someone again. 

But I won't. So I'll fall asleep depressed again late tonight feeling horrible and alone.

1142,PuzzleheadedCarry870,1611295372,1,"I have always been an introverted person. Over the years, people have called me weird, made fun of me, and I was not socially accepted. The repercussions of this on my academics were bad and my grades started to dip. This heavily impacted me as my self-esteem stooped down low, which I did not realise until much later. Needless to say, I've also had to deal with the terrible emotional discomfort caused by loneliness. Having gone through severe depression and just a lot of pain in general, these are 10 ways in which the lockdown helped me raise my self-esteem, be comfortable with myself and gain confidence:

1. **Accepting my loneliness** \- I always liked to think that I had friends and that I was a popular kid when I neither had the former nor was the latter. I was living in denial and this blocked any positive changes from occurring. Coming to terms with my loneliness was difficult as I had to come to terms with the worst possible outcome that I would face, which was being lonely for my entire life. Eventually, as I developed the courage to do so, this thought enabled me to take better care of myself, put myself before others and most importantly, be more independent.
2. **Being in my own skin** \- As a result of spending a lot of time alone, I learnt to control my mind effectively using the following methods :
   1. **Changing perspective and thinking of my body as a shield that protects me from things that make me uncomfortable -** When it's cold outside, people often cover themselves with blankets to feel warm. Similarly, I trained my mind to think of my body as a blanket that covers my personality, which is concealed on the inside. This took a lot of time to develop, but I find it extremely helpful in keeping me calm and allowing me to think rationally when I get nervous or uncomfortable.
   2. **Realising that other people around me don't shape the way I feel about myself -** I was always afraid of being judged wrongly by people and used to overthink about situations in the past a lot. Realising that other people don't shape the way I feel, that most of them are not going to be alongside me throughout my life and that I will, on the other hand, be alongside myself by living my life helped me prioritise my own feelings and made my overthinking endeavours non-existent. Again, this took me a considerable amount of time to develop and throughly believe in.
3. **By turning a blind eye to everyone else present around me and focusing only on the person that I have a conversation with** \- This helped me single out conversations and in turn, be able to carry conversations effectively and for a long time. This, surprisingly, helped me get rid of my social anxiety and allowed me to meet more people and make more friends.
4. **By acknowledging the worst possible outcome of my actions and accepting the consequences of it** \- This helped me boost my self-esteem, be calmer and helped me do things better as I made my mind believe that I had nothing to lose.
5. **By focusing on the words spoken and not the looks of a person or the way they speak** \- Helped me gain confidence.
6. **By dealing with things using logic and less emotions**
7. **Reflecting the same energy or lower that I received while speaking with a person**
8. **Realising that others are their own individuals and not tied to me in any way** \- Helped me deal with overthinking and gain confidence.
9. **Daily workouts -** Exercising played a huge part in restoring my confidence and helping me seek motivation. With every workout, I became conscious of my fitness and realised the requirements of my body in order to acquire optimum fitness levels. I believe that this diverted my attention without me having to put much effort and I moved past my problems.
10. **Constantly referring to the 9 ways mentioned above to ensure that I ingrain them in my daily life.**

To reiterate, the 10 ways mentioned above helped me deal with social anxiety, depression, loneliness, overthinking and self-esteem issues. My sole intent to share this here is to reach out to people undergoing one or more of the aforementioned issues that may find these methods beneficial.",lonely,"10 self-discovered methods that helped me, an introvert, raise my self esteem, gain confidence, and deal with loneliness and overthinking",2021-01-22 17:02:52
1143,its2point0,1611293429,1,"My only girlfriend was in 8th grade and it only lasted 2 months

Since then I have talked to almost nobody because of the shutdown of school. 

On the outside I appear to be a very happy, charismatic person. I even have a little motto of mine that keeps me away from stress. But I'm still alone

I'm at the age now where I would normally start looking for another person to be with, and it seems everyone has one. Yeah I have some friends, but I see them maybe once or twice a week for a couple hours. But right now I don't want occasional chats with buds on discord, I want love. I want to be able to walk up to someone and give them a hug and they won't stare at me awkwardly for the next 30 minutes. I want to cuddle someone and watch a  movie. I want someone who gives me butterflies, to make me feel alive.

All I want is someone who gets me; Someone who can make me laugh in the good times, and comfort me in the bad times. I'm sick of having to snuggle my pillow every night while listening to Bob Ross so that I have SOME level of intimacy.

But there's nobody. Not a single soul that I know fits the bill. Maybe one day I'll find someone new, but I doubt it will help. Everyone in my school is either a whore, or gay. And I don't want to have sex with someone who lost their virginity at age 12, I want to laugh with a girl over a milkshake we share. 

But nobody is there. My friends are content being single, or they have someone of their own. So I feel like an outcast, I have nothing inherently wrong with me. I have no red flags, I take care of myself, and have a wicked sense of humor. But due to factors that I can't control, I'm left to my own accord. I'm left to this eternal pain that is watching my friends find someone while I sit by the sidelines rooting them on waiting for my turn to pitch.

Maybe one day I'll meet someone, but for now I'm alone. I have nothing and no one that makes me feel truly loved. 

I treat video games as a sort of therapy, playing hours of overwatch a day because of the teamwork, and making me feel needed. But at the end of the day it's a bunch of pixels on a laptop.

For factors and reasons I have no control over, I am in pain. Despite every effort to make myself as likable as possible, despite all my teachers praising me, despite my parents and family friends praising me, despite all my friends. I still have nobody pure, nobody who I can text at 2am and talk to about my struggles in life. Nobody who I can say in a heartbeat that they would go out of their way to be with me. Because at this point that's all it takes. Most of my friends won't leave their Xbox to talk to me over discord. Let alone come over for a movie night.

I crave intimacy like a drug, despite never having it.  I want nothing more in life than to give her a kiss on the forehead while we fall asleep in each other's arms.

so now, back to my story. everything is just getting worse. i saw her with one of my best childhood friends holding hands and smiling at each other. i thought that she didn't saw me, but i guess she did. she called me yesterday and actually yelles at me that i should stop stalking her. (if you tell me how to link a post i will link my old post in the comments so you don't think i am actually stalking her or something) she told me that she should have broken up with me sooner and that she can't see my face anymore. she was basically roasting me till i actually started to have a panic attack, broke down, hung up on her and blocked her number. today i got yeeted out of bed by another call from a unknown number, i don't know why but i picked it up and i instantly got yelled at again, this time it wasn't my ex girlfriend, it was my best childhood friend. he threatened me to beat the hell out of me if i would keep stalking her and i was like ""dude listen i didn't even know you would be there i just got me some beers and stuff"". he didn't listen and told me to back off or he will beat me up. i actually just hung up and blocked his number too, because i can't deal with stuff like this.
so i got (probably) cheated on, my heart was torn apart by my ex girl and now i am the bad guy in this story?

but some good news for the people that reached out to help me and for me aswell : i called my dad today and told him what happend and we actually talked for like 2 hours on the phone. i told them that i can't take the situation here anymore and i can't pay my rent for my apartment alone so he offered me to return to my parents till everything is going better again.

1179,inaraserra1981,1611271994,1,"I (39F) have been looking for a steady romantic relationship for a very long time. I had a few in my 20s but nothing lasted. I’ve dated a fair bit in my 30s but nothing sticks. People think I’m ok as a casual friend and seem to like being physically intimate with me but no one thinks I’m worth investing in. I’m not the girl anyone is excited to tell their friends about or who makes being exclusive worth it. It feels like there’s something fundamentally awful - or fundamentally mediocre - about me that makes people not want to be my partner. 

I’ve tried to make myself good enough. I lost weight and started putting a lot of effort into my appearance. I’ve been in therapy for a while to better how I interact with others. I have a career and make my own money. I have hobbies and do volunteer work. I’m not clingy and try not to ask for much and never say no when the person I’m with wants sex. I don’t show people I date the sad parts of me. 

But there are so many women like me out there. It’s not exactly hard to find politically progressive, sex positive women into indie rock and reading. And there are so many versions of me who are cheerier or younger or hotter or have less baggage. 

I met someone (33M) last year and felt like I’d finally met my match (there are an embarrassing amount of details in my post history). We met in my city and he went back to his after a week. The only physical thing we did, because of how we met, was hold hands and snuggle. We had really intense conversations and it felt like something pretty great was possible. When I drove him to the airport he grabbed my hand so tight and wouldn’t let go. We stayed in touch and talked a little bit about how we felt but after a few months he was seeing someone locally. I cut off contact, although we now very sporadically text. Which I shouldn’t do, because it’s pathetic and painful.

I still miss him so much and I feel like a freak. It’s not normal to miss someone this much after such little time and physical interaction. I’m terrified I’ll never get over him. That he was my one shot except he didn’t want to keep me around. 

And it’s extra embarrassing to miss him this much considering how happy he is with his 23 year old girlfriend, who he’s known and worked with for 3 years. She’s in the same general category of work as us and seems brilliant and amazing on top of being young and very pretty. I can feel in my bones that he’s found his one and they’ll get married. I feel so old and pathetic and inadequate. 

I’ve had two abusive relationships and those were the only people who ever wanted me to stick around. Sometimes I think I should have just stayed and dealt with it. Like, who am I to think I can do better? At least they could make a commitment. And I threw both of those relationships away like an egocentric idiot.

I’m seeing someone now who’s told me he’s in love with someone he can’t have and it just makes me more lonely because I know it won’t last once most people are vaccinated and he can see her. 

The closer I get to 40, the more I realize I’m not likely to ever build a life with someone I have mutual romantic love with. I know lots of people have it the same or worse and I feel like a monster for being this upset. If I was a better person, I could be fine regardless. Instead I’m hoping to figure out a way to successfully end my life, because a life without someone to share things with isn’t one I can keep living.",lonely,"Feeling Broken and Worthless TW: DV, Suicide",2021-01-22 10:33:14

In what follows, I´ll explain you the state of my mind. There is not a single cause here to brag about anything, to anyone, for any reason.
I had a happy, promising childhood. And where I did not consider myself being bullied. Some of you might challenge some particular events in my childhood.
Everything changed however when I left home for University. Fell in love and experienced the roth and misery people can give eachother. Admitted,  a lot of mistakes where coming from my side as well. Things escaleted, got diagnosed with Aspergers and no one listened...
Few years later, same story, other girl, no one understood me.
I´m not bad looking (I would define myself as average). I´m not stupid (IQ test while being depressed was over 120). I give quick, silly, fun and sincere reactions on dating apps. I try to make people happy in real life. I do organize parties to see friends happy. I do put efforts in giving original presents. But what for? Do 10 good things, people remember the 1 bad thing.
I see no point in being the happy, carefree person at work, when feeling misery and lonely at night.

I decided, untill here, but no further. Tonight, I´m no longer active on dating apps. I´ll soon remove my reddit accounts. The interconnected world promised by social apps has become more distant than ever before. 
Next step: buy a place of my own and start working on my hermit life. 
I still wanna do good for people. I just do not want to know those people. I see too much bad in every single person I do know. 
To end this post, I gonna quote Kurt Cobain, who had the same are I have now. Got the feeling he knew. Got the feeling he would have understood.

""I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.""

Thanks for reading stranger. I love you, although that´s probably only because I do not know you... Sorry

1192,jonny-apocalypse,1611266336,1,"“They say the two most powerful words in the English language are the shortest: “I am.” Whatever you put after those two words determines your destiny.
Let’s say you want to stop smoking. Maybe you’ve had a few warnings from your doctor, and you’re finally coming around to the idea that you should quit. If you identify as a smoker and regularly say, “I am a smoker,” it’s going to be difficult to quit until you dismantle that identity. When you say you are defined by a particular action, you are essentially priming yourself to identify with and justify a certain behavior.
This is so integral to behavior change that it can’t be overstated. A fascinating study out of Stanford University showed the effects of priming on participants. Researcher Christopher Bryan separated participants into two groups. The first group responded to a questionnaire that included phrases like “to vote” and questions like “How important is it to you to vote?” The second group’s questionnaire had slightly altered questions, like “How important is it to you to be a voter [emphasis added]?”2 The participants were also asked whether they planned to vote in the upcoming elections. Later, researchers used public voting records to confirm whether the participants had voted or not. Bryan and his team found that the participants whose survey included personally identifying statements like “voter” were 13 percent more likely to vote than those who were simply asked about the likelihood that they would vote.
When you consciously decide to identify with the habit or goal you want to create or achieve, or consciously un-identify with a habit you no longer want, you will experience enormous power. If you’ve been telling yourself all of your life that you are a slow learner, or that you can’t learn, you might start telling yourself “I am a fast and efficient learner”
Stop saying I am lonely instead say I am friendly and magnetic to others, and build yourself up from there.

1211,Emeraldwax,1611253804,1,"I just feel so alone. But I can’t break out of this shitty cycle.

I struggle to talk to friends anymore, we just don’t know what to say to each other anymore. 

I’ve not socialized for so long that I don’t know how to anymore

The only people I really communicate with are my mom and my boyfriend. But my relationship with my mom is on off whenever she decides she wants me around, it’s not stable so I don’t count on it anymore. And I’m pretty sure my boyfriend is getting tired of me always wanting to talk to him and me having no other friends. I feel like he wishes I had people in my life.

At first it was more of the fact that I was so afraid to let anyone in. I’m afraid of wasting my time on the wrong people, as my time is so precious to me and I’ve done that so often in the past. Now that still stands, but it’s also the fact that I have no ideas how to socialize anymore. 

Even if a conversation is going well, I seem to back out, I believe out of fear. Fear of it going wrong, so I withdraw before that can happen. Even if I really enjoy the persons company.

I’ve lost over half of my closest friends recently simple due to not knowing how to speak to them. The other half... well I don’t really speak to them, and I fear I won’t know how to ever again. I fear I’ve ruined things too much.

I fear closeness, because that always leads to things blowing up in my face. It has with every other relationship I’ve had in my life, whether that’s friends, partners, or family. I can understand why a lot of my close relationships ended: they usually begin to sabotage our relationship because I get too comfortable, I start depending on them too much, they become so important to me. 

An ex began to rob and cheat because my mental health and drug issues were too much too soon. I learned from my mistakes in this relationship, I recovered from my drug problems and I became a better person towards others. 

A friend, who was my friend for 7 years, lied about me stealing from her family because my family would always ask her about me when they were worried about me, and of course my mental health issues were overwhelming again, she was one of my only friends through my darkest times. The friendship got too much for her, and I understand this. This was over a year ago and she’s tried reaching out multiple times since, although recently I decided not to be upset about our friendship ending, but to cherish the friendship we had while it lasted so I decided to reach out to her to tell her that I understood and I thanked her for being in my life. We have spoke since but I have been struggling to keep up the conversation, I don’t always know what to say and it upsets me deeply especially as she may begin to think I don’t care.

My boyfriend has been my friend for years prior. But I don’t think he expected this in a relationship, me always wanting to speak to him. I love speaking to him, but I do wish I could make/maintain other friendships just like he does as I feel like it can put a strain on our relationship.

I don’t know how to break out of this cycle. I can try, everything will be ‘fine’ for a while, then I’ll just shut down... I’ll cut people out.

A friend from high school tried to reconnect with me a few months ago. We met up the next day and honestly did have a good time hanging out. I met one of her friends and we had a really good time together, I believed that I wanted to build friendships with both of these people. But when they tried to maintain contact afterwards my replies became further apart, then I just stopped replying to them both all together due to the guilt of not being able to keep up with maintaining the friendships. I wanted more than anything to explain, but I felt like if I did and my behavior Continued like this afterwards, it would just become an excuse.

I don’t want to be like this any longer. I love my own company, I enjoy being around myself and spending time alone so much but sometimes I do get lonely, as does every human. I just don’t know how to get out of this cycle anymore. I don’t know how to stop retreating back to what feels ‘safe’.

I have three close friends and they all live far away, we meet occasionally, and chatting on social media is starting to feel absurd and meaningless. I fear that I might lose them and become utterly alone. In college, all of the friends I made either moved to another college or dropped and found a job, I don't know my current classmates very well due to pandemic related procedures, and all the talking I do with them online is related to projects and assignments, I didn't make that good of an impression anyway. I have social anxiety, mild depression, borderline disorder, and very low assertiveness and emotional strength because of my damaged self image. To conclude, when I'm home I spend all of my time inside the houe, when I'm studying, I chat casually with my classmates but never go beyond that.

My mother and father were both academics so I was raised around books more than people. Got decent grades in primary and secondary school while joining the bare minimum of clubs. I was always socially awkward on account of only knowing social interaction from books, as well as being fat back then. I never really got the chance to properly develop socially until I got into the later years of my secondary school, but at that point I already made too many mistakes, said too many lies to even make anything feel sincere. I didn't make good use of those chances.   


Now I'm in my 3rd year in university.  I worked towards looking better physically just to see what would happen, yet I've barely a thing to call a fulfillment or motivation. When asked about anything related to dating, I just say that I'm not interested, and say that ""I'm going to die alone"". Every single thing I do with people feels like it's just an act. I feel guilty. I'm stuck between feeling like I want to interact with people, and wanting to be alone as much as possible. I don't want to keep on feeling like everything is an act.

This observation is colored by two recent events in my life.

First, over the last year or two I’ve grown apart from
and have stopped seeing my best friend from childhood. Our friendship lasted 20 years. We met as kids on the playground together. We told each other everything and experienced fucking everything together. Why did it end? No animosity. No fighting. No tension. We just grew apart as we got older. I went off to college. He didn’t. The things we had to talk about were far and between. The hurt from losing him has brought a deep sense of pain in me.

Second to get off my chest I’m 25 years old. I’ve never done anything with a woman. Date, kissing you name it and I haven’t done it. I go through a cycle where I dabble with the dating apps every year or two. Nothing ever comes of it and I delete them because they make me feel like shit.  Recently I got back in. One conversation was going well - or so I thought. Of course I get ghosted, as 100% of the time this is what happens. She has no clue who I am at this point I bet. For me this was the most flirting I’ve ever done with a woman. I’ve spent days after crying over it. For most normal people they wouldn’t care - we only exchanged 2 dozen messages. 

I used to go on backpacking vacations before covid hit. I’d stay in hostels, party with people and have great conversations and adventures for a few days. And never see them again, often because they’d live thousands of miles away. When I have reconnected with people I met traveling, you realize your only connection was the circumstances you met under.

Same thing with work. My closest work friend I skype messaged with every day at my old job? Who I went drinking with sometimes on Fridays? I text him maybe every 4 months about football. Once you lose the circumstances you met under it’s over. Same deal with anyone whose acquaintance I made in college.

My few remaining friends? They’ll get married and have kids someday. They may move away. It’ll end too.  I have no idea on how romantic relationships work, but I have to imagine those are even more precarious. 

Really the only people I’ll never lose until death are my family and I’m lucky I’m very close to them. I guess that’s why I love dogs too; no friendships between man and his dog will wither away. 

Older and wiser people will say you were richer for having had these relationships and you will find new friends. Well, I can’t view it that way.

I know you really tried so so hard to make things work and I just brushed you aside after 4 years. Why didn't I feel like trying hard enough? Why was I being so flippant? Maybe I was selfish, spoiled with all the attention believing the grass is greener on the other side. I never took heartbreaks seriously and thought everyone should just ""get over it""
That's what I told you too. I told you to burn the letter you wanted to give me. Truth is I had to be cold. Cause even a slight misstep or vulnerability on my part would have us jumping back together for the nth time. It hurt to keep turning you down. Especially after the last time we broke up and we knew it was the last time, I couldn't put myself and you through that.

I hate myself for being so cold and taking you for granted. But do know I've loved you. I've been detached and my anxiety got the better of me and I ruined something so innocent and beautiful. But please do know I never lied, never cheated. The only thing I lied about was that there was no chance for us, because I was terrified you'd hold on to it and pressure me. Deep in my heart, I had hoped our paths would meet? Or was I just a b--- who thought of you as a back up who'd always wait? I don't know anything anymore.

 You're gone. It's my loss. Your love and loss changed me. And this I promise you, that I'll learn how to love right and selflessly from you. I will never ever let my man ever feel insecure and downplay his emotions. I'm sorry I had to lose you to learn this. Im sorry we hurt and now you're happy and gone. She deserves your love.

I can only pray God gives me another chance at love. I want to do it right cause I've understood the value now that you're gone and I'm to blame. Maybe I'm selfish to ask for love again after having thrown it away. But God knows I want a chance to do it right.

I had a woman that I thought I was in love with but she never cared for me. We lived on the opposite sides of the country too so all interaction took place over the phone or video chat. This last for 3 years. 

Fast forward to the beginning of last year (2020). Decided to put myself out their for a woman that was closer to him and gave her my everything. She told me that she could never love me. Even though I would have done anything and treated her like she was the center of the universe. Pined over her for 6mths.

This last Oct, again I decided to see if I could find the right person to love me. Met a girl online. It extremely well for the first month. We talked daily. She professed her love for me and told me I was everything she had been looking for. 2 wks later she changed and told me that she could love me, because of my dedication, consistency and protectiveness. All the things any woman would want in a man but she ""wasn't ready"".
Sure.
I get it. She wasn't ready. I can't force that. And I don't want to be with someone who isn't ready to commit. 
Found out after she had been sleeping with 2 other guys the whole time. And then a 3rd shortly after our split. I mean within-the-week shortly. 

I'm a good guy. I treat women with respect and dedication. My love language is Acts Of Service. I do things to show my love. I've been told on several occasions by different women that I am a great guy. They just couldn't give me what I deserve or wanted in a relationship. 

What is wrong with me? I am the common factor here. So it must be something wrong with me.

1233,Depressionsfinalform,1611229765,1,"I have serious trauma (don't ask, just believe me pls) that has made me co-dependent on other people, in the form of seeking affection. Not nessacarily sexual affection, I love hugging my friends and just being around them (but also avoid them for the same reason as above). So I've been seeking, pretty much like a lot of others on here, a girlfriend. My brain thinks I need it. And I kind of do in a sense. It's like starving, if you don't eat you won't get the nutrients you need to function. So in that sense I have shut down totally and completely, to the point that I ""need"" affection and approval of others. My trauma occured when I was but a child, like about 4-6 yrs old, so it's so ingrained in my memory and my brain that this way of being has manifested permanently it seems. THEN, the dating scene for men like me is nothing but lies and horseshit. (This is true, I don't blame women for this so save your SJW stuff please) It's rare to meet someone actually genuine and loving these days, and even when I do, my trauma causes me to push them away. I am my own worst enemy, and I constantly think about how I will never have what everyone else seems to have; plenty of ppl I know have from what I can tell, healthy, happy, relationships. I want that so bad. It feels like I need it, even though I know I don't. People tell me I need to be happy with myself before I can ever love properly again and be loved, but my trauma has created this stupid fucking paradox that I am 100% aware of yet I can't do anything about.

A little back story, I am a 16 year old highschooler that has almost all honor classes, a part time job, a sport, and barely any friends. This in turn has made me very lonely and sad as I spend most of my day sitting and watching YouTube and staying up until 4 am each night just to wake up at 7. Around 3 years ago I played with quite a bit of people; around 8. But these people were always older than be by several years so know they no longer have time for me so I now hope I can find new friends. Everything I do causes me stress and loneliness. I never have anyone supporting me. I feel like I no longer even do anything for me anymore, only for others.

In the past month I haven't played with anyone who wasn't using me. All I want to do is not having all of these stressful things in my life. Is it normal for a 16 year old to pay for his own car, go to work every week, take honors classes, and participate in sports?

But I had a friend who was really close to me and I really liked spending time with her, we used to talk for hours and spend most of our time together. I'd say overall we just clicked as friends, I had really heavy feelings for her (obviously) but I always knew she was way too good looking for me and the guys she liked or went out were really good looking or had athletic bodies, there were days when I wished she was a little ugly like me so I would have a chance. So I never even tried to ask her out and hid my feeling pretty well after high school we went away to different colleges but kept in touch. From what I heard her college experience was pretty fun and wild (parties, drugs, clubs, hookups) or maybe it is normal for most college students, I was even embarrassed to tell her about mine (ps4, weed, loneliness and depression).

Anyway 6 months ago she told me she's in a relationship and gradually we stopped talking (People have their own lives and I kinda got the feeling her BF didn't want her talking to me but I understand he's her BF and I'm just a friend from HS) but i just missed having someone to talk to. I'm finance Major with 3.6 GPA, got rejected from every job i applied to, last night I texted her she told me she got a job (she's a IB major with 3.1 GPA) I asked her how she did it, she told me the recruiter was impressed with her charisma and natural presence (idk what that even means) and has moved in with her BF. At this point it hit me how differently our lives evolved since HS. She had fun, going to have a job and stable relationship, me on the other hand a sad lonely, depressed virgin whose is going to be jobless after college. Should I even bother to live ?. I can't even think of facing my mom after college  without a job or GF, she's going to be so disappointed.

Hey everyone sorry I went MIA I had a few ask about my date and i canceled it. Before the date via text he had mentioned a couple odd things to me like he knew where I went to High School (I graduated last year) and he also knew where I worked before I told him. Also I don’t tell people where I work before meeting them irl just because I’ve had a friend who went through a traumatic event because she gave that  information away too easily. However as if that wasn’t enough he became kinda possessive for someone who I’ve never met he would get mad if I didn’t text him and he also got insecure at me having male friends. I had this weird gut feeling and after talking to some friends about it I decided to call it off. After I told him I didn’t feel comfortable but I wish him well and I apologized for wasting his time he got extremely mad and said horrible things sadly some men do this when you turn them down to save their own egos so I didn’t take it to heart. But overall I’m happy I called it off he was a creep and I blocked him and told my manager and coworkers about him in case he comes into the store asking for me! Hopefully I’ll be alright and to all the people reading this don’t forget how easy it is for creeps to find information about you and please be safe when going out on dates! Especially to all the girls,poc, and LGBTQ there can be some horrible people out there and the reality is we can’t always know someone’s complete personality until we meet them irl. It’s easy to pretend and fake it over text and social media so please be safe and keep that in mind. Also to anyone who’s interested I keep a alarm on my keychain from the company birdie, I also have a knife in my key chain my friend got me you can buy them on Amazon!!

My oldest friend has ghosted me for the last couple months and I find it infuriating. After everything I did and all the energy and effort I put into the relationship. I was always forthcoming that I didn't like the way she treated me by turning up hours late to a hang (she is my neighbor) and often taking her anger out on me. I always calmly approached the situations as they came and explained my feelings. No one is perfect. I am not perfect. 

Another friend had been ignoring me for months and agreed to meet. He seemed excited but when I shared my feelings of loneliness he exploded in a way that made me want to pull back. I have always supported him and it was scary and uncomfortable to see how he was so horrified by me asking for support.

Other friends from other areas of my life have also slowly stopped answering messages and these are messages asking how they are, sending them things that remind me of them. 

I need a friend right now who knows me well, who I don't have to explain myself to. I feel let down and discouraged. I have lost so many people this year. I hate that people who have ignored countless texts from me reply to my posts on social media as if it's nothing; not to start a conversation but just to reply for some reason.

While I normally am all for this, I can't help but get angry. I have been living on my own, in a big city where I do not have anyone in my life and haven't had anyone in my life for almost 4 years now, and here she is saying that she is lonely when her husband works (WHEN HE IS AT HOME) and comes to me because no one else will have the video call with her.

One - I feel like I am just being used because she knows I am not doing anything else. Two - I don't think she gets just how bad it CAN be. She has people she can hug, and love and be with. I don't. And I don't feel she has the right to feel lonely, really...

I know people can feel lonely and miss family and whatever, but, every single person I know has someone they can go to. I have no one. I have not hugged anyone since July when I went to go out and visit family because I was becoming severely depressed... I have told her this and yet she still seems to think she's lonely...

And I know it's completely wrong to think this, but it is how I am feeling, and she has no right to feel lonely and approach me saying that when she has her own family... I guess I am just looking for what to say to her because I don't want to really and I want her to know that she should be grateful for what she has because I don't have anyone right now.

**TL:DR: Friend, who is married and has a husband who works at home and a child... asked me to have a video call telling me she is lonely...

Don't get me wrong, my personal matters are not that crazy its just basic things but I say personal because, in that series I was watching, they all trusted each other and cared about each other a lot, they wanted the best for each other and would help no matter what.

https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/koog3z/still_alone_but_happy_right_now_because_my_time/

I got a lot of positive feedback and heartwarming comments, but also some sceptical comments like ""stop lying to yourself"".

So now I thought I'm gonna tell you what happened since then and how my life has been. 

I'll be honest: there were some pretty bad days. Days where I didn't want to leave my bed, days where the dark thoughts were stronger than the optimism I wanted to maintain. On these days, I couldn't stop to think about that one comment: ""stop lying to yourself... why am I lying to myself?""

But I've always managed to pull myself together again. Because I'm still not ready to give up hope.

I had a date today, we took a walk by the river. We didn't get along very well, there will be no second date. But HEY, that was already a big step for me. I went out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did, even if it didn't lead to anything. 

There is one person I like a lot and I could imagine being with: my flatmate. But unfortunately, she's now together with my best friend, which is a stressful situation for me, because I see them both almost every day. 

It's not been easy. Optimism is hard work, you always have to search for the positive sides of a situation, even if it seems like there are none. And sometimes you'll fail and you'll be devastated, but it's not the end of the world. 

So I'll stay with my thought from the last post: My time will come. Someday it'll be my turn to finally say: I'm not lonely anymore. And I don't care how often I fail an which obstacles life decides to throw in my way. That doesn't matter in the end.

1330,islandofdrmoreau,1611173028,3,"i literally have no one outside of my sister to talk to about problems and feelings. she’s great and i’m very thankful to have her in my life but its really hard to have no one outside of your immediate family to talk to. my entire life i’ve also been the odd friend out, and i was was really hoping that would change since starting university but it did not. in my first year i already had feelings of being the odd one out and this year i’m convinced my friends just straight-up don’t like me anymore but feel stuck with me. on one hand i don’t really blame them. 

i can feel myself sabotaging the friendship sometimes by ignoring texts, going MIA in the groups chat (gotta love depressive episodes). but on the other hand, i already previously felt like i was odd one out and even when i try to talk to them more and contribute, they still do little things that leave me out and make it clear that i’m not really apart of the group. for example we’re supposed to be figuring out a living situation for next year and they all facetimed to talk about picking rooms without me, when i said i would be able to talk in an hour. they facetime without me all the time. it makes me feel pretty shitty but they’re the only friends i have. 

i’ve never had any relationship with anyone and i’ve never had anyone be interested in me which is a big hit to my self esteem. i know that i shouldn’t base my self worth on male attention but it’s a shitty feeling to be almost 20 and having never had a boyfriend. sometimes i can’t even look at myself in a mirror without wanting to cry but that’s a whole different problem. 

i know that covid and isolation has been hard on everyone, but my life has never been as empty as it is now and it’s really really hard to keep going. i try to distract myself with schoolwork but it doesn’t always help. its really upsetting for me to think about, but i know that i don’t add value into anyone’s life and no one outside of my parents and sister would be upset if i were gone.

   In September I returned to school after the summer nothing of interest really happed just feeling like trash.  


October was an interesting month I have never had the confidence to ask someone out and I know how the world is it was not the best idea but I just needed to prove to myself I could do it. This one girl in my physics class we talked a couple times and every time we did I really enjoyed it. So I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime she said she was busy. That did not hurt that much I felt better that I had at least tried. Than on Halloween I went up to my grandparents for the weekend. I quarantined  two weeks prior and so did they. But I get there and they need help with Halloween so I was like sure. His neighbored stopped by with his daughter and her friend who were around my age. They asked me if I wanted to go on walk with them. I said sure and it led to so far the best night of my life. For the first time I felt as if I was not alone in this world. Since then I have not talked to these people but I'm quarantined right so I can head up to my grandparents so lets hope for the best.   


   Then November gets weird in October I got snapchat I'm not sure why I got it but I did. On November first that girl from my physics class I asked out added me on snapchat. Okay cool I thought and for most of November I was talking to another person. But, on thanksgiving she stopped talking to me and since thanksgiving I have not talked to another person.  


  December is always a rough month for me but the void of now feeling lonely hurt so this was the worst December by far.

1344,Dragonair_fruit1371,1611165965,2,"Hi,

So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an [app](https://happyer4life.com/) for this so that other people can do the same :)

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

No one can be trusted, not even family 
No one is your friend 
Originality is impossible
Love is a myth 
You are always alone, no matter what
No one will truly have your back in long term, in the heat of situation 
No matter how long the connection lasts, how wholesome and genuine it may seem, always have your expectations and hopes lowered, guard up, doubts high

2. I want to cut my sugar/caffeine intake. This one will be extremely difficult, especially since I'm in college, but I've done it before. The worst part is the first 2 weeks.

3. Get out of my college dorm more often and meet people. This shouldn't be too difficult but it seems like I struggle making new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people are itching to down vote anything nowadays but I don't even care. I just want to express this. I just really want to get this off my chest. I'm someone who has absolutely no friends like whatsoever. I will try to make this long story short but more than likely it will be long regardless. Now I'm an aspiring actor, i'm moving to Cali soon in order to pursue it full on without limitations, well exception for this covid thing obviously. Anyways with what I have available at the moment I create my own short films. The hardest part about that is getting someone to be in it even if you offer pay. I posted an ad on cragislist on the gig section for someone to be in my video. A girl responded, let's just call her Jessica. That's not her real name by the way. We met up at the mall, around an area she was staying at because she is like a nomad who moves around a lot. Our first convo turned into hours of talking, than we some how wanted to drink so we drank some beers in my car and talked some more. The next day we did the short film. We again hung out at the same time and drank, and just got to know each other more. I did find out she had a boyfriend and it was just a friendship brewing..or so I thought.

We hung out again the day after and we went out to dave and busters and drank some more, hung out, talked about life while looking out into the night on some movie shit. It was cool. As someone who doesn't have friends or a life, it meant a lot to me. I was smiling the entire time on the inside and she told me she considered me her friend now. I don't trust people but something told me to trust what she was saying. She even snuck me into the place she was temporary staying and we watched a movie, listened to music and smoked hookah. Our ""friendship"" was growing very fast like I said so I thought. We hung out again, that's like 3-4 times in a row and throughout the other days we hung out she had said stuff that should've been red flags from jump street but I ignored it because I was so in the moment of enjoying what was happening since I am so deprived of human connection. It was like sensory overload and so reading red flags was not that apparent to me BUT when we hung out today I finally realized what was happening.

What started it all off for me was when I filmed her saying something random as a joke. I joked and said I won't delete it but I did when she told me to seriously delete it. She also told me if I was her real friend and not just something she works with, she would've smashed my phone already, implying that we weren't actually friends this entire time. I jokingly said I thought we were friends and laughed so I don't make it a tense situation. She was like I mean you are but we also have been working together on stuff. What started clicking was that she told me when she first met, she only agreed to do my project out of convivence and boredom since her ankle was partially injured and she couldn't do her paid acting gigs for the moment. It started to hit me that she was also hanging out with me for that same reason. I mean I know it was only a working relationship at first but she was the one who told me I was her friend. I was just stupid enough to take it to heart, especially with my trust issues that I have in the first place. I know to other people this isn't a big deal but to me it is, someone this deprived of social interactions even pre covid 19, yeah this meant a lot to me.

Another reason I feel played is because she also contradicted herself many times throughout the week we hung out. She told me multiple times that she doesn't have any friends, she just know a lot of people and connections but if she doesn't have friends how am I her friend then? Well that's because I'm not and never was and no friendship was ever brewing. The ""friendship"" happened because she was bored, her leg wasn't fully healed and she was in an area that was close to mine since she moves around a lot. She lives in the same state as me but like 3 hours apart. She was just near my town or a town over mine which is like 25 minutes away because she was staying with people for the time she was there. She comes around the area near me often though. Apparently she never stays in one location for more than a few days. I thought I had made a genuine connection. What I really take offense to is how she told me so many stories of how a lot of guys that she would meet would try to get with her and confess that they like her, but here I was, someone who didn't want to get in her pants and just wanted a genuine friendship and she used me.

She admitted that she uses other people for boredom and has even hung around people and stayed with people who have abused her. I know I only knew her for a week but she told me I was her friend and I was stupid enough to actually believe it and take it to heart. I am so deprived that I some times deny the obvious truth that is in front of my face. I feel so fucking stupid. I mean it is cl so I'm not surprised. You don't meet decent people on there and it's rare whenever you do. I know some people are going to say ""oh you're not entitled to a friendship."" Who said I was? Remember, she was the one who told me I was her friend and later contradicted that. I'm just the stupid one for taking it to heart because I'm so socially and emotionally deprived. I mean I put 2 &amp; 2 together. Her being a nomad should've answered it for me right than and there because she's a hopper in all aspects of her life. So when you know like 100s of people and move around constantly, I'm sure making genuine connections is next to impossible. I was just blind to it all because I'm just such a loser. I am never connecting with someone thru cl again and this damn sure makes it even harder for me to trust anyone now.",lonely,Why I do not trust people,2021-01-20 15:18:06

1415,Lightningz__,1611113091,1,"I’ve literally never felt so sad and so hurt in my life.

I’m going to be short on this because I really don’t have the strength. But I’ve felt in love with my childhood friend 4 years ago, and I only had the courage to tell him last month (which was so difficult because I’m an introvert and super shy person). We saw each other 3 times in total after that.

And the 3rd time when I went to his house, he told me that he thought that I came only to sleep with him and that he doesn’t want anything serious. But after that he told me that he liked me and that he didn’t want anything only physical between us??

And now that I called him so we could talk about it, he told me that it was better that we don’t see each other anymore??

So what?? I expected so much from him, I love so him much. But now what, I’ve lost him as a friend too??

My mind tells me that this was the best decision, and that I shouldn’t stay with a fuckboy like him. But my heart hurts so much. Like physically. I truly feel like that someone go in with a spear in my heart. 

I feel so sad. I feel like I’ve lost my time. And I feel so worthless now. I’m always doing my best and so much efforts in everything I do. I always try to understand people’s point of view whenever I talk with them, so I don’t hurt them. I always try to look my best everywhere I go. I always try to study hard for my exams. And so many other things that I’m forgetting. 

But I’m so tired now. I’m so tired of hoping. I feel like finding someone who you’re in love with and them loving you back is the biggest myth of History.
Seriously, screw everything. I can’t even sleep right now. I literally feel like someone is squeezing my heart.

1428,NoTomato4261,1611108727,1,"I’ve felt stuck since my breakup, but there are other factors. I just know the breakup is the straw that broke the camels back.

In March when the pandemic started, I was sent home from college. It was my senior year so I was very upset I didn’t get to say goodbye to all my friends and graduated on zoom. Also, I had 0 job prospects. I had planned to move to a big city about 2 hours away and work. That was all taken away.

I was super sad and lonely March-May. But at least I had my boyfriend. 

At the end of May, I got an awesome job opportunity. I worked as a brand ambassador all summer for a big company (won’t reveal the name, want to remain anonymous on here). While this job was happening, my boyfriend and I broke up. I won’t go into details but he abused alcohol, and every time he did he abused me emotionally. We were broken up for about a month without contact really, and then I reached out because I missed him. He spent the next 3 months trying to prove he had changed. I was scared. Scared to make another mistake. But also, I was very distracted with my job. I was having so much fun and I was happy. I didn’t give myself time to think much about the breakup. 

Fast forward to September, my job ends. It was only a summer job. Me and my ex are still hanging out. And when I say hanging out, I mean we’re dating, we just hadn’t declared that. We spent so much time together, with each other’s families, it was like nothing had changed. With my job done, I got to thinking more about our breakup. I thought you know what, he really had changed. He hadn’t been drinking and he’d been so much nicer/respectful towards me. So I told him I was ready to officially get back together. I wasn’t nervous about this at all since I was under the impression it wouldn’t be that hard to do. He had said he wanted to all this time we were still spending time together, and I felt like he had changed. Since why we broke up in the first place was his issues. Well, my mistake. He ended up turning cold on me and left me in the dust. I won’t get into the sad boring details, but he strung me along for a month just saying he “built up walls” but “still loved me and we could fix things”. I’ll spare the details again but I found out he was with another girl and when I did, he blocked me on everything. Side note: we were together for 3 years. This happened 2 months ago.

But anyways, yes that whole situation has sent me down a dark dark hole. And to make matters worse, I do not have a job. That reason being, I start the summer job again in April. I had tried to apply to places a month ago but no one wants to hire me when I will be leaving for the summer. 

I also am back home with my mom. I have been since March when I was sent home from college. I live in a very small town. I’m talking one stoplight. There’s nothing to do. Also, my ex lives here. 

I just feel so stuck right now. I find myself counting down the days until the summer. Thinking “I can finally move on then. I’ll be happy then. I’ll be busy, I’ll be around people, and I will be over him.” There’s nothing to do all day and I do try to do things. I walk my dog around, I help my mom cook, I try my best to keep myself busy but it’s so hard here. I’m so heartbroken and I feel like I can’t recover from it because I feel so stuck. I feel like I’m falling into a depression, or I’m already there. I cry every day about my ex and what happened. But I also cry because I feel like I can’t do anything to help make it better.

1455,Marven-J,1611097254,1,"Hello.

If you are like me, then this story should be firmiliar. You are looking through tumbler/reddit/instagram/kik/other platform that allows a conversation with another human/bot. You meet a nice person and talk a bit.

Now, you are no dummy, you want to see a picture of this person, to make sure they are real, and as described. And so you get sent a very normal looking picture that seems to be of the erson you are talking to.

Time passes, conversation is had, and then, oh no, grandma fell down the stairs and broke her hip, and wouldn't you know it, this is just at the same time the sister had a baby and needed money to fix the car and little cousin Samantha just got braces, so now there is no money left for food.

Don't suppose you could be a dear and send a little. Pretty please???

TLDR You meet someone online and they turn out to be a scammer that you wasted time on.

Tinyeye is a very good revers image search engine. Just google it. You can see if the pic sent has been posted on 4chan or some other site. Not 100%, maybe the scammer downloaded it off some girl's twitter or something, but it can save you time and money.

Also, it can help you find the movie from that one screen shot or that actor you don't know the name of if you have a pic. You can even take a picture of some collectable. It even works on cropped or pics that are black and white and the origenal is in color.

WTLDR Google Tinyeye and bookmark it, thank me latter.",lonely,"Tinyeye, you want this search engine bookmarked.",2021-01-20 10:00:54

Im almost 18 but unfortunately it wont be until a year or more later until I can move out of my families house. While I love my parents, I find its super sad and depressing whenever i'm forced to stay at home. Due to the pandemic school is online and that means I make little to no contact with anyone besides my family. The pandemic hit at a really bad time in my life because I had just fallen off with a lot of friends from the summer due to not anything crazy just no similar interests. I expected I would be okay since when school started the corona virus surely has to be gone...No, I have to be online my whole junior year. As you can imagine I stay at home in my pj's all day &amp; I don't care about my appearance since its just my family right? thats what I always tell myself and because of that i've gained a lot of weight and I don't wear any makeup anymore and I don't care about my room or anything because i'm always just seeing my family not going out. It has made me feel really depressed. On top of that, I feel like my family is just as lazy and tired when they are always home so it makes ME feel like that (not sure why but it just affects me). And I feel like the house is always messy and no matter how many times i'll try and clean and sweep they keep it messy and it makes me feel depressed and unmotivated. Also, for the once and a while I go out into society I feel bad because I know my appearance is bad (I know I can be better is what I mean).

1461,Lavalamp412294,1611093972,2,"I don´t know what Im doing wrong, and it gives me a sinking feeling to think that. 

I have a lover who I´ve been having a thing with for a couple months now and we´ve gotten very close. These months are hard for her emotionally (seasonal Depression) so she has been feeling out of touch, less responsive and overall sad. I feel for her so I naturally send her reassuring messages, telling her I love her and I´m here for her, I send her funny videos of me being dumb and anything that could make her feel better. 

I am someone who is very expressive emotionally, so when I love someone I truly try my best to show and provide my love and attention.

Last night she was feeling nostalgic and melancholic, her responses were very short, so I decided to listen to what she had to say and I was always reassuring her if she felt uncomfortable that we could stop for a while and continue with anything she would feel comfortable with. I decided to reassure her and tell her I love her and I was going to be for here now and later on. I made a video compilation of wholesome moments we´ve had together, and I decided to show her since she was in a sad mood. I put my heart into that video, and she seemed to like it which was very nice. I accidentally fell asleep since it was very late and when I woke up.... She began spilling out everything. And. It. All. Hurt. 

I couldn´t hold my tears after a while and had to go for a walk to calm down. She had gotten very upset since from what she had told me. Long story short, she told she felt I wasn´t there for her last night. That I talked about me and made a good part of last night about me,  she began questioning me if I thought every time she would be sad or down was because of the Seasonal Depression, I tried my best to explain to her that I was just trying to help and be there for her last night. But she just said that she was hurt by last night. I think what hurt most was when at one point she told me she didn´t need me to tell her how much she loved me and how much I truly love her. My heart sank reading that since that´s my way of showing that I care. 

I´m sorry if I came off as rude here, I truly am not trying to, I´m just sad now. To whoever reads this, thank you and take care.",lonely,"18M I just want to do right, but it seems as if I just can´t",2021-01-20 09:06:12

I am still learning to live with myself. With who I have become. I am getting better at it, but sometimes, it just has to go out, like now. Sadly, I don't know the limits.

People say that ohh i am lonely, will I ever get to make new friends or find a girlfriend. But the truth is people who are lonely are the most creative and later become multi-millionaires. Just stick with your passion even if no-one is there to support you. Cuz, when you gonna make it and achieve your dream, there will be loads of people to talk to. You will be confident then, but rn, focus on your dream, what you aspire to become. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, UNIVERSE WILL HAND IT OVER TO YOU, THE ONLY LIMIT IS YOU AND YOUR DESIRE. 

And never think you are lonely, i suggest have a pet or think about your soul and talk to it, comfort it and you will realise that you have your best friend with yourself, within you.

1513,elliemacdoogle,1611060550,1,"Sort of a long rant for any kind soul willing to listen:

This past weekend, my boyfriend had plans to meet up with his buds online to DM a D&amp;D session. Two of his friends were late signing on, the third had a legit reason to cancel, and the fourth friend was a flake like usual. Long story short, they weren't able to play. Needless to say, my boyfriend was very disappointed. He had been planning this session for months. The amount of work he put into it was considerable and he was so much looking forward to it paying off by sharing fun with friends. Seeing him so sad made me feel for him and I wish I could've taken his pain away.

The thing is, his friends do this to him *all the time*. We have no idea why either because they have great times together, (virtually nowadays, obviously) when they finally actually all stick to plans. They're a great group of guys that seem to genuinely care about each other once they get chatting. But, my boyfriend is *always* the one asking to hang out or putting the effort into plans. No, he's not being overbearing with them either. He'll only text their group chat maybe once a month now because he felt like he was bothering them when he would try contacting them more often in the past.

The worst part about this is, we know they get together, (even in person) without extending an invitation to him. They aren't trying to hide it from him either since they post about their get togethers all over social media. It hurts my heart when my boyfriend sees these things and then feels like he's not a true friend in their eyes. We're completely baffled by their choice to not include him. It's not like my boyfriend is needy or even super different from the rest of them. They're all friends in the first place for a reason. They have a similar sense of humor and share *a ton* of the same interests. Yet, they often blow off plans and many of his messages have gone unread for months at a time.

So, he's at a point of wanting to give up on them and I don't blame him. This is exactly where I'm at with my friends as well, so we have sympathy for one another. What contributed to this happening with my friends is a bit different, but the end result has been the same. Years ago, they all moved far away and we had to resort to long distance friendships which understandably isn't easy.

My friends never check in with me or ask me how I'm doing. When we do talk, it never fails that the discussion is centered around them before they disappear again. It takes so much out of me to be the person who has to start the conversation every time. They depend on me to be there for them when I remind them I exist, but they don't offer to help me in return. And yeah, my attempts to reach out are regularly ignored. Being separated by miles is so difficult. It's eroded away our connection. We all used to be very close and supportive of one another. True, life gets busy and people grow apart. But, that doesn't dull the ache of losing people you love. Especially when you're the only one trying to keep the bond alive.

Thank goodness my boyfriend and I have each other because it looks like we don't have friends anymore.

1524,UnknownWaemen,1611049356,1,"At the start of 2020, I realized something about myself which made me go down into a deep depression a few months later. In May I realized that my ""friends"" I had at the time, which was the ones I had since childhood, were really toxic and mentally abusive towards me.

I decided to just be allies, but not friends. We're not speaking anymore except when doing school group projects or smth. Since then I've come out of my deep depression and have been actively searching for friends for like 2 months now.

I found some people on Reddit, but I feel like the outsider as I've felt in all my friendships I've had all my life. Everyone got along well, but as usual, I fell behind. I started to feel less welcome in that group and now I don't chat much besides like 5min every other day. People share stories, life, backgrounds, and here I am clueless as to what the fuck is happening. Like usual...

The thing is though. THAT IS FUCKING ONLINE. I've tried everything in real life, joining clubs, getting ""friend"" apps, just going out and talking to grocery store employees, and everything else I can think of, but I just can't seem to do it. My social anxiety is wrecking me too, it might not sound like I have much of it, but after every fail, I either cry profusely or I just feel numb, like I feel now, empty, worthless.

I don't know... Feels like outside of school where people aren't forced to befriend everyone because they won't spend the next 5 years together, it's impossible to make friends. I just... I need help, what can I do? Is this really going to be my life?

Not in a context that I'm the only one that got left out because I know some of my friends that are in my situation.

Back in school, I don't have anybody to talk to personally. So as a result, I also do not have anyone to text until late night which sometimes I envy some of my friends that have that kind of friendship.

 I do have a group that consists of 12 peoples but that just for  'school' group but, outside school we have our own friends. and you know, 12 are just too many to be intimate (not in a romantic way), so most of them also have their own small groups that consist of 4-6 peoples.

It's the most painful feeling in the world for me. So much so that if I could bleed myself dry just to distract myself from the thought of it, I would do it over and over again.

True suffering is not being able to escape anymore because everything you do and experience is tainted by the fact that you are alone, no one else is by your side to enjoy it, or congratulate you, or console you during difficult times. 

I would be that for someone else. I would care even deeper than that. I would try my hardest to make sure she felt as though nothing could compare to my love for her. That no one else could love her and understand her more deeply than I could, no one else would support her and let her be herself and want to do everything together (while still being our own people) like I could.

I just feel so lonely it’s very hard to make friends and I have no one to vent too I feel like I don’t belong in this world I’m keeping so much in from being molested as a child to not having anyone care about my day or just if I’m okay I suffer from nightmares and panic attacks and depression I barely have anyone that will stay up with me when I’m having a hard night or I’m waking up screaming and crying and shaking from my nightmares ... I feel like ... I’m sorry to bother anyone 😢",lonely,30F,2021-01-19 17:28:00

The campus used to be filled with people, and I had been trapped at home for so long I thought even if there won’t be as many people around, this is going to be better. Right now I don’t know if it is, neither of my suite mates talk to me, I don’t have the chance to talk with anyone since everyone is staying to themselves, and any time I go outside I get this haunted feeling creeping up my back. Everything is so much more quiet, it’s to the point where at times I’m completely by myself with no one around. If I’m lucky I’ll see one other person walking in the distance. I have some old friends I met in my first semester, but aside from them I am all alone. And the worst part is I fought to get here, cause my folks wanted me to stay home another semester. I thought it couldn’t get worse being by myself, but now I don’t even have my folks to hug me.

I have accepted the fact that i will never be in a relationship, let alone one where i can truly be me, and i will probably not make any more friends for the rest of my life, while the incredibly few i still have make quick work of distancing themselves. I stopped wondering whether i'm just so repulsive and boring that no one actually cares and worrying about fixing that, and instead i am just numb now.

I'm likely gonna start smoking very soon so my life ends faster (and also to distract me from the pain of loneliness), and i'm honestly hoping the rest of my connections to people are severed enough for them not to miss me when i'm gone, but i can't be bothered to do anything about it myself.
I think the saddest part of this is that, as someone who's always enjoyed sleeping, i don't really find any pleasure in that anymore because it makes me feel this void, this horrible feeling that there will never be anyone in my bed, to hold me tight and pat my head, or even anyone i can say goodnight to in like a group chat or some shit, and 9 out of 10 dreams i can remember once i wake up involve intimacy with someone in a way, and it hurts so much once i'm out of it, it's truly unbearable.

1554,whisper-world,1611031034,1,"Today I cried when I told my therapist I was lonely. I’ve been seeing her for almost a year now, and have seen many other therapists over the many years I’ve been in therapy, but today was different. I just felt I had this brick on my chest that I needed to let go. 

Btw this past week has been really hard because I pretty much coached my best friend into the hospital because of his own personal mental health struggles, my parents are in the middle of a divorce and I currently work alone. 

First, working alone sucks. I’m a teacher (I’m gonna keep it broad) and I’ve been used to in the past having assistants that can help me teach. Sadly, covid kinda ruined that because we don’t have enough money to hire anyone else right now. Luckily I’m good at my job and I do enjoy helping people. That doesn’t make it less lonely.

Second, as anyone that had ever been the child of divorced parents, it’s hard. I feel I walk the line of helping both of my parents out while simultaneously feeling like neither one is helping me the way I wish they would. Part of that is the lack of communication and part of that is just my parents being who they are. It took a lot of therapy to get to that conclusion, but I still love them and I want to support them through this hard time. 

Third, my best friend being hospitalized over mental health issues was hard. A lot harder than I thought. I’ve been the best friend that was hospitalized before, but I never thought it would feel like this to be the best friend. Also when you have to be the one on the phone telling your best friend he either needs to go seek help or I’m getting help for him is hard. 

Back to being lonely...... with all this going on, I’ve felt stuck in my life and wishing to be loved again. I want to feel someone hold me and make me feel like I’m loved. I know I’m loved by the people around me, but I want romance and beauty. I help others so much I’ve lost myself in the troubles of others, likely because it’s easier than admitting to myself I’ve been really sad to be alone. Covid hasn’t made it easier on anyone who struggles with feeling alone. I’m also gay so like my options are already limited, on top of the already limiting factors of where I’m currently located (not a lot of great options for potential lovers). 

So many people I thought I loved in the past turned out to be more like codependent relationships than love, and I’m at the point where I wouldn’t even mind a codependent relationship. I also know that’s not a good option and that isn’t going to fill this void in my heart of where I want to be loved and where I want to love someone. I want something real and raw, but I don’t have that right now and I don’t know when I will. 

People always say ‘be patient’ and ‘love will come when you least expect it’ but I’m pretty sure we can assume the people writing that shit have lovers. I am patient and I will wait, but that doesn’t make it any easier to be alone. Being alone is hard and anyone who struggles with feelings of loneliness understands that. I think that’s why I chose to post this. I want people to know that I’m lonely AND I’m gonna get through this. 

I also want others to know it’s okay and normal to feel lonely. If life was any easier, it would probably be a fairy tale, so I guess I’ll stick through this hard shit until I end up on the other end. One day I won’t be lonely, but that day isn’t gonna be today and definitely not tomorrow. Thanks for reading and god bless us lonely bitches 💕",lonely,Gay and lonely,2021-01-19 15:37:14

Around 8 people. A couple commented on them but no one took any. Then at the end of the meeting I told them all “Someone please take a donut home, I’d hate to waste them.” Someone said “Well you can just leave them, I think there’s a group meeting here in the morning.” Then everyone left and my $6 donuts sat on the table untouched.

If you read all this (Ik it’s long)  I love you and thank you for your time if you have any advice to make it not hurt please help 

We had been together for more than 3 years, he helped me grieve and watch my mother weaken and pass away from cancer a year ago.. we’ve been through so much.

 I didn’t realize fully then what my whole values are. I’ve grown to understand more has I’ve matured during our time together that I’m bisexual and poly. As well as actual values in attributes one being which is a lesson that hurts like hell but to never ignore the truth because in the end I couldn’t tell what was good or bad because I wasn’t listening to my gut.. I was lying to myself and trying to make myself fit what I thought they wanted me to be.   
I had a traumatic childhood and this could be part of why my perspective is different on relationships and sex in terms of monogamy. 

I feel like if you are attracted to someone you cannot physically help that attraction.. same things physically and mentally. Love is a renewable energy source, why force one to hold it back because you want all their love(or sex) to yourself? But that’s not love then.. and you won’t get that extra love because it’s not that it’s taking away from the first person, it’s more love for everyone.. 

I used this as an excuse to cheat which is not right (although I tried on a few different occasions to talk to my now ex about monogamy being maybe not right for me but he wasn’t interested in that part of me.
I’m partially relieved cause once he found out I didn’t have to hide from the truth but also from myself I don’t have to be only what parts of me he wanted me to be. 
I’m mad because I miss his smile he was so sweet and cute and funny and kind. I’m mad that I hurt him I prolly fucked him up and I don’t want him to have issues because of this but it’s happened all I can do is learn improve and move on... but deep down I hope we somehow reconnect years and years later but if I want to be able to truly heal I cannot let myself think like that.
I also need to forgive myself for letting him down. 
He was the only one Ive loved anyone else was just sex and I don’t even value sex so high up that’s why I was like well it doesn’t matter then cause it’s literally just sex... 
it’s annoying because I have never wanted anything other than myself with him in the far distance but I don’t get that and I won’t with any of these other people because they haven’t seen my soul. I don’t know that I want to ever show it to anyone again and I wasn’t even the one that got the most hurt in the demise of this relationship. 
I want him back I want to talk to him but I have to let him go because he needs to heal he deserves more and he deserves to be able to forget. I have to let him go. 
I’ll never love anyone like this again. Ever. 

What’s the point of monogamy in dating if the point is to get married and  be monogamous later?

1573,TopsyOxy,1611021560,1,"A huge part of loneliness is simple longing, and I truly believe that. To long for something to be yours, have it be in your life, and bring you joy or civility. There's always that need to be a part of something for me. Although there's so much often going on around me, I have little going on myself. Truthfully,  I still romanticize the idea of finding that sole person who would help me escape, help me be happy with myself and so on. But there's that fear of ""not being good enough"" and ""not being worthy/deserving"" for me. Wanting to be less lonely left a hole in me that kept growing the more I saw how much I lacked in life and now, there are times where I just sit in silence, feeling fuzzy and wanting to be more of something or someone.

I wish I could care less. I've spent so much time caring about the wrong things that I failed to build relationships at a young age and to just 'do' and not have to think that I couldn't or that I wasn't allowed. The relationship you have with your family and peers often affect how you make relationships in the future. If you're constantly told that you can't do something, and have to do what they want you to, you won't truly be able to be who you are nor find out who you are because of said authoritarian figure. It just makes things a lot harder. You turn cold or into someone only a very few number of people want to be around, but there's that question of how long they'll stay.

I remember asking this one girl if she thought I was boring and she responding by saying, ""You're not boring... you're just lame."" Though I can't entirely say she's wrong, she's not, but after years I still pounder how I can be less 'lame'.

You don't want to say the wrong thing, yet you don't even know what to say, but you'll say whatever you think will make them stay. But you crack and go back to a very idiocratic state. And then everything is finished, ruined, and eventually no more. Unfortunately, you can rarely go back. Even when you do ""go back"" that normalcy is no more, and the same isn't the 'same'.

I lived a very lonely  life i never had any friends i didnt have any relationship experiences with anyone i was a ghost in my childhood , my sister however was the complete oppesite of me she's very outgoing had friends and relationships she had all the experiences a kid should have her age and i realized i had none of it not even a childhood friend nothing &amp; nobody even my identity was not mine until i came out at age 18.

Ignorance was bliss back then i didnt care at the time but now that im growing older and more aware i realized how empty and lonely and hard my life really is going to be.....i was living the covid  life style years before covid was a thing.

Recently the days have been really getting to me ever since the break up i was never quite happy again sure but i managed i was okay but....recently the lonelyness/deppresion have been really getting to me....i been crying for days now and i lack any motivation to do anything meaningful or joyful with my life its as if i cant seem to find any joy in the things i use to like to do anymore....i just sit in my room listening to music or laying in bed....wishing for a better life then going to sleep naively thinking maybe something cool will happen tommorow maybe it will be different.

(Spoiler alert it wasnt)

Each time as i opend my eyes its been the same day as it was yesterday i go days without seeing anyone my age nor interacting with  them.

 ( i live with my mom and her friend currently and my best  friend lives in germany ) 

....im so tired....i dont even want to eat anymore  i dont want to wake up anymore recently and im worried about myself i feel dead  inside and the bad part is i cant talk about it with anyone.

my mom kinda sucks at comforting me and will just start  talking about some conspiracy bullshit or some anti vax shit im so tired of  hearing it its ruining our relationship.

My sister lives with her bf now i dont see her anymore and i dont feel close to her at all anymore....we are not on the same page.

My dad doesnt care about me he never calls or checks up on me and even though im use to that its still sad.

My best  friend although  a sweetheart that cares for me he isnt very good at comforting as my sad mood sours his almost instantley too so its hard for him but atleast he tries..

 Nobody seems to understand me.... i feel so alone.

My life is currently going nowhere i got a backlog on a few things i should know by now its really shameful....

Just another reason that although i would wish for a partner im probally not ready for them... its not gonna work out with the way i am now im working on this but its going rather slow.

I was orginally going to bed right now but a thought of me writing a goodbye note for my family to find and then ending it all it scared me.

I think im not okay...i have been trying to get some mental help but they made me wait for 10 weeks before i could even make a intake appointment with them...the wait has been agonizing im clearly not okay mentally.


I mean...you know your not okay when you play a visual novel and you wish you were the main charachter of that said novel because she got everything you wish for.

-Happy and loving family dynamic (we still have those but less after my sister move out)

-Friends with who i can interact with on a dailey basis and see in real life.

-Talents and intelligence i find myself very lacking in both departements.

-A guy who loves and accepts her as she is even if shes transgender. (Goodluck with that one) this something i really miss and wish i had...

-Fond memories of fun stuff happening in your life. 


I dont think if i was okay a visual novel would impact my way of thoughts and feelings so much...its like it opend a can of worms for me and made me realize that my reality is pretty grim and the fact i keep playing it despite having completed it already more then 3 times and it making me sad is probally not very  healthy...

So yea....thats me....thats Charity  a incapable insecure pathetic unhappy and lonely transgirl coming to terms with  the fact she probally not gonna have a good life..

Im sorry for  being sucha crybaby this entire post i wish i had something  worth while to say and be maybe uplifiting to other people on here who are also struggling and might read this but it seems all i have now is a hole where my heart should  be and my tears...

*sigh* why did i even write this ? Im so stupid.....

Thanks if you read this....mess of emotions that were all over the place tonight... i had to vent....i suppose.",lonely,My name is Charity (23) and my will to live is fading each day..,2021-01-19 12:46:49

One day I come back home and how does he start a conversation with me? By sending me porn. This guy could not even say hi or what's up instead? I mean shit, I had a good conversation with him after but why send me that?

Anyways, I cut contact with this guy and then he tried to get in contact with me right after I forget he exists. He asked me why I cut him out my life
 I explained why, he didn't say sorry once but instead tried to say ""I understand why you would be offended but that was a joke""

I'm a first time reddit poster (and english is not my first language) so sorry if I'm not following the guidelines or if my text looks weird. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so freaking lonely. I have no friends, my boyfriend only talks to me when i initiate contact and my parents are the best but they don't always understand me. 
I truly don't understand why i don't have friends. I'm a nice person and if i care about someone i will do everything for them. I've been through some shit so I'm very understanding and a good listener. I'm a little bit of an introvert but once I'm comfortable i talk a lot. 
The only thing that makes me happy is going to a bar or club because alcohol makes me and other people more outgoing, but everything is closed due to corona. Lately I've been feeling so so depressed and i have no one to talk to about it because the only three or so people i talk to don't understand. 

I don't even know why i'm typing this because no one can help me but it feels good to finally be open and honest for once while also being anonymous.

1592,nothotsxbrainempty,1611015364,1,"I’m brand new here, hi!   

I know life can seem lonely sometimes, and you’re very right in that feeling. Especially during tough times like these. But there are so many people who love and care about you, people who you haven’t even met yet! You may feel lonely but you’re never alone. 

I’m not opposed to the mindset that “We’re all just ghosts trapped in meat skins who exist on a floating rock somewhere in the universe for no good reason. My life is meaningless and full of pain, lemme just end it real quick” on even my best of days. However, there’s so much beauty in life to experience. 

I just got out of a 5 year relationship and adjusting to being by myself has been extremely tough. But it’s made me realize that my own company is enough. And I had a loooot of healing and growth to do (still do). But I want to be the best me possible so I can be healthy mentally and spiritually so I know I’m only putting love out into the world. 

I’m honestly just rambling. But if anyone sees this: you and LOVED, you are CHERISHED, you are VALUED, you are ENOUGH. If you feel like you have nobody in your corner to remind you these things, now you got me.

Stroll in the street two by two
All the boys and girls my age
Know very well what it means to be happy
Eyes gazed in eyes, hands holding hands
 
They go on lovingly without fear of tomorrow
Meanwhile, I go alone in the street, with my troubled soul
I go alone, because no one loves me
 
My days like my nights
Are in every way the same
Without joy and full of boredom
No one whispers I love you in my ear”

I mean, everyone uses me pretty much just for school and venting anyway. Don't get me wrong, I love helping people. But helping people gets me tired too. Once I'm done being everyone's dumptruck for emotions, I'm thrown away and discarded as if I were trash. They literally go ""boo-hoo-hoo help me do this and do that because I hate this and I don't know what to do about it"" then I do help them and they're like, ""okay, I'm done. Thanks, bye"" and walk away like nothing happened and suddenly, they don't know me anymore.

_It makes me feel physically sick._ My chest hurts everytime I feel lonely, and guess what? That's all the fucking time. It saddens me knowing that at the end of the day, all I have is myself with no one to see or hear or talk to. I try to talk to people I feel like I'm genuinely friends with, but even they are dismissive of me. They make me feel as if I'm a nuisance. I just don't feel lasting love or care or understanding people I personally know at all. Not even genuine kindness. I hate to say it, but everyone forgets about me and nobody really cares. At this point, I just want to have someone I can sit in complete silence with -- away from pressure and expectations and deep thoughts.

I'm a student in doctor of pharmacy, yes that's literally the course's name, Pharm.D; I'm sweet, kind, dorky, will make bad jokes and love dad jokes, I sing, write and photograph, I'm a cynic with faith in the mechanics of chaos in the cosmos, possibly a pessimist but more realist. 

I do possibly have bordeline personality disorder just so you know 

Here's what I love in the artistic or entertainment area: 

Moviewise: I love almost anything with good writing and a solid story but more dark toned things, my favourite includes Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, Interstellar, Logan etc, I recently watched Portrait of a Lady on Fire which blew me away

Music tastes: I am a mild stan of Lana Del Rey, I love Tame Impala and Weeknd, Cigarettes After Sex is the balm to my soul, I mostly enjoy sad music 
I do not like k pop, country roads with yodeling, they drive me crazy 

Painting or digital art wise: I don't have a specific taste because I haven't gotten into it but I do like an artist named Alena Aenami, I'll link it with the post 

Poetry: I do love Charles Bukowski and another poet named shadowofeve, I'm open to suggestions similar to their work 

I'm hoping for meeting someone who can talk long term, can stay in touch etc 
If you're snooping around my profile, just know I get wild ass mood swings so that's there, have a high sex drive too, you can ask me about it, I'll answer if I'm comfortable

Please be somewhere around my age and don't break my back carrying the conversation please

And I know I could not live an entire life alone. I don't know what to do about it. I hate feeling stuck like this. Everywhere I go, no matter how many people are there, it feels empty. I can be playing billards with several others and its like I'm playing with ghosts. I know 5 years might not be much to some, but its the longest I've ever been without someone. I'm losing my patience with it all. Im know im gonna delete this rant before 24 hours pass because I'll get angry at myself and say ""fuck it, why bother"" because that's how I feel about everything.

1651,nia_ellarius,1610987229,1,"Hello
I am 23 years old. I am from a south asian country.  feet tall, weigh around 115 pounds. I am in college. I am very shy and introverted and awkward around new people. But open up once I get to know people. 
Here's my question. In 23 years of my life, no guy has never been interested in me in a romantic way or in any other way. 
I went to an all girls' school and had no social media account, so back then I understood why no guy has been interested in me because I knew no guys.
I thought the situation would change when I go to college. But it did not. 
Even in my college, no one guy has shown interest in me the past four years. I have always thought it's because I am ugly. I am dark skinned with lots of hyperpigmentation, short and fat according to lots of people and guys in my country are usually interested in fair skinned skinny girls. 
I am just extremely frustrated sometimes. Like I get really frustated sometimes. 
After I started college, I started to come out of my shell and put myself out there to meet someone. I did not. Also, introverted girls around me get asked out as well, so don't tell me to put myself out there. 
I did start a situationship with a narcissist two years back out of loneliness and even he didn't want to be in a relationship with me. 
I am thinking maybe it will be the case for the rest of my life. ☹️",lonely,Why has no one ever been interested in me?,2021-01-19 03:27:09

I don’t know what to do anymore. Lately i feel like absolute shit. I can still function and do responsibilities but whenever i am alone in my room i just completely shutdown. I don’t feel like i have a drive anymore. 

We’re currently in an academic break so i have a LOT of time. I usually like to play games and interact with people but now i feel so disassociated and lifeless.

I have been lying down for like hours already and i don’t feel sleepy or tired but i also don’t have the will to do anything. Ive been like this for almost a month now, just in this tiring shitty cycle. 

I hate myself so much. I lost my teenage years to immaturity and now i’m losing my adolescence to both a pandemic and lack of will. To be really honest i’m fed up already. 

Regardless i’m trying to crawl back up. I try to reach out to friends but nothing really worked, I think we are distant now. I tried self improvement through health and exercise, the habit was never formed. Everyday i tried to convince myself that “everything will be better” “you will get better” “love yourself” but at the same time i’ll just argue to myself and get even more unmotivated.

I need to make some big decisions, I think more quickly, like keep up with school, also decide how I will manage a job I have, since it's with people and I feel like resentments going to grow. 

What to do about therapy, who to go back to, how long to wait, how much to spend. If I quit the job then where to stay, how much to spend. Otherwise I can't half ass it since I guess I'm affecting others in the process. Therapy is going to take a while though, and at a point where I can't even see a future to hold a job to support me, I don't even know. I'm left like I started from ground zero, like I'm 11 years old and nothing happened in the last 10 years. Like the past events were a lie, I believed this and this to be true but now I'm rewriting all those things. And also being asian doesn't help since maybe why I didn't get what I wanted from therapy and if that's true that gives me more reason to not try, to understand that it's not going to work out. I feel like I lost everything in just realizing. I lost any sign of friends since I saw it was all for show, I lost the career since even though I did college I never actually did it. I lost any sense of stability since I can't turn back on anyone. 

If it really is as I start to see it now, then my life just went from OK, to actually not good, to now actually even worse. I would have never guessed. I would not guess this is how it will end up but if I go back and remember, then yes I did know that something would give, I do remember never feeling right, I was coping. Then things really are much worse than I hoped they were. And the prospect more bleak, but that means I would have to start over from zero again.

I would like to find someone to chat with because I do have friends that I love to talk to but I just have this feeling that things won't be the same if I told them about my pain. 

As for what's wrong, I don't know.. I'm just lonely. I don't ever exactly feel happy or anything. I don't really smile like how I used to. Ever since I moved away from my old home life has been so much more dry. Covid doesn't make repairing my mental state and health any easier. I just listen to music or play videogames all day as coping mechanisms. I'm still finishing school and I am conflicted about my future. That doesn't really matter though. All I can really say is that my mental health got worse as years went by and now I'm at rock bottom. 

As I said before, I really just want someone to chat with and hopefully help dissolve my loneliness.

-I love music (I'll listen to anything with a good beat, I don't really like present day rap though.) 

-Drawing (this is more of a side hobby and i do it here and there. I'm not great at it.) 

-Writing (Also another side hobby. I mostly use it as an escape from reality but I do write for fun occasionally.)

I'm extremely lonely. I can't make friends at my new current small university. I live off campus and I know no one. I'm an introvert and not very sociable so it's been really hard for me to make any friends despite the campus being open and in-person. Everyday I would go to class do home homework, sleep and repeat, I don't interact with anyone and spends time in my room of the time. I tried joining clubs but I didn't felt like fitting in, and most clubs have people doing their own things. I don't want to live in solitude for four years. I have great ambitions and I want to work hard to achieve them but sometimes I get anxious thinking that so what if I achieve all my goals? I'll still be a loner with no friends and no one to talk to. I'm terrified of that and it's affecting my mental health greatly. I believe a huge part of it is the university I'm currently attending.

1719,ghostpepper665,1610944630,1,"   TL;DR: My friends all got girlfriends and I miss spending meaningful time with them. I’m also missing my ex because I miss what they’re feeling rn.     

         Don’t get me wrong, I’m very happy that my friends are happy and I truly enjoy seeing how they’re growing as people, but part of me is jealous and hurting.

         Some backstory, I have 3 very close friends. They all live in the same house together and I have my own apartment, but I have a key to their house and I’m there more than I’m home. All 3 of them got into relationships right about the same time and things are so much different now. 

          We all used to spend time together, as a group, literally all the time. We would just hang out, eat, smoke, watch movies, play games, do shit friends do. Lately though, it’s been nearly impossible to make plans to see them. I went from being over there 3-4 nights a week and being with everyone to seeing one or two of them every week or so. And I’m lucky that they’re still in my life, but they’re all so preoccupied now. I know that this is kinda just the natural progression of life and priorities change, but it’s been really hard on me and I’m not sure that they know that. Even when they’re around at the house, they spend more time in their rooms for personal space or distant when we’re together 
 
           Not only is it difficult to spend time with them now, but it’s also hard just seeing them with their partners. Ive been single going on a couple years now, for a multitude of reasons but mostly because I’ve had a really hard time moving on from someone who I know isn’t good for me. And seeing them all doing their own thing with their partners and out living their lives and it feels like I’m getting left behind. It’s making it really hard not to miss my ex and think back on the times that we had that are like the ones my friends are having now.

          I have to move forward, I’ve been trying the whole dating app thing and (even though that’s where I met my ex) I’m having a hard time with it. I always get caught up on the “maybe someday” when I think about her still, and I have to get myself out of that mindset. 

          Between working a full time job and with school coming back up, I’m afraid that I’m going lose my biggest, and honestly only support system and to be truthful, I’m afraid. I’m afraid of being alone. I’m afraid of being cut off from the ones I love but I can’t break this bubble into letting myself be happy. I don’t know what to do.

          Long story short, I’m struggling. I already feel so terribly alone and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve tried focusing on just bettering myself and becoming the person I want to be but it’s so hard feeling like I’m doing it all by myself.

           If you read this whole thing, thank you for putting in the time to acknowledge me! I’m just feeling really hard stuck and things are getting rough being in my own company so often now. If you have any thoughts or ideas or ways to help, please let me know.

He got a girlfriend recently and he said that we have to stop being friends. I’m really heartbroken. He threw our entire friendship away for a girl he barely knows. He was always really fun to talk to and we would send each other memes throughout the day that we thought the other would like. Now besides my bf, I have no one to talk to.

I’m really sad about this. My depression has been getting worse and I’ve been dealing with some drama with my family as well as some health issues.

1723,r24alex3,1610942581,1,"
I’ve struggled with severe depression for a long time, and sometimes I wonder if it started earlier but wasn’t noticed. Recently, it’s been worse than ever. I’ve tried so many different medicines but they don’t work, not really. I’m afraid that I’m just wired this way. That something in my brain is broken that keeps me from ever feeling joy, that keeps me awkward and unattractive and uncharismatic, that keeps me in the fucking dirt. I can’t focus or work anymore, I just get no joy out of accomplishing anything. Even if I do, it just hits me over and over that people my age don’t give a shit about me. They don’t care, and it’s my fault. I started to distance myself from my friends because I couldn’t put on a happy face anymore and they were super put off whenever I tried to talk about what I’m feeling. I haven’t talked to most of them in a while, and I know they won’t reach out no matter how long I wait. I don’t feel confident or attractive at all, to the point where it seems like girls don’t even know I exist. It’s not their fault obviously, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling so unwanted that most days I just want to collapse. I used to get joy from playing the piano, from video games, from working out. None of those things seem to help anymore, and I’m afraid they won’t start to be fun ever again. I feel like a cold, disgusting rock most of the time, just shuffling by. I wish I had people to turn to outside of my family. I can talk to my parents, but they don’t know what to do and I know they just feel obligated to care. I wish I could feel confident and attractive in my body, and be able to engage with people properly. I wish I had something to be proud of. I wish I could feel accomplished when I do things. Sorry if you read this far, I don’t really have anything interesting to say. I’m only eighteen, but it already feels like I’ve wasted so much time and so many opportunities that the chance for me to be well-adjusted and happy is gone. I don’t really know why I posted here. I’d ask for reassurance, but it would probably feel hollow, I don’t know how to make things better.

I kind of tried to meet people irl but since theres a pandemic thats....actually to be completely honest the pandemic hasnt changed anything for me. I just avoid everyone by nature and dont really talk with anyone except my friends. 

So i was on Tinder today looking to talk with someone, ik such a great place for that, anyway i matched with this cute girl who told me she thought i was cool but didnt want to use Tinder anymore and i was understanding, no harm no foul. That happened a few hours ago, i sent her another message giving her my email if she wanted to talk (i dont like SC because the responses disappear and i didnt want to show this girl everything about me from my fb account.) I felt email was a good choice.  Honestly, im not too worried about this, i understand depression all too well and being on Tinder and other apps like it make me depressed, so whatever.

So basically, im fuckin lonely, bro and its saddening to use Tinder and other dating apps. Idk, i could go to a dark place and im pretty much tip toeing on the edge right now, but its fine, whatever. Fuck the world.

I realize i may not seem like the funnest person to talk to and if you see my other posts in other places, youll know that im all over the place. I feel pretty good right now considering other times but id understand not wanting to talk.

1778,Mechanicalgoff,1610922647,1,"Even before my husband left me in October, there was just no physical contact - no hugs, hand holding, not even touching in bed. My one friend lives several hours away, and is now a no-go thanks to Covid. I feel so touch starved it's painful, yet at the same time, at this point the idea of touching another person makes my skin crawl.


I just don't know what to do with myself at this point. I crave and fear touch at the same time and it's wreaking havoc on my already terrible mental health. It's got me so distraught I end up with constant nightmares, now I go days without sleeping, only to crash for a few hours, and go back to do it again. It feels like I'm burning myself out, both mentally and physically.


I've been talking with my therapist and psychiatrist, but there's only so much that can be done over the phone, and any sleeping meds I've been prescribed haven't done a thing.

It's just wild to me, that something as simple as touch can deeply affect a person, I just hate feeling it firsthand.",lonely,30F | I haven't even touched another person in over a year.,2021-01-18 09:30:47

I never went to sleepovers, parties, vacations and stuffs that good friends usually do. And deep down its really hits me hard when ever i think about it. I never had a opportinuty to do this things, never be part of any friendgroup that shares similar interests or anything like that. I just never fit in.

I only had 3 friends, 2 of them from highschool, one is my childhood friend that i don't trust and like that much(he has some toxic behaviors that i really hate) we don't hangout very often due to they live far from me, except one of them.  Now, about that one friend lives close to me, we are kinda close but we don't share similar interests, it makes so hard to make plans with him, we don't do any activity besides going to a walk and chitchat. The other friend that i know since childhood has some kind of toxic personality. We share similar interests (anime,video games) but his selfish personality makes me want to end my friendship with him. He always put himself first, never cares about others feelings. If he can't have what he wants, I shouldn't have it too. That is his mind set. And he usually rejects my hangout calls. But i just couldn't end my friendship with him, than i will have no one to play games or watch animes. Now about the other friend from high school is,  he is a good guy and we get along well. But our friendship is kinda one sided. If I dont reach out first, he never does it. And he never shares his problems with me. I feel like he doesn't feel close to me as much as i do. So yeah, you get the rest. In my last year of the university, i feel like i miss the train.

Hello all,

I am a 24 year old male from the United States. I have gone through a lot over the past few years and I am honestly just tired. I truly wish I had lifelong friends, that simply isn’t the case. I enjoy the friends I do have, I appreciate them so much, but it’s just never enough. I don’t know what is ailing me so thoroughly. I’m sad too frequently and I know I’ve hurt the people I care most about. I’ve pushed them away and I have no idea if they will ever return. Even though I can keep hoping, I don’t know. I wish I could just tell them that I didn’t mean to. My anxiety and sadness made the world a confusing place for me so I didn’t act as myself. I wish I could say I would never intentionally hurt you. But maybe sometimes you can’t. 

However, what I can do is try to find someone else, make new friends. No one is a replacement but we have to try and keep going or else there is nothing. Life is not meant to be experienced all alone but you can only look out for yourself because no one else will. I’m asking for a friend to give me company, someone I can share myself with and maybe one day we can evolve into long term friends. I want a best friend, who can be there for me and I for them. If you are near my age range (21-25) and are from the US or Canada (so we can meet in the near future :) ) I would love to hear from you. I just want to make a connection and I am asking you very kind people for some help with that.

I see a single flaw and I'm thinking it's over before it's begun, even if the flaw isn't even a real flaw. I just think what's the point in trying, then being let down and disappointed. May as well only put effort in if it's seemingly perfect from the get go. Stupid.

I am not very social but I still in the past always had atleast one friend to hang out or stleast talk to at school, this year I moved over summer new school and with covid were only there 2 days a week rest is online. In the past I normally end up becoming friend with someone I sit by In a class, this year were in school only 2 days a week we have to sit 2 seats and a walk way apart with masks on and are given at most 5 minutes end of class per week to talk to eachother, and no group assignments of any kind. On top of that 2 of my classes are kids in a different grade and one of them isn't even at the same school. So I havent actually talked to anyone other than family in months, apart from 1 conversation in photography when going around-the-clock the school for pictures and one old friend that starts texting me again recently, but that only lasted for 3 week before she got to busy to text, no we only text a few words a week if that instead of long conversations we use to have a little under 2months ago. So right now I just feel more alone than I eve have before which I originally didn't think would be so bad but it effected more than I would have imagined.

1857,throwawaylonely12876,1610862599,1,"I’m currently sitting in my dorm alone on a Saturday night, wasn’t college suppose to be the best time of my life? 

I transferred to this school just last semester and since the moment I got here I’ve been empty, lonely, without connection to anyone. The only time I’ve felt ok was when I went back to see my family for winter break, but even that feels far away now. 

I even switched apartments this semester hoping to find some new guys that I could relate to, and things were looking up this past week. We had similar humor styles, liked the same hobbies and entertainment. I even hung out with all my roommates and some of their friends yesterday which turned out to be really fun! For once, I felt a part of something. I made people laugh, I was engaging, and I got to know a few people even more. 

I was riding that feeling today, until just an hour ago one roommate (who was staying home because of is chem hw) came into my room surprised I was still here. He stated that he thought I was at the “bonfire,” which I had no clue what he was talking about.

Turns out a few of my roommates went to some meetup without inviting me. One of the roommates who went even came by my room to say “what’s up” a few hours ago, yet never mentioned a bonfire at all. I was clearly twiddling my thumbs yet I guess it never occurred to him that he could’ve invited me. I suppose he didn’t want to. 

I’m tired. I know I’m not like some who’ve gone years and years without much social interaction so I know my pain cannot supersede that, but I’m still hurting. I had friends just 6 months ago, I had purpose. There was a time where I never had to worry about what I was doing during the day or on the weekend, because I knew for a fact I’d be spending it with at least someone. 

Ever since coming to this school I’ve tried to be nice, respectful, and engaging. I’ve inquired about people’s lives and i genuinely believe I’ve made good impressions. Even in this moment I find it hard to think that with all of that, some people would still just not like me enough to invite me out.

The real sad thing is, I have a girlfriend. I have someone who loves me, who cares about me. I never have to worry about my worth to at least someone, however, we are long distance and that presents it’s own challenges. Nonetheless I feel like a loser. Sometimes I think my girlfriend is the only one keeping me from doing something bad to myself. That scares me.

I’m grateful for having a girlfriend, but I’m tired of having nobody else. I just want friends who like me, who appreciate what I have to offer. I’m sorry for such a long post but I’m scared that if my life continues like this, I’m going to ruin it while I’m still young.

1870,pizzaguy889,1610857509,1,"I can't bring myself to do anything worthwhile nowadays.  I have anxiety, depression, ADHD and OCD. I have no job and hardly any money. I can't express my feelings, so I suck at talking to therapists in the few times I can even get one. I'm a 21-year-old man and I've never had a girlfriend; never even been on a ""real"" date. People always tell me the same shit, like ""be yourself"", ""just talk with more people"", and it doesn't seem to help at all. I overthink all the time, and I self-sabotage any time I begin to get close with anyone. I keep myself lonely. I don't know why I do it, but I can't seem to break the cycle. It's tiring; it has been for almost a decade now, and I have nothing to show for it. 

Lately, I've realized that no one has free will. We are simply particles set in motion from the beginning of the world, following predetermined trajectories, albeit with the occasional random jump. Ultimately, none of us have control over what we do. 

So, each person is more or less destined to end up a certain way. The people who were born and raised to have good self-esteem, social inclination, and decent mental health will probably do well. Those who weren't will probably not. After years of stagnation and self-isolation, I'm starting to think I'm one of the people who stays at the bottom.

1878,Revolver-Knight,1610854031,1,"I’m 17 so maybe it’s weird teen fears and hormone shit or moody ness or something

It’s just I read this article about what loneliness does to young men and I feel horrible and scared about myself 

I have a loving family and a girlfriend I date in secrecy because her family doesn’t like boys so it’s kinda long distance basically 

But I was reading that lonely guys end up using and abusing woman and that’s not me and how loneliness will end up being the cause of a break up.

My honey bun is the only  girl who’s ever given me a chance. Any other girl made fun of me or just ghosted me or took/tried to take advantage of me.

But she loves me and cares about me.
Every time she says I love you my heart wants to fucking explode.

But I fear and I will admit I have clinging tendency’s I’m not proud of. But I fear that I could affect her struggles with depression negativity. I’m worried my constant worries will affect her badly 

 I don’t want to do that.

Then I watched the movie UP today and it’s one of my favorites because of its thematic messages and the fact it’s me and my Mema’s favorites.
But watching Carl being so just grumpy and alone just really got to me and I had a though of end up like that but never getting out.

And for now I just wanna say sorry to anyone else reading this I know I’m way better off than many people family and people wise. My apologies for being greedy.


I’m 17 like I never really have gone out beside being by myself a and going to the movies cause I love movies and stories. Before we started dating I used to wrap my arms around the chair next to me and pretend a girl that loves movies as much as I do was there.

I never went to home coming or proms or football games. It used to never bother me or I never cared  cause I focused more on my grades but now that I’m a senior and I’m so close to being an adult and I’m Supposed to go to college I’m afraid of losing my school friends I’m afraid of my life being consumed by a job or school. Like I know it’s important to go to school and have a job and expand you money making capabilities cause of the cost of living and job competition but the emotional side of me sees no point because of a lack of friends to vibe with. There’s so much I wanna do I kinda feel limited cause I can’t drive. I wanna go downtown and experience the history. My other passion Is history btw lol 

I love movies that take me on a journey real places or fictional 

Sometimes I listen to game grumps or oney plays so I feel like I’m just chilling with friends vibing playing video games.


I feel like I’ve wasted my “greatest years” and I’m never Gonna like amount to anything I’m gonna end up old and alone my honey bun will leave me.

I just find it hard to talk about this to anyone that cares about me. I know they’d listen it just feel weird.

I feel greedy cause her telling me “I love you” just fucking makes my mind explode. I feel like a bad boyfriend cause I can’t treat her like the queen I see her as. She tells me I’m a good boyfriend but sometimes I don’t feel like it.

I’m sorry once again cause I know I’m better off than many.

1879,Essaya90,1610853413,1,"Pretty sure now my GF of 2 months is ghosting me.

The past few days of ghosting has been terrible, and a mind fuck. Now on top of those being ghosted feelings, I get to have all the typical ""break up"" depression too. I dont have friends, so cant hang out with people to distract me. Being in a small city, plus with Covid, cant really go do stuff to distract myself. I do Taekwondo, but thats only for 1 hour every Mon and Weds. Not focusing on work enough. Struggling to find enjoyment in gaming.

Life just feels miserable. I know it should get better in a couple of weeks or something, its just always really tough in the moment.

I have social anxiety, and I know I can function in public now much better than a lot of other people with SA, but socializing and making friends is still something that I have always sucked at. So its not like I can even just ""go out and meet people""

I set up Tinder and Bumble again, in the faint hope that it might help distract me. But as I'm sure 99% of people that use Tinder know, it usually leads to more hopelessness and feelings of ""forever alone""

I struggled with v v low self-esteem for most of my life and for the past year I have spent a lot of time and energy working on this (thank you COVID for this one positive LOL). I finally feel good enough for and ready to be in a relationship.

The problem is that I'm in my last year of med school, applying to residency now, and have no idea where I'm going to end up in a few months. I *really* want to get out there and meet people (as much as I safely can w/ COVID even if it's just talking to people over video call) just so I can get used to thinking of myself as a person who can go on dates and who another person could be attracted to... but I literally don't have the time right now because I have applications and interviews to worry about. I don't want to waste brain power on this and I also don't want to waste anyone's time when I'm busy thinking about this huge transition in my life and am also probably leaving in 3 months anyway. A few weeks ago I downloaded Bumble and was SHOCKED that there were actually some guys who were into me and they seemed really great - but I just felt overwhelmed by everything else going on in my life right now and deleted it. (But at least now I know that people CAN be attracted to me! No one has ever liked me before so I always used to feel like it was impossible.)

I am just frustrated lol. I'm really really proud of myself for coming this far but now I finally feel ready to take some action but it's just not a good time for it right now. It's also frustrating that I could have started trying to date in the summer, when it was safer w/ fewer COVID cases in my area and I was less busy, but I just didn't because I thought it would be blasphemous bc we're in a pandemic and I spend time in the hospital everyday... but then I found out that a bunch of my med school friends (and non-med school friends) met people during the pandemic despite being in the same situation. (Kinda salty that they didn't follow the rules tbh but I wish I had done the same lol)

sljfkldjf I am happy but also frustrated, you know?

Any tips for how I can channel this energy into something positive that prepares me to start dating when I finally can in a few months (hopefully)? I know I'm 25 and am already so old and behind and people will think it's weird that I have no experience, so I just want to get over that hurdle ASAP when possible so that I can get at least some experience, gain some confidence and be ready to meet someone and not mess it up due to lack of experience/knowledge about dating.

Any advice is appreciated, sorry if this makes no sense, I am just :/ :/ :/ sad but still proud of myself lol",lonely,Just kind of frustrated :/,2021-01-17 14:15:55

1884,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1610851750,1,"Hi there! I'm a 31 M from the Midwest. To be upfront, I'm looking for a friendship first. So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships. But this pandemic has changed the landscape and I've considered exploring the online route. 

What I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens. 

Some of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

Now it's my responsibility to get her to talk to me again. Because we have no time to meet in person and live on two sides of the city and I don't want to talk about it through chat - it's hard... I did try, she just said ""not today"", we talked for a minute like everything is fine and... it's been a week. 

The rest of my 'friends' took a side and I'm left basically by myself. And the more time passes, the less I want to talk about the whole matter.

And also the more time passes the more I get pissed at her AND at everyone else. Because I did something, I broke it up against my will because I value my friend more - and no one cares. Everyone is on her side and not one person asked how I AM feeling. And frankly I've been feeling Shitty for two weeks now.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD?

i've been reading and listening to to what smart people were saying years ago about where they thought society was heading.

people like aldous huxley, carl jung, alan watts, jiddu krishnamurti, terence mckenna and rod serling (yes the twilight zone guy) to name a few.

we are there, folks.  :(

their foresight was incredibly (if not downright scary) accurate.

There’s this guy that I’ve been in love with for at least 4 years. And I finally had the courage to tell him not so long ago (which was a huge effort because I’m an introvert and really shy person).

I don’t really give attention and affection to a lot of people in general (it’s pretty rare when it happens). But with him, I felt like there was something between us; and that we were sort of tune with each other. 
I love him so much, and he makes the things becoming worst.

He told me that he always liked me, but he wasn’t certain that he had romantic feelings towards me. We saw each other a couple of times since then.. (3 times in total). 
But last time I came to his house, he thought I was only coming to sleep with him. He even told me “why did you came if you don’t wanna do it”? I just wanted to see him because I care for him.

But then I asked him if he wanted a purely physical relationship and he told me “no, I wouldn’t want to make it with you if I didn’t liked you”. But then he told me that he doesn’t want a serious relationship. I don’t understand, you like me but you don’t want something more than platonic between us?

I feel like he’s playing with me and he only wants me for my body..
I realize that this relation will become even more toxic as it is now if it goes on like this. But I love him, and I don’t want to loose him.

But it doesn't seem like it now that I look at it again. My sister, who isn't a whole lot different than me, except for a few different interests has a vastly broader and happier social life. Did I do something wrong after all, is there something wrong with me?

My parents would probably say it's because I'm an antisocial gamer who doesn't want to leave the house, which is, unbeknownst to them is because of my social anxiety spurred by my depression. But see, that can only go so far right? I've met up with people outside of school before, and I act just as sociable as everyone else.

Would you like them to let you vent and try to be supportive OR would you just want a nice causal conversation where you get to vent but also talk to someone about Random things? 

This Subreddit helped me a lot at the start of January, I am really grateful for the people who contacted me and didn’t pressure me to talk about it but still offered me tons of support. So I’d like to help others the same way I received Help. But I am wondering whats the best way to do it? 

Lastly, Don’t feel pressured to reply to people daily, we all know sometimes we need our space or even not reply to a certain person (I am guilty of that lol) just don’t pressure yourself, this is a safe space, so don’t put too much pressure and responsibilities on yourself (Conversations and carrying it can be a draining thing, I understand that far too well too) my point is, Do whats right FOR YOU. and if the other person doesn’t understand, oh well.

I moved to settle in a new area in 2017 to escape an apartment where an assault happened. In 2018 I was 139 lbs. worked out 3-4 day and  with a trainer two days a week. Kick boxing, swimming, boot camp, boxing, running, HIT training. Then I was screwed over by a woman I trusted (my trainer) and a whole bunch of other stuff caught up to me.     I spiraled and became pretty much agoraphobiac. 
The reason that seems like a bit of an over reaction... is because it was - I have c-ptsd and I struggle with this type of thing.  Couldn’t even take the trash out.  I lost my friends from the gym : every last one.  And they did come to check on me.    But I was so broken.  I spent about 5-6 months inside and I gained close to 60+ lbs. cholesterol went up, got GERD, bad skin etc.   I’m now obese and I have no friends.  My one friend I retained since then has been my bestie since then she has been there through thick and thin. And really bad.   But I’m so lonely. She just moved away.       I tried to start dating again recently after spending most of 2019/2020 in intense trauma focused therapy.  

Now on the other side with covid ...I just feel broken.    And sooooo lonely.         It’s hard for me to relate what I’ve gone through to other people - especially men -because they maybe have not ever been put in a physically dangerous situation based on their sex.

I just turned 21 a couple of months ago, and I just feel like such a strange person, people treat me as if I were autistic or something because of how “different” (I guess?) I come across. And please don’t think I’m trying to come across as some “special, unique” person when I say that, as that is the furthest from what I would prefer given my, admittedly, limited experience in life. I live at home, and my situation is obvious to my mom and sisters. I have no job, I’m not in school, and I just don’t do anything. I procrastinate everything, from simple things like brushing my teeth, to things that don’t even make sense, like reading a book I want to read. I’ve never had a legitimate girlfriend, I have no clue how fulfilling it’d feel to have someone just want to be around me. I can only imagine how beautiful that would be. The only girl I have ever genuinely wanted to be with (she liked me as well, I just didn’t do anything about it hah) is long gone now. We went to high school together for a semester, but we were pretty much just acquaintances, so we never kept in touch, as we didn’t have each other on social media. She’s doing whatever now with whoever, and rightfully so, but I just can’t shake the feeling of being left in the dust by my actions and circumstances. I’m told I’m a good person, but every year of loneliness makes me feel as though my positive attributes are just becoming more weathered and worn. I feel like I have nobody to share anything at all with (whether that be silence, understanding, ideas, whatever it may be). I just feel so out of place, and like the ying and yang of everything just isn’t worth it. This world doesn’t seem as though it was meant for any life to dwell. Idk man, I was just sitting here and I thought about that girl (pretty sad of me, as I have no doubt she’s forgotten about me), and the silence and stillness of the room just felt different, almost as if it knew what I was thinking about and began to mock me. It would be nice to have a new voice shatter the silence in here, to have someone interested in just being with me or getting to know me.

You have just as much reason to believe me, as you do not too, so I don't expect everyone to Believe all this.
The reason for this post is to hopefully meet someone or maybe it's to vent I'm not sure.

I've been alone for a long time my last relationship was a disaster. I'm a gamer, a film buff, I have an interest in the supernatural. 
I am a good person, at least I like to think so. I always did the right thing, I was too nice, too generous and people took advantage of that. I was abuse at home and school.
I always looked the other way when people lied and bullied me, when they insulted me and it was a mistake because now I have a hard time sticking up for myself.

I have be sexually assaulted by a man and a woman not at the same time. 
Like I said it was easy for people to take advantage of me and I'm okay with what happen I've found peace there, the part that unsets me is if i come forward no one will care or believe me.
I think about all the bad things people did on me and it keeps me awake at night.
I could list out hundreds of times people hurt me but that won't do any good complaining.

I have had weight problems in the past but it's under control now just a few more pounds until my goal weight.
I don't work as I've been battling depression but I'm take steps to be working by the end of the year.

As looks go I'm average, I'm also short at 5'4 and yes most of my girlfriend's have been taller than me and no they didn't care about height.
I'm open minded and I never judge anyone, as I don't know their story so I don't think it's fair to judge them. 
I'll accept everyone for who they are no matter what you believe about yourself.

I sometimes wish I had someone to cuddle at night just to talk or introduce to my favourite games and movies.
Maybe show them a TV show from years ago they didn't know existed.
To listen to them knowing that I'm helping them by making sure they are heard.
I know someday I'll be okay, I'll have kids and be happy and the wait is sometimes torture but I know I'll get there.

I still don't know what the point of this post was maybe to vent maybe I'll meet someone like me.

2012,Webz235,1610772631,1,"This has been happening for the last half of my winter break. I either have a breakdown or I feel completely neutral about everything. I’ve stopped talking to the few friends I have and when we do talk I find it very hard to have the desire to keep chatting. I feel like a burden to everyone so I might as well keep any negativity away from them and not interact. I quit Instagram to put away some painful memories and just to get away from that burning dumpster fire in general. I’ve gone from being desperate to have connection and interactions to honestly not giving a crap. I don’t want to talk to anyone anymore. God I just don’t give a shit about anything anymore. I don’t find enjoyment in the hobbies I used to. I don’t find enjoyment in any of life anymore. I’m so sick of covid, I’m sick of politics, I’m sick of the violence, I’m sick of the lying media and full of shit politicians who are literally only in it for power and money.

2013,JudgementalJester,1610771275,1,"The thought of turning 20 this year and never had a relationship makes me feel cold. Like I've been left out and forgotten in winter. 

A few months ago I was hopeful, I thought that something might change. For more context, a girl I met through my brother asked for my number from him but didn't message me. My brother put here contact on mine, and I thought it was someone else. 

Replied to her status once about a song and we hit it off from there. We texted daily. We talked about the most bizarre things. We met up in school a few times and talked. She said I was cute and showed interested in things I liked. We shared intimate details about over lives and past. I thought there was a genuine connection. 

When the semester started she grows a bit distant. Any attempt to make plans was met with excuses. I wouldn't hear from her unless I reached out first. Then I learned that she had a boyfriend. 

I wish I wasn't so hopeful. I wish I could have seen the signs. This sort of thing had happened several times since middle school, and I should have learned. 

Today my emotions drove me to put my thoughts on paper, and that's what I want to share.

     THE COLD

""The ever-present feeling all around you.
The unbearable chill that penetrates you, soul.
The very air showing it's hostility.
Assaulting all your senses.
That's the feeling of the cold. 

We describe things of joy and things of sorrow with this word. 
A cold drink, the bitter cold of winter. 
These are just a few examples of its duality.

In such conditions, it's only natural to seek out warmth,
No matter the form it takes. 
Is that so wrong?
To desire warmth. 

Wondering endlessly,
Looking for that feeling,
The sensation of warmth.
That is the fate of many, 
Including me. 

Sometimes we come across embers. 
We hold them tightly, hoping for a fire. 
A fire that never comes. 

We know these things, yet we chase them, 
Why wouldn't we? 
All we've know is the unforgiving frost of winter. 

You don't need to wonder far.
You'll see so many campfires.
So comforting and inviting, safe from the cold,
Fit for only two. 

The flame had never seemed so close.
But it was shared by another. 
I was just too blind to see it. 
Too foolish to think that I would be accorded such. 
To think that someone would want to kindle a flame with me.

The thought of accepting my fate and getting used to the cold sounds so appealing. 
Caves, furry clothes and the occasional shelter. 
All these are good tools to fight the cold. 

Now I wonder this endless wasteland of life with only my own body heat to keep me warm. 
Even in the coldest night,
Even in the harshest storm,
I will bear the cold. 

I won't let the cold take me. 
I won't let it freeze me, 
And let it make me numb to everything. 

I still want to feel.
Even if all I feel is the cold"".

2043,cassie_to_heart,1610761458,1,"A long time has passed since I posted here, and I'd figured that a prospective connection is in order. I've restrained myself in trying to erase my post history given it may scare off any applicants but I decided against it in order to find those who can have the capacity to understand myself, and experiences, even if it meant the reminder of it being enough to make it difficult to stifle the emotions rising in my chest.

The only people in my life who closely matter to me is my existing male friend in the USMC who just got back from a field op but given his responsibilities, I've made the choice to not become a potential burden and liability and a another male friend in WI.... yet thousands of miles away. However, I found that being able to share something so innate, personal in my life has been something that brought me great hesitation in sharing but the semblance of hope of someone truly understanding, acknowledging my experiences... guiding through it... the candle is still it though I doubt for how long. Honestly, I'm on the verge of losing hope and it has made me take an approach to feeling less vulnerable, more distant... more cold and I feel powerless.

For background 6 months ago, I was partnered with the first man I've ever loved, in an LDR... never regretting the time spent. One day, at work in an aged care facility unbeknownst to me, he wanted to eat a bullet to the brain, in part due to combat injuries sustained also in the MC. I wasn't there in his time of need, when quietly, he must've truly expressed his then deep desire for me to be there. I was well familiar with his tendencies, and I knew deep down when he seemed distant, I sensed it. Since then, I've fallen through a myriad of personal hells too many to count, enough to actively consider moving to WI in the distant future for a fresh, clean new slate and leave the past behind here in Australia.

Now, I'm looking for a penpal who shares an unspoken ability to mutually understand mine and his experiences, preferably guys who are AD/retired. I am also open to guys who are considering enlisting, much easier to be able to bond through the pain, sense of trauma and loss. To the civilian world, it feels my experiences are ignored, they don't exist. The same hollow platitudes ring hollow and I'm simply exhausted. I am still open to making penpals with civilians, but the extra depth of personal connection can make it difficult given my experiences.

My first penpal I've made a year ago was former Navy/CO and a current LEO whom we shared much correspondence, down to the mundane things in life though it was infrequent. Ideally, I'd want someone long-term.

Now, sharing things about myself:

After about 3 schools in from the time of writing this, I have confessed my love to about 5 girls. The closest moment of getting into a relationship was a few years ago. But, she was “confused” and left it at that. I, being emotionally challenged with social anxiety and ADD, I was freaking out when she told me what she felt. Like I said, turned out she was “confused”. And the other times, ignored. Although, one time I was “friend zoned”. 

Point is, in this school year, a lot of people are developing feelings for others. I have not, as for the girl who friend zoned me left the school, and one that was confused was pure cringe, and the rest, apart from one, other schools.

But I have this feeling as if a little fire is starting to burn again. I-I do-I don’t know! It’s confusing! I haven’t told anyone, and it’s not necessarily feelings, but I’m *afraid* they are!

I don't really have any friends because I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship that took up all my time and effort, and finally was ready to try to meet people (both friends + dating) around a year ago. I didn't make a ton of progress because I was kind of out of practice social wise (not horrible just took some time to feel comfortable with it again), and then covid hit and now I can't really meet people around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried making friends online which helped for a bit, but not being in the same room as a human just watching tv or something is really getting at me. I'm having a hard time focusing on my job or really anything at this point. Nothing is fun or makes me feel anything positive anymore aside from eating (which obviously isn't great...) Anyone I'd want to reconnect with that I've known in the past is either geographically really far away or is not taking covid stuff seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want a hug and to sit on the couch and watch a movie with someone. And honestly have me be their first choice to do that with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really scared that once the pandemic isn't as much of a problem that I'll be too far gone to be someone that someone would want to be around.

2054,the_angryhomo,1610757355,1,"I'm a 22 year old guy struggling with multiple health issues. Over the last few years, I've gone from a healthy, active, and social person to someone who's lucky to socialize once per month, has trouble walking for more than 30 minutes, and has trouble balancing his work and school life against an endless slew of doctors appointment.

The worst part is that I'm just functional enough to have some semblance of a professional life, though that may change soon. 

I have a boyfriend and our relationship has been fraught. He's cheated on me twice and I've caught him on dating apps. I love him, and I know he loves me, but sometimes I feel so alone. I have trouble doing physical tasks, but he makes me get groceries and never does himself. It's been over two months. I've asked him, but he doesn't listen. He has mental health issues, and we've besn through some traumatic stuff, so I try to be considerate. I can see that a lot of what he does comes from his mental illness, but some days I feel like I hate him. He's successful at what he does, and does try his best to be kind to me. 

I don't really have anyone to turn to, so I spend a lot of time feeling shitty. I go to therapy, but I'm scared to tell my therapist. My family is poor and I live with my boyfriend. My mom can't afford to take care of my siblings, let alone me. I'm putting myself through school, but I feel so burnt out. I'm worried that I won't have what it takes to be successful post-graduation. I'm worried my boyfriend will break up with me if I fall apart. He wants us to move to a new country after graduating. I'll go with him, but I worry that he'll cheat or leave me because of my health once we move. He tells me that I'm his number one priority and that he wants to grow old with me. I love him and I want to trust him. 

No matter how miserable I feel, I try my best to push forward. But even though I'm trying my best, I still feel like a failure. I have dreams. I want to contribute to society and live a healthy, productive life, but it's so hard.

2056,pairofgucciflipflop,1610756786,1,"Disclaimer: It's not only meant for love relationships but also for friendships + my English is very bad, I apologize deeply.

Tonight I find myself in my bed thinking about my role in a relationship, because my life hasn't been very lucky regarding this specific topic. I thought that I was overthinking as usual but this time I guess that I found a truth which is hard for me to accept.

I met a boy on tinder in November and I thought that he actually may be interesting because he'd put a lot of effort into his bio. We matched and instantly connected pretty good. We've decided to call or FaceTime each other at least once a week, which worked for about a month. But since the end of December we kinda lost each other.

We aren't talking as much as we did and we also never called each other since the 27th of December. I didn't think it was that big of a deal because he may have had better things to do, like idk but I also didn't want to disturb him with whatever he was doing. Once I had the courage to ask what he was doing but he said that he was just laying in his bed, basically doing nothing. I was worried about our chemistry which has been a 10/10 for sure but he simply responded ""it's kinda gone, isn't it?""

That's where I realized that I fucked up... Again.

It obviously isn't the first time this happened to me. I lost many friends and love opportunities this way in a rather similar time span. Thats the reason I asked myself why I am this way and how I can change myself so I can't lose people which are very close to me. It's been 5h since I wanted to go to sleep but all the questions keep me awake. Why am I unable to keep the interest high enough towards the ones close to me? Why is everyone turning their back to me that quick? Am I really that boring?

Maybe you guys have something to say about that. Anyways, have a nice day.

Where is he possibly be going for dinner during a locked down pandemic with no indoor dining in the dead of winter? No clue, he didn’t offer any details.

2059,Inidae,1610752751,1,"I’ve been in about 40 discord groups but as of now I’m down to three groups. Over the course of the years I’ve left discord servers with toxic communities, insensitive admins, circle jerk-cliquish members. It became second nature to leave groups when the going goes tough and I feel like I don't belong. Often nobody notices or even cares that I left. I tried so hard to be an active member of servers but I get ignored or treated badly. I decided to delete discord on all platforms except on my laptop so that I can keep communicating with what little associates I have left.

Even when I deleted discord on my phone, I always had an urge to check the notification tab to check if someone sent me a message in a group. It's a painful reminder that I'm lonely. There's no one to share game screenshots with,  have discussions about anime, or even seeing/posting art I/people make.

I'm practically invisible now, never made an impact in any community. I'm convinced I'm forgotten. 

Never had many friends growing up so I turned to online as an alternative. Been talking online since I was 10. It was risky but I had no choice..it was that or I would feel alone and miserable. 

Don't tell me it will get better.

Don't tell me to do this and that to “better” myself.

Ok so this is going to be one of the very few times that I actually open myself up. I don’t have anyone else to talk to. But lately I have been feeling so lonely and misplaced. I have slowly drifted away from all of my friends as I realized that they were all fake. They never cared about me in the first place. I stopped contacting all of my friends for about a week. And not a single person called or messaged me during that time. I could see on their storys that they were out having fun and doing stuff. But no one ever contacts unless they have no one else to play with or if they need information like ”when’s our next class” or ”when should this assignment be turned in”. Nobody cares for me except for when they can get something out of it. 

And I also feel misplaced. By that I mean I struggle to find someone else like me. No-one has the same interests as me. I feel like I am the only person in my whole city in my age that likes what I do. I can appreciate the deeper more meaningful things in life. For example I have always been fascinated and inspired by philosophy. The great thinker Allan Watts is one of my big idols. Or maybe the deeper questions about life? What pour purpose is? Who are we? I like to do things that have actual deeper meaning to them. Thing like talking about deeper feelings and really getting into our own brains. 

Whilst all my ”friends” care about is alcohol and where they should have a party next. It feels like as if they can’t think at all beyond alcohol and other stupid stuff. I haven’t met a single person in my whole life in my age that can relate to what I’m thinking or views life in the same way as I do. It leaves my outside feeling alone like there is nobody else like me. No matter who I have tried to talk to they all seem confused or a bit behind. Like they can’t relate at all or understand me. I don’t like seeing myself as ”above” other people. But it makes me feel like all my ”friends” are more ”simple”. They don’t have so much to think about and they don’t really care either. 

So as I said I am feeling lonely, and even more so by every day that passes. Do I need to get out of this town? Find new people? Because I live in a very small town and I know basically all the people that live here. And when I tell you they are all the same. All they like to do is cruising around in their cars, drink every weekend and vandalize stuff. 

I am only 16 years old and maybe this a part of being a teenager? I really don’t know. It leaves me feeling so out of touch with the rest of the people my age.

2085,Anonmami,1610736254,2,"The past 2 years have been incredibly difficult for me. 

I lost a lot if friends and family for a plethora of reasons. A major reason for me losing friends has to do with me being assaulted, but thats all a lot to talk about. As for my family, we’ve always been pretty broken and as I’m getting older and I’m becoming more aware of the loneliness that comes with coming from a broken family. 

The friends I once had were never really around for me when I needed it so I always kind of felt alone on my journey. It wasn’t until quarantine and me losing my job that i realized how truly lonely i was and i had been just running through life on autopilot trying not to give that thought any time of day. 

I spent my birthday alone. All the the holidays were spent alone. Its been really unbearable and I can’t stand dealing with it on my own anymore. 

I met a guy on reddit and we hit it off really nicely and it was really great because i had not interacted with men like this in a REALLLLLLLLYYYYYYY long time. This was also the first time i had sex in a long time and i was learning to be comfortable with being touched. 

But then i had a bad day and I reached out to him for support. I just felt alone and really needed someone to be nice to me that day and he just didn’t respond at all. I understand that people can be busy, but it hurt. He had spent the past few weeks telling me we can help each other and i could talk to him and that us meeting was was perfect and that i was perfect, so i thought i could reach out to him and i thought I could be vulnerable with him. But after i expressed how i wished he would have at least talked to me that day, he told me I couldn’t rely on him like that. 

I understand that people have their own issues and problems and they cant always be available for me. But i have made myself available for people, and i wish someone else could do the same for me. 

He did apologize about it. But now I kinda don’t trust him and knowing I can’t rely on him doesn’t sit right with me. 

I can’t stop thinking about how there’s not one person in the world that is here for me. Not one. Not even the men I’m intimate with. 

I cant even be on social media anymore. I see everyone with their families, friends, and significant others and i just want all that so badly. Im happy for everyone that has all that. But see it and think about how much i dont have anyone and it really hurts. 

I spend all this time alone. I try to understand myself. I try to understand others. I can’t bare how helpless this feels. I want REAL friends and i want to be intimate with someone that i can at least reach out to on bad days. 

I used to be extremely su*c!dal, but I haven’t been in a while. But i keep waking up feeling extremely empty and alone and Im really scared that these feelings are going to lead me down that path again. 

I don’t even know what im expecting out of this post. I just want to rant and let go of some of my thoughts. I found r/lonely today and i thought it was pretty cool that we can just come here and talk about these feelings.",lonely,I can’t seem to find reliability or consistency,2021-01-16 05:44:14

2093,codecrunchie,1610733036,1,"Hello and behold, prepare for a long post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reason my friend [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ spent over 8 months working in their spare time on a friend finding project. Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28Qs, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. It's basically this info:  


* more about you
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures 
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.  


**Concerns:**

A few people have concerns about the above - but you can (and probably should be anyway) be completely anonymous if you choose - just use a throwaway contact info, and also there is a very simple and short privacy policy as well. And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) and mine as well.

**What is the final result?**

The algorithm searches over 3900 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches (active in the past 2weeks)** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

**Final tips:**  
I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with notifications recently - but these usually get fixed quickly. 

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

Don’t drink it too fast.

Let the warmth radiate

To your hands, and slowly fade away

Watch the steam rise from the top

Like a subway car full of regretful smokers

Force yourself to drink the

Cold and bitter remains.

&amp;#x200B;

Lay on the floor every night 

staring at the ceiling

Put on your favorite song.

The one that reminds you

Of a party you went to

That one time when people

Still remembered your face.

&amp;#x200B;

Go on drives for hours to

Different neighborhoods and

Watch children play baseball

And couples go on dates

Watch dogs chase each other

In the park

And the old man giving bread

To the pigeons.

&amp;#x200B;

Sit on the bus and have a

Conversation with a stranger

Who smells like rosewater

Who fosters children because she

Was never able to have them on her own.

Do not collect contact information

Instead remember their face in

Snapshots marred by whiskey and

Late night talks.

&amp;#x200B;

Go on a walk and step in gum

Hold back hypothetical tears as you think

“It only ever happens to me.”

“I am worthless.”

Even if you tried to cry, you don’t

Know if anything would come out.

You somehow miss the mornings

Where you would wake up with tears in your eyes

And go to bed the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Always remind yourself that the

Graveyard has no vacancy and that

It is better to be lonely for the rest of your life

Then not have a rest of your life.

That’s what everyone promised

So you might as well listen.

Nobody said it would be easy

But they said it would be worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a cold shower and

Try to feel something other than

Self inflicted heartache and insults

Try to feel what you used to feel

Back before everything melted into

A vast obscurity.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a conversation with yourself

As you stare emptily into the

Foggy mirror.

Notice everything wrong with

Your stupid face.

Flip yourself off to remind yourself

That you are nothing. Not even

Worthy of your own respect.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember every single time

That you let someone down.

And take a vow of silence

Because there is a reason to all of this

And maybe it doesn’t involve you.

Maybe you should just be quiet.

No one likes you unless you’re drinking anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Grab your watercolors and paint on

The walls of your bedroom

Watch as the paint runs down

And the picture so clear in your head

Becomes a watery mess.

Feel ashamed because you’ll

Never be an artist

And will never be able to

Translate how your feeling

Into something beautiful.

Feel the noise in your head

You so desperately want to silence.

&amp;#x200B;

You can no longer discern their commands.

You know you are obsessive compulsive

But not even a doctors word can convince

You to rebel against the demons

Demons probably sitting by a fireplace boiling tea.

With their long black nails bobbing the bag

In hot water as they discuss

What they can do next, barley looking up from the

Books that they are reading.

&amp;#x200B;

You wish you could rip your skin off

To let it out.

Let the energy leave your brain like

A hot air balloon.

To send those demons back to hell.

You would do anything to

Feel again. Feel

Something that made sense.

Never stop moving

And never lift your head to

See where you’re going.

&amp;#x200B;

Walk for miles and avoid hitting cracks and stumbling.

Buy more cheap coffee. Board another bus.

Be anything but present in the present.

Take a back seat, and relax.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch as you lose your meaning and

Your purpose

You have become nothing.

Just a cicada casing on the sidewalk.

Just an empty bottle that

Will remain neglected until it shatters.

You can’t change your mind

You can’t change your mind

You can’t change your mind.

It’s all too fucked now anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Find love in secondhand jackets

And leather-bound notebooks.

Find love in the subway grates

And the hot static air that hits you

As the train goes by.

&amp;#x200B;

Find love in each pigeon that flies

Over your head

And busking dreamers.

Find love in in a stranger's eyes

As you sit in the doctor’s waiting room

Find love in warm blankets

And even warmer coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

Find love in the world around you

Because you can’t stop yourself from being lonely.

But maybe if you love this sick and stupid world enough,

It’ll love you back.

And maybe one day

You’ll learn to befriend your loneliness.

And maybe one day

Maybe years down the road

You’ll find that you finally changed your mind.",lonely,A Step By Step Guide on How to Always Feel Lonely (Poem/Vent/Rant),2021-01-16 03:08:51

So that being said, here's a little about me 

I'm a student in doctor of pharmacy, yes that's literally the course's name, Pharm.D; I'm sweet, kind, dorky, will make bad jokes and love dad jokes, I sing, write and photograph, I'm a cynic with faith in the mechanics of chaos in the cosmos, possibly a pessimist but more realist. 

I do possibly have bordeline personality disorder just so you know 

Here's what I love in the artistic or entertainment area: 

Moviewise: I love almost anything with good writing and a solid story but more dark toned things, my favourite includes Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, Interstellar, Logan etc, I recently watched Portrait of a Lady on Fire which blew me away

Music tastes: I am a mild stan of Lana Del Rey, I love Tame Impala and Weeknd, Cigarettes After Sex is the balm to my soul, I mostly enjoy sad music 
I do not like k pop, country roads with yodeling, they drive me crazy 

Painting or digital art wise: I don't have a specific taste because I haven't gotten into it but I do like an artist named Alena Aenami, I'll link it with the post 

Poetry: I do love Charles Bukowski and another poet named shadowofeve, I'm open to suggestions similar to their work 

I'm hoping for meeting someone who can talk long term, can stay in touch etc 
If you're snooping around my profile, just know I get wild ass mood swings so that's there, you can ask me about it, I'll answer if I'm comfortable

2120,im-just-lost,1610713469,1,"So, I’m 16, pretty young I know. I’ve been having issues of feeling lonely and possible signs of depression, although I can’t fully admit it to myself, almost as if I don’t want to, i always talk to myself when I suspect anything and usually say “nah, it’s nothing, you’re just tired”, or “eh I’m not lonely, I have some great friends and family”. I’m not sure what this means which is why I’m asking you guys, I feel like I diagnosing myself just isn’t right, I’ve never been able to admit to having anything just do to the fact that I overthink/convince myself that it’s false. Anyway moving on, the loneliness has been REALLY creeping on me lately, i always deny it but when I think about it I feel very alone, I have my friends, but I don’t trust any of them completely, I have a family but I’m a expert at bottling everything up so it’s hard for them to know if I’m feeling sad. When I think about the loneliness I imagine myself standing somewhere far up by myself, watching the sunset or something along those lines ( weird, I know ) I also sometimes think that it’s just me, or that’s how it feels, like I’m the only one who can understand me, maybe I’m missing a big puzzle piece to this but it’s been bothering me. Oddly enough another thing that is probably unhealthy would be the fact that when I bring up being lonely to myself in my head or having depression I instantly try and make myself happy, such as, thinking of certain items or things that excite me, or trying to think about an event coming up soon, it usually works too which fascinated me considering I’m self aware of it. Onto the possible depression, I wake up tired, takes me about an hour to get up completely, and even then I feel super unmotivated to do anything, unless I talk myself into it which puts a little pep in my step. For awhile now I haven’t been as interested in past things I’ve been in love with, such as games or guitar ( guitar varies ), which is VERY odd because I love video games and playing a lot, yet I just haven’t been?. Anyway I’m gonna wrap this wall of text up, thanks for listening if anyone gets or sees this, I hope this made you more in touch with your emotions and I hope we can relate, I also want to work on myself the end :)

Those things are completely unimaginable to me - I could never, even for a single moment, believe that I will ever go out and do these things. These things have never existed to me, and I'm almost incapable of believing that they actually do happen.

It's like I've discovered a wonderful world which I - solely I - am denied access. It's funny because, logically, I know these things happen. But I've never sat down and properly thought about it.

Of course, normal for me is coming home from work and sitting alone, posting on reddit or playing games.

2126,Embarrassed_Round_99,1610711362,1,"I am 36F from Europe (been living here for the past three years) and I have failed to turn my life around. I cannot afford therapy, so please do me a favour and avoid suggesting it. I feel that I am going to end up alone and miserable. I don't have much finances, and the neglect, confusion and general strict upbringing I had has made me resentful, and it hurt my 20's very badly. I finally decided to leave that country, my family and everything behind. I don't my parents but I can't seem to forgive even though i wish to as they don't keep well. 

I don't have a partner nor friends. Yesterday, I sent a message to many people who at one point were in touch with me but I received no reply from anyone. I lost contact with many of them because I have been going through a very stressful period where I feel old, lonely, coupled with not having much to show for my 36 years on earth, I feel ashamed, my mum doesn't keep well and I don't feel like talking to people. I can't relate to anyone. I can't seem to connect. I can't seem to even go out for basic things as I now have started to feel very self-conscious. People look at me as if I am a weirdo and when I open my mouth ask the same bloody repetitve questions of where I am from. It's so often that it is now downright annoying. So, now I simply don't talk. When I try to be social or at least when I tried, they would keep fixing me with the people from my country of origin. The last thing I bloody want. I have experienced immense trauma there and I just wish people weren't trying to be 'so nice'. 

I wished and hoped to have a family, a house but I have nothing. I keep posting on here and on other websites I have tried but nothing. Men just want bloody friendships. For 2.5 years my mother was depressed about my departure and would keep asking when I'd be back. She now has dementia. My dad was an absent husband and an absent father. I tried to play husband and didn't even realise. I felt smothered by everything and for years I lived in a controlled upbringing. my dad abused my mum and I learned to just internalise it. To the xtent that everything seemed normal. In trying to keep the peace or maybe I just didn't have the courage I have lost myself. My mother became so deeply attached that I still feel guilty for having left her but I just couldn't do it anymore. My sister, is 7 years older to me but never bothered as a sister to ask if I am okay. All she'd do would compare her life whenever I said something about my struggles. WTF. I stopped. I am extremely angry and resentful of everything and every one. I made the move but see my shit luck, I lived and relived so much of negativity and trauma and stress that today I suffer from depression, anxiety and can't seem to get out of my house even though I have changed. I already had mental health problems and took treatment for it before. And now it seems to have come back with force.

I try my hardest not to interject myself into their community, but I try as much as I can to be around them so that I might be included. I never quite get the intimacy I need from it though. I just keep getting excluded, and that causes my inner voice to tell me they find me annoying. Inevitably the interest fades in the person/group, as I grow more obsessed with my discontent than the people themselves. I get so toxically, emotionally invested in the relationship, that I get way too attached to people I don’t even know.

 I don't know how to go forward. I am devastated and paralyzed with fear because of my current situation.
I am currently getting ready to go through a divorce from my only husband of 13 years. He and I share a wonderful little 9 year old boy that has been with me just about every day since he was born. I am the one that bathed him every night, made sure he brushed his teeth, we always read a book or two and then get up to start our day. My soon to be ex husband would step in if I asked for help but nothing more. 
We had some problems and had separated while we attempted to work on those issues when I found out he had been sleeping with someone else and she was pregnant.
That's when we could no longer work through our marital problems and he requested a divorce. 
I moved 2/4 hours away when we got married so we could be closer to his family since my mother and father were no longer alive and my brother lives on the other side of the US. So now I am stuck here in this town with no one because his family of course is sticking with him.
He knows I do not have the money to hire a lawyer since I have been only working sporadically because of Covid-19. He has his parents and three brothers all helping him financially, and paying/hiring an attorney. I am afraid I am going to lose my son because hiring an attorney for this matter costs $1,800 according to numerous attorneys I have consulted with. He knows I don't have anyone to go to for help or support and my place financially, but yet, he will not work with me. He is slowly letting me see my son fewer and fewer days and he also knows I will not call the police or make a scene in front of my son that might scared him. I cannot come up with that money. 
Does anyone have any advice as to what I can do. Maybe a firm that does probono work or at a lesser price or good advice on how to submit paperwork to do it myself. I just know that it's not a good idea to represent yourself but I am willing to listen to anything at this point. It makes me sick to my stomach the idea of not being to see my son all because I cannot come up with that large amount of money right now to hire an attorney. Can anyone be of help to me?

I'll spare the details, but we started chatting, and it's great. Just general friendly chatting, nothing sexual though, cause I'm not interested in that sort of thing if it's not genuine and paying for it obviously cancels that out 

Anyway, the point I wanted to make is that this interaction gave me this weird freeing feeling. 
It took a second for me to figure out what it was, and I think it's because, I know what the deal is. 
I know what is expected of me, and what she ""wants"" from me. I also know the limits of what I can expect from her.
I don't have to worry about feeling harassed by constant replies. 
It's also weird, that while she's really hot, I genuinely feel embarassed if I see her posts on my feed when I log in. So, I'm definitely not there for the free posts she does put up. 

I feel like there's a discussion to be had about how complicated people have made just simply interacting with others, that it's more calming to talk to a porn star, on their website than really anyone else.

I’m convinced God created her with no imperfections, cause I can’t find any. I pass her every time I walk in, but I don’t think she even notices when I’m there. I hear her voice from a far and sneak a gaze when she’s busy. I can’t help but Fantasize about us being together with a family, I can’t help but think about beautiful she looks when she bites her lips or how happy I get when she blushes. I often wonder if she notices when I’m not there. I come in very often and I always look forward to seeing her. We even locked eyes once, as I walked passed her counter. That split second means everything to me, it’s just the beginning. Loneliness has followed me my whole life, and I’m on the verge of giving up, but looking at her and seeing her smile gives me hope.

I'm okay with that most of the time, but every now a then, every few months, I feel incredibly frustrated and tense for a few days before I calm down.

I enjoy my solitude, but being alone all the time has been taking its toll. I need someone to converse with at the end of the day. I also have been feeling the need to touch other people and be touched, and I don't mean sexually.

Speaking of sex, I haven't had sex since I was 20. I had paid for prostitutes a couple times, in great part because I didn't want to say I was a virgin if ever confronted with the question.

Is it weird that I do this and should I stop?

2282,Some_Velvet_Morn,1610598828,1,"I'm sure this sub can relate to the title. I'm 20 and since my teen years I can't say socialization has been my strong suit. At the end of the day I accept it's my fault but I was just soo young and naïve when I think about it. It came so natural and effortlessly to other people but for me, my standard default was just to be quiet and not speak unless spoken to. That's how things were in my household for the most part. Being from an immigrant background it was drilled how important the books were. Before I came to America it was made so clear that I must stay out of trouble, and work hard to make everyone proud. But I guess my mind took that, as I should be meek. My family didn't help much either. It actually became a running joke in the house about how I didn't have any friends. But oldy in high school I didn't care that much. I just wanted to get out and do well. I regret that, I resent that if I'm being honest.

Now I'm a junior in college while things are marginally better I'm a far cry from everyone else. But thing that hurts the most about my current situation is that I feel that I actually have tried! I feel like I've done the best I could at least under my circumstances. My first year I joined a varsity sports team. Made ""friends"" there but they weren't really genuine. We never did much outside of our sport. They had parties every weekend and I was never invited. I asked it but I was told the standard ""I don't know, ask around"" I eventually quit the second semester due to grades and not liking the sport too much (crew). Second year tried the clubs route and signed up for things I was passionate about, the outdoors, martial arts, soccer. I had fun but no connection with anyone. Plus half my second year didn't happen due to corona. Now this weird ass third year. I've joined even more clubs, which are almost all zoom calls. Went on events but when you're by yourself it feels isolating to see everyone else in groups of like 12 lol.

I met some people on a trip this year. They're cool but we don't hangout too often. When I propose something, it usually gets liked but no one actually takes up the offer. I guess I should be grateful that I'm not completely isolated but I truly hate my experience right now. I know shouldn't be talking like this but his is how I feel. I staring down the barrel. Almost at the end college, no real friends, no romantic partners, no ""time of my life"" fun. I often have to ask like why is this my life. Out of everyone else. Surely I'm not worse than anyone else, so then why is this me? my existence?

If you've read though this shit you're a real one :) lol. After a period of time if I don't release my thoughts I go mental. I journal but not consistently, will be a new habit for me.",lonely,Not being taught how to socialize (At least in an effective way),2021-01-14 15:33:48

2286,AdAdditional8499,1610598209,2,"Tonight, I’ve finally acknowledged myself for what I truly am: a loser. 

I was sitting on my computer chair at my desk with my over priced gaming laptop playing genshin impact for the 8th consecutive hour when it hit me. As I hear my mom brushing her teeth in the bathroom adjacent to my bedroom, moments before she rinses her mouth and opens my door to tell me good night and to sleep well, Hunching over my desk with a pile of dishes 5 feet away from me, I had an epiphany.  
I’m a loser. 

I’m a 20 year old male who hasn’t had any friends in 4 years. 

I’ve never been on a night out, I haven’t been over to a friends house in eons, I have no interesting hobbies, I seldom get out of the apartment... I mean, I really haven’t done anything meaningful or fun with my life. 

“That’s not true.”, I assure myself in my head. 

Oh, but it is. But it is. 

“You’re wrong...”, I tell myself as the growing pain from self loathing festers in my chest. 

My life has only just begun, but I can see the path that I’m on will lead to a life full of loneliness and worthlessness. It can be avoided given I use my time wisely and work towards my various dreams and goals, although, I do not have any. Well, I guess my one dream in life would be to have a strong, tight knit group of friends. To be sociable, to have fun and to enjoy my life. But I don’t have anybody to do anything with. But why should I tell myself that I can only have fun with other people? After all, I’m a very hard introvert and enjoy my time spent alone. 

Idk what I’m doing anymore, I mean, look at this, I’m talking to myself here. I’m a gremlin. When I think of where I’ll be in 10 years, idk.... I can’t even begin to think of that, idek where I’ll be or what’ll become of me next week.",lonely,"I admit it, I’m a loser.",2021-01-14 15:23:29

2292,Trophonix,1610595514,1,"&gt;All day I've faced a barren waste  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the taste of water, cool water  
&gt;  
&gt;Old Dan and I with throats burned dry  
&gt;  
&gt;And souls that cry for water  
&gt;  
&gt;Cool, clear water

This song has been featured in a couple western movies, and I just find it oddly relatable. ""Cool Water"" was originally recorded by Sons of the Pioneers, but I like Marty Robbins' cover. It talks about the narrator and his mule, Dan, traveling across a desert in search of water but finding only mirages.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
&gt;  
&gt;Each star's a pool of water  
&gt;  
&gt;Cool water  
&gt;  
&gt;And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn  
&gt;  
&gt;And carry on to water  
&gt;  
&gt;Cool, clear water  
&gt;  
&gt;Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan  
&gt;  
&gt;He's a devil, not a man  
&gt;  
&gt;And he spreads the burning sand with water

He dreams of seeing pools of water in the stars and laments the mirages. The devil, he imagines, is showing him these false paths of burning sand yet each time his hope is dashed, on they walk, looking for water.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?'  
&gt;  
&gt;Where the water's runnin' free  
&gt;  
&gt;And it's waiting there for you and me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Water  
&gt;  
&gt;Cool, clear water

Keep walking, my friends.

Its been 4 months since we moved in together and I always find myself by myself in my room. Sometimes I go out to see my other roomies but I know I'm boring and don't really add much to the situation. Maybe thats my problem of completely shutting myself out to others because I feel as though I have nothing to offer, but I do make efforts to try and be there, and mostly it doesnt even seem like they output the same effort either. 

I tried dating apps, going to some bars (ones that are still open), and just chatting randomly with others but I can't bring myself to continue conversations anymore. I like to communicate, at least I thought. But nowadays I feel like maybe the hermit life is meant for me.

It got me thinking maybe I wasn't meant to have the normal life that everyone else has. Maybe I'm meant to just stay in my corner and entertain myself as best as I can because there is nobody like me that I can call my own. Maybe I have to be my own person's person, if that makes sense.

And usually at the practices there's just Nate, Norah (the captains), myself (as of the past two weeks because I'm just coming back from an injury), and maybe one or two others.
So today it was just Nate and Peyton (who ran together), and Norah and I. So Norah ran with me (my parents are gonna see how often I'm typing her name and think things), and so she and I talked the whole time. Not like, small talk, but real conversation. And seriously, the more I learn about her the more I really like her. She seriously is the most pure soul I have ever met. 
A while ago, I asked her what she was hoping for for Christmas. And she said she doesn't really like holidays, she just asks her mom to take her to the homeless shelter so she can volunteer there.
Today she said that if she has kids, she doesn't want to have kids herself, because there's so many kids already out there without a family, and she wants to help them. That and because she was adopted, and she wants to carry that on.
Like, seriously.
Ok sorry I'm like, going on and on about her but I really really reaaallyyyyyy like her.
But she can't know because she's already dating someone else. 
Like, I would really like to date her.
But that's not gonna happen.
Even if, if, she and the guy she's dating broke up for some reason, it's not as if I'd be the guy to take advantage of that, as seeing they've been together for years, it'd probably really affect her, and she probably wouldn't be in a place to date for like a year anyway. Even then, she probably wouldn't like like me. If she did, we'd both be about to graduate, so I don't know how well a relationship would really work out, because we'd both be going to different colleges.

2338,connectedsum,1610573009,1,"Being this lonely and bored, I thought I could vent here.

Now that there is COVID and we are on lockdown, this obviously got amplified, but has been a thing also pre-pandemic. Thing is, there are quite a lot of people around me. They are really nice and friendly and all when I am my happy, bubbly self. Here, being around is something like co-being happy though. It doesn’t give me the emotional connection I need, so even though I look happy outside, I’m still lonely on the inside and lacking someone to rely on when I’m emotionally in need, or just someone I can share my real, actual, raw self with.

I have had a few attempts at deeper connections with people. With people that I am seemingly close to, I would talk about things that aren’t trivial daily necessities, or I would show my real, more complex emotions that aren’t simply “smile and wave”. Here are a few things that happened:

- The ignorer: “Well, that sucks. Let’s make sushi.”
- The escaper: Would basically leave on read, and when you do confront them about it, it’s the classical “I was gonna reply”. Then stop interacting altogether because they think you are too sensitive and they could also hurt your feelings while making sushi.
- The here-is-your-perfect-chance: Is happy to finally see a vulnerable girl, asks for a second date (as if there were a first one...). He listens to you till the end, but hey, he would listen to anything you’d have to say, not that he really listens. Heck, even my exes all fell into this category.
- The poker face: Does listen, but has absolutely. no. reaction. Not even a facial expression or something.
- The you-need-help: Says that I should see a therapist? For just implying I have feelings? I mean sure, I could, but that’s not it right now???

I think one reason to this is the “keep negative people away”-bs. It has expanded to the point that if you are not smiling 100% of the time, you are a Debbie-downer and you are instable and needy. I know for a fact that these people do get upset too, but they probably just keep it to themselves, which I suck at. And this is not even about negative feelings only, expressing hope and attachment and compassion and whatnot has also become synonymous to being emotionally draining. People also walk away as soon as they see you trusting them too much, I guess. But I don’t understand. I want people to trust me. I want to understand people. I want to know if they are hurting, and if I could help somehow. I want to know them better as though I would get to know myself. Not only do I not get this, but also I’m treated like I am almost a toxic character?

Nobody understands all of everything, in life you will have to be very lucky to find someone who will get you completely but most of the times it will be in parts only, I mean your one friend will understand one part the other may understand some other part of your life. And sometimes you will not get anybody who understands you, which is bad but fine also because it teaches you that the only person who understands you is you yourself.

 I once met a guy and he asked me "" how are you?"" and hit me really hard, in years nobody took my name and asked me how I was? I thought he was joking around or maybe he was not. idk. but then I did tell him some part of my life in a very very tiny way and he said some words that I did understand that day but never applied in life really,  but he was so correct "" kisiko ko bolne se kuch nahi hota sabko apna apna khud dekhna padta hai""  ( crying, venting and telling people about the stories of your pain never help for real, you will always have to take care of yourself by your own), he himself was going through some tough time but never did he tell anything to me, once when I asked him about how is he so happy he said ""acting, the surface should be calm"" kisiko andar ki baat nahi pata chalne dena chahiye(  tell nobody what goes inside of your head and heart just act happy ). 

He was so right! the little conversation that I had with him gives me a thought that I will never tell people what I exactly feel, act like nothing ever happened, keep my head free from such thoughts ... even if it's not, act like everything is in place.

2366,_alliemamas,1610557073,1,"Sometimes I feel like I’m the reason why I don’t have any friends - I’ve truly never been the one to have many friends and that’s been fairly ok for me. Recently it’s been really weighing on me that I don’t have any close friends just a slue of what feel to be acquaintances. All of my “close friends” and I have grown apart and I’m not sure where to look for friends at this age(26/F) At this time, amidst the pandemic it feels even harder. A few of my really good friendships had some tough fall outs and I can help but feel like I’m the reason why I don’t have anyone close to me. When my boyfriend and I argue, he often brings up that I AM the reason why no one wants to be my friend. Yesterday point blank in an argument he asked me “where are your friends?” And I was at a loss because I don’t really have any of my own. I know there must be some truth me being at fault because no matter how hard I try I’m unable to grasp a true friendship. 

Before the pandemic it was much easier to put myself in situations where I could possibly meet someone. Now, I’ve found myself withdrawing and shutting myself off which is making my depression so much worse. I’ve found myself in a downward spiral and I’m not sure how to resurface. 

My boyfriend has a robust group of friends that seem to have accepted me but I’m having a hard time feeling like they truly are my friends. Sometimes it feels like they just put up with me because I’m a “girlfriend”. It really hurts and he doesn’t understand why I would feel that way, which makes it hurts worse. These feelings also make me spiral because it makes me envious of my boyfriend. (Which I never want to be). It also makes me want to withdraw from the group and it reemphasizes my feelings for wanting my own circle of friends.  Often I fear that if my boyfriend and I were to get married (much after COVID) that I would have no one on my side to invite except family. Sometimes I wish he would want to marry me sooner (In COVID) to save the embarrassment. I’m pathetic. 

Is it too late for me? Honestly I don’t need a big group of friends. I’d be just fine with one true best friend. I’m searching for that type of relationships as they are what I’ve lacked through my life. I’m just feeling so sad, alone and lost.",lonely,Yearning for true friends of my own,2021-01-14 03:57:53

I've always had this thing that when I'm doing something new in life, new work/moving to a new place etc, that I feel very strongly that I'd just want to go back home and curl up on the couch and never go anywhere outside. The feeling is like a combination of scared/anxious/lonely/abandoment. Like I really wish somebody would help me, like I wish I wasn't alone.

I'm not sure if what I'm writing even describes the feeling that well. I've always had this. I look at other people and I feel like they don't experience this so badly. They are happy, they smile, they somehow don't crumble under a change in their life but manage to build a home or keep a steady job. I'm tired of feeling this way, I don't want to feel this way and I try to turn it to positive excitement but it's almost like I can't stop myself from feeling this way even if I really try. 

I did grow up getting somewhat little contact with new situations or guidance on how to handle stuff in general/how to take care of things. I've had to learn stuff on my own and be very independent in lots of things. 

I just wish it wasn't this way, I feel like this reaction I'm getting is so build into my system that there is no way in fixing it. I'm feel tired and really down on thinking that I can't stop this and I have to endure this for years on end and it's hindering my ability to get a job or move when necessary.

2390,Arial-sori,1610539346,1,"I'm in college, I live in a small flat not far from m'y parents home and I'm alone.

I don't have any Friends, I never get to talk to anyone wether it be when I Come home or at school. 

I Can literaly count the number of interactions with other individuals I had in a week, and I rarely need to go above 10 to do so.

I can go talk to people, they won't get mad and if I ask a question they'll respond but once the question is answered it's the end of the conversation. No one ever tries to add something to keep the conversation going, it just one or two sentences and that's it. It's pretty clear to me that while no one hates me no one seems to really like me or just want to talk to me either. 

So I tries multiple things to make people want to tailles to me. I tries making myself a better person, act with respect, moral, politness and such. It's not working.

So I tried just asking people questions and keeping the conversation going, but the result is the same in the end, I just feel like a bother.

So I tried being a top student, this way people would come at me and ask me questions, Ask for my answers on homeworks and test. It isn't a good relationship but a Bad relationship still seems better than no relationship at all. But not only I barely reach the to 5 of the class but also no one come and talk to me, even if I have the highest grades in multiple subjects.

Even teacher, when they talk about the top students they never mention me, only the top 3 obviously. 

Yet I feel like it's unfair, I'm still human, I want Friends, I want a boyfriend, I want to exist like everyone. 

not only am I to dumb to be good enought to mention even with all my efforts but I am also incapable to have any relationship. I sometime feel like a failure on every single levels.

2392,KingZipper25,1610537312,1,"Hello everyone. This is my first post on Reddit so before I go any further I would like to say that I am 34-year-old heterosexual man from Wisconsin in the United States. 

I chose this particular section of Reddit because it seemed like the place for this, and quite frankly, I have nowhere else to turn at the moment. As I wrote above, I am 34. Before you ask, yes, I am one of those adult male virgins who has never been touched by a woman. But that does not make an “incel.” In fact, I hate those guys. Pigs. The world needs to differentiate between men like myself who are just sad, lonely, and depressed, and incels. So anyways. 

My depression runs deeper than that. Now, I know what some of you are thinking, if I am depressed I should go seek out a therapist. Well, while I do agree that therapy is a good thing, and I am a big believer in it, therapy is not going to solve this type of depression. I’ve had a therapist in the past. She was a wonderful and amazing woman who helped me with my anger management issues as well as other problems I was having at the moment. Therapy is good for the type of depression where you look yourself in the mirror, and you hate what you see, you hate what you think, you hate what you sexually attracted to, you hate how you feel, etc. I don’t have those problems. I like myself just fine as a man and a human being. I’m kind, I’m caring, I’m not afraid of emotions, I like my hobbies, etc. I have no issues with myself. 

Rather, my depression is the result of a lifetime of loneliness. I’ve been bullied, mocked, humiliated, laughed at, rejected, and eventually ignored my entire life. I’m not even really talking about romantic affection at this moment. I’m talking about good old regular friendship. You might be thinking I need to put myself out there. Well, I’ve been doing that all my life, and every single time I do I keep getting pushed back down. You can only push a man down so many times before he realizes it’s better for him to just sit there rather than try to get back up, only to be pushed down again. Why would a man who has spent his entire life being bullied, humiliated, mocked, laughed at, rejected, and eventually ignored by an entire society want to participate in the very same society that did that to him? 

Think about like an abused dog. You don’t stand there, waiting for the abused dog to come to you. No, you go to the abused dog, putting up with all of the scratching, biting, clawing, and attempts to get away, going out of your way to prove to that dog you are not going to hurt them and they can trust you. 

I don’t know, maybe I do need to go get another therapist. Or maybe the fear is deep down that would be the ultimate feeling of loneliness- That I have reached a point in my life where I now have to pay people to talk to me. I just don’t know anymore about anything.

The last 7 months my life has pretty much only consisted of going to the gym and walking back home. I'm from a nordic country so not even gyms are a social place, everyone wears earbuds and minds their own business.

I honestly don't miss the social aspect that much, but the feeling of being lonely and not feeling like you're a part of 'society' feels slightly depressing. I have never really been good at being social, and the idea of going on a job interview in the future feels bad considering I barely talk to anyone and they'll probably notice that I have 'lonely vibes'.

I've tried making friends before, and I've tried to make myself engage in activities outside my comfort zone, but it never amounts to much. Most of the time, that's fine. Most of the time I'm more or less at peace with the fact that I've got no real friends or that I'll never truly fit in anywhere.

But some nights it really weighs me down where I prefer to just go to sleep and not have to deal with it. Lately, though, I can't sleep so even that provides no escape. Nights like this are the worse, where every time my phone buzzes, I feel stupid for feeling a spark of hope.

There was the girl I got to know online, we talked quite a bit and we shared our emotions/feelings with each other. We talked about life, watched funny videos together, video chatted, honstly it was pretty great. There was another part of our friendship though that is honestly what helped me get by. We would talk to each other while we shared porn/masturbated. Yes I know its gross but.. it helped us both. We were lonely and we got along and so we did that some with each other.

It was so......comforting. We found a comfort with each other that was good. We both knew it was temporary cause we were both single but... it just was nice. Eventually we drifted apart (as people tend to do) and that stopped. I miss it.

I'm not sure it would feel the same with someone who I didn't also do the other stuff with (hangout watching funny videos, sharing our thoughts, ect.) but damn... i miss it. I feel sad that I miss it. I mean its kinda gross, to internet strangers doing that together, but..... it felt really nice.

I'm 18 years old and have never had sex, I've never properly dated anyone, never dabbled with drugs or alcohol, never had any real friends to hang out with, never been invited to a party, although to be fair if I was I'd probably say no because I'm very introverted, I still have not learned how to drive, I currently don't work and i dont go to post secondary so I have nothing to keep me busy and to make me feel mature. 

It's just the feeling of being so uncool its painful. I feel like a lazy loser daily and struggle to find the motivation to be more productive with my day to day life. 

And I know that even if I did all those things I've missed out on or have yet to do, I know it wouldnt solve shit, because that's just how my brain works. My brain wouldn't be satisfied, it'd find something else to feel like a loser about, like for example I can get a girlfriend and lose my virginity and my brain would be like ""yea well you only just lost your virginity, where as the average person lost it years ago"". It sucks.

And in all honesty I like the idea of being an outcast, but being an outcast by choice is probably more enjoyable than just being dealt a boring life and not feeling cool. Its not like I made the conscious decision to not have sex and remain drug free and to stay away from parties, its jus that the way my life has gone so far that I've never really had much of a chance to experience those things.

I have no siblings and my dad passed away when I was 12 so it’s just me and my mom living together. I never had a true father figure growing up so I always had to be the “big man” for my self you know. Every night for the past 3 months I feel it gets worse. The thoughts I keep to myself hurt me so much but when ever I try to communicate them with my mom or friends it’s really hard. I’ve been so lonely lately since my Gaming pc stopped working and that was my only real chance of communication on a daily with my friends. I would spend every day and night with them on discord laughing but now I have none of that. I also used to have a best friend I was super close with and he sorta turned his back on me and become a whole different person and I can’t get over him. I feel like such a big bitch talking about missing my old best friend but he really meant a lot to me and we had such good chemistry together and to have him turn his back on me and turn into a douche really hurt me. We haven’t spoken in over a year. The only people I feel like are really trying to help me out are the ones who get paid for it like my therapist but I still am grateful for their help. Everyday has been the same for a very very long time.

I lost all motivation to even strive for love or friendships because one of my closest friends robbed me on my trip when I went to go see them and my family (not even a month ago) and lied to me.

We've fought countless times and even never talked for 2 weeks but this is the first time things became like this. after i replied with ok she never texted me back. and to be real with you she was the only one i had that i could vent to and talk about anything and her not talking to me made me feel really sad and i tend to otherthink a lot. I flopped my exams due to overthinking and feeling lonley and not feeling like doing anything. after my exams ended, still no text. my birthday came, still not text. i felt like and idiot staying up to see if she'd atleast sent a happy birthday text. and the funny thing is i waited til midnight just to send her a text and we even stayed up together. i then texted her 'i guess i was expecting too much' she then texts me like 9 hours later ""same"" like what the fuck do you mean SAME????

Even after countless all nighters studying alone in the library, I never felt lonely. Even after not being invited to anything I never felt lonely. Even after I realized I didn’t really have any friends, I didn’t feel lonely. Maybe I just didn’t know what lonely was. After all, I always knew I was introverted so I thought I was fine by myself. 

And so to the person I was tutoring who jokingly told me “hahaha you’re always by yourself aren’t you lonely?”. It was just an innocent comment made a year and half ago but why did you say that to me?  It that crushed me. While I used to lie awake in bed watching Korean drama’s for fun, now I watch them because I’m scared to be left alone in my own thoughts. What I used to find new and exciting now only makes sad because I realize that I have no one else to share it with. 

There was a period of time where I wanted to work on myself. I taught myself to cook, work on my own car, and even bought some new clothes.  It’s funny how I much pride I had in this. What’s the point of cooking if the only person you cook for is yourself? What’s the point of working on my car when I have no one to go drive and see? What’s the point of buying new clothes when the only person who see’s them is myself?  What’s the point of making money when I have no friends or girlfriend to spend it on?

I miss her...I miss her a lot but I know we can’t be together and I accept that. But I do miss the way she would light up my life with her positivity and energetic persona. 

I know many people think you can never be friends with your ex but don’t they realize that if your ex was a good person and you both separated yourselves from one another willingly...then it’s clear we don’t want to lose their presence. 

It feels like an empty void. Yes I will find another love again in the future I know that but that void left from her will never be filled. Everyone is unique in their own way, all 7 billion of us. And it is so painful to watch the ones who touched our lives positively leave. Everyone comes and goes in our life but it would be nice to have the ones who never did us any harm to stick around with us in another way. 

Friendship is love, close friendship is even more love and I think it’s possible to be friends with an Ex who has a warm heart. It depends on the ex but if they are a kind person and if they light up your life then it shouldn’t be a bad thing to offer friendship for them. 

I’m learning to let her go but I do hope she reaches out one day once we heal our wounds. On that day I will always appreciate and love her for the person she is and I will be happy for her happiness even if it is with someone else.

There r many things that make people feel lonely may it be not having friends, or feeling like you don’t fit in, or maybe it’s bc you want love (I really want love) but there are many people in this world and it takes time for everything. If you just don’t think you have friends just try to find anyone to talk to and don’t worry about age or gender, if you feel you don’t fit in join an online community where you think you would, if you want love give it time and try to focus on bettering yourself

I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely 
I have nobody for my own…“

I feel so called out hearing this song in public i feel like people look at me and they just know. I am ashamed of being alone. And it is going on for so long i don’t know anymore how to be not alone anymore. I asked myself so often what went wrong. There were so many paths i could have taken. And i can’t imagine any of them would have sucked so hard. I am 23 years old now. Essentially wasting my last 5 years. At least others are successful while being alone. 

But i guess that doesn’t really matter in the end. If you are alone, you are alone. I always said...yeah next year it is gonna be better. For example my birthdays or new year. Most of the time alone or with parents (and that feels like being alone as well for me) the last 10 years. But it does not get better. If not it gets worse. Cause there is only as mich as one can take. 

This sounds depressing i know. It is depressing. I finally got the courage to talk with my doctor about it. She is a very kind human being. She cares a lot. So i could open up a bit. I am on a waiting list for therapy now and got my share of antidepressiva yesterday and another appointment in 2 weeks. I did not take it today. I am still a bit skeptical. But i know it is the right move. I loose more energy everyday. I am so tired even though i sleep all day. Someone her who can maybe share his/her experience with medication? I really want to take it. But reading the potential side effects... 

Anyways this year is my year. It has to be. I feel like this is my last chance to change directions. Wish me luck. And everyone who reads this and feels the same. I wish you luck as well.

It’s been a struggle for me to get out of my bed and do basic hygiene. I can spend days in my bed on my phone not doing anything, just scrolling social media. Avoiding to go to the WC because I was too lazy and tired to get up and overeating in my bed. I never saw this as a problem. Tbh, I enjoyed being alone and doing nothing but now I’m just mad at myself because there are so many things I could have done but I just stayed in bed.

Today I wanted to change my routine and I got up early, made myself a breakfast but I felt so tired that I came back to bed and spent the rest of my day there. 

I started thinking that I would feel much better if I had a sister or brother who I could talk to and I would be able to get up everyday and actually do chores, clean my room and be productive overall. I feel like I would have less time to overthink. 
Now I realised how sad my life is since I live with my mom and we don’t talk as much. I spend most of the days silent, not speaking to anyone cuz I’m alone all the time. I rarely go out, and when I do, no one could guess how I’m feeling because I’m always positive around other people. 
I have a boyfriend and we don’t have problems in a relationship at all, but sometimes I feel a bit clingy when we’re texting because he has roommates and is not able to talk to me all day. This was a “problem” also in my previous relationship. I would stay in bed all day waiting for my bf to reply to my messages while he’s busy and not having the need to get up and start my day.
 I have friends, but I don’t like talking too much with them because I get bored, yet I want to talk to someone.

Recently, I really fell for a coworker of mine, and I need to get over it because we’ve both left that job now and may never see each other again, but I just need to know if he ever reciprocated feelings for me... I find it hard to believe because he seems to be out of my league in so many ways, but whenever we were partnered up to do something at work, he would always change the subject from work to have a personal conversation. We talked about our families, and he would always ask me about what I would do on the weekends. He would back out of going to work events whenever I couldn’t make it. One time he even asked me if I’d want to hang out one weekend, but he actually ended up canceling on those plans before that even happened with no explanation...

2504,JokoDragon1,1610470931,2,"Hey guys. I decided to share my story on here too, along with an advice for you guys. This happened in 2020. If you've gone through something similar, you're not alone. Don't give up just yet, no matter how alone you feel. Things are gonna get better.

At the beginning of 2020 my friend of 6 years started saying perverted shit to me, taking me as an example for his perverted shit. I won't say anything else because it's a trauma to me. I had no choice but to end the friendship.

Then, when summer break started around May, maybe June, my best friend left me. She wrote me a paragraph, about not wanting to be friends with me anymore because i support the LGBTQ+ community, and she was scared someone may think we're a couple. Which was so fake of her, because I've made it clear that I'm straight, i just support them. I haven't heard a word from her since. I saw her once outside but she just passed me by like i was nobody.

When I thought things are getting better i was very wrong. One day, a guy (i will call him K) on reddit reached out to me after seeing a post of mine. We started chatting and i was so incredibly happy to have made a friend! Finally! He even gave me his Discord. It was so fun chatting everyday. For once, i felt happy again! But i made a mistake. I got attached to him emotionally, this was because of my past loses and i didn't know what to do. We talked and talked until one day slowly, he started drifting away. After one month, we weren't talking anymore. I was so confused, i reached out to him a couple of times, i got replies after a week, saying he was busy with video games which didn't make sense to me. I would've been better if he told me the truth. I was crying everyday, i couldn't stop. It mentally destroyed me. Every single day i waited for my parents to go to bed, so i can cry. He helped me get over my best friend leaving, and then he left, leaving me to fall down the darkest hole I've fell in my whole life. I fell into depression. At this point my life was pointless. I was sitting in front of my pc, playing games, drinking coffee (coffee helped me feel energized, because without it i felt like shit), and crying. This was my routine all summer. I bet he has no idea what hell I've been through just because i missed him, and i had no one at that time. I was left alone. Sometimes i wish i could tell him this story. I kept asking myself what i did wrong. I understand being busy with work or homework, but he said he was busy with games. Don't forget it was still summer break, there was no school. Since we drifted apart I've talked to him three times. I don't get replies anymore..He helped me so incredibly much, and then he left too. This hit me so hard because he was saying these nice things, that he cares for me, he's gonna be there for me, and things like that. But i guess i'm just dumb for trusting people.

Fast forward until today, i made more friends on the internet, and I'm happier now! I'm so thankful for these people! Sometimes, K crosses in my mind, I'm thinking what he's doing now, how he's doing. I still cry sometimes but it's much much less. People helped me. Huge thanks to Nathan, Isaac, Ada, Ado, Jarel and others for helping me through this. Love u guys ❤️

My advice for people with similar problems is, if they leave you when they know you need them the most, they're not it. Don't waste your time crying over someone who doesn't shed a single tear for you. Don't waste your time being sad over someone who has fun and laughs somewhere else not knowing what hell you're in right now because of them. I promise, with time it gets better. Be strong. Better people will come on your road. We learn from these situations. We become wiser and stronger.",lonely,I was left alone to fall in depression but things got better,2021-01-13 04:02:11

2508,cryptidace,1610469698,1,"I'm currently in my second year at uni and it's not at all close to home and I feel super lonely despite having friends (not at uni), a great boyfriend (also not at uni) and lovely housemates. During my time at uni I've come to the realisation that I struggle making friends/creating emotional bonds with people. I've always been introverted, had an overwhelming feeling of being scared/anxious when putting my hand up in class or asking for help (it's less prominent than it used to be now) and I've had issues regarding toxic/emotionally abusive friends in the past which has exacerbated my difficulty creating some sort of emotional relationships with others. I have developed trust issues and struggle letting my guard down and it takes me about a year or more to feel as if I can be myself around people and possibly trusting them.

With that in mind, when I meet people I hardly ever talk about myself and dislike doing it. I always mention anecdotes or relate to others based on my friends and families stories and not my own. Majority of the time my relationships are based on ""I give, they receive"" causing me to feel drained and them feeling closer to me than I do to them. In other words, I feel lonely despite having friends. My friends will come to me about problems (which I don't have issues or bad feelings with helping them) and a lot of the time will only speak to me when I reach out. If I have a problem or feeling shit I always ask how the other person is doing before I talk about my own issues. This is hardly ever reciprocated. Another reason I feel lonely is because I feel as if I can't come out to people. I'm asexual and I'm scared of telling some people because I still feel vulnerable about possible backlash or ignorant comments/questions even if they come from a place that's not intentional. I would love to tell my housemates and be open, make jokes about my sexuality with them and, in doing so, will feel more understood and closer to them but I feel nervous that someone will say something ignorant or hurtful.

I decided to remove myself from social media for a bit because I know I needed to internalise my emotions and hopefully do some self-healing and social media was distracting me from doing that. Not only that but when I'm in a bad place mentally I feel this urge to unfollow everyone and delete everything because I feel as if I'm being watched and I don't want to be fake and act as if I'm ok when someone sends a meme or whatever. I basically want to be left alone.

During my break from social media, I have come to the realisation of some things (mentioned above) but I'm not sure how to go from here. I did have therapy for a while and it felt good because I could understand why people did the stuff they did to me and I gained some sort of closure but I'm unsure how to break this spiral of loneliness particularly during a pandemic. I know I'm fortunate enough to have the support I do but that itself doesn't stop this feeling. I'm wondering whether to go back to therapy but I feel awkward about telling my parents and for them to pay for it like last time.

Hey. I’m tired. I can’t make it stop. 
I’m almost 25yo and this just never change.
It doesn’t happen as often but it does. And every time it happen it doesn’t feel good. And it will take a while before I can function.

Basically, I’m just not good at facing people—that I care about— being mad/disappointed/sad because of something I’ve done. Fast forward, if I live by myself, I usually don’t see people for days or weeks after that.
But since I don’t live alone. I try my best to not seclude myself. Although I rather hide in the closet.

I don’t like being treated differently. But the thing is, once I supposed to confront someone, I get very anxious. It will escalate 0-100 within minutes if the person doesn’t respond me positively. It’s not like I’m not aware of it, it’s more like, it’s so hard to control it. Let’s say. It’s impossible for now. I will start having a hard time to breathe, then I will cry, then when I start crying, I will hate myself and tell myself to stop, only ended up making myself howling(?) or kinda. Not sure what to call it. I texted crisis hotline. Something like that. They narrow it that I probably need to talk to a doctor. Nope I can’t afford it. 

So I wonder if someone would willingly to just stay on the call with me when that happens. But just don’t say anything besides “it’s ok” I find it comforting. 
I just can’t ask to to the person that I have to confront it’s too embarrassing. 🥲 and I’m not looking for kindnesses or forgiveness out of pity. It’s just humiliating. 

I don’t know if I make sense but. That’s just that.",lonely,I’m tired. I just wanna hide myself in the closet. But that will make people at home worrying about me,2021-01-13 02:30:03

2517,Tdiddleydoodle,1610464039,1,"Hey everyone, first time poster, 25M. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for posting here, advice, comfort, just a place to rant?

I guess I’m just confused, it never used to be this bad. I was never popular in high-school, but I never had an issue making friends. I was shy, but was always hanging out with people, had some girlfriends, typical stuff. College was the same way. I’m a musician which always made it easy to make friends and meet new people.

Once I graduated college in 2018 I moved from NY to California and that’s where something changed. I started having a lot of trouble meeting people my age. I eventually did meet people while in bands but they were way older and they felt more like a business relationships than actual friendships. After two years I moved back to NY after deciding California wasn’t working. Old friends had been telling me to come back so I thought the loneliness I felt in California was over and things were going to get better.  

Nope. 

They barely have talked to me since I’ve gotten back. They’ll text me if they want advice or emotional support. Which I’m happy to give. However, if I text, they ignore me. If they do respond, it’s briefly before they stop responding mid conversation. We’ve made plans and they just didn’t show up. Not even a message to tell me they couldn’t come or what happened (I guess I’m not owed an explanation, I just feel like it’d be nice though). Now it’s gotten to the point where we haven’t spoken in like a month. I understand that they may have moved on while I was in California, but at this point I feel like I’m being aggressively ignored. 

But okay...fine. I’ll just try to meet new people and find some new people to hang out with. I can’t even do that. I’ve been ghosted EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. If it’s dating apps, I’ll get their number, we’ll talk for a couple weeks and then poof, gone. Our conversations are going well too! We’re always laughing, sharing funny stuff to each other and one day they just never respond again. Same story with trying to meet people for music projects. We meet, jam, they tell me they want to start something, we start making plans and...poof. Gone. 

I’d like to think I’m relatively self aware, but I really don’t know what I’m doing so unbelievably wrong at this point. It has to be me though, right? I find it hard to believe every single person that has ghosted me or ignores me is in the wrong. I just don’t know what about me changed, I never used to be this much of a problem for people.

With that, my rant is over. I don’t usually like to air my dirty laundry online like this, but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it, so if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading.",lonely,Lost and Confused,2021-01-13 02:07:19

nothing. nada. even when she had nothing better to do she didn't want to talk to me. After all the worrying, the going-on-two-months of raw anxiety, that I may have done something wrong or, god forbid, something happened to her, I learned that she had decided to completely cut me off without so much as a simple warning, just like I secretly thought she would. And this is always what happens: I meet someone, we hit it off, I think they may be interested in me, I go out or stay in with them, and suddenly we're strangers, assuming I ever get to the ""going out"" phase. Well, I've had enough. I deleted her number. I still feel awful, but a lot less so, like I can finally accept that for whatever reason she just doesn't want me in her life, and if she ever does want me back in, she still has my number. I can't shake the feeling that this is how it will always be, though. I'm afraid any affection I feel for another human being will go unrequited - that no matter how much I care for someone, no matter how much I want to be with them, they'll never feel the same. It's so draining falling in love alone. I don't know how many indirect rejections I have in me now. A simple ""no"" is fine. Getting my hopes up for half a year and cutting me off after the first date is not, and it isn't even the worst I've been treated. All of this mistreatment and I can't even say I've been in a relationship. I don't think it'll get any better, so I've decided to stop trying altogether - and in a bitter way, that makes me feel better.  


TL;DR: the girl I posted about \~2 months ago doesn't want me around, much like everyone else I'm interested in, and I've decided to stop trying, and I feel happier for that, if even more jaded.",lonely,Feeling a little better,2021-01-12 22:35:26

I’ve been so lonely my entire life, I feel attached to literally anyone that gives me a little bit of their time. And I find it extremely difficult to say goodbye when it’s time. It’s weird especially because most people that came into my life was because of music - to learn guitar or working as a band. It was mostly work related and these people had no prior connection with me whatsoever. We were not friends or acquaintances or anything. Just strangers coming together from different backgrounds. And I’m sure most of them (esp people that learned music from me) have moved on and forgotten me. But I can’t. I can’t forget. I don’t know how to do that. I feel like I haven’t grown one bit. Playing music, teaching music gives me a sense of purpose in my otherwise meaningless life. I feel like someone needs me. And when they leave, it hurts so bad. I know it shouldn’t, that’s life, but I just cannot understand why everything has to end! Esp the good things. I’m sorry if it sounds stupid.

I almost cried of the joy and the freedom that came with releasing this bottled up secret. 

I felt so overwhelmed with emotion, of years of having convinced myself that the attraction to girls was nothing more than the result of the sexual trauma i had experienced at my young age. I had convinced myself then that it was a sin, and i didn’t really feel this way. how could i? all my past crushes were male and looked like the word testosterone. but i did it. 

i told my bestfriend about my crush on a girl in class. though it was hard for me to even tell her, i think she sensed that and it was the reason why she replied with nothing more than a simple “ok” and didn’t question or press me further when i changed the topic. 

the girl i like is beautiful, and not my usual type at all. she has this happy energy that radiates through the winter like the sun. how can you not like her?

21m, never had a girlfriend. (Or done anything with a girl). Senior in college with no friends, only acquaintances. How is that supposed to feel? How are you supposed to pretend everything is ok?

I have anxiety, I went to therapy and I didn't continue. People I met didn't take it seriously saying I should socialize more. I got really nervous eating with people as a kid, I couldn't eat, and was always trying to find time to get food in since I would get nervous. It was always there. So the comments about how I'm very skinny. I went to the gym. A guy said oh you can gain weight. If you only knew. 

This girl kind of messed with me for a couple years but I know now. I would have went back if I didn't post Reddit and got advice. I dreamed and fantasized about her more times than I want to say. 

I can blame it on my personality and my parents. My parents don't have friends, socially anxious or been hurt before. Both were hurt before. Mother in denial, Dad also. Parents didn't teach me respect, or how to grow up. The more someone is cold, the more I go back. Emotional enmeshment, treating me like a child. They were really incapable people but broke their back doing their best. 

But I did so much. Worked fast food, went to great university. Straight A's. Leadership positions. Tutoring business. Made over 15k. Customer service, jobs that led people. I was always out of comfort. 

Even adults mess with me. I feel like almost everyone messes with me-- so I have to keep at a distance -- I mean if you see me for who I am. It was so hard to continue, especially last year when people fell out of my life, I started seeing a professional who weren't there either, now I still do, but the urge to try is gone. So then others can feel I don't care, and then the disrespect comes, so I have to fight for boundaries I don't know I have. Reading books on emotional immaturity. Trying to trust. Not having expectations but still being there. But it's hard to be strong when there is nothing on the inside.

I some how kept on with my life, but it wasn't easy.

it's been almost 16years since my first depression, now I'm pretty much cured and has become to socialize with people with no big problems. But I do sometimes feel lonely and dive deep to think about am I doing things right? World is moving so fast and I feel exhausted to chase the trend improving myself to be recognized more. 

Still now I feel more comfortable to talk with strangers than people around me to share my thoughts and to fulfill my mental condition. (I mean kind and thoughtful strangers) I do have somethings that I cannot really talk with my close ones. Those might be some worries, concerns or just a small talk to make myself feel lighter when I'm lonely and exhausted.

I talked to some people about this and realized I'm not only one feeling this way. So I came up with the idea building a random voice chat app where lonely, exhausted people can have a nice &amp; clean conversation anonymously. People on dating apps or on other social platforms get half naked or do some insane actions to with draw attention. I'm not blaming them but just sad that world has turned this way. So I'm thinking of getting rid of visual elements such as videos or pictures to avoid judging by looks. And mostly to have people more concentrated on their talks and be cheerful to each other.

Or when you tell yourself you’re going to be fine and that it doesn’t matter if you have no one to turn to because all you need is yourself but only start to realize how alone you are when you look around and realize that no is there to catch you if you fall. 
  When you’re treated like a nuisance or they give you that look that knows you’re not wanted? How else are you supposed to feel but exactly how they want you to feel. Or when they actually voice their opinions about you but say it in a joking manner and you can’t help but feel backed into a corner where your only option is to agree and laugh along with them because your other option is forcing confrontation and you don’t want that because you know you’ll lose since you’re not as well liked as them. Because if you force confrontation it would ultimately ruin your life because everyone liked you better when you kept your mouth shut and just took it.
  What about when you do something new and totally you and you love it but then someone comments about how horrible it looks on you and you just carry that horrible feeling with you. It makes you doubt your every decision and worry over whether society will judge you for it or not. And you have no one to turn to so that they can reassure you that you look fine and you shouldn’t worry so much.
  And the times when you feel frustrated, angry, sad, and just all around horrible but you force those feelings down because you know if you let it affect you, all of your emotions would come spilling out and you don’t want anyone to see you that vulnerable because then they would secretly judge you while trying to comfort you even though they’re the reason for your misery.

So, that day. It was a Sunday. It's long to explain how, but we started arguing. I had rage accumulated from the previous 3 months, when they started treating me like garbage, especially 2 days before.

13 December 2019 (2 days before)

18th birthday party of a classmate of ours. Wasn't in my group of friends but he invited a lot of people. It was a good party. They even put up one of the few songs I know by heart. And coincidentally they even passed the microphone to people to sing only for that song. I didn't miss the chance, so I sang a part of the lyrics with all the voice I had. People even applauded me. I was finally showing them I'm not just a study guy. They even complimented me. I finally felt like one of them. So I did a big mistake: I lowered my guard. The birthday boy presented me a hot chick (I’m gay, but he didn't know and I still thought of myself as somewhat bisexual at the time). Since I thought I looked cool that night, I thought he was serious. About an hour later a guy tells me she is not single: it was all a prank. The one time I lower my guard, it's a prank. And that's not even the worst thing. My ""friends"" knew everything. They knew that girl and they knew those people were pranking me. I asked them why they didn't tell me. They said I had to learn through experience. They were monsters. And they probably don't even realise this.

15 December 2019

We argued. That day my patience was gone for good. I asked them, sincerely, why they had started treating me like garbage lately. They said I'm too talkative, therefore I result annoying. I asked them for more serious reasons then this bullshit, but they gave me none. I told them that, if that was the only reason, I had no regrets on my part and nothing to apologize for. They had thought that with time I could have changed, become more like them. Turns out I didn't. Then, we revealed each other the truth. I hated some of them with all my forces. One of them (the boyfriend of the somewhat ""leader"" of the group) said ""Fine, if you wanna know, I hate u too anyway"". I told him I hated him a lot, especially after the party prank. His reply hurt me so much I still think about it to this day. ""To be honest I hate you since I've met you but I don't show it much, and also do you seriously think that I was the only person at the party who knew that the girl was engaged? wake up. And then what the fuck, why are you even trying to flirt with hot girls that even I would have a hard time flirting with and end up crying"". I had let this person copy my English homework asking for nothing in return several times before and this was his thank you. I said that I'm just not compatible with that group and that we should have stopped hanging out. I tried to get back a few days later, but it was clear they weren't even interested anymore.

In the following days I had hit the lowest point in my whole life. I would have given anything to have a friend. I would have rathered be handicapped then friendless. And in January I even knew about my father's cancer. And February was covid time. This is very egotistical: even those bad news were nothing to me compared to what happened that day. Luckily my dad’s health is fine now. I started playing Solitaire on my PC. A lot. Several hours per day. Daily. That's were my comic title InSolitario was born (solitario = lonely, but also the card game solitaire). But that's another story.

12 January 2021. One year later

Guess what? Nothing changed. Now that university is all online, I'm even more lonely. Not to mention that my freetime is even less, so I my time to make friendships would be too little anyway.

All I wanna do is cry right now. I wanna cry, but my parents would hear me, and ask me what's wrong. Then I would have to tell them my problem, but after that they would complain on how I always add my problems to the ones they already have.

I want a friend. It's all I want, I don't think of anything else. I want a friend irl that can listen to me, like me for my true self and hug me to comfort me from distress. I live hugs. I like them even more than kisses.

When is all of this gonna end? The more time I'm lonely, the more it feels like it's my destiny. Like I was born to be alone for the rest of my life. This thought doesn't leave my head, and it makes me sad. And scared.

 I saw a humorous photograph, I couldn't smile I couldn't laugh, I talked to a pretty girl, But my heart it did not stir, I read a book of poetry, On the way to the zoo, Where I saw six birds in a tree, But they, they would not sing, Because, I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside  And on the way home I saw the news A thousand dead, but what's the use? I just can't seem to care, The feelings they just aren't there. So I'll go home to the T.V. Stare into space, happily, There's not much more that I need, Because I'm Dead Inside  I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside I'm Dead Inside  I'm Dead Inside now, I'm Dead Inside, I'm Dead Inside now, I'm Dead Inside.

These things come and go and it makes me have to try twice as hard to do regular mundane things but I usually just throw myself back in bed. Self isolation is horrible but I can’t ever bring myself to fully trust someone so where does that leave me? I can write a whole book about my weird and complex thoughts and feelings but you wouldn’t hear the end of it from me. (That is if u would even hear me at all) I know I probably don’t even make much sense but I get tired of keeping to myself as well and I can only go for so long. It sucks not having friends and not being able to make any because of my intense fear of people I’ve never even had a girlfriend before and I feel like I will be alone for a very long time. I do like being alone don’t get me wrong but sometimes I wish I had someone to share it with so we could just be awkward and weird together or something but I think that only exists in my head. I wish things came easy to me and that it wasn’t practically impossible to let people in but I am so scared to get hurt by others again because I am so weird.

I am lonely.
I take it one day at a time.

I scroll through my contacts..
I know none of them would answer if I called.

I just need someone to talk to.
I just need something to distract me.

I’m addicted to distraction.
I’m addicted to masturbation and eating.

I’m addicted to drugs.
I’m addicted to distraction.

I’ve never experienced mutual love.
The thought of companionship leans closer to fiction everyday.

The distractions are starting not to work.
I am lonely.

I’m running out of friends,
and I ran out of family a long time ago.

The only thing I have left is myself.
That’s not enough anymore.

I used to beg for solidarity when it wasn’t an option.
Now I just want a friend.

Because the ones I have/had are drifting away.
“That’s just life.”

Because friends do drift apart.
And that’s okay.

I don’t know what to do.
I just want someone to talk to.

I don’t care about what.
I just want someone to talk to.

I know I’m not anything special. 
I don’t deserve to be loved anymore than the next guy.

I know it’s my fault.
I’ll be more interesting.

I’ll be nicer.
I’ll try my best to be more attractive.

What do I do when that doesn’t change anything?
What’s the next plan?

Download some app on my phone.
Still haven’t got a match.

Go out to bars and concerts by myself?
Maybe when anxiety goes away.

I have been rejected too many times to reach out anymore.
I know no one is going to reach out to me.

So what now?
I guess I wait...

But I don’t know how much longer I can wait.

Meeting someone new, speaking out loud or just about any situation where I'm in the spotlight makes my anxiety go through the roof. I'm also very self conscious and have been since I was young, this makes it hard for me to connect with new people and therefore I'm lonely. I'm feel so weak, for example at work if everyone is talking and I contribute something to the conversation I'm either talked over, people don't respond or its almost like they don't hear me, Which then makes me feel like shit even more.

I am a completely alone person therefor I join lonely places for friends since there is no community that large that names themselves ""alone"".  It occurred to me there is a very big difference between alone and lonely. A lot of people in these types of communities have friends and just feel lonely. And then there people like me who actually alone no friends and it, not just a feeling. I often try to desperately make friends in communities like this hoping to find someone like but every time I get close to someone they are just lonely. Not actually alone. The reason this matter is because !! When I get attached to them then they tell me they have friends all sudden. and I have wait for them as they are gone all the time. This is not fair to me I am being teased with friendship for a second and then go back waiting anxiously and sad like a dog for my friend to get back. I want someone who completely alone so  I won't have to worry about this type of thing at least until I increase my friend count to more one person at a time. I want someone who we both can build our friend count up together slowly. but I do understand two people alone is a very unhealthy thing!

No my father was not there for me. He had his moon, he was full and could go hunt. While i could not, i was too afraid to loose the one small light i had. I had to keep an eye on it.

I had no tribe. Lonely people would want to steal my light and others were chasing their moons.

I was more and more protective and i had to be raw, my rawness was not for play and an act because i could, others could talk about their moons and wanted everybody to see, you can not steal a moon and there is enough for everybody.

So I wanted to express myself here because I don’t really have anybody I’m comfortable with to open up. My friends wouldn’t understand and my parents aren’t even an option lol.
So lately I’ve been feeling really lonely much more than usual. I’ve always been solitary and always dealt with my stuff alone, pretending I was okay when most of the time I was not. Weirdly lately things are less bad than usual and yet the need of male attention, caring and affection has become really heavy and overwhelming, to the point where I constantly think about it. Social medias are definitely triggering it.

I never had a boyfriend, a date or even a flirt back in high school or before. Even the few male friends I know became my “friends” because they first connected with my female friends (for the record I’m kinda the insecure weirdo of the group so it’s not a surprise). I never had a best friend too but I’m okay with it. I’m a college freshmen and I expected this year to finally be my moment but the virus showed up and we’re homeschooling. I didn’t give up there though.
Everybody seemed to easily connect with new people on social medias and stuff. Tiktok, Instagram, Tinder... I see it, I want to try but I realized i’d need to post my face which I eventually tried but couldn’t maintain. I never found someone that shared the same interests as me. I’m curious, sarcastic, I’d talk a lot about anything, I’m even a little corny lol. Also I’m a very good listener and no one was ever my listener.. I never found this person even as a friend, that I’d be 100% comfortable with. My music style for example : Nobody in my environment shares the same music taste or even likes music like i do. (Music is probably the one thing that makes me happy). 
For the first time, I’ve been craving sexual intimacy too and it really messes up with my mind.

I feel like I’ll never belong, like I’ll never find that one person that will understand me perfectly and genuinely care about what I say or feel. Actually I’ve been through depressive episodes and no one ever noticed. My ADHD plays a big part too.
I’m grateful for my friends and I feel guilty about it but I just wish I had a boyfriend that showed genuine interest or maybe a male friend I could talk to about things that aren’t fashion trends or Basic Netflix shows.",lonely,I feel lonely and I crave something that seems accessible to others (F18),2021-01-12 09:27:37

That I do my job and I have improvement in some stress but overall I’m about average. I suppose I already knew that. I’ve always been average. School, work, life, whatever. The thing that’s bothering me is that I’ve always felt and been told in some way that I’m just average. I’m tired of it.

I don’t have many (if any) friends or family, I have a mundane job, and living a mundane life. I’ve made nothing of myself and yet there’s nothing I really want anymore.

I used to dream of being a dad or a husband but that notion got sifted away into the sands of time and after every rejection or failed relationship. Looking back... I feel like nothing important ever happened to me and that nothing will. I’m 30 now and what the hell have I done with my life except to watch it all disappear? Nothing is special about me.

It has been a year since I came here to study and although it was my decision and I don't blame anyone else for it, this is not what I had expected. As a foreigner, it is extremely difficult, especially if you're not American or European, to break into German circles. Even if you speak decent German. Nobody likes to admit it but there is a clear hierarchy among foreigners. If you are brown, there is extremely little chance that a German would approach you or initiate a conversation with you. Luckily I have had one good German friend but even after a year, we are not that close. I am not in her priority. Another problem which we South-Asians face are the infuriating stereotypes about Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi men. We are not creeps who are desperate for female attention. It makes spontaneous conversations almost impossible. You don't want the other person to freak out and make things awkward.  

""You came here out your personal interest so it is not our job to go out of our way to make you feel welcome here!"" This is the general undertone in the comments I receive when I post my experiences on German subreddits. Of course nobody is this harsh and blunt but this is the attitude.

At the beginning of last year everything was great, would hang out with friends quiet often, had a great mate that I made in high school and continued to be great mates throughout the years since finishing high school and even through our first 2 years of university. All on all everything was great, however when covid-19 had joined the and restrictions had been introduced, my social life had began to slowly decrease. At time went by and restrictions had began to give us some freedom and life was looking a little bit normal, I had thought that my social life would return back to normal however that wasn’t the case. 

My friends had began to fade away not speaking to me, never asking me how my day was or planning a day out. And some even not replying to my messages after a couple of days, even though I was ALWAYS the one who would text first and ask them how they were and always would try and plan something so we can all stay in touch coz losing the only friends I had was the last thing I wanted to happen. I began to just accept what had occurred and  thought I’ll just let it pass by and hopefully it will all change. However I lost faith in that belief after my best mate who I really cared about just completely disappeared like we never new each other, never called or text nothing just disappeared. I had sent him a message to see what the hell happened and after 5-6 weeks I got a reply with the excuse that his busy with work and that on he can only see messages but can’t reply. However I knew  that wasn’t the case coz I found out he would life chat to another friend of mine so at the point I just gave up.  

I’ll probably cut it short because I can go on forever. So right now I’m in a position that I can’t get my self out and others are beginning to notice, such as my parents even asking me where are your friends and why I don’t go out. Knowing that I’ve reached that point I just hit me even harder and this sense of loneliness and emptiness just continues to grow and grow every time I see one of my “friends” hanging out with his mates and enjoying himself and wishing that was me it just hurts.

I got into highschool where I changed by 8th grade, i got a little livelier and talk to those i became friends with, 9th grade made me fall inlove with someone, i really thought that it's all going in for me, I'm at the peak like I'm really myself and eventually things really turned around quick. The girl i liked (we're in a complicated situation so yeah better not tell it since it's too complicated) turned me down. I focused on something else, sports, basketball to be exact. I aimed to be a great basketball player, putting all of my hard work into it because i believe i have a future with it. Told by the ones closest to me that it's not gonna be supported by anyone and i can't do it (to be exact, i always bring up to my parents and that closest friends to me my dream, one answer i didn't expect is that from my sister that God wouldn't support me (my family is religious) and the support from my parents i couldn't really see it) so basically I didn't pursue that career anymore even though i made plans on how to achieve my basketball career. Today I'm thinking about me as a person, I know I've done many wrong things and wrong decisions. I'm overthinking due to the fact that I now act differently around others and when I'm on my own.

When I'm on my own i talk to myself about what's wrong with me, when did it all started that i acted this way, why do i do things wrong, why do i feel sad after an activity that i know i contributed something but i feel I'm not a part of it. I research many things what i want to know about how i act and the results are: inferiority complex, depression, and anxiety. Actually my results are based on my own so i don't have proof unless i consult to a psychologist who can truly detect what's wrong with me. I know my parents would be mad if i consult with a psychologist because they think I'm crazy or something is wrong with me.

The person i acted in my freshmen year is the opposite of what i am today, i was that happy go lucky, joker, lively, participating student, always looked on the good things in life, my personality took change little by little through my sophomore and junior year. I was still that person but nerfed. Now I'm this overthinking, what you can call crazy person while changing personality when I'm with others.

Ah, hey. First time poster, life long loner. 
So I started teaching myself piano at 3 years old, but unfortunately I've been brought up by a pair of narcissists who have abused me since I was born. I play 17 instruments, started writing music when I was 13, and taught myself everything I know. my parents slowly, carefully alienated me from my music and my joy as a creator and just now, at 26, I'm realizing that they tortured me with music to get me to hate it. That probably sounds crazy but I'm also autistic and noise sensitive, with chronic insomnia and health issues, and my parents would blast music very early in the morning when I'd barely slept. anyway.. I've never met, or even spoken with, anybody who's gone through something similar or even falls under the category of prodigy. I'm extremely, extremely lonely. honestly, even though I'm blessed to have really great friends, I've never had anybody even come close to understanding me and I'm sick of trying to explain myself when I have no idea how. So here I am. Are you out there, fellow abused prodigy? Do you look around and feel terrified that you'll always be this lonely?

However by the time i reached university i had become an introvert and would never have the courage to comment on someones posts or initiate friendships. From the ages of 21 - 27 she gots many phones calls, text messages, posts on social media, gifts and i got nothing. I did not care cause she always spent the day with me or we have a trip somewhere. The weekend before and so excited to plan it. In 2020 she got married and while i am happy she found a nice guy i knew that we could not be as close as we were before and i knew i would  have a horrible time on my birthday. It hurts so bad that she chose to spend the day with someone else over me.  from 22- 27 she has had a  birthday dinner or party with her friends but she always made it as equally if not more important to plan out time with me first. although it make perfect sense to spend time with your spouse on your birthday. I still feel like complete and utter crap most likely cause i have no one else and still wouldn't put anyone else over her. She offered to go to breakfast with me but the way her husband is he would probably just show up and i rather not feel like a third wheel on my birthday or get ignored. Hanging with her has changed because we used to be so insync a when we see something funny we both look at each other same time and when i look over she is looking at him if she doesn't find it funny like her tastes and humour is changing as well. Her husband is a guy that is always joking and he keeps pointing out that i have no friends. Third time was on Christmas when i was saying look what my friends did at work and my sister said which friends as in the names of the friends i was with and her husband interjected laughing saying what friends and laugh further. I rather not hang out with a jokster during one of the worst times of my life.  I honestly feel horrible i wish i had friends so all this wouldn't be so hard but living with someone having them there any time any place and knowing i could always count on her it hard to just move on like it didnt exist and like i dont still have those needs.

2754,_Alrxo92,1610332863,1,"Hey all 

I know most people have a ""type"" they go for but its normally basic things but my ""type"" of guy is more than the basic things. It scares me I won't find love again as I'm too fussy. 

Basically, I'm not that overall fussed on looks. I prefer dark hair and dark eyes but I also go for blonde and blue eyes. I prefer guys with longer hair than shorter. I also prefer a medium built guy, I don't like too many muscles though. 

It's personality/ interests that is the biggest thing I look for and is where I have a lot more things that I look for. I'll list the things I'm looking for, but I do feel a bit stupid for wanting so much. I'm looking for a guy who is around 25-29, into gaming, into comics - DC/Marvel, into metal (preferably the same bands or type of metal as me) also liking the same YouTube channels as me, but that would just be a bonus. Due to being a petrol head myself, I also would like a bf who is the same. His personality is probably what most girls want tbh, but due to me having a medical condition, I would like someone patient, understanding, romantic, spontaneous and loyal.  

I know I will probably get a lot of negative comments, but I'm being genuine with how my mind works and with the type of guy I am trying to find. I honestly haven't found anyone in a while that I have any connection with, or anyone that I'm interested in holding a conversation with, let alone thinking i could date them.",lonely,I (28F) feel I'm too fussy to find someone compatible,2021-01-11 13:41:03

I’m 29. A somewhat normal, college educated and independent Black dude, gay. But I ain’t got no friends. For most of my life I’ve found it difficult to make good lasting friends. Part of why I moved out of my home state was to make good friends. Hasn’t happened yet. Where I’m from there were not many other Black people like myself and I found I was a bit too Black for the white folks so I never found myself fitting in to any social group in the suburbs. 

Now with being unemployed and Covid pandemic it has become difficult to get out and meet folks for friendships. At times it’s rather frustrating to keep hope that A. I will find gainful employment again, and B. meet good quality people to befriend and build bonds with.

I know a couple of people from school but we dont really gel, and it's always one way e.g. I have to start all conversation and keep it going.
Sadly everyone I've met it has been like this with except my friend who passed.
My closest friend passed away in August in a freak car accident, it was tragic and I miss being able to talk to him.
Would be nice to have a girlfriend at some point, I've never had one, when I was in my teens I was nervous just talking to any girl but now I'm not, it doesnt bother me, but I can't go out coz of coronavirus restrictions.
I never get any matches on dating apps, I dont think I'm ugly, maybe just a baby face idk, the couple of times I have got a match or when I have sent messages Ive never got response.

The absence of close friendships since middle school has made me form a habit of doing all things alone, even though I always feel extremely lonely and desperate for having a close connection with someone. I have found myself an introvert and grow quickly anxious in social situations because I am hypersensitive to people's nonverbal signals and tones hidden in their words. Sometimes this gets worse and I (likely falsely) perceive others, especially strangers, as threatening which makes me avoid socializing despite my desire to have close friends.

I feel trapped in this lonely state, constantly wanting to make friends while fearing connections and wanting to withdraw myself. But deep down, part of me doesn't want to get out of this state.

So that was a perfect fucking boost for my self confidence.

So after i realised she had blocked me for what ever reason she had I went and talked to my pal about it on sc and she just said ""finaly ur not gonna be dragged around by her and move on with ur own shit"" and those words picked me up from the lil set back. but this pal who've iv known since late 2018 maybe early 2019 and had recently just started seeing a lad around october and since then we've chatted less and less and she lost a pal to depression he had and she herself has depression so today i got a messaged from her at 1:30 am saying she cant have social media anymore and that she was deleting her sc as it was her final form of social media but at the same time mine and hers only form of communication and she said it was becouse she cant be arsed handling it anymore so thats when i started panicking thinking she was going to harm herself in some way or a permanent way so i just straight up asked her that and she promised me that it wasnt anything like that and she asked me not to do anything like that either and the convo went on for a while about it but the whole time i wanted just to say dont do this ur litrally the only person i talk to but i didnt wanna put that kinda burden on person let alone a good friend like her so i said my good bye that was long and ended with me giving her my number and saying if she needed anything just call me or text even just to vent.

20mins after i saw her bye snap i just couldnt hold it back anymore so i had to send another snap asking is this really it r we just not gonna talk ever again or till u feel better but it appears she had already deleted her account or as im starting to think shes just doing this by the request of her new bf. Either way i feel like shit and alone as i literally dont have any mates to talk to and just want this shit to end and just really needed to vent this shit out so someone knows that im not ok for once i guess and if u actually read all this thanks for hearing me out 👍",lonely,Another shitty start to another shitty year,2021-01-11 07:30:53

They are two and with one of them I feel somewhat good but with the other I don't have anything in common and when we it's just us we have almost nothing to talk about and I just hate that feeling, like we are not really friends. The thing is, when they're together I just feel like I don't belong at all. They go to the same school and I don't.

Because I have been spending a lot of time with them and I feel like it's becoming bad for me.

I am a lonely guy, I admit it. I am hurting a lot for various reasons, the truth is I really need some friends. I do have them, but I’ve lost more. I am learning how to be a good friend in the way that one does at a young age. I am 24 but I never really had anyone close for so long. I need help, I need support, most importantly I want to help anyone out there. It’s not about solving anyone’s problems. You are all beautiful and wonderful individuals who deserve happiness. I want to support you in anyway I can. Listen to your daily successes and woes or just talk about our interests. I am trying to become a better version of me. I am working on myself everyday, but some company and true friendship would help so much. 

When I was young I was made to feel as if I didn’t belong. I thought I’d always be on my own and my life up until this point has proven that true. But I have to try. Please if anyone is out there and willing to give me a chance I will try to be the best friend to you I possibly can. I am into music (especially folk rock), movies, photography and nature. I like to travel and dream and feel. I’ve made so many mistakes in my life but searching for the answers is not one of them. Please I ask you if you are near my age of 24, and hopefully live in the United States so we can meet up one day! Let me know if you’d like to be my friend. I ask for help at an incredibly difficult time for me. I ask for kindness and understanding when maybe I don’t deserve. I begin to feel like I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t know. I just always wanted someone I can call a friend for the foreseeable future. Because what is life worth if you don’t have someone to share it with?

2843,JumpBackground,1610280164,1,"*I don’t want to say what school, I’d really hate to get doxxed* 

TLDR: I’m a ‘successful’ kid that cries out of loneliness often, recently after my acceptance it’s gotten to nearly everyday multiple times a day 

I took a 65 day hiatus from this sub to focus on applying to this school (I’m recruited for women’s track). I *really really REALLY* was so nervous about it and felt extremely underqualified, but lo and behold, I got in! 

The first week or two after I felt pretty good but pretty numb. People in my school I never spoke to congratulated me, teachers seemed more genuinely interested in me, more acquaintances than ever, and I was snapping a couple of track guys but nothing crazy or fulfilling (they live 40+ min away and/or I’m honestly not very attracted to them) 

But no friends. No real romantic interests. After all these years and time working on being my best self, I still don’t have girlfriends to laugh with or someone to cuddle.

It’s approaching 2 years since I was carefree and content. COVID made the friends I once considered family grow apart from me. I’m a dark skinned Indian girl so nobody in my small school really looks at me romantically. I struggled my entire childhood with my family putting me down for being so dark (just including this so you can better understand my psyche). My parents are really strict and don’t see the value in me having connections, so pursuing any type of relationship is kind of impossible. 

I know I’m not articulating what I feel properly, but what I’m trying to say is that I feel a little defeated. I feel like I’ve been waiting for my life start for so long- everyday is so so dull. I still have some motivation to do work and plan goals, but I feel loneliness is eating away at my drive. Maybe it’s hormones but seeing people laughing or a couple talking always feels like a kick in the throat. Is there something wrong with me? I’m respected and even praised by people around me yet I still feel ugly and unlovable?",lonely,I thought getting into an Ivy League school would make me cry less,2021-01-10 23:02:44

After a year almost of social distancing as much as I could, yesterday I broke down crying realizing how lonely I feel. 

My friendships mutated and changed rapidly during COVID: I barely see them because I don't feel comfortable around them. They don't respect social distancing rules when we get together take off their masks (when they know my mom is immunosuppressed, in a wheel chair, and also I don't really want to get COVID either). It's really uncomfortable for me having to please ask them again to respect those rules, so I feel awkward going to these outdoor meetings but also very lonely if I don't. Lose - lose.

And since they get together, there are no more Zoom meetings (I know, everybody's tired of Zoom but it was the only way I could get at least *some* connection).

I was sobbing yesterday in need of a hug. It's been so long since I hugged someone without the fear of catching or giving COVID. Thinking of all the missed hugs and company, and wondering if we'll ever get to make up for them.

And it was a year of transformation, because I graduated from med school, became a vegetarian, came out as bi and so many other personal growths. But I went through those changes with the company of my lovely boyfriend. But I really needed and still need friends.

We talked about life, watched funny videos together, video chatted, honstly it was pretty great. There was another part of our friendship though that is honestly what helped me get by. We would talk to each other while we shared porn/masturbated. Yes I know its gross but.. it helped us both. We were lonely and we got along and so we did that some with each other. 

It was so......comforting. We found a comfort with each other that was good. We both knew it was temporary cause we were both single but... it just was nice. Eventually we drifted apart (as people tend to do) and that stopped. I miss it.

I'm a 27 year old male living alone with my dog. I lost my parents about 7 years ago and have mainly come to terms with it but there are days where I really envy my friends or other family that have their mom or dad to talk to through the tough times. This last year with COVID has only further pushed the fact that I'm alone. Multiple plans fell through with friends or family because they are worried about visitors with the current pandemic. All my friends and family have either left my city, are dead, or simply don't speak anymore. They're just gone.

I lost my job after becoming part time with COVID, so, I was the first to go. While I didn't love my job, just some form of human interaction was healthy I think. I have been searching nearly every day for jobs relevant to my field of study, and I just cannot find something in the midst of this pandemic.

I hadn't thought about dating in years, but I met a girl through my online classes and I thought we had begun to hit it off at the end of the year last year. We continued talking after our initial date very often, but she expressed she just wasn't interested romantically. She wanted to remain friends and later revealed she had been seeing someone. After the shit year, I think I was just really optimistic it would end in something good. 

My other dog, Dexter, passed away due to cancer on July 15, 2020 and he was one of the best friends I had. I miss him every day and the apartment just feels so empty without him. I still have my other dog, but it just isn't the same without the both of them here with me.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while, and with any relationship, there are issues. One of them is my boyfriend’s temper and his ability to talk down to me and make me feel like I’m a child and like I’m the damn problem. 

Tonight, I wanted to be with him since I’m having a hard time with my recent move, so I drove a few hours to be with him. Once I got into town, he said he was hungry, so I said I’d pick up food. There was a little bit of a line, so I told him, so he was aware it wasn’t going to be super quick. Then I got stopped by a train on my way to his place. I had asked him to unlock the door, but he didn’t, so I was a little frustrated because I walked upstairs with my hands full. Once I opened the door, I didn’t throw a fit or anything; I just quickly set down his food and went to unload my things. He seemed to be sulking in his bedroom when I came in, so I gave him space. I grabbed a blanket and sat on the couch, waiting for him to eat. 

He came out in a huff then saying that he had to leave the apartment to get away from my bad attitude and asked why I even bothered to come over if I’m going to act like this and questioned my intelligence by stopping for food at a place we know takes a while. I’ll admit I was sitting on the couch irritated that he was letting the food go cold after I waited 20 minutes for it and didn’t even bother to say thank you, but I wasn’t pissy or passive-aggressive or anything. When I first came in, and he told me that he unlock the door, I calmly said to him that he didn’t, but it was fine (because I was already inside). Eventually, my boyfriend threw away the food I got him and left the apartment. 

I had just moved all my shit to a different city, so it’s not like I could quickly head home. I just drove almost two hours to be here and I do not have it in me to make a return trip right now. I drove over here because I love falling asleep and waking up next to him. I wanted to hang out and listen to him make music or play Mario Kart. Instead, I feel like a damn idiot. He came back to the apartment and just went inside his bedroom, closing the door, and left me out here on the couch. It’s pretty cold out here, and I’m exhausted from my day of unpacking and organizing shit and driving through a bunch of bullshit to get here, not even to get a damn hug or anything. I’m angry as hell, and I’m sad.

My anxiety has admittedly been a lot worse than what it is at the moment, seeing as i used to not be able to leave my home at all. I couldn’t walk my dogs, i couldn’t grocery shop because i’d be in tears just thinking about having to talk to the cashier, i dropped out of school very early and haven’t returned since, i couldn’t look anyone in the eye, and sometimes even the sound of people speaking would be enough to make me break down and cry. 

I grew up without a dad, he left me at a very early age, and i have no memories with him.
My mother has been physically and mentally abusive throughout my whole life, and i recently gathered the strength to remove her from my life completely, as i moved out to live on my own, in my little humble apartment.


As for friends, i’ve pretty much never had a single good friend. Right now, i don’t have a single person to contact in physical, other than my therapist and my mentor. I have no emotional support to fall back on, because i’m too anxious and too terrified to go out and try to improve my life. I’m too scared to break this cycle of isolating myself and disssociating from the world around me. 

It’s like i know what i need to do to help myself, i just can’t seem to find the strength to do so.

I know i have potential to improve, and i do have hope that i will, seeing as i’m just 19 i got my whole life ahead of me, i just feel like a mess right now, in bed, 7am, not having fallen asleep yet.",lonely,My life the past few years,2021-01-10 16:53:53

I didn't go the websites tonight thinking about going with a partner, I just got in a strange mood to check things out, and once I started, that feeling of having wanted to go with a romantic partner suddenly came over me, and I become incredibly sad.

In my free time (most of the time), when I’m not stalking attractive girls on social media or wasting my life elsewhere, online, I lament having never seized an opportunity for companionship in my recent past, and I feel myself getting increasingly distant from even my closest friends. I convince myself that what I want is all the beautiful and lofty things that come with a serious relationship. But it’s become clear to me what my actual motivations are... I live to spite myself. While deep down I’m sure I desire to love someone like I’ve witnessed others do before, I have a stronger affinity to preserve the persisting numbness that has come to define my emotional state. I act according to this urge to spite myself, and I find a kind of peace in the numb feeling that ensues—it is a feeling I’m familiar and comfortable with. Since I was a child I always preferred winter over summer and I find that I am still most comfortable in the cold. I only recently likened this tendency to my emotional tendencies and realized that they both inspire the same numb feeling that I chase, daily.

2895,SHOWMEWHATYOUGOT83,1610251760,1,"Let's just jump right in shall we?

I have major social anxiety. I am bipolar type 2. Let me give a brief explanation of what that means. If you already know, skip the next paragraph. 

Bipolar disorder used to be called manic depression. The term is outdated now because we understand that bipolar is a spectrum that takes more than one form. People with bipolar type 1 are the type you would think of as manic depressive. Crazy high periods followed by periods of severe depression. Obviously this is an oversimplification but you get the idea. Bipolar 2 is a little different. I dont get the manic part as most would describe it. Instead people with my affliction become whats called hypomanic. Its like the mania of bipolar 1 but can be much much harder to identify because its so much more mild. It may present as a period of irritation or being irrationally angry. It may lead one to spend a bunch of money you dont have. It may just be feeling really good and being in a great mood for no reason. And when the depressive state hits it tends to hit hard and fast and often lasts much longer than those with type 1. I can cycle rapidly between both states or remain in one or the other indefinitely although the hypomanic state is generally short and not my issue. I've learned to identify and deal with that. Its the depression that causes my problems.

Its next to impossible for me to deal with. How do I ask anyone else to take on that kind of crap? How do I explain to someone who's never felt that way that a lot of the time I just want to end it all and sometimes fight with myself all day over it? How do I tell someone that sometimes the simplest of things or nothing at all can render me nonfunctional for days, weeks, months at a time and all I can do is live one day to the next just trying to hang on feeling isolated and afraid and alone? Who would want that person?  Who wants the guy who has to take a handful of meds twice a day just to be able to think clearly and act rationally? Even when they work which is not always the case. 

I'm so tired of being alone. I posted in this line in a group the other day and its been stuck in my head since:

""Water water everywhere but not a drop to drink. People too but not a one who understands the way I think.""  

And thats hard frankly. To know that no one gets it. That i can spend hours obsessing over just the tone of a text message. That I have no belief that anyone actually likes me or wants me around. That I don't believe that anyone will ever really love me and that I dont deserve to be loved anyway. 

Nobody wants to be with that guy. Nobody wants to take that on and who would blame them? And so im lonely and here I am. I just want someone to share the good times and the bad times with but unfortunately I offer more bad than good it seems. 

This sucks.

I actually felt like I had value there, people listened to me and cared about me, every conversation was a laugh and I actually felt like I fit in somewhere.    


I worry that I'm just not normal enough. I find it hard to really make new connections and all my closest friends are from college, I didn't make any really close friends at Uni or at any work place. People are really really nice, but I just find it hard to make that connection. 

I'm 24 and I still miss my family like it's the first day of moving out again. I kinda feel like there's something wrong with me, or I should've made more of myself down here at the city i moved to. It breaks me up at night and makes me feel pathetic.",lonely,"24 and living alone. It's not bad, but it's not with my family.",2021-01-10 12:40:44

2923,zTeloi,1610241386,1,"Hi,

It's my first time posting here. I just needed a space to express what I am going through. 

This past week, I realized something deeply about myself. I've been collecting my thoughts, processing, and reflecting on myself. I've been lonely most of my life and it is because I've been suppressing my needs for intimacy and connection. I thought I didn't need them and so I left my needs unmet. I've been suppressing my needs for so long that it started to manifest physically and subconsciously. I always thought holding back my needs would be enough but in doing so has impaired my sense of self. I have not been able to meet my needs in a healthy way. I am 29 years old right now and I don't have a lot of dating experience. I grew up in a very conservative and religious household even though I myself am not. I wasn't allowed to date growing up and it stifled me from forming relationships with people in general. I broke up with my ex 2 years ago and she was my first real girlfriend. My ex made me realized my love languages which are physical touch and quality time. She made me realize that yearning for intimacy with another person. Something I never had nor experienced. To be held, hugged, and cuddled were all things that I yearned for so long. I thought I didn't need it but when my ex left, it opened up a part of me that I didn't know I needed. The thing is I don't want this part of me to go away because it's one of the first emotional experiences that actually made me feel like I was alive. My whole life, I've intellectualized everything as a defense mechanism. It protected me from being hurt but it came at the cost of being able to form meaningful emotional connections. 

Right now, I feel so alone and I don't know how to cope with it. I just feel like if I can't get my needs met, it will continue to affect my life and I won't be able to truly live my life.

Thank you again for reading. I do apologize for it being a long read.",lonely,First Time Here: Just Need a Space to Express Myself,2021-01-10 12:16:26
2924,Fabulous-Advantage,1610240845,1,"I know that others have it much worse.

For me, I'm 21 m, never had a gf, or been close to a girl.

I went through over 3 years of college and didn't make friends, just acquaintances. I was lost and broken. I wanted to be part of different groups. I talked to people, I just didn't do it enough, I was awkward, too blunt, miss social cues, shy/anxious, guarded.  

I'm short, and pretty skinny. Always been like this, don't eat enough. I did go to the gym, I just didn't eat enough. In fact I had a personal training assessment and since I'm so lean my body fat % came like 4% (really low) and the person was like usually people come in at much higher and work down to 11%. I was like yeah I need to gain weight. But I don't eat enough. I am strong for my size, upper body I can do 50+ pushups one go. 

I did therapy for a few months. I saw a few in person because I thought I didn't have friends, and I thought anxiety or my eating. One man I didn't really feel safe but he said I must be very lonely and have anxiety and have personal insecurities. A lady I saw over the summer validated me, thought it was anxiety. But for friends she said I might not met the right people. And after a month she stopped remembering some things, and wasn't on the same page. 

I kept trying. I was to finish my degree, but I was too lazy to learn. So I would just skim the material, and open up the tabs so I could look back and forth to see if I can draw connections on the final exam. I am smart so that helps. I ended up failing almost all the finals. I did pass all the classes, but I didn't feel better. In other words if I failed, I would just change up my plans. I had 2 degrees lined up so if I had to one fall through, then the other was still useful. I didn't want it to happen, but if it did it would clear up my plans--I didn't care. 

Even with Covid, I stayed overnight, in empty part of airport. I just had my suitcases, and I didn't sleep, it was hard. I just sat and thought. I started feeling bad for myself, like I was such a 'good person' and here I was, putting my health at risk, like I was homeless, since I wanted to save money. I saw a few others who were always waiting for someone else and I realized how no one will ever wait for me. I didn't sleep so I started crying a little but I started having these questions, like why hasn't anything changed. 

I'm a residential assistant on my campus, and after couple days, I felt like since I didn't really have emotional capacity for the social part of my residents, so I called saying I wanted to resign, but then the next day I felt different and kept at it. It's a cycle, the day I feel Ok or good, at night I feel like it's not good. I would like not to do it, but the alternative is spending a lot of money. Also I thought it was noble to quit, that since I do play a role in their lives if I feel like I didn't have my life together to not rub it off on them, but they do need people and essentially I was 'doing everything'. I just hope they're not complaining or they see more for how incapable I am in the emotion/social aspect. I don't know what to try at.",lonely,Why should I keep trying?,2021-01-10 12:07:25

2932,CraftyGamer_,1610236050,1,"  This is one of those thoughts that while it doesn't happen daily, it's been roaming around my mind for a while. Yes I do have friends, it's that we just haven't talked in a while. Their either busy or offline, and I can't blame them for it, and even if they're online I hesitate to start a conversation with them, as I read that I might be bothering them from something. After a while of just not talking to them my mind just assumes that I'm not important to them anymore. And that is because I don't see myself as a good person, even if everyone has their own definition of a good person. I can't see myself fitting in. I can't see myself being important to anyone else. I still find it surprising that I even managed to make friends in the first place, despite being who I am. And when it comes to that sort of thing, I think that they deserve someone better than me or that they'd be better off without me. Maybe I'm just some asshole who wants attention, that's a possibility.
  As stated earlier, I hesitate to make a conversation, not just to friends but to any group chat or server, so I just stay silent and not talk to anyone for a while. I isolate myself to prevent being a bother, yet I want to be with someone without feeling like one.
I usually think hugs are better than kisses, and to me it's because hugs are more to do with emotional warmth and comfort while kisses are more of a romantic thing, and if I ever do get hugged, it's more likely that I will burst into tears as for my lack of affection.
  I want to feel something. Something more than the amalgamation of pain that I've already been feeling. I want to someone to spend a good time with, someone who cares about me, someone who makes me feel, I don't know, safe?  But maybe I'm wrong and lying to myself, who knows, my mind tends to make up a lot of nonsense when it comes to these sort of things.",lonely,"17M / Surrounded, but Isolated",2021-01-10 10:47:30

2939,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1610233234,1,"Hi there! I'm a 31 M from the Midwest. To be upfront, I'm looking for a friendship first. So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships. But this pandemic has changed the landscape and I've considered exploring the online route. 

What I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens. 

Some of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

I am in no way trying to invalidate that but offering a perspective someone else told me that made me feel a bit better. 

Saying “I’m 18” or “I’m 22” or “I’m 26” and never been in a relationship makes it seem like a long time. 18 years is a long time to be lonely, right? But why start counting years of loneliness from the day you were born? Instead, start counting from from when you could have reasonably expected to have found a relationship. Nobody expected you to have a significant other in 2nd or 3rd grade so why count those years?

And sure, some people found boyfriends or girlfriends in high school but if you were like me then you might have been too focused on school and clubs to be doing that. So I would start counting my own loneliness at 18 when I graduated high school. Given that I’m only 21, saying I’ve been alone 3 years is not as painful as saying I’ve been alone for 21. 

All I’m saying is you should take into account the circumstances of your life. Some people are busy with a heavy workload in college, a time consuming job, or something else that leaves them too occupied to think about a relationship until they are in their 20s. 

And of course this is no magic bullet, I’m not expecting anyone to say “Thanks, I’m cured!” I’m just saying loneliness hurts, I know from personal experience, and thinking about it this way eases that pain.

So be honest with yourself, how long have you spent actively searching for a relationship? Because I can almost guarantee you it has not been your entire life. So when you count your years of loneliness, don’t start from the day you were born. Start from the day you can honestly say you had the time, energy, and opportunities available to actively seek someone. And then you’ll realize maybe it hasn’t been as long as you think.

Even if it’s a brief conversation you could have a major impact on helping them.",lonely,Real thoughts: shouldn’t we begin helping each other not be lonely?

After my last ""breakup"" (if that's the proper term to call it), I've never felt connected in a love manner to anyone. Or maybe anyone has never felt connected in a love manner to me. I don't know who the focus or issue is on. I had two love relationships in my whole life, the first one when I was 25 or 26 years old (very late, when majority of people had the first one at 14 or 15 years old), and it was a very toxic relationship. But it was my first one, and it lasted for two years, until she decided to cheat on me while I was in front of them. Before that, she had never stopped thinking about her platonic love, 22 years older than she was, and I was very upset about that, but she never seemed to be concerned. My second relationship was worse than the first one, because it turned out that she was a professional liar to everyone, even me. She lied to my ""friends"" (if that's the proper term to call them) about me, and she lied to me about my ""friends"". Besides, she cheated on me too, not with one guy in front of me, but with multiple guys (not at the same time) behind my back.

Not only that. Those ""friends"" turned out to be very toxic, to me, between themselves and to other people, but I feel that they were more toxic to me. Those two girls belonged to that group of friends, it was there where I met them, and nobody warned me about that situation. Their reason? I'm too old for them to waste their time in give me advices and I have to grow up already. That's not something friends do. And the worst thing is, when I tell them things to their face about what I feel or what I think, they put themselves against me in a very hostile way, not violently, but... you know what I mean.

I feel that I want to be connected as a friend and as a lover to people, but I just can't. I can't trust anyone, because I trusted those shitty people, just because I met two or three of them when we were going to high school, and I was the most injured party. So, what is the point for me to trust anyone if anyone can hurt my feelings? What's the point to love if I can be cheated on?

And after that ""breakup"", in September 2018, I was trying to get involved again in a love relationship, but I didn't succeed. I feel like nobody wants to be with me in any way. I talked to women on dating sites, Reddit and messaging apps, but they were the ones who left talking to me at some point, and the only ones who wanted to keep talking to me were scammers. And the few friends I have, very good friends, they work, I can't hang out with them very often, just a few times in the year. They're all in relationships. I'm the only misfit.

I feel that I've severe issues on my self esteem and self confidence, but I don't have the money to go to a psychologist, and I don't know anyone who can help me. So, maybe I'm cursed. Maybe I'll be forever alone, and that hurts.",lonely,"Maybe I'll be forever alone, and that hurts",2021-01-10 06:32:23

Here’s the story:
I’m homeschooled, have been my whole life. Was supposed to go to high school this year but covid-19 hit. I’ve wanted to go school for so long, but my parents haven’t allowed me. I live in “the hood” but there’s a lot of good people here too, like my church friends my age.I figured remote learning would convince my parents to let me go. But it didn’t. So I tried to be a “part time student” remotely. I got in but not the way I wanted. Not with a zoom teacher. Because of that my parents lashed out me saying why I shouldn’t have done it in the first place. I’m so alone, I have no one. I’m afraid I’m failing academically. Incredibly insecure. I can’t go on like this. Someone please give me advice.",lonely,I can’t do this anymore,2021-01-10 06:19:46
2962,codecrunchie,1610219030,1,"Hello, finally something positive that came out of 2020, this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who **are** willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying** and have interests in **dinosaurs, minecraft or biology.** Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3500 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

Let's be honest though 2020 wasn't a year for ANYONEEEEE except for those who already have their ""one"" or ""missing puzzle piece."" At the beginning of my lonely journey after getting out of a lengthy relationship (failed marriage) I can definitely say I was in my feels way worse than I am currently. But, now it almost concerns me because its as if im feeling nothing now...? Or if anything at all, I dont know its kind of hard to explain. I've probably been rejected by over hundred women in these past years for all of the reasons you can name: average height, too much of a family man, workaholic, clean shaven, no tattoos, no piercings, that cliche response from every female ""you're going to make a girl feel like the luckiest woman in the world."" LOL am I though? Because from how constant you've all told me that and how much I've experienced it I dont think that person exists to be quite honest with you. I'm not saying I'm depressed because honestly I don't feel that way because I like who I am, feel about myself, and I can social engage with just about anyone but, at the same time I can't say I'm happy either. So what is it that I call this feeling? The limbo of content of everyday living? Just being THERE for the moment because thats unfortunately how my life has turned out and progressed. Its such an unusual sensation that I wish I could explain better, I also came to the conclusion of just being there as the person I am. A good person, honest to a fault and just openly express to the best of my ability. Being.... maybe thats the best way to describe it? I'm in a state of BEING instead of a state of LIVING.

Even though she’s told you
“I don’t love you anymore”
you still love her as much as the universe is expanding. You know that nothing you do or say will undo what’s been done and all that you can do is just sit there and try not to cry. 
You run through all of the things you could’ve done differently. It all seems so obvious now, so why didn’t you see it earlier? You start to lose sleep over thinking about what you did, or more importantly, what you didn’t do. 
Weeks go by and eventually you get what you’ve been wanting for years now. You’ve been diagnosed with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder). A lot of things that you do or say make sense now. You wonder what would be different if you had been diagnosed, even a few weeks earlier. Things would’ve been easier to work through and you would probably still be with her, and your relationship would be stronger as a result. But the health system messed you around for years and told you that you were fine. You believed that you were fine. But you’re not, and since you haven’t been diagnosed until now, you haven’t had access to the help you needed and the help that would’ve been useful for repairing your relationship. 
All you can do now is accept what has happened, and try and move on. It’s hard, very very hard without her. You still have her scrunchy that she gave you months ago. 
The overbearing guilt eats away at you each night. You keep telling yourself that you can move on but every day you seem to latch on to the thought of her even more.

The age I started looking back at time wanting to go back was freshmen year of high school. I had no friends and was suffering  with social anxiety. I remember missing my friends from middle school so much. I would be like last year may was the last time I saw them.. and every year I’d realize how close I was to middle school until I wasn’t anymore. 

Freshmen year was when I first remember being me. Before then felt like a dream. Though now that I’ve aged so much I feel like I remember being me starting toward the end of my senior year of high school.

I think when I realized something was wrong with me and in this world was right after the end of 9th grade during the summer. My brain changed. Sure it changed in 9th grade as well but that was just social anxiety. my thoughts changed completely. I met her. But the changes wouldn’t end there. I knew something was wrong in this world. You found me then. I was scared of you. Then when I was in junior year everything all of my thoughts were realized. And there it was. That sky, those lands, you. 

I have a music playlist I’ve been growing since 2015. Damn 5 fucking years now! Wait no fuck it’s 2021 6 years. I remember listening to these songs back then! I’ve had it so long some songs get deleted which is extremely annoying since I like looking back at my playlist to see how far I’ve came. 

Time goes by so fast now. All I do is work sleep work sleep, then sleep and do nothing once I’m off of work. Life is going by so fast now. I’m missing out on so much and wasting so many opportunities sooner or later I won’t be able to experience certain things because of my age. 

I want to go back in time and remember all the memories I forgot... so much time has passed I’ve started forgetting certain memories... 

Then there’s late 2017 early 2018. The pain. It lasted until I believe early 2019. Sometimes I want to dive back into that life even though it hurt. I miss the pain. 

Then there’s... you. That’s what I’m scared of the most. Looking back at this life many many years from now. Remembering everything. The shock of how much time has passed since then.

But I do this nearly every night now, I won't be able to sleep until 3am and then I'll feel like crap about myself until I fall asleep and then I get up the next day ready to feel this way again once 3am rolls around.

I've been single my whole life. All I want in life right now is to have a loving relationship, to be able to feel loved by a person who wants to be with me romantically. To hold someone and to be held. To have someone who wants me not just physically but emotionally, and to want those things because of each other.

But when I'm not getting ghosted on dating apps or going on the very rare date that I know isn't going to work out, I feel like I keep getting in my own way. I found out recently I have ADHD as a 20 year old, and I don't know enough about it but I'm almost resentful of it for my plight. I always seem to stick my foot in my mouth, or come on too strong, or just find myself uninterested in someone who's in to me. I think the last part is the worst of all, I know I'm not unlovable it just seems that everywhere I turn the girls I'm interested in don't notice me and the ones who do I'm not remotely interested in.

And at this point since I have no experience being in a relationship it feels like I'm going to be behind the curve for the rest of my life.

I have a campus job now that needs me to work with people, build relationships, and manage students living on campus. It's funny because I don't think I have the emotional capacity for other people, I just feel empty. I care and respond and am there. This was what made me want to quit at first since I was worried how I would 'be there' for them if they may have more experience with people and emotional support than I have. I socialize on the job, basically as much as needed. I don't have expectations, I just listen to them, make comments, try to be myself. No expectations. Just to have a conversation. I had a couple good conversations. On a side note: I also worry that I give of a low-confidence feel so I tend to be on the lookout for those who's behavior changes toward me. 

I also guess people tend to feel comfortable around me. And most seem to like me too. Or at least share things and come talk to me. I basically have good conversations with people, and they don't seem to openly disrespect me I guess. I also just skim read Dale Carnegie every now and then. 

I didn't really have a lot of 'friends', in fact I would say I have friends I just don't reach out to. In terms of social friends to hang, basically none.

All replies encouraged, love to hear your thoughts

Myself:

Covid has really sucked for everyone, no matter how you have it, I think everyone's social life has been a lot shittier than before covid. A little background about myself, I'm a sophomore, only child, very extroverted. If I spend long periods of time on my own, I get way too much in my head and almost feel like I lose sense of reality. Anyone else feel this way? I go to a big university. I've been wondering what college will be like after we graduate? I recently disaffiliated from my fraternity of a year for personal reasons. I feel I've just been tossed into ""the real world"" 2 years earlier than most. Which has been good in a way, I feel more independent and free from alot of the toxic stuff that goes down in greek life.

Society and Covid:

With all the alone time I've had, mainly because I've been home for break. I've really thought about how much people have changed over covid. We had this long, weird, sucky period of basically half a year where we were just by ourselves. I personally started working once June came, but after those three months of complete lockdown, not seeing anyone in person besides my family, going back to somewhat normal life was weird. I think a lot of people really don't think about that period much. But we should. I've noticed, not only myself, but everyone I know changed so much over quarantine and nobody talks about it?

Relationships as a result of covid:

People have become more independent, depressed, antisocial, and woke as ever. Among the people I know (about 100 probably) that I knew before covid, seeing them now feels different. I feel people are nicer to eachother than before, but I think this is because most of us are sadder than ever. The lockdown showed peoples true colors, I along with many people lost touch with a lot of ""friends"" over lockdown. I haven't bounced back from this, but I'm also kind of okay with it. I realized most people are fake as shit. Nobody cares about you besides maybe 5 people, and I mean genuinely care about you. Besides that everyone else is the same as you, you just want people to text with or go out with to drink, just to not talk till the next weekend were you go out and drink again. Ive seen almost all of my friends get into relationships, which to me, seems like its cause people are really lonely now. I am also probably the loneliest I've ever been, don't know if its just part of getting older now...but the zoom classes really don't help at all for an extrovert like me.

Social media influence:

I hate texting, it's super artificial. I only text to setup plans or if im bored asl. Over break I've been on tinder just to pass time and maybe meet a cool girl, but its boring too. You really need to meet someone face to face to know who they are. This was the realization I had over quarantine. I'm addicted to social media, but really only to pass time. I mean instagram and tiktok is what I spend most time on, IG/snap to keep up with people I know, and tiktok when im bored. But I know alot of people who have deleted socials. The thought of that low-key scares me cause I feel like ill just be forgotten, kind of. But why is that so important to everyone these days? This mindset is so toxic, constantly needing attention from random people and comparing yourself to others lives, which are so faked on social media. I think this is why depression/anxiety is at an all time high. It sucks though, because everyone's on the wave, and its not slowing down. The future scares me mainly for this reason. I think our generation's future mental health is going to be so bad that the social media industry will be forced to regress, at the least be more restricted.",lonely,What I learned about people after covid lockdown,2021-01-09 16:54:15
3027,Duckborne,1610168781,1,"I feel strange, I do- for the better part of a decade I have been without a partner. Sure, there were the occasional possibilities that popped up here and there but nothing really ever seemed to stick. Either they weren't interested in me, or I didn't see a future with them (normally the former rather than the latter).

When I was going through my degree, I assumed that once I got out into the ""real world"" things would start making sense- but they didn't. I have a job, a place to live, friends- I should be incredibly content- but I still feel like there is something missing. Someone missing. But then I become my own worst opponent, I am not social enough to meet new people- let alone those who share my interests. If I do meet someone they likely just become another ""friend"" which is fine- sure- whatever. But like; there are some things you can't do with friends that you can with others. I miss feeling loved by someone other than direct family, I miss cuddles, I miss being able to express myself to someone else in a way that you seem to only be able to do with a partner.

For a few years I just tried not caring, just going with the flow and just seeing what happens- but between what happened with 2020, the slow and expected drifting of people away and the increasing loss of my motivation and self esteem I am starting to feel like it'll never happen. Actively searching for people is hard to me, I lack the self esteem to bring myself to start up a tinder account (combined with the fact that half the people in my life say I SHOULD- and the other half say I shouldnt), I live in a small place (rural aus) which means finding people who share my nerdy interests is hard, and I don't drink- so its not like I can even do the classic thing of going ""clubbing"". I just- I don't know what to do; people like me often end up being introduced to others through their friends- but all my real life friends don't know anyone my age and all my online friends don't know anyone single who i'd be good with. Hell, just recently a friend of mine broke it off with their husband and is going to be living with me. It's fine, I am happy to help;- but the ex husband isn't even worried that we would even get together. One of her family members was, but quickly was set straight- It's not even like i'd want to be with her- we wouldn't likely mesh like that, but I kinda hate the fact that it isn't even considered a possible option. 

I just, I want to find someone who I can be with again. I miss the feeling of knowing that someone loves me like that, having someone I can be so incredibly myself with- someone I can play games with and share passions with. Someone who can show me cool new things to do and that I can grow with. I'd love to just- goto the zoo or the park and just- sit and snuggle while just being- or talking up a storm about our plans together. I'd love to get all hot and sweaty playing VR games together. I'd love to have someone who would check in with me and who would look forward to hearing from/seeing me each day. I'd love to have more to look forward to than the next game or TV show series. Hell, i'm getting to the point I would also love to start having a family of my own, but none of that is ever on the table for me and it sucks.

But anyway to my main point, I don't have any friends. Now the thing is that I haven't had friends for about 3 years. (it's been awhile) I never really had a lot of friends but now I have none. I lost most of them because of my mental health. But this time from people has not been all bad. I have taught myself how to draw and I'm pretty good at it. I also taught myself how to code and have written a website and I am going to start writing another one. But I am still lonely and still want friends. I have tried talking to people online and can actual be myself! but because my mental health has been so bad I don't have energy to eat let alone respond. But I actually have been working really hard at it and it's getting better! So here's the problem I don't know how to make friends anymore, there is an argument   that I never really knew how and extroverts just adopted me.

I'm 16 though, so I can't just go check by myself. I would need to talk with my parents about it, which is the problem. My mom has both depression and anxiety (diagnosed) so I thought she was the best one to go to. So not too long ago while in the car with just her I brought up that I think I have anxiety or something. So then she aggressively asks why I think I have it so I tell her the long list of reasons and she shrugs and doesn't say anything for the rest of the car ride. So that was the end of that. And so yesterday I was pissed off at myself because I literally can't get myself to focus for more than 10 minutes. I have to stop about every 5 questions, listen to a song or 2, and continue and my math teacher wants me to do 2 pages everyday and have it turned in by the end of class and it was stressing me out so I texted my mom asking if I have ADD or something. That ended with my mom saying that I don't have anything and my dad saying he doesn't believe that kind of stuff is real. Its probably the most stupid thing I've ever heard. A flat earther could have more reasoning than that. So I'm gonna have to wait till I'm 18 for anything which kinda sucks but is what it is. Maybe I'm overreacting?

The people I live with hate each other and there is a horrible energy in the house 24/7 since everyone works from home.

I don't have any IRL friends, and never have had any...I have a few online friends, but one of them straight up hates me and another two of them are starting to dislike me, and are treating me differently 😟

So here I am on a Friday night, feeling tired, feeling lonely, feeling sad. Nothing to look forward to on the weekend, only a week of this new job, which I already know I am going to hate...but I have no choice I'm sitting at $-15 dollars in my bank account right now..

I just wish I had something to help me through....I know I'll make it...I know I'll make it through....but knowing that it has to be alone hurts so much...because what happens then....what happens then when I'm still alone

What happens 2 years from now, when I'm sitting alone and tired on a Friday night feeling lonely...


It doesn't feel like I'll ever find that connection I long for. 

What if ill be alone forever. 

It sucks because most people don't understand me...even most lonely people don't understand me...because I've never NOT been alone. 

Raised by unavailable shitty parents.

Bullied in School. 

Abandoned by the ""friends"" I made in college

All of the ""friends"" I've made through the many jobs I've had end the second we clock out.

Even the online friends I have don't make feel any less alone. There not the type I can share my problems with, because they'd just minimize them and gaslight me, maybe even make fun of me for it. I've sat in listened to calls where they talk that way about other peoples problems.

People always tell me how I should talk to her.  Or that men should be more open about their feelings.  But we are told we're being selfish,  assholes, or whiny bitches. Or suffering asking those lines.  That's my experience, but I've seen the same from others online.

I usually only have one “friend” that sticks around, but I only talk to them once in a blue moon before the spark fizzles out and I have to start again. The worst part is that it’s mostly my fault. I can’t hold a conversation (most of the time), I’m anxious and scared of everything and everyone, I beat myself up constantly which puts people off because they can only listen to me say “I fucking hate X about myself” so many times, I push people away out of fear that I’m burdening them, I get upset easily because of how I’ve been treated in the past...the list goes on, honestly. The only person I really have is my partner, and I know that people are going to tell me that I’m not really lonely because I have a SO. First of all, that isn’t how things work. Ever heard somebody say “I feel lonely even in a room full of people”? That’s what it feels like. But, instead of the room being full, there’s one other person sat on the other side interacting with all of their friends (on social media/gaming forums because Covid) constantly, complaining about how exhausting it is being so sociable, and then going back to talking to all of their friends again. It sucks - and I love my partner very much, but I don’t think that they understand just how difficult it is.

I've been lonely (no friends, a S.O. or understanding family) for the past 2 years now, and I've been having no success in finding the right people and it drained me so much that I decided that online talk and possible dating is the way to go for now.

So of course, as I am russian I tried out russian tinder and other apps with no success. My intentions in a relationship is to make my partner feel loved and cared about, like they're the only One on the Earth.
But russian mentality is a bit different. We're not that romantic, especially at the age that I'm at. Most people I had convos with wanted hook ups or nudes exchange, which is a no-no for me.

And so I thought that hey, maybe I can try reddit and other stuff like that! I've been following this specific subreddit for a while now, and I really hope people here will find someone who'll love them back. So I found a few subreddits such as r4r, lonelydating, and Needafriend. I made a few posts describing myself, never expecting anything. And my expectations were correct, people who PM'ed me either ghosted me after 10 minutes or never replied back. Same goes for when I see a post by a person, I decided to pm them and they just never reply.

3124,Psychological_Reason,1610113620,1,"Im so so so sad (m32). I dont know if this is the right forum.

Im horrible. Hate myself.

I got single in september and went on tinder to date people. Actually just for sex I think. Starting october I texted and dated multiple women. I slept with 2-3 women at a time.

Met one woman who was kind of out of my league I thought. Much higher socio economic status than me. And great looking. The sex was incredible, something I have been struggling with my whole life. My sexlife have been bad for multiple years do to insecurities and genital warts. Not with her. We hit it on and she really liked me. To my surprise. In hindsigt she was really smitten! We texted everyday. But I was close minded and didn't think we were compatable. I thought she wanted a man with a career and was somewhat materialistic. I kept swiping, texting and dating other girls.

I think I was using tinder as a distraction from my real sucky life. And to help with my self esteem. I dont like myself very much.

She asked me to meet her friends, but I would make up fake excuses. About 1.5 month in she told me ""I dont want you to be dating other women"". In her usual demanding voice. I was taking aback. I had a date next day and couldn't lie to her face. So I mumbled some stupid shit, and said I was coming out of a relationship not that long ago. Which was true. And probably is a factor in all of this. Didn't tell her I was dating other women and continued to do so.

I would lie about how my masters thesis was going and make up lies about my whereabouts and plans. I feel like this is pretty manipulating bordering on psychopathic behaviour.

After that evening she started to be harsh on me and would belittle me. She wasn't being nice to my face. I didn't stand my ground. And let her bully me. Maybe because I think I deserved it - but no I dont think so. It's because I cant say no to people and want everybody to like me. I dont like conflict or ""serious talks"".

She started taking about how we were different and that I had no aspirations in life. I felt her moving away from me, and the more she did the more I clinged on to her. But this STILL didn't stop me from dating others. At this point it was maybe to protect myself against her rejection. I dont know.

Her mother got seriously ill in all of this. I tried to be there for her. But at the same time I felt her slipping from my fingers so I wanted to give her space and time. And still dated others. In hindsight she really needed me to be there for her. I hate myself for not awknowleding that I actually liked this woman.

I wasn't even Into the other women I was dating. I just wanted them all to like me. I felt bad after each date but continued to set them up. This is not normal behaviour. I couldn't tell them I couldn't see them anymore because I didn't want them to be sad. I cant say no to people. Would go on dates I knew I didn't want to go on, even when she was askimg me to be with her. Well it gets muddy here, because at the same time she wasn't treating me well face to face. So maybe I wanted other women to give me that. Or I dont know. Maybe I just think it's fun to see if I can get everybody to like me.

This is only half the story. There is an ending to it. But I cant see the screen because Im crying so much. I hate myself for screwing this relationship up. I wish I could have done everything differently. I guess I just had to get this off my chest. Utterly heart broken. I understand if you despise me. Know that noone despises me more than myself right now.

3132,tfrodton,1610104316,1,"[18 F] I feel like the few loose friendships I had are coming to a close. All it comes down to is that I feel abandoned by these people (two main ones), mostly because they just don't talk to me anymore. It feels like a weird limbo where I'm being held onto ""in case,"" but not for genuine friendship. 
I was supposed to do a gift exchange with one of them but she keeps ""forgetting"" to text me back right before the times we set up for it, and then it doesn't happen, even though she's the one who suggested it in the first place. I put a lot of time into the gift but at this point I don't really care, I just want it out of my house... I feel bad because she probably has something going on in her life that's making her act distant. I think I will ask if something is wrong and for honesty, but even doing that in the past has made me feel like an idiot. I would be fine with her saying I'm annoying and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore, because then I would at least know where I stand with her and could move on (after crying and feeling upset about it, but that's way better than this weird friendship purgatory).
I've been starting to feel better about myself lately but these ""friendships"" are actually making things harder... The thing is, I'm stubborn and I don't want to give up on the relationships, but I feel like maybe that isn't a good reason to stay attached to someone. 
This situation just makes me feel like a needy weirdo, but rationally I know I've just been putting effort into being a friend and not getting the same effort back. I definitely need to manage my expectations for other people in my future relationships, because if not I'll just get disappointed again. 
It sounds strange, but it might be better to just be my own friend for a while? Sort of meaning that I care for myself the way I've been expecting friends to care for me, so that I kind of get the same feeling as a friendship. That might just be self-love and I'm only just realizing I should be doing it now -_- I'll probably try that though.

You've seen things and experienced things from me I've literally never shared with anyone else.  I feel like I can be completely myself with you and you just love me that much more.

Holidays typically suck for me, because I do not have any family that I talk to or hang out with. This Christmas and Thanksgiving I decided not to go to a friend's house, and have to deal with seeing other people with their families, or having to explain why I am not spending the holidays with my family... or be secretly judged because I came from a broken home.


Fast forward to last weekend. My birthday is on New Year's Day, and to continue with my new holiday tradition (of doing my own thing alone) I was planning on treating myself to a restaurant and spending the time alone. My good friend said he wanted to hang out, which I'm up for that, and I told him my plans. (In the past I have tried to get my two friends together to celebrate my birthday - they would not work with me in the planning and joked around at my expense when I got stressed out - this, I was fine for being alone and doing my own thing for my birthday). I told him 5 guys at 5pm. I ended up spending the day with his younger brother, who is a cool dude for being young. Later my friend (who says he's always there for me) didn't make it for my birthday burger, because he was hunting. He said that since he payed for the permits and a gun, it would be, ""irresponsible,"" if he did not hunt. It is another reminder for me that I am alone in this life - that things and anything else is more important in life. A part of me hopes he will say, ""I'm sorry I missed your birthday, let's hang out this weekend to celebrate who you are!""",lonely,"With friends like this, who needs enemas?",2021-01-08 16:49:09

I guess I'm trying to accept that I will never have friends for the next few months and I don't know how to feel okay with it. I've been terrified to even leave my room, but next week I'm going to force myself to go out. 

How do you be comfortable being alone, especially in public in a campus surrounded by people enjoying their youth?? I feel very self conscious about it and this has been making me depressed for a couple of days. (I've already heard the advice to ""put yourself out there"", but knowing me theres no point in trying to find friends).",lonely,How to be comfortable alone.,2021-01-08 14:04:21

I would like someone I can talk to regularly, do voice calls.... and in kind, feel cared for that they would regularly check on me, send messages, call me. Perhaps we could talk to each other on Twitch if you like while you play games like COD *(popular game nowadays)*

Someone I can confide in and talk to in the long-term without reservations about me or ill-judgements about me. And for once, it'd be nice where it would be someone my age *(17-21).*

I plan to move to the midwest *(specifically in WI in the Fox Cities area)* in the future for a clean slate and it would be a miracle, if I could connect with someone there in terms of not feeling alone as I already am here, living in Australia.

3173,scremtrick,1610074081,1,"I am a 21 year old chemistry student. For all my life I've been pretty normal, I  always had my group of friends. I still do. I have very good friends who I know would support me if I had any kind of problem. I know I am very lucky because many people don't have this kind of friendship and I even find myself making new friends but never the kind of friends I already have. I think if I hadn't known them ever since I was born I wouldn't even have this kind of friends, and I am thankful. 

However, at uni, I sure do make friends that I can ask for uni related things, I can go out with them, go out for lunch or a drink... I think people like me but at the same time I don't make myself that approachable to people or idk what it is, maybe I act weird in someway I don't realize that for me is normal. So I am unable to make this kind of conexion with anybody. Last one was my current boyfriend, 2 years ago. 

But again, this is really weird to me because even with my long time friends, who I know I can 100% trust, or even with my close family, or even my boyfriend I get this feeling of being unable to like feel somehow close. I feel like in a bubble or something. 

I am not depressed, that I know for sure, but I feel like I can't fully connect with anybody or anything. It is a very weird feeling and even though I think I act normal (maybe to others it is clear there's something weird going on) and I think to a point it certainly works because I am able to do normal things, people keep inviting me, talking to me so I think it is not that bad. However that feeling of loneliness I can't delete. That awkwardness I can't help feeling everytime I interact with someone. 

I even thought for a time I have some kind of autism, which could be really stupid, because no one has ever told me anything and I have talked about everything with my closest friends but at the same time it could totally make sense, I totally feel I have some features, or maybe again it is just suggestion.

Do I dislike it or am I just not used to it?

I'm the only person in my life without something else going on. I don't have friends outside my friends. I see my partner texting someone or I heard my friends mention someone in passing and it feels so dull because I don't have that and I don't know how to have it. 

Every compliment or nice comment feels forced or fake or just doesn't bring any positive feelings and i don't know why. I worry that they feel like they have to because they know my self esteem isn't the best.

The first women I truly ever loved was, and is, like no one I have come across all these years on this Earth. We were best friends before we ever got together, we were together almost all the time. As time went on I started falling heavy for this women, there wasn't a thing I wouldn't do for her. The way she would present herself, the way she would smile even after all the things she has been through, the way she smelled, the way she would love hard, her crooked pinkies(lol), everything about her was astonishing.

When we finally got together it was truly amazing at first. I started sleeping over basically moving in. When I would try to leave and go back home she would pout, honestly we both got use to being together all the time. It started going downhill whenever she would get mad about me going to go see my parents. I was always there to hang out with them because they don't have anyone here in Texas. My mom has what two friends and my dad has none. My big brother all he did was sleep after work so they never saw him. I felt like I needed to be there sometimes to just be around you know?  I would always try to get my GF to come with me and just hangout. My parents loved her and my mom and dad tried so hard to get her too like them. My mom's primary language isn't English so it was difficult and she tried so hard. My dad tried to joke around with her so she can feel like she is part of us. My GF however didn't like either of them, she didn't like my dad because of his beliefs and how he saw the world. Man forget that you know? She never could see past that and just kept talking shit about him. My dad is a great fucking guy and he came from nothing to where he is at now. It started going downhill after we fought on almost everything. Every one of those fights was the result of a conversation where I made a thoughtless, selfish, emotionally impulsive and undisciplined choice. It started going downhill whenever I would lie to her about stupid shit that didn't matter. It started going downhill whenever she would make fun of one of my biggest insecurities. I would insult her back probably shouldn't have. That just shows how immature I really was. I just felt like I was walking on eggshells every time I tried to talk to her as time progressed.  It started going downhill when I heard about her friends bashing my appearance and how ugly I was. As time went on I started to stop caring as in I stopped trying to better myself. I went into a huge depression and didn't love myself. I stayed like that until the end.

Looking back on it, I started turning developing narcissistic tendencies. I would lash out on her and take my problems out on her. Whenever she would try to communicate to me about a lot of things that hurt her that I did, I would shut down and not communicate. After finding out what gaslighting was I'm 100% positive I did it. She told me how she felt she was settling. She told me how she wanted to be treated and loved this went on for months and I simply did not change, looking back on it how big of a fool I fucking was. This women loved me so much and stuck to my side even though I was such a fucking loser and disgusting person to her. I put her through so much psychological and emotional torment, a relationship shouldn't drain a person and believe me looking back I definitely drained her.  Even today, I’m guilty of thinking back on it with fights about things that didn’t matter. Little, insignificant things we'd blow out of proportion.

One fight however was the breaking point. This happened in June, so close to her birthday. She was in the living room with my roommate and his simp and they were drinking and talking. I wasn't up for it so I went to the room and wanted to go too bed after working both jobs. Our puppy needed to go outside and I was already in bed so I assumed she would take her out. She asked me if I could take her out. I groaned and said why can't you take her out and she told me she has been all day. I then say you'd rather drink then take care of our dog. Fuck. I immediately regretted saying that, because she was right it was only fair. She then came into the room and started yelling at me raising her voice. I got irritated and said dude leave. She kept going and I say again dude leave. Again, still going and I said leave and put my hands on her stomach and pushed her away from me. She immediately yells dont fucking touch me and bam hits me on the head. I get mad and said more firmly fucking leave pushing her again, and she just started going at it. She started hitting me on the skull bruising her hands in the process after the fight the next day because she doesn't know how to punch. Coming down with hammer strikes and shit. I get up and say Im fucking leaving. I went toward the bathroom and as I was trying to get out she got in my way. I ask her to get out of my way and she said no. I grab her arms very hard to move her out of my way but she was presentient and just kept getting in my way. I just needed to leave. The morale of the story I shouldn't have put my hands on the women I loved. I shouldn't have been selfish and just taken the dog out and not make a snarky comment like that. I’m not trying to justify anything. All I have now is guilt and sadness. It wasn't the same after that fight. 

She finally had enough of the abuse and manipulation I put her through after begging me for months to change and me saying I would but wouldn't (i just don't know why I didn't wanna try) and called it quits. After the breakup I moved back to my parents and started sharing the dog we got together at the time every week. We still stayed in touch and would hang out still, go out to eat and what not. She and I both wanted each other to be part of each others lives still (i definitely didn't deserve to have her in my life). I start taking charge and started to better myself after we broke up. She would tell me where was this energy whenever we were together and again I stayed silent. Honestly I was doing it to win her back and to better myself all together.(she doesn't know that)

As time progressed it just became more and more distant and one week it was her turn to have the dog back. I was woken up by my parents and they told me I got to take the dog back because there is people here fixing the house. I immediately got up and got my things together and started going to her place. I left my phone at home so I couldn't tell her I was on the way but I told her beforehand I would be there in the morning prior. I still had keys to the apartment so my dumbass thought haha I should surprise her with the dog. That was a big mistake, I should've respected her boundaries and knocked on the front door. I opened the front door, and proceeded to her room. My dog and I made so much noise prior to coming in so I was sure she heard us. I opened the bedroom door and a non-existent hammer fucking hits me on the chest. I see her and her ex who she would talk really badly about don’t have a opinion on the guy don’t know him so idk but kept the pictures of them up together while we were together. She was never over him I guess. She immediately deletes anything of me when we broke up so I guess I prove my theory correct. I was always second rate. They were finishing or starting something that wasn't my business. I knew we weren't together anymore but doing things on stuff we got together it just hurt you know? Made me feel like I never really mattered idk I guess. This ain’t no pity party I fucked up first but damn she got me back. I immediately left and the immaturity kicked in and I blocked her on everything.

I didn't talk to her for about a week afterwards, I hurt myself during for unblocking her and seeing what she said about me and her likes. I then proceed to delete all my social media and when it was my turn for the dog back I reached out to her.  She came to drop off the dog and I told her how I wanted to talk to her. She agreed and we talked, I proceeded to tell her how sorry I was about stepping over her boundaries and walking in on them. I then give her the spare keys to her place off my keychain. I tell her how this is my last week with our dog and how I was going to let her keep her because I knew how much she loved the dog. I start to get overwhelmed with emotions then start telling her how sorry I am about everything I've done to her and she just stops me. She tells me she doesn't want to hear it and how she doesn't validate my feelings. I deserve that because I didn't do it when we were together.

During my week with the dog all that was going through my mind was her. How I should've improved myself earlier, how much I loved her, how much she tried to work things out, how I would do anything for her. So I reached out again during the week and told her how much I missed her and how much I loved her. I told her to not hesitate to reach out to me if anything happens or if she ever needs my help. She then proceeds to say ""Lmaooo so toxic, you decide to be kind whenever you realized I moved on."" ""I appreciate you saying that but I know your words are hallow"" and a bunch of other things how she needed to stop accepting so low for herself and how she was genuinely over me. I tell her I'll just stay out of your life. I brought this upon myself, I shouldn't have done what I did but I did. As my week ended with the dog I take her back to her place and didn't forget my phone this time and told her I was walking up to the door. We exchange the dog and as I was walking out she hugs me but it was one of those side hugs. Honestly I didn't deserve even that.

I still miss and love her very much but to respect her and her boundaries I should just stay out of her life. Man dude everytime I hear her name or drive past where she works I just get teary eyed and sad as fuck. I hope she thrives in everything she sets her mind towards. I hope she lives a very happy life and finds a man that gives her everything. She deserves the best and I wish her well. I’m just sad it wasn’t me.",lonely,Walking disaster.,2021-01-08 11:40:43

One thing I’ve noticed is that no one ever seems to be as interested in getting to know me as I am with them.

They don’t want to listen to my favorite spotify playlist or watch my favorite movie with me. They don’t want to hear about my results to all the popular personality tests, or hear my long rant about something I’m passionate about. 

For months, I’ll go out of my way to learn about this person because I’m so interested in getting to know them, and then somewhere along the line I’ll realize that they’re just not interested in returning that excitement.

Some weeks I deal with it, but there are days and nights like this one where I am laying in bed, mind racing and thinking of all the people I've walked alongside during my 31 years on this Earth and realizing how often I made the wrong decision leading me to where I am.

I lost one of my oldest friends some years ago, because he did something to expose a toxic person that was draining me, and I didn't want him to do that.

I've been used by other guys in ways I still hurt to think about, only to be discarded after.

Now my life consists of nothing, with the only breaks from my loneliness consisting in experiencing my hobbies. Sometimes I reach out, and talk for months with someone, but then it gets overwhelming and they might be hurt by me taking my time. Usually people lose interest justifiably so. 

About me: I am gay, and from Europe.

I like games (Sony fanboy + some pc gaming, mostly) and music (mostly various subgenres of metal, mostly the less harsh ones, but I like some of the harsher ones too, trying to currently navigate the world of prog rock starting with Van Der Graaf Generator).

I would love to get into playing an instrument despite my age. What attracts me the most are guitars, bass guitars and keyboards. I do not have the money to justify buying those instruments though, since the hobby money is shared with someone else, it'd be too self centered of me to buy one at this point. 

I like history, despite not knowing enough. I like reading, sometimes scifi stuff, sometimes autobiographies, but I am a really slow reader. Unlike the past I can't focus well anymore.

It feels weird not being able to connect even in a superficial way with others. I always get told that being gay should be great when it comes even to things like one night stands, but maybe it's because I am well below average looks wise, but I repulse others when talking on apps.

Well, it's late here and I'm getting tired, so I'll sign off and get to sleep. I'm a very vivid dreamer, and dreaming is probably the only moments where I'm truly happy. I sometimes dream entire lifetimes, which can hurt when I wake up, but until I do, it's nice. I feel love, and get into a lot of weird situations.

Both friends each found a new group to hang out with. There are regular group trips etc I'm not invited to. Now I don't hear from one old friend at all, he turns down all my invites. My other friend was my support bubble during covid and she's just ditched me to form a bubble with another household. I've known her 16 years. I'm totally alone now. I go weeks without talking to another human, my family is 300 miles away. 


What I don't get is why.  I don't see what I'm doing so wrong that means I have to be alone? I'm a good listener, I'm caring,  I'm not overbearing or demanding, I'm not crushingly shy. I don't think I smell. I'm a bit fat and average attractive but exercise 3x per week, I don't dress 'in fashion' but does that matter so much at this age? Do I embarrass people? I have a wide range of interests and hobbies and am open to hearing about other people's interests. I'm not loud but will chip in to conversation and people laugh at my jokes. 


I had 3 years of weekly therapy to go from someone who really deeply hated themself  to someone who does genuinely like themself. But I just can't seem to find anyone who likes me enough to want to spend time with me. They say when you love yourself you'll be open to love but... That isn't happening.  I've been more open. I make more eye contact and small talk I invite people to things, people might come once and then just repeatedly decline  and don't suggest other dates and then you honestly feel you are inflicting yourself on others. I try tinder, bumble, pof, match, (precovid) going to bars/clubs, different social or hobby groups, meet up. I'm a bit reserved with strangers but try to talk to them about light topics and be funny, but it never goes to a point where they'll come for coffee or a drink or a movie. I go on dates with all different kinds of people. I ask normal questions and try to be engaging. I text back. I dont ghost. I don't think I come across as desperate as I'll let things go if it's not working.  My last relationship was 3 years ago, then 4 y before that, I've never had a relationship last longer than 6 months. 


A big part of me does accept its just that my old friends have naturally drifted away but I just don't get why. Why do they get to have big groups of friends and go on trips together. I've never been on a group trip with friends.  I can't even imagine what it's like to be surrounded by people who care for you and to have fun with them. 


I'm trying to make do with my isolation. I have a good job, my pets, my hobbies, I travel alone to places I want to visit.

I don't have many friends, I am not good at social situations, I feel like I'm unable to date due to trust issues, and it is all just getting to me. 

It's very clear to me that the people I do call my friends are totally fine without me around and I honestly don't think they give a damn about how I feel or how I am doing. I am only ever useful as a tool  for them to feel better - just to have someone around. 

I thought I made a new friend on reddit, but after being gone for a couple weeks due to falling into a deep depression, I found that he had deleted his Reddit account for whatever reason.

3203,KollegeMalte,1610060174,1,"  

I (m19) moved in September last year. I had just finished school and was now studying IT security. Since I never had any friends, I decided to move into a flat-sharing community in order to get in touch with people immediately and, in the best case, to become friends with them. 

Just a short time after I moved in, we had a close relationship. I spent a lot of time with one particular roommat and this New Year's Eve was going to be the first highlight in my new home. Through him we were invited to other groups of people to eat and celebrate. We drank alcohol, smoked weed, and had the time of our lives. At one point we were even standing in the kitchen and Blinding Lights was playing and high as I was I started dancing while my friend whistled the tune. Later that evening I must have fallen into the sea as well, but I'll keep it short here.

It was probably the best night of my life. But shortly after the effect of alcohol and weed waned, I was alone again. First I filled the void with work, then I cleaned up my room and in the end it was a movie that was supposed to distract me. However, I made a wrong choice and watched Scott Pilgrim (a love-action-comedy film). I had never seen the movie before and for a better understanding I have to say that at the beginning of the year I broke up with my first and only girlfriend so far. I watched the movie and realized that this emptiness that sits inside of me can’t be filled by just friends and celebrations. I was the loser in my own film. But there was no happy end.

This emptiness is not unknown to me and I have noticed it more often, but it has never been as strong as it is in this moment. I didn’t want to be alone anymore and tried to reach a friend that I had always known since feeling. However, I was unsuccessful, which felt like a slap in the face.

I took my coat and went outside. At first, I hesitated because I was close to tears, but after a short thought, I called an old classmate with whom I had always got along. When she answered, I already burst into tears. The loneliness had absorbed me completely. I told her my story and even more. I’ve been through a few difficult things, including overcoming an addiction, but I’ve never felt so helpless as I was in this situation. 

In the meantime a few days have passed and I feel a little better again. This means that the loneliness has been postponed a little. 

Please wish me luck that it stays that way or I might find the right person so that I am no longer alone.",lonely,The best day of my lilfe and the day after,2021-01-08 09:56:14
3204,Freakyboy008,1610057852,4,"I just want to rant and kinda collect my thoughts.


Ive thought about it sometimes but it really hit me when I was hanging with a friend one day. We were just playing videogames and talking and then I said ""yo corona exists haha. I just realized. I'm just inside all day so I don't notice"" and then he said ""yo. That's sad."" I was just kinda in shock for the moment. He continues saying that he's been out a lot. The following days though I couldn't stop thinking about it. I realized how few friends I have. Not like aquaintences but like actual friends. If I were to call that person right now and we were to hang out, we'd be just fine and nothing awkward. That's what I consider a friend here. 2 people came to mind. And one of them lives far away. And I am hesitant to invite certain people because I am scared we wouldn't be able to just hang out. And I was just so shocked to think of that because in the past I had no such problems. I had many friends. At least I think so. But I've drifted away from so many of them. I've lost contact to almost all friends I had. I just find it quite sad. I don't know how I could prevent this or how to get friends. I just don't know. And also my friend's friend circle is so huge. That also made me think. They have this huge group of people that they all get along with. I had that once but I decided that I wanted to meat with 3 friends max at the same time because otherwise I felt left out and ignored and not even really acknowledged. I don't know. Maybe it's fine like this. But what if I lose contact to all my friends. Espacially after school. I'm kinda concerned that I'll lose some people after graduating.

I’m 17, and have not been this sad and lonely in my entire life.
I’ve been suicidal since September of 2020 for a number of reasons that I won’t get into because I don’t want for this post to be removed.
At first I thought it was just the hormones, puberty and all that, but now i think it might be more than that.
My mom had stage 2 breast cancer last year and i didn’t really deal with that super well, and i think me not confronting my feelings back then has caused me to internalize all of my feelings for the rest of my life; it’s the way my brain functions now.
I think being touch starved has made it all so much worse. I got a total of 6 minutes of human touch in December 2020 (nothing to do with the virus).

I figure I'm worn out from work so my usual mental blocks just aren't functioning.

All I can think is what's the point? Why do I bother getting up in the morning? I get up and go to a job I hate to earn money I don't really need. All so that when I eventually can't live with my parents anymore I can afford a nice big empty house to rot in. 

Why couldn't I have just been born normal? Why did I have to be a freak? Why couldn't I have just had some normal experiences that virtually everyone else on this planet gets? What is it about me that's so special in this regard? 

The joke is that even the stuff I crave wouldn't help me. I can barely maintain awkward friendships with other guys, I have nothing to offer in a relationship. Hell, I have no idea how a real relationship functions.

Even if someone expressed an interest in me (not likely) I hate myself so much that I would never believe it, I would find some twisted way to rationalize it away. I'm emotionally a child, a boy trying to deal with a man's desires.

For some people, being alone for a long time can cause severe mental health problems, so I understand that part. But then he said ""addicting"". Now I suppose for people who prefer being alone, it can be quite a breath of fresh air to not have to deal with multiple people this pandemic. But then that wouldn't be dangerous for them? It's comforting for them, but not really addicting or dangerous. Sure, you enjoy the newfound time you have to yourself. And you probably feel upset whenever someone disrupts that, but I doubt it borders on levels that are ""dangerous"" enough to impact your health or your career. Someone said in Tom Hardy's case, he leads the busy life of an actor so being alone this pandemic gives him some peace and quiet from showbiz. He could get used to such a lifestyle which is inconsistent with what actors should do. But dangerous? Addicting? I doubt those are the right words to use.  And does peace really mean ""peace and quiet"" in this aspect. Cause I took it some context to mean peace as in lack of conflict, as in avoiding toxicity and confrontations.  


It just made me think since a lot of people shared it on social media so I wondered, ""Are they in danger? Should I reach out to them? But they seem to be enjoying being alone. They like their new found lonesome. Should I let them be? But they also recognize it's dangerous and addicting? But they enjoy it? Are they addicted to the peace? How is that dangerous?""

I keep having dreams where we become friends again, and I think of messaging him, but I know that's a bad idea. Things have changed too much and too much damage has been done, it would never be the same and I don't think he even wants me back. I miss him so much

There was a guy on whom I had a crush on from mutual friend group. He tried to pressure me into having sex with him when i was on drugs he gave me. We only kissed. I told him i was a virgin, but he still tried to manipulate me with his words to have sex with him. After i repeatedly said no, he told me that having sex with a virgin is gross anyway because of blood and everything. Then he turned on some degrading porn on his computer and i left. I was so shocked by this because before all that i thought of him as a sweet, gentle guy. He then pursued my friend of 4 years and dated her for a while. She dated him even though she knew i had crush on him and that he tried to use me. She said to me that he was grossed and embarassed that he kissed me and it was all because of the drugs. One time she was having a party and she couldnt invite me bc her bf told her not to. He tried to shift blame on me, like it was all my fault. She dumped him eventually but  by that time I already  cut off ties with her. Now hes having another gf who thinks hes the sweetest guy ever. Its so fucking gross. What did i do to deserve this??? I will never heal from this. I feel so betrayed and humiliated. Justice and karma doesnt exist. Some guys can use women  for sex like its nothing and it is justified in their minds because theyre not the women they actually want for relationship. No matter if these women good hearted, loving etc. Then they pretend to be the good guy because they are decent to women they do want. Its a fucked up society.

I would do the same. It doesn’t make it hurt less. You wanted to say 3 words to me this morning . Maybe it was a joke.  Maybe not. I have felt the same for the last week, but always knew it wasn’t right to let it pass my lips even though it felt natural.

Its just going to add some stress that I don't think I can handle. But I'm wanting to work at a grocery store, but I really don't think they would accept me. Well honestly I'm not even sure how it works. Do they look at how you are in school? I think they do. But if that's the case there's no way they would even give me a chance. My grades and attendance were awful last semester. I'm gonna try anyways though. Hopefully in 3-4 months I don't sit there and procrastinate like I always do. I just really REALLY want to start working so that I can get an acoustic guitar. In my freetime for the most part I just lay down and listen to music so it'd be awesome to play along with some of the music I enjoy. I've always wanted to get into playing guitars since my dad plays them and it just looks cool and fun. Maybe it could also be something I make friends from? Cause I really need some. But on the negative side I'm not sure how long it will take. Because grocery stores don't pay anything nutty and since we live basically week to week my parents already said I'd have to help with food, bills etc. I don't have a problem with that though, I just hope it isn't like 75% of what I make. All I know is there is no way ima be flipping patties and serving fries. So if I don't get accepted which I probably won't I'm not sure what I'll do.

3262,72ak0002,1610018376,1,"So I () think cats are the most adorable things to ever exist and I love them more than pretty anything, but I don’t have one. Of course, I want one really badly, but I live my with my dad who finds pets really annoying, so he won’t let me have one. It really sucks, because he’s aware (though to exactly what extent I’m not sure) that I’ve been extremely depressed and lonely for a long time, and having a pet would help with that a lot. I think having something to take care of that I love would be really fulfilling and would probably make me feel better about myself.

I’ve been self-harming a lot lately. I don’t want to do it, obviously, but it’s not that easy. Since I’d always have to keep them in my room, my cat would see me do that to myself, and—despite the fact that they probably wouldn’t understand what’s happening—I wouldn’t want that, so that’d help me not do it as much as I do, which is kind of a lot, unfortunately. 

I don’t know. I think I’ve reached a point of loneliness where I have such an overwhelming desire to actually be in contact with another living that even just an animal having some level of affection for me seems mind-boggling. I want to feel something. I want to feel love for something that’s tangible and goes beyond having an interest, which I’d say is the only kind of love I’ve ever felt.",lonely,I want a cat so badly it hurts (TW: self-harm),2021-01-07 22:19:36

3285,gibsunn,1609999386,0,"G-d, words can’t express how badly this burns. 

I’ve known this guy for about a year now, having met him online via another friend. Over the time, we’ve gotten to be pretty good friends, we’ve shared a lot with each other, we talk quite a bit recently, and we’ve overall grown to be really close. Hell, all my friends love him, and even my bro is pretty close with him. 

For reference, he lives in Germany, while I live in the USA. As far as friendship distance goes, I’m no newcomer to it. I’ve been incredibly blessed to meet many awesome people over the internet, and the distance has honestly never bothered me that much. Hell, I was glad to have these friends, and having met these people at all. One thing I AM a newcomer to, however, is catching HEAVY feelings for someone online. 

It started off like a silly middle school crush. I felt butterflies when we would FaceTime, he’d been so funny and sweet. We would have playful arguments and take turns throwing stupid insults at each other. (That corny “I hate you” and “you know you love me” crap.) It was a friendship that meant so much to me. I’d honestly not had a friendship quite like it before. The lines started to blur between friendship and genuine attraction. But I didn’t want these feelings of...attraction. I know that distance relationships have hardly worked from friend’s experiences, and I didn’t want to get myself down. And let alone risk our friendship. So I directed these feelings out, pushed them down, ignored them, denied them, etc.

The more I tried to drown them under the water though, they only bobbed up ten times stronger. I’d become full on love-sick. I could hardly text without feeling overwhelming attraction and my brain just telling me “you have to be with this person”. I hated it. I would try to find so many reasons to NOT like him. For instance, I’d tell myself, “Nah, his smile is crooked. His haircut is bad. He’s got a boring personality!” 
Well I love that crooked smile, I adore that stupid haircut, and his personality couldn’t be more interesting. 

I eventually came to terms with the fact that hey, maybe I could give distance dating a try. Because if he did like me back, like hell I would miss that opportunity. After all, it’s not like I wouldn’t eventually be able to see him again. He would be so worth those thousands and thousands of miles separating us.

After debating for a few days, I finally decided to just tell him how I felt. I told myself over and over, ‘Rip the bandaid off.’

So I did. He told me he had complicated feelings about me. He told me he “didn’t know how he felt entirely”. He told me he liked me, but he didn’t like to get serious feelings for someone over a long distance. He told me that we just couldn’t happen. It would be impossible. He told me that “I would have to forget him emotionally.”
He told me I would find someone better. He told me he just wasn’t the perfect guy I thought he was. I explained to him that I didn’t WANT anyone better. That G-d knows he’s not perfect. Not even close to it. I want him BECAUSE he’s not perfect. 

And I’d mentioned before, I wouldn’t want you to be perfect either. I'm willing to admit I have so many flaws, so why would I stick myself next to someone who didn’t have any at all? Yes, you’re flawed. Who isn’t? You wouldn’t be the same if you weren’t. I wouldn’t have you any other way. 
Why else would I have told you all that shit? All that shit that I’ve only ever kept to myself.

But it was no use at all. It didn't get through to him. 

Great. I ripped the bandaid off, now the wound is open, and it’s bleeding all over the place. 

When he told me to forget him, did he plan on forgetting me too? 
I asked him this, and his response was, “I don’t know, I don’t think I can.” 

After that, we still talked a bit, but eventually took a mini break from talking to each other. Which was totally fine with me, I understood it was a lot to digest. Soon enough we started talking again though, and for a while I thought it had almost returned to normal. But of course not. I remember him texting me a simple, “Good Night &lt;3”. I replied with a “Gute Nacht! Love ya!” I was met with a text the next morning that said, “Don’t say ‘I love you’ please.”

It definitely affected me harder than it should have. I tell “Love ya!” to ALL my friends. It didn’t seem like anything that could’ve offended. I was so confused and sad. I asked him why he didn’t want me to say it, and he wouldn’t expand any further on it. 

I’d been trying to take his advice. I’d been trying to forget him emotionally. To convince myself that we would always be better as just friends. That we weren’t made for each other that way. I just remember thinking, “I hope it’s as hard for him to forget me as it is for me to forget him.”

Flash forward to today. He seemed a bit off, and I asked him what was the matter. He told me he’d caught such strong feelings for a girl, but felt so conflicted because she lived in Sweden. But he kept saying how he just ‘couldn’t get her off his mind.” And how “he just wanted to know, needed to know, if she felt the same way.” He told me how he, “didn’t even want these feelings towards her.”
Hah. Well doesn’t that sound familiar. 
Needless to say, I wasn’t expecting that. 
It burned. 
It burned badly. 
I pretty much broke down for a bit. 
He felt the exact way for this girl, that I’ve felt about him this whole time. And L-rd knows how fucking strong that is. How much that shit fucking aches through your whole body. How powerful that is. 
How. Fucking. Ironic. 

Pushing my personal feelings and grudges aside, I still talked to him about it, gave him some scraps of advice, and that was that. 

It was easier for him to forget me than I thought.

I feel a hole in me. A burning, sick, nauseous hole. Am I really that easy to get over? Had he lied through his teeth when he told me he ‘didn’t think he could forget me’? Was he just playing me the whole time? Never planned on glancing at me twice? Did you build me up just to tear me down that gracefully? All those sweet words, those playful flirts, teasings, were they all held with no value? 

I remember when he told me, “You’ll find someone better”
Hah. It seems you did so easily. 
Well fuck him, fuck his sensitive heart, and fuck that Swedish girl or whatever. It feels like a fucking joke, man. I feel like such a clown. Such a gag. I’m humiliated. 

I plan on still talking and being friends, hell, I don’t think I could ever paint him out of my picture, but man, it’s fucking painful. And I don’t know if it can ever be the same. 

Fuck. This. Shit. 

TL;DR: I caught strong feelings for a close friend, he had me thinking the feeling was mutual but it only wouldn’t work because of distance, and not even a week later he’s caught on a different distanced girl and completely forgot me.",lonely,Rejection has never burned so bad.

I wish I never would have gotten attached to him. I tried to warn him many times, but he ignored the things I said. I always try to warn people, but even though I have problems I want what everyone else wants.

I want friends, I want to fall in love one day, but it’s just so difficult because I have so many problems &amp; traumas from my past. I don’t think anyone should have to deal with my issues, but I just wish people wouldn’t even try if they know they aren’t in it for the long haul... it hurts more to lose someone than to have never met them at all. But at the same time maybe it’s my fault for even seeking out other people...  I know how I am, but I don’t want to live a depressing life where I just avoid relationships with everyone. 

I’m not trying to blame anyone for not wanting to be near me, but I just wish I had a normal brain. I wish I wasn’t hard to deal with. I really am trying... and I hope someday someone sees that and will stay with me. I just feel so unworthy of affection from others.

I know I need to get help, I know it’s my responsibility to make myself happy, I don’t blame anyone, and I am trying my best. I just pray that one day my best will be good enough, and I become stable enough to maintain relationships with others.

But it just hurts so much when my two best friends dumped me over the summer, most of the few friends I have left live hours away, and the one person, a coworker (24M), that I consider to be my best friend/favorite person, wants space. I am too intense, annoying, and codependent for his liking, I am too insecure and anxious of possible abandonment...and he never said a thing about it for months. I told him that I had these issues from the very start, and he seemed super understanding then. But he suddenly told me today that he doesn't want to text very much anymore, he doesn't want to hang out anymore for now, and he only wants to talk at work for the time being. My rational side says that it might be with the intent to build our relationship back up on a more stable foundation, but I can't help but also think he's just slowly trying to distance himself from me until he feels he can get rid of me. I know my abandonment issues and need for validation can be hard to deal with, we've both suffered because of them, but I asked him to *help me* overcome them. I asked him this just a few days ago, because I know this isn't something I can get through alone. Instead, I've been left with no one to talk to and thinking I must just not be worth the effort to help. My life has barely started and I already feel like I'm a lost cause. Maybe I will always be alone, because other people can't stand to be around me for too long. I can't even stand myself sometimes, so how could I blame them?

That what happened to me, I was in my final year of university in a relationship but from March onwards that fell apart. The relationship ended I had to move back to live with my parents and been diagnosed with depression. I went from having a few good friends that I see often to literally having no one, didn’t talk or message anyone and if I try I just feel like I’m just annoying them. When My depression came I didn’t know what it was so I message one of my friend and told what been going on and I was told that it could be some form of anxiety or depression and I had a little panic about it cause I didn’t know what to do. I was afraid to tell my parents about this but I told my sister cause I know she dealt with it as well so she told them that I may be going through depression and all my dad said was bullshit and that hit me a lot and my mum was kinda in his side too and because of that, I had to keep a secret to them that I was depressed once I was diagnosed. But later on I told my mum that I was going through depression cause I thought she would be a bit not understanding than my dad but I was wrong. she was ranting about what I should do to make myself happy and cause if that I left and went to my room, she came into my room later and I just shouted at her cause I was upset and that my own parents ranting about me what I should do to make myself more happy and not giving me support on what I’m going through. But luckily she came around and now I can come to her for anything.

I’ve been going thought this still but luckily I’m slow getting there. I’m taking antidepressant, I got a temporary job that I’ve been on for a few months and I made some new friends, but there are still days when I just feel lonely and don’t have anyone it’s getting better as I don’t cry myself to sleep but the feeling is still there. The feeling where I have no one to talk to and I feel like I’m annoying everyone I talk to. I know I can be better soon but it’s going to be a long journey.

Then the parties stopped, gradually. Lockdown. We couldn’t hang out, and the communication kinda stopped. (At least for me, I don’t know how much they talk without me). Went to a few parties (irresponsible, I know) at the beginning of the fall semester. But those parties stopped and our communication has been very scarce ever since and I just know that these girls aren’t my true friends. So I don’t want to spend more time trying to get closer to them or fooling myself that they care about me. 

I’m going to drop them. Gently. I don’t want to make enemies, I just want to make other friends who care about me (and I them), and whom I trust. But it hurts a lot to think of all the time I spent trying to make myself believe they cared more about me than they did. Looking back it feels like I was more of an accessory. Convenient. Someone to go to parties with (where they’d spend most of them time looking for guys to hook up with). 

This all sucks so much and I feel like I wasted so much time thinking we were true, good friends. I feel kinda pathetic. 

 I have another (childhood) friend and it took me about 20 years to realize that  she doesn’t care about me either. Maybe she did once but in the last years she just contacted me when she wants something or when she’s bored. I thought she was just extremely busy all the time (too busy too even remember my birthday! We’ve known each other ever since we were born!!!!). But I have no excuses left for her. 

Good thing is that I have a couple of childhood friends who DO care. So I guess I know what friendship is supposed to be like, deep down. 

So, starting 2021 with -7 friends . I feel like shit. I’m angry, but don’t know at who or what. I regret the heartfelt Christmas wishes I sent them (I mailed them all personalized xmas cards...a few of them said “Thanks”) and all the lame parties I went to that ended with them leaving with some stupid guy and me going home feeling miserable.

We talked about a week every day, every hour till 2-3 in the morning. We even had a date, even kissed on said date and held hands while I took her back to her car. After the date I ask her if she wants to go on another date some other time and maybe try to make something out of this to which she replies that she's ok with the second date but because of her past relationships she wants to take it slow until she knows this is what she wants. I agree and after another 1 or 2 days of talking a lot, she starts to respond like after a lot of time, like 4-5 hours even longer. I ask her if it's something i said and she tells me that everything is fine, she just needs some space and that i should let her miss me a bit. I honestly don't stress her out with meeting or talking a lot I just want some attention. Continuing on, I kinda left her alone for a couple of days and asked her for a second date to which she agreed but we didn't set anything (I'm stupid I know). So I leave her alone again for 2 days. Yesterday evening I write her again and we talk until like 1 o clock. I ask her again about the date to which she replies she doesn't have time this weekend but we'll see each other again.  I really don't know what to do at this point, I was hoping of meeting with her in the weekend to talk about this ""thing"" between us but I guess that's a no go.

I do not blame others for my mistakes and feeling of isolation, but I simply can not stand all this isolation anymore.I wish I talked with someone daily about simple stuff, like what I did in that day or what movies I had, about work.

I do not know how I reached 33 m and didn’t have a group of friends to hang out with.I slowly lost contact with my local friends from my hometown even since around high school. Then I started a college I did only 2 years of and didn’t complete.In my 20’s I was in a job hop and couldn’t keep a job for too long.I did finish the history college in 2018.I am close to finish my Masters too next year now.

I joined my history college at 28 yo in 2015.I honestly thought things will just improve socially at college.But anytime I was with my colleagues in a bar , they just made me feel worse. Not to mention just posting memes or having to come up a lit joke so I attract other people on Facebook doesn’t feel like much of a social interaction.Quite the contrary.

I worked in the last 9 months, although I still live in my small town.So maybe I could move to a bigger city from spring.Also, I worked from home with the pandemic and everything and I am starting to resent.I haven’t met any colleagues, nor bosses.If I move out, maybe I can improve my social life.",lonely,"I hope after I move out, things will get better for me",2021-01-07 05:40:17

Despite these facts, I have always hated my intelligence and hated the person I am because even after high school and college, I have not even kissed a woman.

I am so incredibly alone and have been for my entire life. I've wanted to experience a romantic relationship since I knew what they were, and yet I've made no substantial actions in life to obtain what I want. How is that not a sign that I'm pathetic? All I've wanted is to be loved and love others, but I can't even do that. My whole life I have tried to fix what's wrong with me. I know I look bad since I was made fun of for being a scrawny weak nerd throughout my childhood. Years at the gym and getting rid of my glasses have barely fixed any of that. I know there is something wrong with my personality since even after making these changes, people still hate me and don't want to talk or hang out with me. I am so broken, and I keep coming to the conclusion that no matter how hard I try, I'll always be alone.

3384,codecrunchie,1609952199,1,"Hello, finally something positive that came out of 2020, this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who **are** willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying** and have interests in **dinosaurs, minecraft or biology.** Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3500 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

Over the years the people I’ve spoken to either romantically or platonically have all gone on to experience some major life change shortly after we part ways. If it happened once it’s not a big deal but it’s become a pattern with almost everyone I’ve once befriended, even if the last time we spoke was a few months ago they end going through something really big, as if I meet them in a time of their life where I act as some “catalyst” or pit stop along their way to their final destination and yet when I speak to them after months or years they’ve had life changes and experiences and yet Nothing has happened for me or changed in my life since the first time I met them? 

Then I have to go on the socials and see their lives and it’s as if time works differently for them? People always say “a lot can happen in a year” and I see that happening to the people around me, people I once knew but for me time doesn’t change anything, if anything it just seems I’m living in an extended version of 2015 (the last time things changed for me) and I can’t help but feel like it’s always gonna be ME watching other people experience life while I’m on the side trapped in some unchanging and uneventful glass box never moving.

For some reason, people from the past generations (parents, grandparents) don't seem to understand very well that many people from the current generation who are in our 20s and 30s are not alone because we want, but because we are unable to find a partner. We are a misunderstood generation. Sure, of course I would love to have a girl at my side to love and be loved back. But you know what, dear father? I cannot. No one has ever loved me and no one ever will. It is not a matter of just ""wanting"" or not. If it were, I would not be alone. How hard to understand can that be?

I might be wrong, but sometimes I feel like they (parents, grandparents) lived simpler times, when loving someone and being loved back was a simpler thing. They cannot seem to comprehend why this generation lives in such solitude. The song ""Yesterday"" says: ""Yesterday love was such an easy game to play, now I need a place to hide away"".

My father got his girlfriend (who is now her wife and my mother) when they were careless 16 year old high schoolers. He confessed his love for her in front of a fountain. On the other hand, I know damn well that I will be in my 40s without having ever experienced love. I have never even held hands with anyone.

3394,chrissyannt1995,1609947314,1,"I was always an extroverted person. I never was the most popular or the prettiest, but people did like me and I made connections with people because I was incredibly open about most things in my life. In college, I started to make deeper friendships, meet more people, and feel more comfortable in my body. I thought though that college was still just a practice run. I was going to make the perfect friends on graduate school, where people had more aligned interests.  I still had feelings and pangs of loneliness through this whole time. I could gossip with friends and pretend I was having a good time, but then come home and cry feeling that no one would ever get to understand the real me. 

I moved to a different state to be in graduate school and the first year was one of the loneliest years of my life. And I wish I could say that it’s better, but it hasn’t been. I tried really hard to convince myself that I was happy - I was doing well in lab, I tried to have lunch or dinner with people as often as I could, and I tried to forget about the fact that I didn’t feel my closest friends would drop everything for me like I would do for them. In fact, the people who I deemed my closest friends would not make me feel special to them at all. 

When COVID happened, the act that I was putting up with my life finally fell. I started becoming lazy, not taking care of myself. I didn’t feel like I had to put the constant effort I put in before...and then I realized how much effort I was putting into everyday to just have a normal life. Since COVID I have been smoking and just watching sitcoms all day. And along with giving up the effort with myself...I gave up the effort to maintain friendships with the people from HS, college and grad school. 

Some days, I’m really happy. I sit and watch tv and it’s all I want to do. I mindlessly scroll through things, and I have freedom to take naps.  I try to exercise, eat my appropriate macros/calories, and clean+cook when I have good days.  I really enjoy the time I have with myself. However, most days, I cry because I can’t believe I’m 24 feeling these intense emotions of loneliness. When I think of my wedding day I think of empty seats and no friends as bridesmaids. I still feel like a 14 year old girl crying about feeling lonely, and that makes me cry even more because I really wanted things to change in 10 years. I am so used to my isolated routine, when I do reach out and talk to someone else all I can think of is when I can be back to being alone. I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I’m afraid to talk to my family since I don’t live near them and don’t want to worry them. 

I know I have to change my life. I have to start going back to putting a real effort into graduate school, and make the effort to be a real person. Everyday I say I will do it, and everyday it becomes so much harder.  If you made it this far, thank you for reading.

I feel so fucking alone in my endometriosis treatment. I am so tired of having diarrhoea each month, the nausea, the weakness, the fatigue, the dizziness, the slight insomnia, how down I feel, and it just happens all at once. I decided after I finished school end of 2019 that I would distant myself from friends who just they were the kind of people who couldn't comprehend illness. My best friend has IBS and other shit and they just criticised her. They use to criticise me because I was too weak to handle my period. The day I told them it's most likely endometriosis (you can't get a definite diagnosis until surgery) I felt like a fucking winner. They almost seemed embarrassed. I didn't go I told you so to them but they were just shocked I actually had a problem. Though petty, I felt finally maybe hey they will understand me more but no they didn't. Couldn't comprehend that my gyno was considering a laparoscopy, couldn't comprehend shit. I was told today the most likely scenario is that my bowels are fucking fused together or to the abdominal wall or have been incorrectly positioned by my endo. 

On Christmas Day I had pain and was so physically weak and tired and it was just oh you feel pain? My sisters fucking laughed at me. Why the fuck do I feel like I'm the only one that feels empathy right now? Respect that other people will go through shit I won't be able to understand. I just can't even eat anymore. I feel so alone in this shit of a journey, messing with my hormones, telling me there's a possibility of a diagnosis or someway they could ease my pain and then not let me sign the consent form to have a lap, the worst part is when someone says just deal with it, without even having a remotely similar experience to my experience. The only place I felt I was understood was on reddit, specifically r/endometriosis where people spoke of their endometriosis, people who provided me tips and advice, provided me support. It's the only place where I don't feel so alone in dealing with this shit. When I shat my pants at 3am and wanted to break down and give up, the first thing that came to mind was someone's message on reddit saying what to do if that happened. The reddit post explaining how to clean shit off your pants. I should've been thinking about the support my friends and family give me. I just feel so alone I have no one to text I shat my pants can you cheer me up. 

I started crying in the car today I haven't slept all week, my gyno appointment was exhausting and my dad was being just so frustrating and all I kept saying was I want to go home and play my games. Why, to the point I'm crying and obviously so tired and frustrated, that I am literally saying all I want to do is go home and do the one thing my period hasn't stopped me from doing, can't you see I'm tired of doing it alone? If my endo had been found out at a worser stage, I would've probably shut down by now. The scariest thing is I can see myself giving up soon, but I can't because I always think about the people on r/endometriosis and even though I'm thankful for that I really want to give up.

3413,sadthrowaway0001,1609928802,1,"Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to men on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with men on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

I feel so disgusting and I cannot believe I acted like this. I was so afraid and overthinking my own fears that I didn’t stop to think about how my actions were creepy, deceitful and harmful. I treated real people like an object, I didn’t treat them well - I was selfish and blinded by my own fears. I can’t forgive myself for this and I don’t feel like I deserve forgiveness. I want to disappear and start over. I can’t do this. Do I even deserve happiness and love and to move on? I’m so disgusting. If the people I catfished ever knew it was me, I just want them to know I never shared their images/chats. I want them to know how sorry I am. I want to tell them it was me but I don’t know if that would help the situation or just make it worse. 

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",lonely,I cannot.

It's been 10 months since I started working from home due to the COVID lockdowns in our country. Although I love spending time with my family, somehow I still feel lonely. At night, I miss having a different kind of connection. Sometimes, I suddenly burst into tears for no specific reason.

I do talk to my workmates online and I have some friends from school before whom I chat with occasionally but not on a personal level.

I guess I just miss having someone to share my secrets with. Someone who would ask me how my day went. Someone who would listen to my rants when my day is bad.

so, last year my former gf broke up with me, and ever before she did it i felt very much alone. we basically lived together for a year, and she left. two weeks later, i turned to dating apps to cope. had sex with some people. some of them actually became friends. loneliness never left, that emptiness was something that could only be satisfied by her smile, those beautiful little eyes she made when i told her that i loved her, her music, her jokes, those little dances she made when she liked the food i cooked... damn.

now i got a girlfriend. we've only been together for a few weeks, she's really pretty, and she's good to me, but... she's not her. i still feel alone. my friends usually come and see me multiple times a week, and a lot of times i fake interest just because I'm just unstoppably thinking about my ex and how could she be and how much i still love her.

i know I'm an asshole being that way, but i can't help it. it's been like that ever since she left. i just wanna forget everything related to her so i don't feel like I'm missing someone specific, someone who wants nothing to do with me anymore.

Hi guys, 

Over the past few months, I have lived alone is a huge house and my only human interaction was when a delivery guy would deliver groceries every three - four days. I have always been an introvert guy, not having many friends, and was labelled weird in high school (and bullied). Always good with tech though. 

One thing I realized is that reddit can help in times of loneliness, but its more about discovering ""your people"". Its about finding your tribe. Could be any shared interest or a unique habit that connects you to someone else. Its simply reassuring to know that others like you exist. Online, most of the time no one knows I am here, unless I comment like I am doing now. (Football helped me, and so did this sub)

There is this aspect for synchronous communication that can really help folks like me. Like you open a product, and it shows you content about stuff you are interested in - with a synchronous comment option to engage in real time. Being a tech guy, I am hoping to make one such solution, and need early users for that. 

Here is what we are building: https://app.getnoomi.com

3460,Historian_More,1609897819,1,"Dear all,
I write this for all to see but I only am speaking to someone in particular. Thank you for reading.

My pen pal, my companion, my dearest friend. I am so sorry. The words don’t exist to convey all of the feelings I have. I can’t say it enough, it hurts me so. I think about you everyday, all day. I miss you so much. Hearing your voice and spending time with you. I miss watching movies with you and staying up obscenely late just to be in your presence. I miss knowing that we were friends, when all else failed I had you to lean on and you had me. I really messed up, I was wrong on so many levels. It wasn’t only one day, it was a pattern of behavior born from my unwell mental state.

There is no argument that I am cursed with anxiety. It makes me alienate everyone I care about. I am petrified of abandonment, but each and every time I cause it. I just can’t believe I let it hurt you, the person I care for most, the person who I only ever wanted to make happy. My anxiety has cost me a normal life, a life with horrible self-esteem and profuse self-hatred. It has cost me the career I intended forcing me to drop out of the PhD program I was attending. And now, worst of all, it may have cost me you. I am so inconsolably sad. It’s hard to live with the fact that I said hurtful things to you and caused you pain. 

I hope you know I’d do anything in the entire world to make things right between us. Even when things were great, I’d do anything for you, all you had to do was ask. I desperately want to rekindle our friendship, I want to be there for you. Being in your presence was the best feeling in the world. I really like the person you are, the most genuine, kind, understanding and lovely person I’ve ever met. I also liked who I was when we spent time together. I need you so much, everyday. I still do.

Not hearing from you is like my personal nightmare. The truth is I deserve to be punished, everything I feel is deserved. All of the hopeless thoughts and loneliness, you deserve so much more. If we can no longer be friends, as sad as it would make me, I’d accept it as your wish. I only ask that I can say goodbye and hope that you remember me as the person who cared so much about you. I still do. I care about you more than anything, as much as one friend can care about another. That kind of caring doesn’t go away, it lasts a lifetime. 

I thought you could be my lifetime friend, I felt lucky, like I never wanted to spend a day where we weren’t friends. I know you are going through so much, you are fighting your own battles. I hope you know I wish I could help you, take all the pain you are suffering for myself. I wish my words could make a difference. I humbly ask for your forgiveness, to give me another opportunity to earn your trust once again. 

Over a lifetime you meet a few people that have an impact. You make legitimate connections with so few. We made such a connection and I just can’t bear to see it disappear. Remember, the universe gave us each other, I truly hope I didn’t ruin it. I am learning to cope with major anxiety and to keep it out of my personal life. It’s a struggle and I need you on my side to become the better person I want to be. I’m also learning to be a good friend since I have such little experience. Still, there is no excuse for not understanding. 

I don’t quite know why I decided to write this. I feel like maybe I needed to put forward a gesture, I don’t know. All I know is I miss you, I care about you, and I am in pain without you. To all the wonderful moments we spent together, I hope to lend you my shoulder to cry on or my company to share a laugh. Until we talk again, I will be thinking of you. 

Best, 
Joe.",lonely,I’m So Sorry My Friend,2021-01-06 12:50:19

3463,EatThatPussy0104,1609896481,1,"Not quite sure if Im even going to post this cuz I doubt everything I say but let's give it a try.

I really dont know my place in life. I'm 20 years old and feel lost and burnt out already. For the past couple of years I have been struggling hard with self doubt and hatred, low confidence and depressive episodes as well as anxiety. I never went to a psychologist or professional to get a check up or diagnose. Mostly I dont talk much about my problems with anyone. My closest friends barely know anything about what's actually going on in my mind. And I know that i sound just like thousands of others that struggle. That's why i normally wouldn't say anything about it. But I think that is a part of my problem. I cant talk anymore. Beeing around people is getting harder. I see everyone around me following their passions. Having things in life that excite them. And I'm just wandering around not knowing where to go and what to do. I'm pathetic. Seeing myself degrade more and more from time to time. Becoming empty. You know I'm trying my best not to mess up. And yet i still cant manage to do it right. Lonelyness is a huge part of my life. I have been on the search for love for many years. I'm seeing my youth passing by without any positive memory of romantic love. Generally I'm not the type of guy that girls get a crush on. And combined with my self doubts It was always real hard to find someone that might be interested in me. I have been following a girl for over a year. I felt a lot of love and empathy for her. In the end she fell in love with one of my closest friends. I am actually so happy for both of em that they found each other because they are just made for each other. But it still hurt in the beginning because I once again felt rejected. After a long time I finally got over her but I still felt lonely. Some time passed and then I met this girl in school. We didn't talk but after a few weeks I had the courage to text her. We got along quite well and met up a few times. We really liked each other. I have never met someone this beautiful in my life. She Is wise and smart. She is a poet and sings like an angel. We had so many similarities in our views on life. And she actually liked me. I experienced so much happiness. I finally saw my future coming together and had the feeling that my loneliness has come to an end. It felt like a dream. Sadly she is suffering from depression, anxiety, trauma and dissociation way harder than I could ever imagine. It was hard for both of us to get closer together. Emotionally as well as physically. We never held hands or kissed. When we met we had beautiful times together but were both really stressed out and worried about so much stuff that we often times just silently sat next to each other. We wanted to Express ourselves and emotionally bond but we just couldn't get it to work. Sometimes we didn't see each other for 1 or 2 months because we weren't able to meet up. In these times when I didn't see her I struggled a lot with self doubt. Worrying she might doenst like me anymore. She is absolutely perfect, she could have anyone, why would she even choose to talk to me. So many thoughts wandering around my mind so that I once I again messed up to just be with her. We always told each other that will get this figured out and that we will give each other as much time as we need. Her smile gave me so much confidence and trust. Last month we wanted to meet up. She couldn't make it on the day so we rearranged our date for two days later. But the day after she texted me that she couldn't do this anymore. She told me that her mental condition is really bad and that she will probably never be able to build a relationship. Also that she wouldn't want to hurt me, because she is sure that she will. It felt like she took away a part of me. My heart felt like it was shredded into pieces. I have never experienced this suffering. I felt so empty. Every day I cried for hours, griefing for my loss. I fell apart thinking I could never get out in the world again. Yet because I just moved out into my first own flat about 2 month ago i still had responsibilities. I knew that everything would turn out even worse for me if I didn't go to work and keep up with my obligations. It was hard but I just ran on idle mode. That's why I also didn't have much time to process everything because my days were fully packed with work either from my job or my flat. Only 2 weeks after our break up my suffering slowly faded away and turned into numbness. In the past couple of days she came into my mind more often again. I dream about her. I miss her. I really dont know who I can talk to anymore. As I mentioned in the beginning I kinda dont want to post this right now. I left out so many informations because there is just so much to say, and I am just not able to write this all down. This story is incomplete. Not worth sharing because there are many missing aspects that matter to all of this. But I feel the need to finally share at least something about this. I need to try to get some sleep now.

They are nice on the cover, but they are just simply not interested in knowing me better, so I only made one friend in that school during my five years here. But the problem is that we don't really have anything in common other than we both feel left out. The situation is especially painful because back in elementary school I had the most amazing friends, but during that five years they all have started their new lives, so I can't ""go back"" to them. I tried to make more friends in my current class, but the ones that I had always tought that I am ""insane"" when I wanted to hang out after school or something like that. Of course, after they realised that it's not that bad to have a social life, they always ""forgot about me"" when they were organising parties, pub-nights etc. So long story short now I'm lonelier and more depressed than ever before but in the same time I'm angry at my classmates and I want to show them that I can have the social life that I want without them.

3479,Comrade__Possum,1609889073,1,"I've always tried so hard to keep friends. I had one small group of friends in elementary school, a group of about 4 girls and a few random friends here and there. 
When I left elementary, I lost all those friends due to drama and my own mental health. 
In middle school, I was super depressed in 6th and went thru a severe rough patch and had absolutely no one. 
In 7th I came into the grade with high hopes and my positive attitude showed. I had a very large friend group with about 10 close friends and still a few acquaintances. I wasn't popular by any means but we were more of a group of ""differents"" that stuck together. 
By the end of middle school, I had lost all but 3 of those friends. 
At the end of freshman year, 2 remained. 
At the end of sophomore year, I had 1. And during that exact summer break, I found out that my one friend had transferred to a Christian school and been segregated from everyone she knew because her parents found out she was gay. I've been homeschooled the past 2 years. It's gone fine, and I've tried making two different friends in that time but each time something goes wrong and they aren't safe to be around anymore. 
So here I am. About to start college in the fall, and I have no one for any support. At this point, I am so desperate to simply date someone, have someone close.

Back when a simple ""I like you"" might have sufficed for a relationship to begin. But I never took that chance, missing out on the chance to experience and learn about romantic relationships and intimacy in my formative years. It's all on me.

Now, relationships are fucking complicated with so many things to consider, like jobs, desired number of kids, parental approval, hobbies, etc.

Now, I get that if a relationship didn't fulfill the above criteria, it would not have worked out either way. But wouldn't it be better to experience some form of a relationship rather than none at all?",lonely,I finally know why I'm so starved of affection.,2021-01-06 10:22:04

Anyways...I hate coffee, not that I hate it like I hate tea but I'm not the biggest fan of it, maybe I just don't know how to make good coffee, that's all. This is making me feel better. Thank you for reading me. I'm 26 years old, I think that's enough information for now. I should be eating, it's 5 pm but I had an apple at 3 so, maybe that's why I'm not hungry.   


Happy new years, everyone! Should I start writing here? I think this is not how reddit works but can it be done? It feels nice to think that somebody is reading you, somewhere, it makes everything feel less...lonely. It sucks to think that anyone can feel this lonely in a planet where 7 billion people meet and talk and text and call each other to know how are they doing. Does it make sense to say that I'm not alone in my life but I feel lonely? Hopefully it makes sense.  


I don't know what to talk to you about, it's hard to imagine that this is a conversation. I would love to read what you have to say. Do you like music? I was super into country music last year! Toby Keith and Brad Paisley were my top artists on Spotify. Right now I'm trying to hear more relaxing, soft ballads like ""I have never loved someone"" by My Brightest Diamond (which is the song I am listening right now). My back hurts, I think I've been super tense for the last 2 years. Have you ever felt like that? So worried about nothing but your body demands a hug? Hugging is the best. It feels great.   


Let's talk about food, shall we? Have you eaten anything good lately? It's not food but for christmas I bought this frying pan that doesn't use cooking oil and yet, nothing gets stucked or gets burned. It's great! I cooked my breakfast in it this morning, Ham &amp; Eggs (if interested...). I love ham &amp; eggs, it's simple and tasty. I think after work I am going to have quesadillar (I'm getting hungry now by just talking food, y'all!). By the way, I am sorry if my english is not good, I have not written anything in English in a long, long time. Actually, I stoped talking in English too years ago. Such a shame.

Yesterday I played guitar for my dog, he's name is ""Bombon"" which is ""Marshmellow"" in spanish. Even though I adopted him, he is still frightened of people. He was an abused dog and I can understand why he is scared of hugs or kindness at all. Talking to myself (or in this case, a computer screen) was harder than I thought. I think I don't really want to talk about me, I want to hear about anyone else who needs a good chit-chat. I would love to do this with a coffee (local coffee house works), I like the smell of coffe, reminds me of the good and sany days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I will make coffe today. Is that to crazy? I started this text saying I hate coffe and now I'm thinking in buying coffe on the way home. I should just go eat. What else can I talk about? Today I woke up in a cold, cold morning but my dog jumped to my bed and cuddle in my sheets so, that was okay. I remember I couldn't sleep so I played CNN (USA) 'till I get comfy. I did but I tend to dream about what I am hearing so I think I dreamed about Georgia elections (I don't know exactly what is going on, sorry about that...)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, that's pretty much my day. I forgot why I was so sad and lonely, I mean I am still lonely and probably will remember that tomorrow or tonight but my mind cleared up by writting. Thank you! I think I'm going to go eat and maybe I will go home early from work, there's no much left to do. I would love to read about you and your day, maybe we can be online friends! I'm up to it.

I was so afraid of all these new people, but we connected instantly, had the same interests and the same weird humour. We were extremely close until 10th grade. Then we graduated and went to college, the next two years we were in separate classes, which already impacted our friendship a bit. We talked less. Made newer friends. Then we graduated, I started my job exactly one year ago, and she went to Uni. We celebrated my birthday in Feb 2020 and... that was the last time I saw her.

She stopped texting me and the handful of conversations we had that last year was me reaching out to her. Asked her in July if she'd like to hang out, which she denied. Radio silence then. I messaged her on her birthday in october, wished her a birthday and said what a shame it is that she can't celebrate her birthday, cause covid restrictions got really strict again. She only said she would celebrate anyway. I wished her lots of fun and then she left me on read and I never heard of her again. Fucking hurts. 

I lost all my friends after graduating and can't come that close to anyone again. I fucking hate it how lonely I feel here in that shit little town. Covid makes it only worse.

And I can only think: Why? What did I do? Why did she leave me? Seeing her hang out with new people on social media is extremely painful.

Music video for this song was predictably sad to start but happy ending, about a lonely guy (who looks like an Orc for some reason) who ends up getting a girl and finding his lost dog... anyway, ended up triggering a massive sobfest of tears and snot that went on for like 10 minutes, all the while trying to keep it quiet so my dad didn't hear (I'm 28 and still living with my parents).  

It was just another painful reminder of something I've never had, and will never have, and it triggered a deep emotional pain that's existed since I was 9, but festered over the past year or so of total isolation.

Honestly, I don't even feel relief typing this out like I normally do. Just the pain of knowing this is all my existence will be.

However I was wondering if my problem and maybe the problem of a lot of people in this sub could actually be caused by Cognitive Distortions/Bias? 

For example. I sometimes feel like people don’t like me and that no one cares about me. There is  a possibility that my view of things is skewed/incorrect. Perhaps in reality some people *do* really show interest and care about me but my mind does not pay attention to them and only focuses on the people who don’t seem interested. The mind is a complex thing.

My therapist told me about cognitive distortions and cognitive biases. Sometimes what you think/feel is not necessarily the reality. Sometimes your mind/feelings could be distorting reality.

An example is the “Mental Filter” and “All or Nothing” distortion. A person who engages in these distortions will only pay attention to negative reactions of other people and ignore all the positive reactions from people. Which will inaccurately confirm their belief that no one likes them. (Confirmation bias)

But the reality is not that *everyone* thinks bad of you. The reality is that *some* people may but some people may have a good opinion of you. This is the distortion *All or Nothing thinking*. I was wondering if perhaps because of Cognitive distortions/biases we are creating a self fulfilling prophecy which leads to our isolation. 

For example because we only focus on the negative and ignore the positive perhaps that makes us behave negatively towards others and makes us isolate ourselves which further leads to isolation and keeps the cycle and belief going.

3520,preferablyanonymity,1609861857,1,"It's strange how for most of my life, I've been alone. I rarely felt like I was someone who needed other people. I liked doing things on my own, enjoyed ""seclusive"" hobbies, found satisfaction in my own company.

But it's even stranger how, in the midst of all this self-proclaimed self-reliance, I still sometimes find myself longing for a hand to hold. Someone to sit quietly with, or at times, someone to pour my heart out to.

When I go on social media, I see my peers go from one relationship to the next. Somehow it makes me feel all the more lonely. I am in my 20's, and I've never been on one single date. Never held someone's hand, never got to experience what a kiss would feel like.

Sometimes I can't help but think there must be something wrong with me. That I must be the problem.

And maybe it's true. Because I seem to close myself off to other people. I tried not to be like this, but it's hard when being alone is all you've ever known.

Maybe it's better this way. Save myself from hurt and disappointment, and save other people from that as well.

3530,IAmNot0rious,1609851085,1,"  I cant help but feel so lonely and unwanted. So a few months ago like aroubd mid September I decided to try and talk to this girl that I had a MASSIVE crush on for the past 3 years. For the next few days/weeks I really started to feel that maybe, just maybe things would start getting better. I even asked her friends what her interests were since I wanted to surprise her on her birthday with songs from her favorite band (One Direction), I spent months learning as much songs from their albums as possible and playing them on my guitar since her birthday was coming up (Dec 17) I wanted to make it special. Well that didnt really go all to well, a week before her birthday I asked one of her friends if I had a chance or a shot with her. And she told me how  K***'s standards were insanely high, and her type were foreigners and ideally british. To make things worse the day right after that she suddenly stopped talking to me. I don't know why, but I still held out hope that maybe I could turn it around, Ive never been the type of person to quit no matter how hard things got. But I still tried, my best I looked forward to her birthday and I really wanted to make her smile even if it wasn't in person. I was scrolling through her twitter and I came across one of her tweets that was talking about how sad father's day was for her and I realized her parents were seperated and that just gave me more motivation to at least try and you know do my part in trying to help her because if there's one thing im familliar with its lonliness that feeling that even in a roon full of people or even wheb you're just talking with your friends no one really gets how sad and alone you feel inside. A few days before her birthday she replied to my previous messages and well for a second my heart started doing marathon laps and it was just for a second. Her text said ""Nd Ive been hearing na(that) you have a crush on me"", I aplogized and told her that I should have told her sooner. And then she replied with ""But lol sorry I'm not interested""   and my heart dropped. At that time I tried to laugh it off and say that I knew how high her standards were and blah blah blah but I just wanted to curl up into a corner and cry. Whats worse is that she said that even her friends who I thought were my friends too I could trust to open up to about my feelings, found me annoying and didnt want to hear from me again. I threw my phone on the bed locked my door and cried, I know how dumb it is I know that Im too young to understand things that otherwise maybe easier for adults to get. But it's just that for once in my life things seemed to be so... Right, she made me feel great inside and when I spent tine with her or even just saw her smile I felt amazing. I didnt handle rejection well, ever since that night I cried myself to sleep if you know the book series Percy Jackson and the Olymipans and know about Percy and Annabeth, I read all the Percabeth moments every night and cry myself to sleep, even if its a fantasy Im reminded of something that could have been and I cant help but feel so alone. I tried to open up to my friends and they are a GREAT help but every night my chest just feels so heavy and I just tear up. All i ever wanted was to just give her a reason to smile, but I never realized that I- Id never get the chance too anyway. Now its 2021 and I have never felt so alone, I feel like my chest caved in and the only person who could fix it was gone. I don't know what to do anymore every morning i pretend that everything is fine towards my family but at night it just comes crashing down on me.",lonely,These past few months have been the worst for me,2021-01-05 23:51:25

The first women I truly ever loved was, and is, like no one I have come across all these years on this Earth. We were best friends before we ever got together, we were together almost all the time. As time went on I started falling heavy for this women, there wasn't a thing I wouldn't do for her. The way she would present herself, the way she would smile even after all the things she has been through, the way she smelled, the way she would love hard, her crooked pinkies(lol), everything about her was astonishing.

When we finally got together it was truly amazing at first. I started sleeping over basically moving in. When I would try to leave and go back home she would pout, honestly we both got use to being together all the time. It started going downhill whenever she would get mad about me going to go see my parents. I was always there to hang out with them because they don't have anyone here in Texas. My mom has what two friends and my dad has none. My big brother all he did was sleep after work so they never saw him. I felt like I needed to be there sometimes to just be around you know?  I would always try to get my GF to come with me and just hangout. My parents loved her and my mom and dad tried so hard to get her too like them. My mom's primary language isn't English so it was difficult and she tried so hard. My dad tried to joke around with her so she can feel like she is part of us. My GF however didn't like either of them, she didn't like my dad because of his beliefs and how he saw the world. Man forget that you know? She never could see past that and just kept talking shit about him. My dad is a great fucking guy and he came from nothing to where he is at now. It started going downhill after we fought on almost everything. Every one of those fights was the result of a conversation where I made a thoughtless, selfish, emotionally impulsive and undisciplined choice. It started going downhill whenever I would lie to her about stupid shit that didn't matter. It started going downhill whenever she would make fun of one of my biggest insecurities. I would insult her back probably shouldn't have. That just shows how immature I really was. I just felt like I was walking on eggshells every time I tried to talk to her as time progressed.  It started going downhill when I heard about her friends bashing my appearance and how ugly I was. As time went on I started to stop caring as in I stopped trying to better myself. I went into a huge depression and didn't love myself. I stayed like that until the end.

Looking back on it, I started turning developing narcissistic tendencies. I would lash out on her and take my problems out on her. Whenever she would try to communicate to me about a lot of things that hurt her that I did, I would shut down and not communicate. After finding out what gaslighting was I'm 100% positive I did it. She told me how she felt she was settling. She told me how she wanted to be treated and loved this went on for months and I simply did not change, looking back on it how big of a fool I fucking was. This women loved me so much and stuck to my side even though I was such a fucking loser and disgusting person to her. I put her through so much psychological and emotional torment, a relationship shouldn't drain a person and believe me looking back I definitely drained her.  Even today, I’m guilty of thinking back on it with fights about things that didn’t matter. Little, insignificant things we'd blow out of proportion.

One fight however was the breaking point. This happened in June, so close to her birthday. She was in the living room with my roommate and his simp and they were drinking and talking. I wasn't up for it so I went to the room and wanted to go too bed after working both jobs. Our puppy needed to go outside and I was already in bed so I assumed she would take her out. She asked me if I could take her out. I groaned and said why can't you take her out and she told me she has been all day. I then say you'd rather drink then take care of our dog. Fuck. I immediately regretted saying that, because she was right it was only fair. She then came into the room and started yelling at me raising her voice. I got irritated and said dude leave. She kept going and I say again dude leave. Again, still going and I said leave and put my hands on her stomach and pushed her away from me. She immediately yells dont fucking touch me and bam hits me on the head. I get mad and said more firmly fucking leave pushing her again, and she just started going at it. She started hitting me on the skull bruising her hands in the process after the fight the next day because she doesn't know how to punch. Coming down with hammer strikes and shit. I get up and say Im fucking leaving. I went toward the bathroom and as I was trying to get out she got in my way. I ask her to get out of my way and she said no. I grab her arms very hard to move her out of my way but she was presentient and just kept getting in my way. I just needed to leave. The morale of the story I shouldn't have put my hands on the women I loved. I shouldn't have been selfish and just taken the dog out and not make a snarky comment like that. I’m not trying to justify anything. All I have now is guilt and sadness. It wasn't the same after that fight. 

She finally had enough of the abuse and manipulation I put her through after begging me for months to change and me saying I would but wouldn't (i just don't know why I didn't wanna try) and called it quits. After the breakup I moved back to my parents and started sharing the dog we got together at the time every week. We still stayed in touch and would hang out still, go out to eat and what not. She and I both wanted each other to be part of each others lives still (i definitely didn't deserve to have her in my life). I start taking charge and started to better myself after we broke up. She would tell me where was this energy whenever we were together and again I stayed silent. Honestly I was doing it to win her back and to better myself all together.(she doesn't know that)

As time progressed it just became more and more distant and one week it was her turn to have the dog back. I was woken up by my parents and they told me I got to take the dog back because there is people here fixing the house. I immediately got up and got my things together and started going to her place. I left my phone at home so I couldn't tell her I was on the way but I told her beforehand I would be there in the morning prior. I still had keys to the apartment so my dumbass thought haha I should surprise her with the dog. That was a big mistake, I should've respected her boundaries and knocked on the front door. I opened the front door, and proceeded to her room. My dog and I made so much noise prior to coming in so I was sure she heard us. I opened the bedroom door and a non-existent hammer fucking hits me on the chest. I see her and her ex who she would talk really badly about don’t have a opinion on the guy don’t know him so idk but kept the pictures of them up together while we were together. She was never over him I guess. She immediately deletes anything of me when we broke up so I guess I prove my theory correct. I was always second rate. They were finishing or starting something that wasn't my business. I knew we weren't together anymore but doing things on stuff we got together it just hurt you know? Made me feel like I never really mattered idk I guess. This ain’t no pity party I fucked up first but damn she got me back. I immediately left and the immaturity kicked in and I blocked her on everything.

I didn't talk to her for about a week afterwards, I hurt myself during for unblocking her and seeing what she said about me and her likes. I then proceed to delete all my social media and when it was my turn for the dog back I reached out to her.  She came to drop off the dog and I told her how I wanted to talk to her. She agreed and we talked, I proceeded to tell her how sorry I was about stepping over her boundaries and walking in on them. I then give her the spare keys to her place off my keychain. I tell her how this is my last week with our dog and how I was going to let her keep her because I knew how much she loved the dog. I start to get overwhelmed with emotions then start telling her how sorry I am about everything I've done to her and she just stops me. She tells me she doesn't want to hear it and how she doesn't validate my feelings. I deserve that because I didn't do it when we were together.

During my week with the dog all that was going through my mind was her. How I should've improved myself earlier, how much I loved her, how much she tried to work things out, how I would do anything for her. So I reached out again during the week and told her how much I missed her and how much I loved her. I told her to not hesitate to reach out to me if anything happens or if she ever needs my help. She then proceeds to say ""Lmaooo so toxic, you decide to be kind whenever you realized I moved on."" ""I appreciate you saying that but I know your words are hallow"" and a bunch of other things how she needed to stop accepting so low for herself and how she was genuinely over me. I tell her I'll just stay out of your life. I brought this upon myself, I shouldn't have done what I did but I did. As my week ended with the dog I take her back to her place and didn't forget my phone this time and told her I was walking up to the door. We exchange the dog and as I was walking out she hugs me but it was one of those side hugs. Honestly I didn't deserve even that.

I still miss and love her very much but to respect her and her boundaries I should just stay out of her life. Man dude everytime I hear her name or drive past where she works I just get teary eyed and sad as fuck. I hope she thrives in everything she sets her mind towards. I hope she lives a very happy life and finds a man that gives her everything. She deserves the best and I wish her well. I’m just sad it wasn’t me.",lonely,Walking disaster.,2021-01-05 19:36:00

I want to try to make some friends I feel burnt a bit trying since people being ghosting on reddit. I wish things were simple but their not. I am keep trying to make friends but I know getting more is going to fix the problem. I looking for friends I can make who are accepting and understand I want to be accepted as I am. I felt I made one good friend so because she told me not to change which I felt was important because I not sure what my brother is doing and he is telling me to. Compliment girls but u feel their more like flirting and now how I am. So I feeling like I must be doing something wrong or something is making me feel I am the problem but i do feel it is the people I keep meeting. I don't want to change may be tell a girl she is pretty but nothing more since I don't want romantic relationship since I don't feel that way the other genders I don't want to say I can't change and not feel I coukdn't love someone romantic but i don't that will happen maybe if they were my best friend then I wonder if I would then.

3586,ihen_,1609820788,1,"I had a really bad day today. 

In the morning I had to get a drug test as required by my part time job, which is working with an autistic adult taking him out on walks. After arriving I was immediately very anxious because I haven’t been in a public building in so long. The nurse made me remove all my items from my pockets and put them in a lock box and then give them a urine sample. She was barking orders at me and I couldn’t understand anything she was saying because of her mask. This whole situation was giving me flashbacks from a time when I was arrested about 4 months ago. The tiny bathroom reminded me of the holding cell. 

After leaving the facility my car started to sputter and bog down, like it was only running on half the cylinders. The worst part is it’s not even my car it’s my fathers, and it is a sports car. I had to take his car this morning because my mom had an important appointment at the same time. Going up a hill I would lose speed and if I pushed the pedal more than a third the whole car would shudder and vibrate violently. The drive home was nerve wracking and I tried to coast as much as possible. But I made it

I parked the car in the garage and for some reason had the urge to rearrange some things in my studio. (I am a spray paint artist, and I use the garage as my studio) I have large boards I was no longer painting that I wanted to move to the roof storage of the garage. Without asking for help, I tried to lift the heavy wooden boards for about 10 minutes. I should have stopped, but I was stupid and ended up dropping one of the boards and it fell onto my dads car, scuffing some bright purple paint onto the side mirror and a bit of the door. By now I was utterly shocked at how stupid I was. I eventually was able to remove most of the paint, and I went inside. Pulling my phone out of my pocket, I found the entire screen was shattered because when carrying the wooden board it had crushed my phone screen in my pocket. 

The cherry on top was my sister. She loves to be nocturnal, sleeping during the day and up all night. I commented she woke me up last night when she decided to clear the dishwasher at 3am. She gave me the standard response she always gives, full of attitude and dismissal. I made the mistake of talking back to her, and you can never win an argument with her she will back talk you into oblivion. 

I figure everything is fucked with this day so I try to make plans to talk with my best friend on the phone. They ended up apparently having such a bad day also that they ended up rain checking me for a phone call.

I turned off my cracked phone and made a vow to skate to the liquor store and buy a bottle of wine and drink half of it in the park. Only when I got there the store was closed. It was 7:10.

I feel really shitty and can’t stop overthinking. I wish I had someone to talk to, and I can’t imagine how I am going to get my brain to settle down enough to sleep tonight. I guess I am just glad this day is almost over. Goodnight everyone",lonely,A bad day,2021-01-05 15:26:28

Its just a bit too much.
Im in my late twenties, Ive wasted almost all social opportunities I've had. I dont remember having a non-circumstantial friend (ie not a house mate, not a desk mate, not somebody I was paired with in study Group etc) and now I have only 2 people I could talk to. But I cant force myself to do so. Im suffering from depression and anxiety disorder, and although im on meds I still feel like shit. Just barely functional. People I used to call friends were around me only because I had a pathological need to be a good friend, to help them regardless of my own needs. Now even they are gone. My Best friend from uni promised to call me every day after I moved out. She never even messaged me, not once. Another friend, flatmate, promised the same and didn't even bother to reply to my messages. I kept telling them ""dont promise that, just call me once or twice"". They never do. 
My girlfriend broke up with me a while ago. She was working abroad, a temp job, just to make some money to get our own place together. She broke up with me over text, saying she needs to focus on her career. She promised to meet with me and explain everything, ""because i deserve it"". Apparently I dont, because its been like 6 months and she didn't even bother to message me, not to mention meet me. It hit me hard, I've gotten even fatter than i was. Oh, I didn't mention im disgustingly fat and ugly. I am.

I have never struggled much with suicidal thoughts, but it’s been overwhelming me lately. This morning I just kept thinking that I wanted to not be living anymore. 

My wife is fine, but she is very emotionally distant. She is also fairly judgmental and often gives the silent treatment. Since kids our intimacy has went way way down. 

I had a situation where I had a falling out with a long time friend. I no longer trust him and really don’t want to be around him. 

I have a few casual friends, but none that are super close. My closest friends in the office are female, so I’m not going to go down that road really. I have one in law that I’m fairly close to, but I often feel forgotten by most of these people. I don’t really feel like I have a place to fit in. I don’t have anyone to go to. 

I started taking some medication for depression, but I had to stop because the meds aggravated another medical condition I have. It was so demoralizing. 

I don’t feel like I have much to look forward to in life. I want more connections with people, but it seems the more I try the more I screw up. 

On the outside it may look like I have a lot of connections, but I don’t. When I was single, I always thought getting married would fix the loneliness. It hasn’t. It has taken away some hope that I’ll one day not feel lonely, though. 

I want to be the type of person that loves life and is so positive that it rubs off on other people, I just can’t. I feel so alone. I just want to give up.

My current fav is Cullen from DA: Inquisition. I know he wasn’t a total fan favorite in the previous games, but he really expands well into his role in the third game.

Being from the military myself, I really like his approach to things, how he looks at everything in the most practical light and executes his missions with efficiency. He also is enthusiastic and helpful. My time in service would have been much more fulfilling with more leaders like him in charge.

And for the romance, he is the complete opposite. Careful, nervous and sensitive. It’s so perfect and I admire his personality so much.

3620,the_lost_mind,1609804558,1,"I was very lonely for ages. No relationship, I had friends but they were more or less shit people except for one. 

My last year of high school I wasn’t there. I stayed at home. I wasn’t really sure why. I said I was ill. I think I managed to convince myself of it. I stopped caring for people. Would wait to enter classes myself. Would walk around myself. I felt like a walking depression basically. 

Then I moved to college and was on a high. I met lots of new people and was ready to be open-minded. The high lasted for the semester. I went against instincts I had about people for the sake of getting rid of this wave of depression. I wanted to grow. See who I really was. 

Semester was over. I came home. It all hit me. 

I was too open-minded. Too trusting. Too stupid, to say the least. People were bad and manipulative and talkative. I tried to change myself for them, rather than just toughening up and saying to myself - “these people are horrible, you are above them all, stay away from them all.” 

And I realised... the time I thought I was wrong for being lonely. That was the time I couldn’t have been more right. It was the time I worked the hardest, had no drama, no pain from others. It was the time my head was fully in check. 

So now. I’m gonna be myself.  Cut out the toxic people. Keep my one good friend. Work hard. I need to just get it in my fucking head that people judge anyway. I need to stop caring for their godamn opinion. I need to be more in control of myself and smart. I need to think higher of myself. And I’ll watch the difference it makes. 

Those who are still there afterwards are the ones meant to be. I strive when I’m on my own away from others. 

What I’m tryna say is. I wish I hadn’t of did what I did this semester. People might say “but you did nothing.” But for me it was a lot. And I just need to think “well, screw them. I’m not like everybody else.” 

So if your lonely. Stop caring for others. Focus on yourself. Be above your enemies. Reach your goals and don’t give a damn what anyone else thinks. I’m more clear headed than ever.

So as a fair warning, I was very selfish and recently took a vacation during the pandemic. I went to the Caribbean to visit my friend and I know it was stupid and selfish but somehow I talked myself into it. I’ve been pretty vigilant until my vacation but obviously the vacation wasn’t a smart or considerate choice. I understand if you are mad at me or think I’m a bad person, I don’t blame you at all.

Anyways while I was there I met a girl and had a great few days with her. We talked for hours multiple nights and we slept together a few times. She was beautiful and one of the coolest people I’ve ever met. She lives half way around the globe from me so we probably won’t be seeing each other again and I feel so empty inside. I got attached so fast for some reason, even though rationally it was so short and fleeting. Now I feel despondent and honestly heart broken

I’ve had a few girlfriends in the past, one for ~4 years and one for ~3 years and had similar feelings (obviously deeper and longer lasting) when we broke up. 

I have two dilemmas that I could use real advice with:

1) I’m starting to give up hope on finding someone who I find beautiful inside and out and honestly fear I’ll be alone in the long run. How do people get over that fear? 

2) I want to work on not being so devastated when a women leaves my life.

I feel like if I would leave somewhere without telling anyone, nobody would even notice.

There also this guy that I love. But I feel like he’s playing with me. And still, I can’t stop thinking about him and how much I love him everyday. This is so painful.

There’s also my friends hanging out with each other without even telling me even tough I told them I was available and that they could call me whenever they wanted. This is painful too.

I’m so hurt and so sad. I feel so lonely too, there’s nobody to tell me a “don’t worry this will be fine, I’m here if you feel sad, I can help you if you want. I know you will do fine”. Just a word of encouragement when I feel low like this. 

I feel so ridiculous to write this, but I feel so lost at the same time. I know that tomorrow I’ll feel better and I’ll think about what I’m writing right now and I’ll feel so ridiculous and miserable.

Everyone is the same to me anymore and it bothers me to even think that. I’ve lost all hope or faith and now all I believe in are actions and results. Proof. It’s clear to me that I’m not someone that anyone wants to get to know. To love. To believe in. To help grow. I’m forgettable and weird. I want to feel relevant. Purposeful. To know why I am here. To know why I see through THESE eyes. But, in retrospect, it feels like everything in my life led up to something... and that something is nothing. Like I missed my chance at living a life worth living. I’m ok if my life ended today, or tomorrow, or whenever. Everything in my life is settled and no one in particular would miss me. There’s no one who would go to my funeral. I don’t have family and my friends are coworkers that I occasionally talk to about things. The reality is that when I’m gone the only way anyone would know is that I get catalogued as a no call no show at work before being terminated for attendance and when my landlord shows up a month and half after a missed payment to my rent. I have no reason to be alive, to be around, to keep going, or anything. No purpose and too few joys. No one who wants to be in a relationship or, much less, just wants to spend a minute of their time with me. My last relationship ended in June of 2020 and the last thing I told her after she left me was that “I was lucky to get a minute of her time.” Such is my life I guess.

I started a discord server with the idea that those who just feel like talking to someone can enter a voice or written chat and just hang out with others who also looking for someone to talk to. The server has grown and there are many channels for different topics like sharing pictures of pets to venting about your day. There are some minigames and people often hang out and play simple games together or stream for each other or just sit there listening to music together.  
So far the server has become popular on the /r INFP and I thought maybe someone here would also benefit from this server.

3656,npc_strider,1609778175,1,"Venting some not-so-novel thoughts I've had about this upcoming year.


Point 0: I should probably get some more '''socially acceptable''' hobbies this year. I see a lot of advice about getting hobbies to hopefully develop friendships etc. but I guess it's not enough for it to be ""personally fulfilling"", but it must be both that and socially acceptable to work. I'm sure there's a better term for this than 'acceptable'. 


Point 1: I should start actually interacting with the real world some more. This relates to Point 0, but I do expect this to change by the end of the year because I will basically have to make these changes (no choice here, unless I want to devolve more) due to life changing factors. Right now, it does feel like a closed loop because I'm (relatively, by age) anxious and inexperienced, but in order to gain experience I have to start interacting more, but [refer to previous point]. Good thing I'll be forced to open this loop. Okay starting to ramble too much on this point...

*Oh and context for Point 1; where I live covid hasn't been a factor in the community for a long while so there should be no problem acting on this point this year.


Point 2: This year will probably have the most changes, so I better not fuck it up.


Point 3: Really hoping I find some love this year. Probably wont happen given the past, but again this year will have significant changes unlike the past few years. Not really sure if I'm deserving or worthy of love in my current state - even with that the chance right now is low, and I need to start improving on the above points to increase that chance I know it's not all probability, but a good part of it is. I can't the outcome of a nearly random event, but I can influence the chance so that's what I'll do. I would say my current chance is 0.1%, but really that's just a guess.


Point 4: Sorry if these points are jarring - I haven't talked to people in weeks.

Does anyone else use daydreaming to cope?

I’ve been doing this since probably around elementary school and I’m now 24. For the longest time, I thought it was just a quirk I had due to an (over)active imagination. Earlier this year, I came across a Wikipedia article for maladaptive daydreaming and I realized it’s an actual thing that people do. 

When I was younger, I was horribly bullied. It continued until my freshman year of high school. I had next to no friends and my school life was absolutely miserable. So, I started daydreaming as an escape attempt. In my daydreams, I had friends. I was happy. As I got older and matured, the daydreams became more detailed and complex. In the daydream, I don’t have a job so I’m not sure where the money comes from but I never worry about it. I live in a house with a big group of friends and I feel an intense sense of belonging. I’m always doing something with them, going out all the time. I’m happy, content. I have everything I want and need there. 

I feel closer to this fake world than I do the current one. And not because I have any issues actually distinguishing it from reality. I’m fully aware it’s not real. But I can’t help but yearn for it. I’m so unhappy in real life that I’ve created this other one as a coping mechanism. I have brief moments of happiness in real life, I have a couple friends that I’m not that close to anymore, and in the evening it comes back. 

I’m frequently late to work because of it. I haven’t been in trouble for it yet. I’ve been working from home since March because of the pandemic. My alarm goes off about an hour prior to needing to log on to my work computer and I hit snooze until i was supposed to have started work 5 minutes ago. Sometimes it’s because I’m just tired but most of the time, it’s because when I wake up my mind immediately goes to the daydream. I want more time to be happy, just for a little while. To get out of bed is to accept my day and resign myself to sitting at my desk for the next 9 hours working at a call center. 

Im having an especially hard time this morning. I logged on 6 minutes late and I’ve been sitting here doing nothing ever since. It’s been about 40 minutes and I haven’t gotten anything done. I’m not actually daydreaming right now, just mulling over what my life has become. 

Anyway...thanks for reading if you did. I know I probably sound pathetic or insane. Oh well. The pathetic part is true at least.",lonely,Does anyone else use daydreaming to cope?,2021-01-05 00:46:19

Also my parents got divorced when i was in still in school so idk why but they all starting to treat me differently.

Nobody texted me on 31st night, nobody send me ""Happy New year"" untill I wished them. From last 4 days I didn't received any whatsapp messages. After thinking for a while I thought all my best friends are fake they want me for fulfilling their own gap, they never cared for me. So now at this movement I had decided to not give any shit towards them.

I feel like because I’ve never had a close relationship with anyone that I have a lot of empathy problems. It’s hard for me to relate to other people, it makes me feel so sad and alone because whenever people try to befriend me I feel cold and distant. I don’t want to trust anyone else because I’m afraid. 

Lately though, I’ve been feeling like I don’t want to be so afraid anymore. I want to lower my guard and trust someone. I want try to relate to someone. I want to be someone who makes them happy, I want to write letters to them, watch shows together and always be around if they need someone to listen. I want to be someone’s light and a reason they smile, be that platonically or romantically. 

I really want that... but I am so scared because I don’t want to get hurt anymore like in the past. I’ve been feeling like one more heartbreak, or one more person walking out of my life might break me completely, even though it’s been 6 years since I’ve been close to anyone.

I just wish someone could be patient with me and teach me how to be a more empathetic person. I want to feel that closeness of truly caring about someone because they’ve bonded with me. I don’t even have a close relationship with my parents or any of my family members.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 months, but started talking a bit before that. He lives 2 hours away, but we still see each other almost every week for a few days and we stay at each other’s houses. The holiday made seeing him difficult, but considering we both were on vacation for a week we decided to spend the entire week together. 

Every time my boyfriend leaves, I get this completely horrendous depression and sadness. I can’t stop crying when he leaves. I should also note that I moved to my area in the middle of the pandemic and work from home. He is the closest person to me proximity wise, and without him I’m usually very much alone. He makes me happier than anything could, and sometimes everything else seems pointless. I was the most independent person before I met him, yet now I sob uncontrollably at times when he isn’t with me. It usually subsides after a day or so, but that’s only because I get to see him again. Today, since he left I have been a wreck. I can’t stop crying, I feel so alone. I look at the counter and his toothbrush isn’t there and I sob, and the idea of laying in bed without him or just existing without him is too much to bear. I’m not sure how to handle this feeling, and I’ve never felt it before.

My entire childhood and young adult life I feel like I have been treated like I am invisible. People never really seemed to notice me, and sometimes would actively go out of there way to not talk to me. In elementary school, I was always told I had ""an old soul"" and that ""I was so mature"" but looking back on it I think I acted that way because I could never really connect to my peers. In high school many of my friendships ended in rejection or abandonment. I was never texted first, I was always the third friend walking behind the other two on the sidewalk, and I was told to shut up and that no one cared. I don't hold any blame on them, but it still really sucks. I've had so many experiences like this that in college I find it very difficult to invest in other people, but I work really hard on trying to improve my disposition and ability to connect. However, the same issues I had in high school still happen in college. Even though I try to be kind and invested, my efforts just seem pointless. I am still the second choice. People do not seem to want me around. I have a family that cares about me, but I have a very unstable social life outside of that. It really affects my self worth. I am almost to a point where I feel like I am just a lost cause and will just have to be alone forever.

 Everything seems to be coming up roses. But my close friends know I'm from a desperately turbulent home situation. My sister suffers from massive mood swings as a complication from brain surgery and can cause massive arguments at the drop of a hat. My dad is completely distant and depressed from it all. My mother has been a severe alcoholic for almost a decade.

I have some other deep wounds from traumas I won't mention as I don't want to trigger anyone. But I'm desperately lonely sometimes and feel like I'm drowning in the madness of my life.

I've been in and out of therapy for years for what seems to be an unending struggle of me coping poorly. It's just really fucking hard. Today was fucking hard. This pandemic makes it all so much worse.

3740,EggsOverOzzie,1609732902,1,"I had a best friend. She was worth 100 friends. We would talk everyday about whatever. I'd tell her what I did that day, what I ate, what I wanted to do. She'd do the same. We'd talk about the dreams that we had while we slept. We would talk about the problems were having, our worries... 

Because her boyfriend didn't like that I was in her life, she removed me on Snapchat. She says we can't be friends anymore. And I have never felt so alone. 

It's been about a month since she left me. Since then I tried to have what we had with other people. But no one talks to me the way she would. Hell, no one wants to even talk to me, period. So I went on reddit. Dming lots of people only to be ignored. I haven't met anyone I clicked with as much as I clicked with her. 

I have a few friends, but none like her. I'm still trying to find someone like her. I'm awkward, weird, and annoying. A lot of people don't like that. But she not only accepted me, she didn't think those were flaws. She liked those parts of me.

Over the past few weeks I just haven't been myself I guess? I've been more lonely than normal. As I stated in the title, I'm always second choice whether it be relationships or friendships. I hate feeling that way because it makes me feel like shit. I'm never the first person to be asked to hang out or talk to. I'm almost always the one to initiate things and I guess I'm just tired of it being one sided. 

In the end, I end up feeling lonely as hell. Just going throughout my routine of a day work, school, gym, eat, sleep repeat. 

I know this sounds like I'm just seeking attention or being a selfish asshole but I'm not I swear. It's just one of the weekends where I've been left alone with my thoughts for too long and I've had no one to talk to about it.

Again I really feel like I’m selfish for thinking about this, and I’m trying to do better on it, but it just hurts, and I can’t help it. At the same time tho I also think that if I do get together with her at any point in the future, I’ll still be so messed up and I won’t be a good boyfriend to her, so that makes me want to try and get better, but it’s so hard when you have these late night thoughts, and you’re always hurting.

3746,SnooSquirrels6758,1609730778,1,"so I wouldn't say that I'm lonely per se but I have noticed that in my state and all across my country and broadly across the world there seems to be a situation where people are getting lonelier and lonelier, and that, if it were to befall us, we shouldn't be ashamed about it.

we need to make this a public and political issue. 

it should no longer be a problem that is to be dealt with via atomized individuals. 

I think there are four things that are making Americans lonelier these days, and if you're someone of another country or nationality, then feel free to wear the shoe. 

first to start I'm going to list off four things that cause people to bond and befriend one another: 

1.) centralized bonding activities 

((ex., everyone is canoeing, everyone is playing a board game, everyone is doing the same project, etc.) 

2.) what is called ""signaling"" 

((ex., asking some kind of question or wearing some kind of clothing that has people of a desired in-group noticing you.)) 

3.) symbiotic exchange 

((ex., having one thing but lacking another whilst needing both, and noticing someone who has this other thing that you have but lacks the thing that you have, thus you two can trade with each other.)) 

4.) free time 

((ex., not being overworked and having a free schedule, as well as the ability to go from place to place at leisure.)) 

... 

when I was much younger, and I didn't notice this until recently, these four things were the foundational superstructures that allowed me to befriend people. 

in other words the making of friends happens in good environments, this is why I feel as though the advice of just reach out to people is akin to the bootstraps advice that is often given to poor people. loneliness is not an interpersonal failing like many bring up, but rather a structural one. 

because, these days, more and more people seem to be 

(as well as more and more places, on and offline), 

noticing that public rec centers in community investment in meetup groups are dwindling as restaurants become more and more numerous. 

(""we tear down the playgrounds 

and build up the restaurants

just so we can get a cocktail

 that reminds us of the ground 

we used to play on.""

~ me)  

not signaling as much anymore, or being receptive to signaling, as many subcultures have become deteritorialized and

hyper-normalized


(ex., think of when you wore an anime shirt to school and you became friends the bunch of people, or how these days on tiktok there's this question of ""do you listen to Girl in Red""?.)

in many MMORPGs for instance they have become so streamlined and so pay to win that nobody needs to feed off each other in a kind of collaborative and vulnerable way, but rather they can just go to the in-game store, 

people are overworked these days in a way that hasn't happened for a long time in this country. for the past few years we've been seeing the rollback of workers rights, and a general culture that can't seem to combat it in response, for one reason or another.

… 

with all these reasons combined, my conclusion here is that I believe that the structures and contexts in which people befriend one another and make friendships are fundamentally being eroded away. thus, people are becoming more socially isolated. 

… 

however with all that said what are some other potential causations I could be overlooking? 

I want to make this a collaborative effort and I don't want to seem like the smartest person in the room. 

thank you! ",lonely,epidemic of Social Isolation?,2021-01-04 14:26:18

My ex of 13yrs was supportive and followed with becoming sober, then she came out in 2018 and life became much more lonely. 

I made a few friends over the past 4yrs while at university, but most of these friendships dissolved as Covid started to be another filter.

Nowadays I have this group of girls from university, but I feel like we never tried enough to expand our relationship outside of it, so basically the only things we talk about are work related. I have this other group of friends, also from uni, with whom I used to hang out and party a lot, but just that, no intimate talk or anything. 
Because of the pandemic I've hardly seen any of them, and I don't talk to anyone either. The girls I first mentioned, we have a WhatsApp group together but hardly anyone talks, except if it has to do with college stuff, and even though they've been for me at tough situations, I often feel we're more classmates than FRIENDS.

I can never seem to make friends the traditional way, I've only ever been in long distance relationships... I'm not some weirdo, it's not like I'm not a friendly or approachable guy, so why is it I only ever seem to actually meet people online?

&amp;#x200B;

Like the other day, I was talking to my sister about his boyfriend. There was a point in her relationship he started working far, so they'd see each other week on and week off. She considered it a ""Long Distance Relationship"". Me, having had been in an LDR for a year, said ""yeah, I know what that's like."", and she told me ""oh that doesn't count."". See, it's not like in said relationships, and even friendships, I've physically seen these people. Some of them I've only ever talked to through calls/video calls. It's sort of discouraging when people tell me that doesn't really count. People seem to increasingly think its weird my 'best friend' lives 500km+ away.

When I was kid, it seemed less frowned upon, I think? Not even frowned upon, but people look at you weird. I feel like a 15 year old vs a 25 year old telling you their in a LDR will bring two different responses out of the majority of people.

This is a silly vent, I realize I should just be happy I at least have people that care about me SOMEWHERE in the world... But like... I wish I could have close relationships. Someone I could physically see every other day. I wish I had friends I could just call up and head to the pubs or movies or whatever whenever I'm feel down. I'm not saying I don't value the relationships I have... they're just... different. I need me a squad.",lonely,never had a physical relationship... So does it even count?,2021-01-04 10:22:30

It took everything I was looking forward to away from me: my 18th birthday party, graduation, prom, my final HS theatre performance, my final chorus concert, my school trip to NYC, my summer vacation to the beach, and my first year of college. I was even set to host the school talent show, something I had wanted to do ever since I got to high school. Everything was destroyed.

It’s 9 months later and I’m still locked down, and things haven’t been going well. I got fired from my job for pushing back on their relaxed COVID policy. My roommates are total slobs, and the burden of keeping my apartment clean is constantly on my shoulders. My efforts to find companionship have fallen completely flat, and I’m struggling financially. 

Also, my close friends from high school have seemed to move on. The people I talked to every day don’t text me back anymore. I feel like a burden to anyone that does talk to me. I’ve been looking for a new friend group, but it’s nearly impossible under COVID. I cry most nights, hating my empty bed.

The only close friend I still have is my twin brother, who lives with me. He and I are inseparable, best friends. However, he’s tired of having the same lives as each other, so he went to find a community of his own, which he found. It’s made him so happy: he has friends he talks to every day, and has even made romantic and sexual connections through it. I’m so jealous of him, he has everything I want right now and I have nothing.

So last night, I walk into his room to get the phone charger I left in there. He’s talking to one of his friends over the phone. He says “Oh hey X, meet my twin brother Wadsworth.” Over the other end of the phone comes this gorgeous voice, the kind to make you melt. She says hello to me and we exchange niceties and a joke or two. Eventually she says, “Hey if you’re on Discord, hit me up. My username is ______.” I was so happy, so I was about to say “Yeah, sure! My name is _____.” But before I could anything my brother stated right at me with a stern look on his face and shook his head like “Don’t.” So I said/mumbled something like “Yeah, I don’t know. Maybe.” She then talked to my brother a bit more, told him that she loved him, blew a kiss, and hung up. I was standing there the whole time. 

My brother said to me “I would really prefer it if you don’t talk to her. Our worlds don’t have to be the same, I would like to have some connections that you’re not in.” I was shattered. It’s been a long time since anyone had told me that they loved me, or even called me at night. But being the total doormat that I am I said “Yeah, that’s cool, I understand. If she’s asks, just say that I have my own group of friends.” My brother knows this isn’t true, he knows I have no one, but he says “OK” and I leave. I immediately went into my room and broke down crying. 

I’m such a pushover, I will do anything to make people happy or to avoid a disagreement. If a friend agrees to meet and then stands me up for some bullshit reason, I always go along with it, because it’s better than losing a friend, even one that doesn’t care. I do everything for other people, and I get nothing in return. I’m tired of being invisible and alone. And I’m tired of all the other people in my life moving on and me being stuck where I am.

I’ve been trying dating apps and trying to find online communities that I get make friends in, to no avail. It’s disheartening and depressing. I’m not sure I can do this much longer. A bit of support would be nice, everything is so dark right now. 

Sorry for the long post, I hope it makes sense. If anyone does wanna talk, I’m from the US, I love movies and books and trivia/quizzes. I love acting (which I think I’m good at) and singing (about which I think the opposite). I love sports (watching not playing) and writing stories.

hi im Andrea.  It’s very difficult for me to be fully open with other people, mostly because I am from two different cultures  (have been 1/2 my life in one and 1/2 my life in the other) and so it’s hard to bond fully with people of either culture because there’s many things they dont understand. So I often come across people who have no idea what I am talking about and that makes it difficult for me to feel understood, which is why it’s hard for me to feel close to everyone. 
But regardless I have 2 best friends, that I am greatful for. 
The first one, is nice, but sometimes (very rarely) he says rude things that hurt me, so I like him but I keep my space a bit. 
The other one is just about the loveliest girl I’ve met in life, but she’s very busy and sometimes takes days to reply to me. 
I spend a lot of hours of my day alone, sometimes all day, sometimes my sister is around for 1-3 hours, my brother is almost never home anymore and my sister just really likes to be alone. That means the only voice i hear in the day is mine. My parents are not around. 
I dont need lots of friends or attention, currently i was texting a guy, but im not really sure what he wants from me right now, and i dont want to get hurt so i would like to start finding a new friend, mostly that wants to follow a similar workout routine as me and then we could just keep updating each other on it!

3837,codecrunchie,1609689901,1,"Hello, finally something positive that came out of 2020, this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who **are** willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying** and have interests in **dinosaurs, minecraft or biology.** Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3500 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

I feel like a fucking hypocrite because my friends are always asking me to hang out with them but I tend to reject their offer because I like to be alone. However, sometimes when I see them hanging out together, I start feeling left out and lonely even though I was the one who wanted to stay home. 

My friends are wonderful, and genuinely fun people. I like and care for them a lot but I just don't have the urge to get out to meet them. Or maybe I'm just lazy? I always feel so drained out after I hang out with my friends. It's not like I don't enjoy their company or anything... I know I'm doing such a shit job at explaining this but, I just feel so tired, sad and lonely afterwards. It's like no matter what, I wound up lonely either ways. 

It's confusing because I desire to be alone but at the same time, I feel sad and lonely even though I want to be alone????

I grew up in extreme poverty without ever meeting my biological father and only raised by my mother. Based on my circumstances, I should be pregnant, incarcerated or dead. Instead, I graduated college top of class and working for some of the best companies in the country. I ended up far more successful than even those who had all the right circumstances. But after seeing so many people become jealous of me for making it farther than them, I stopped sharing what I consider to be my successes. I don’t have anyone to relate to and share all these feelings of doubts, tribulations and merits. I always thought that money would buy me happiness and the life I never had but now I’m left feeling more lonelier than ever before.

I give myself to people, I show them that I care, I try to be the best person that I can be and that they need  me to be.

I want to be good, so damn good. I want to be that thing in someone's life that they are proud to have. That means more to them than any material possession they could possibly ever have. I want to give pleasure, to give affection and adoration, and be rewarded for my efforts with reciprocation.

What I get is people that see me as a device. As a toy to be played with and then disposed of. As a stupid plaything and not a service-oriented partner. I give, and get next to nothing in return other than a kind word here and there. As if that's going to sustain me. As if that's enough.

Nothing makes me feel as lonely as that moment where my efforts are rewarded by nothing. When I'm told I'm asking for too much by merely asking to get something in return, even a fraction of what I give.

I'm am happy that I can make other people feel valued and appreciated. I'm happy to lavish attention and praise on others, because they deserve to be told how amazing they are and how adored.

I just wish I could, for once in my life, find someone that would spoil me in return and then not get freaked out when they find out I want to keep them.

Fuck my naive optimism every time I meet someone amazing. Fuck my willingness to believe someone when they tell me they aren't going to leave. Fuck my ability to be won over by words, believing that actions will follow, that I should keep pouring energy into something because eventually it will come back to me. Why can't I meet someone that is available and wants to give me what I give them? Why do I always find the perfect person, and then find out they don't want me the way I thought they were saying they did? Why can't I harden my heart to this shit and just be a shitty person to others the way they are to me? I fucking hate that I still have the capacity to believe people when they spoon feed me the lies I want to hear.

3846,Alphamatter9,1609685288,1,"  I know this going to be a lot to read and I don’t fully expect everyone to take the time too but I feel like lately I’ve been feeling especially shitty and I don’t want to develop a chip on my shoulder or anything so I guess I hope sharing will make me feel a little bit better. I’m gonna start at the beginning of where I started feeling especially shitty and where I feel things started really going down hill. I’m also gonna leave out any details like names of people and even pets to try and keep this from getting to personal but I am gonna say the names of the places where I lived.

  The beginning of 2019 started with me living in Vegas working full-time and spending most of my free time with my girlfriend of two and a half years. She was going to school to become a beauty technician and we saw each other a couple times a week because she still lived with her parents and I worked 12 hour shifts driving a taxi. A little over a year before that my family had moved back to Washington state and I stayed in Vegas on my own to be with her, I really loved this girl more than anything and would’ve done anything to stay with her at the time. 

  Around the beginning of 2019 though things started to go down hill, I was constantly fighting with her family and at one point it got physical with one of them which ended up with us taking about a month long break. That’s gonna be a little bit of theme in all of this because ever since I was a kid I’ve dealt with having a nasty temper and a lot of emotional pain. Me and her never physically fought but with this particular family member he was constantly harassing us and on this particular night I just snapped. 

  So after all that we re connected and we spent most of the spring and summer together but that’s when I started to notice a lot of suspicious stuff and activity that was giving me major red flags. I ended up forcing a conversation that she clearly didn’t want to have and when I asked if I could see her phone she was super adamant against the idea. She knew the lock code for my phone and would be on it pretty often so the fact that she wouldn’t let me do the same felt wrong. I ended up fighting her talking to a couple different people and even sending nudes to her ex from years ago. 

  I still loved her though and after a long tearful talk she apologized and said she didn’t know why she did it. I tried to figure out what the heart of the issue was but she never really wanted to talk and had always built up walls. We gave it another shot after that and big surprise around the end of September we ended up breaking up.

  After this I was pretty upset, I felt like I had nothing and had seeked out a mutual friend to talk to. This friend was really close to both of us and tried to be supportive and talk me through it at the time. It wasn’t until months later that I learned that this friend had probably been seeing my ex for a while before we broke up. 

  I was pretty devastated but one of the worst things to come out of all this was that I had left my bird with her because while he was my bird he was given to both of us through her grandparents. We originally had two but one of them escaped and flew off so my bird who was left required a lot of attention. She wasn’t giving it to him and he ended up dying.  

  So life went on, I was depressed but I just kept working and even had another short lived relationship that didn’t work out either (honestly we just weren’t compatible). I felt pretty empty for a while and if it wasn’t for my few friends I had left in Vegas and my dog I probably wouldn’t be here to write this.

  Then covid hit and my job went bust, there wasn’t anyone visiting Vegas and I ended up loosing my job. I had been thinking about going home for a while and my dad said he would pay to bring me home and stay with him. This was a bad decision, me and my dad have never seen eye to eye and at this point I hadn’t seen him in over 5ish years.

  I packed everything up and he got a truck and we drove it up to Washington. My dad lives out in the country on a decent plot of land with a small pasture for cows. Over the next few months I quarantined at my dads, installed and irrigation system in his pasture, built fences, and got mentally wiped out. My dad loves to berate people and bring negative energy to everything and I had hoped maybe as he gad gotten older that he would’ve changed. 

  I was wrong and after about 4 months it escalated and I told him I’d had enough. He ended up raising his hand to hit me but unlike when I was a kid this time I grabbed him and pinned him up against a wall. When I let go of him and grabbed a wooden chair and bashed me in my leg. I walked away and after about an hour we hashed it out. I told I was leaving and apologized and he didn’t even say he was sorry.

  So I moved over the mountains and moved in with my mom. At thus point my depression was hitting astronomical levels but I still had my moms family and throughout everything I still had my dog. Things were starting to cone together a little bit and by December I had a new job lined up working retail. 

  Unfortunately at the beginning of the month my dog had to be put down after 15 long years of being together everyday. It hit me hard and as a response I threw everything into my work to try and avoid confronting how I was feeling. I could feel the loneliness creeping up on me though and despite being surrounded by people I started feeling more alone than I ever had.

  Now we get to the present moment, im on my last week at my job after being told that they wouldn’t be keeping any of the seasonal help. I understand that and don’t harbor any ill will towards the retailer I understood I might not get to keep the job when I took it. 

  As this last week comes up I’m starting to feel an immense sense of dread and unease. I feel alone and lacking of any emotional warmth and I can’t stop thinking of the past 2 years. I know there’s nothing I can do but keep on keeping on but sometimes it just feels so worthless. Anyways if you read to this point thanks, I know there’s not a lot people can do but I hoped by writing this all out it might make me feel better.",lonely,"The Last Two Years, A Long Read",2021-01-04 01:48:08

Things were looking really night with her, she was great from the way she smiled to the way she talked, but it felt like she didn’t want to put any effort into our relationship as I was the only one inviting the other out on dates I’ve the course of 5 months. I asked a countless amount of times to go out but she only decided to go once, and she brought friends. This had me feeling down about dating and relationships and honestly really isolated, so for the past 2 weeks I’ve been talking with my friends about how I feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness and they were genuinely helpful at first, however a day ago they all disassociated themselves from me saying ‘fix your shit or we don’t want any part of you’.

Tonight after I brought myself to climax I immediately felt so empty and lonely. I just needed to manually get the release done and over with. I'd been a raging bitch that evening. There are many unmet needs deep within my soul which ache constantly and lately the need for sex is the ache crying out the loudest. What I miss is being touched, exposed, admired, tasted, felt, savored, experienced, connected, charmed, submitting, devoured, explored. To be human. To be free. To just be myself. So I got it over with. Then afterwards, I called to mind some of my favorite memories and just cried. Not for missing anyone in particular or any one experience but just for missing the act itself. How beautiful it is to me. Just beautiful. How much my heart, my soul hurts all the time without it. Without a partner. I cried from a deeply wounded, hollow part of myself. I felt better afterward and then had to continue on with my night. That's just how it goes sometimes.",lonely,Tonight I broke down from missing sex,2021-01-03 21:41:04

3896,anonymous_muffin_,1609646144,1,"I've been painfully lonely and increadibly touch-deprived forever (I just graduated University and I've never had a SO or anyone interested) and the last 2ish years it's been negatively impacting my mental state in really bad ways. It's starting to get darker and I've been a hollow husk the last week where I'm starting to just smile, laugh, and converse on cue when I know it's what's appropriate for a given circumstance. I'm starting to feel numb to my emotions with only extreme joy or sadness seeming to have some impact. A majority of my emotions at this point are more of an act for others.


That being said, most of this 2 year span I've spent trying to improve myself to get a SO. I want someone who trusts me, loves me, and wants to hold me but I can't have that if I have trust issues, don't love myself, and am too pathetic to want to hold. So, I focused on trying to improve myself. However, this last week I'm starting to feel like a bad person for this. I'm purposely going after a SO in order to fill a festering void. I'm essentially trying to remove all of my unhealthy coping mechanisms and shove a human being in their place.


So, my question boils down to how do I do a patch job on this lonely feeling (that I can tell keeps getting worse and at least needs to be stopped if not reversed) while not going on the hunt for a SO as an objectified means to an end? (Sorry; I know how that sounds. I'm not some creepy guy who's like, ""If I just bang a chick I'll be all better""; that's not what I mean by objectifying them. I have no interest in sex for dating and can feel that the one thing I want is to hold someone who looks at me with nothing but love. However, finding someone to do that and fill that longing feels like I'm objectifying them and that's what I'm referring to).


Tldr: Things have been getting really dark the last couple of years because I am absurdly lonely. I've been trying to improve myself so I can find a SO to fix this issue. I feel like seeing another human being as a solution to a problem is inherently objectifying and I feel like a piece of shit for that.

I told her I wasn't and I thought she was fine with it, but Christmas day, she obviously wasn't fine with it.

3908,VeryEmbarrasedLoser,1609638524,1,"I am such a loser.

I hate my life.

I came to this app looking for support. That's what I got. People messaged me wanting to be friends. One by one they have almost all abandoned me. 

I dont fucking understand. If you don't want to be my friend then fine. BUT DONT SEND ME A DM SAYING LETS BE FRIENDS IF YOU ARE GOING TO ABANDON ME A WEEK LATER. Or be straight forward with me. Don't tell me you want to friends if you just want a short casual conversation. 

I had one person, who maybe they will see this. If you do, I'm sorry, I don't hold any anger towards you. But I feel so sad. We had good meaningful conversations after they DM'ed me saying we should be friends. Eventually then they said while I was an amazing person , they can't message with me anymore. Long story short, I said it was fine, and if they want to talk in the future great. It hurt though. And they then sent me a mean message and insinuated I was too talkative and repetitive and we needed to be done. Basically saying I need to shut up, we can't talk anymore. Now they have blocked me. I guess when they said I was amazing they were lying, I'm just a loser, just like I thought.

Another person sent me a similar message. They told me they wanted to talk with me. They did. We had long deep conversations. They were valuable. I enjoyed them. I liked meeting them. I thought they cared, until they never responded out of the blue. I waited a while, then sent them another message. I still have not received a response. I guess I wasn't worth the energy.

Some conversations don't even make it that far, sometimes people message me, and withing 3-4 messages they just stop talking to me.

I've still got a few people who keep up in my DMs. If you are one of them and happen to see this, thank you. I appreciate it. Even if you are one of the many people who ghosted me, or the many people who said we shouldn't talk anymore, I hold no anger in my heart towards you. I don't know what your situation is and I'm not here to judge. In fact I thank you for caring even for a second. What these experiences have helped me resolve is I'm going to stop trying to make friends, everybody has their own lives. Clearly I'm too much of a mental mess to be in them. By trying to make friends, I only set myself up for disaster, and disappointment.

To a lonely person with nobody to talk to, it really really hurts when this happens. I thought I had made friends, and since I have basically no other friends it meant a lot. Now they are gone. I've still got a few people who respond, but I'm so scared they are just going to abandon me too. If they do, I'm not talking to anybody ever again. 

I've been hurt too many times. It's not just oner persons fault. Even if it was I can't blame them, they all have themselves to worry about. But I'm not setting myself up for disappointment anymore. I'm not answering anymore DMs. I'm going to try to keep in touch with the people who still talk to me and hope they stick around, but that's it.

I know this experience isn't unique. Ive seen others complain of the same thing. I don't know why I thought I'd be any different. I'm just too naive

3909,frosttiptop,1609638181,1,"I have it all. I have a car. I have a scholarship. I have good grades. I have a boyfriend. I have a loving family. I have it all and yet it feels like I have nothing... Yea, I have a lot but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. My parents are borderline about to kick me out because I'm dating a dude that's a college dropout. I absolutely hate school. I have no friends. My car is about to break down, and I'm in the shittiest of financial situations.

I guess why I'm saying this is because it *seems* like everything is going great on the outside, but deep down I feel immensely hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to because if I talk to my parents it's about how I've done something wrong, like going to a state school instead of an Ivy league. I don't want to talk to friend because they have their own struggles, and I don't want to talk to my boyfriend because it's largely about how my parents hate him.

I feel alone, and the more I feel alone, the more my anxiety starts to creep up on me. The more I start losing the little control over life that I have. I start to panic because I'm unaware about if I'll be homeless the next day or if my test scores will be high enough. 

I'm fucking losing it, and the worst part is that it only gets harder. No, I'm not at rock bottom. School's only going to get harder. My parents are only going to get more angry that I haven't broken up with my boyfriend.  My car's only going to get in worse condition. And the student loans are only going to get bigger if I don't cut the small joys away in my life because of my parents. There's good to look forward too, and yes, that's all I have these days, but the thought that it only gets worse, causes me to just cradle up in bed and cry.

I lost weight, I dress better, I'm doing better (on LinkedIn, at least... in reality I spend almost all of my time alone at home with my family since college is online right now). To be fair, I don't see many people, but I've made sure to \~subtly\~ bring up the changes I've made in conversation with the former-ish friends from HS I talk to over text. And... people don't like me any more than they did before.

OK. But here's the hopeful part. I'm not really... as upset about it anymore? I've been home for a while, and I thought of it as a sort of cocoon period where I could return to civilization (meaning my university, mainly) as the skinnier, cooler, smarter, world-hunger-solving version of myself that I've always wanted to be. I've realized, based on interactions I've had since, that it may not happen like that. And I still feel lonely, and I still want a relationship, and I still want friends. (And I'm still bitter when I see two friends that I introduced to each other hanging out together when one of them, someone I used to consider my best friend, abandoned me a while ago. Not that anything like THAT has happened. Hahahaha... ha.)

But I don't care as much. Because I like myself more now, I really, really do. I still struggle with feelings of inadequacy when it comes to things like career aspirations, and I'm not saying I have some sort of Kennedy-esque social charisma because I definitely don't. But I've realized that it's not \*completely\* my fault that I don't have friends. So much of it is luck, and always has been. Maybe if I went to a bigger high school, lived in a different freshman dorm, grew up in a different neighborhood, or had some niche interest, I would have met more people that I stayed close with. Maybe if I went to the grocery store last night I would have run into the person of my dreams buying Chobani yogurt. But I didn't. Maybe tomorrow I will.

I'm not gonna say anything about how ""yOu HaVe tO LOve YouRsELF beFOre soMeoNe eLSe cAn LovE yOU"", but like, it helps to realize that attitude really does change things. I met with a high school friend recently and she told me I seemed happier. Mental issues aside, in an everyday sense, I was and I am happier. Despite having even LESS friends than I did eight months ago, and I had like... 2.5 friends eight months ago.

The thing is that I have always struggled to find people to whom I can relate or feel connected. I have friends and I even know a lot of people, but I still constantly feel alieanated from mainstream humans.

I’ve made the effort tried communicating with people through various social media apps but it always hits that point where I send a message and get no reply back after a brief conversation and then I wonder whether or not I should bother sending another one. To add to my stupidity I decided to go on a series of dating apps due to the fact that I’ve been single for almost 10 years now. How come people you know in your everyday life tell you that you attractive funny smart great to be around but that one person on a dating app looks at your profile but then moves on? What about the people that don’t send messages back or the people that weirdly block you after you send a nice message. I guess I’m just destined to be alone but it doesn’t help.

Every time I have been rated on looks it’s been at least a 7/10 all 20ish times. I can make anyone smile, I can make anyone laugh. Apparently she’s just a “naturally flirtatious person”, I don’t care if it’s true. The amount of flirting she did, I thought she woulda wanted to marry me(not literally just a bad joke). I cried for the first time in years when I found out, it sounds pathetic I know, but I can’t hide my feelings anymore. I fake so much of my happiness but she was one of the few people who could genuinely make me smile. So many people have called me “boyfriend material”. It’s outrageously flattering. I just want her to be happy, that’s all I wanted. I wasn’t mad she didn’t feel the same way, I was sorrowed because I felt betrayed. Betrayal is my worse fear and the person I was closest with betrayed me. All I do is get betrayed, first it was being beaten and pushed into that freezing lake like some 4 years ago. I’ve been threatened with a gun by my own brother for no reason. And when I told her how upset I was, she tried manipulating me out of feeling bad. I knew she was, but how did I? I don’t know. I have never cared more about a person than I have her. She said she really cares about me, but now I am not sure if I can trust those words anymore. She was the only thing keeping me going. I broke. Hell I didn’t break I exploded. I didn’t insult her or anything I just said stuff like “ Honestly I don’t think if I can trust you anymore. It’s a strange thing, you care about a person more than you do yourself. Then like a beetle turned on his back, I vulnerable.” and “ Kick a man when he’s down, it’s a funny thing ” when she tried to change the subject. I showed her my monster(I told her about my depression and suicidal thoughts) and I realize now, she’s a Trojan horse. She struck me once I was the most vulnerable. I’ve seriously thought about cutting off that entire friend group and Try moving on. I can’t forget her, she’s unforgettable. She hurt me more then she will ever know. She took my heart and stomped on it and and then fed it to a 100 pound Labrador named princess. She knew I liked her and she played me. She tried acting like she didn’t know what I was talking about. I then realized how I perfectly fell into her trap. I have a really bad tendency to go emotionally numb for a while when things like this happen, like for months. I was just gonna try to move on and get some girls numbers and talk to them to get my mind off her. But it would be unfair to in which I get numbers from.

The kind of loneliness I experience chronically, is hard to explain exactly... It's not so much a lack of human interaction (per se) as it is a personality trait(?)

What I mean to say is that it's like I've lost my basic human ability to connect with others. Like, I could have all the social interactions in the world, but it wouldn't help because I can't make genuine connections. At least not anymore. And my ability to do so is probably in a permanent state of decline. I'm like a fucking shell of a shell that *kinda* resembles a person I might've been once upon a time.

Anyway, I can probably blame it on the massive amounts of isolation I've experienced since, idk, childhood. With each successive bout of isolation chipping away at my sense of ""self"", and it just withered and withered until it was virtually gone. Today the result is that there is no ""me"" on the inside. Theres just a shell, wherein there exists an endless sea of nothing. Maybe that's too existential for some folks, but anywho...

There is no me. So when people try to connect to ""me"" they can't because there's nothing to connect to. It's the worst loneliness. Because I can't even keep myself company. It's just nothingness with a vague, gnawing craving to connect.

Then I suppose this wouldn't be a full account of my neuroses if we didn't discuss social anxiety. Because any shred of self I do have left I just lock away for safe keeping. Theres no way I can let anything ""real"" about me come into contact with the world. That would be far too existentially threatening. This cycle is self-reinforcing. The more I isolate, the more my healthy sense of self dissolves, the less I'm able to connect, the more my loneliness increases. Repeat into infinity.

So this ""exterior self"" I have is just the most non-genuine thing. That being said I can sometimes add genuine scraps of myself to my exterior depending on how comfortable I feel with someone, but for the most part I can't let my guard down.

My final refuge is in music. Because it's the only thing that reminds me that I'm alive. 

Anyway, I don't have a real conclusion here, this isn't a thesis, I'm just rambling off some jumbled jumblings. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn't, but I gave it the ol' college try.",lonely,Abject loneliness,2021-01-03 02:31:38

Apart me likes to be alone and has found comfort in it because I can always change that and fill my life with short and brief connections but I would prefer to be alone because I rather continue to establish that growing relationship with myself. Discovering myself. When the time comes, life will be filled with others who have done the same and has moved in the wind a while enough to come across another feather.

I have not had the joys that many people my age have had. For starters, I don't have a single friend in this world. All I know are a handful of acquaintances who will never initiate the conversation or call me. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I have never had a girlfriend. I'd go so far as to say with the solemnity of a monk that I've never even held a girl's hand. Not one to merely complain without taking action, I spent the year trying to be more social. I met numerous girls off dating apps (that are a drop in the ocean of the number of girls who ghosted me or simply weren't interested). But despite my efforts, it all came to naught.

At the end of the day, it is not so much the fact of my own failures that disturbs me. After all, one can always hope that next time it will be different and give it another shot like a mad gambler. Rather, it is the fact that I spent so much time and effort into being more sociable with, as one girl put it, ""zero return on investment"" that makes me awfully reluctant to try again. To quote Louis Ferdinand Celine: ""The sadness of the world has different ways of getting to people, but it seems to succeed almost every time.""",lonely,Tumbleweed,2021-01-03 00:35:42

3990,J_S_artboy,1609589421,1,"It's so damn confusion going on in my life rn. I'm 19M. Last year was really an eye opener for me, I came to know what my college/degree was actually worth... It's not gonna give guarantee for a sustainable future and it just doesn't makes sense to me learning those things that aren't teaching me how to live life ahead happily or to contribute something to the society which is the real reason why we exist! WHAT THE FUCK am I supposed to do with learning logic gates and binary multiplication when it's of nowhere near my interests and has a meaningful lesson to learn from it... 


In the lockdown I was completely shocked what the reality looked like in real. It's not about going to a well known college and then land a job which pays just for the bills and gives a lot of mental health problems while working on something which you don't understand and don't even like... and for that reason I'm afraid of my future... I don't feel like talking to anyone about it cuz most people just don't care, even my parents are not motivating to me whenever I try to talk about LIFE or anything like that in general... I'm left completely alone with things I've started learning during the lockdown period like coding, music, investing in stock markets, design and reading books that teach how to live and be self-reliant and it's just draining me emotionally, physically and mentally... It's impossible to live life happily by doing ordinary things in this EXTRAORDINARY FUCKED UP WORLD! You just can't! 

P.S - I treid talking about this topic several times in some mental health groups on telegram and joined couple subreddits and most people were very nice and Supported me a lot but that all fades away when physical reality hits, being around ppl virtually is not sustainable and it kida hurts my brain when I touch my phone again and again...",lonely,I'm lonely AS FUCCCCCCKK,2021-01-02 23:10:21
3991,leviOsa_,1609588863,1,"Loneliness takes upon many forms, for me.

Sometimes she dances around me, near transparent, almost forgettable. Then she'll reach behind the top of my sternum and pull. Quietly reminding me that, yes I'm not free of her yet. She takes this form when I'm with my best friend - I love him more than anything - but even then, it's not enough.

Other times, usually at work, she'll stand beside me, take my hand or just hover over my shoulder. She'll laugh as I head on my breaks, as I desperately try to get her to go away through meaningless small talk with coworkers. She'll jeer, warp my perceptions of things as I try to understand if my coworker sees me as something more - if he feels the same way I do. 

Earlier this year, in the worst of lockdown, she took all control of me, as I woke up only to play the sims 4, for twelve hours a day, avoiding the world as it crumbled around me. 

Today lonely is a rock musician. She's demands my attention and will do everything to get it. She screams into my head, spewing horrible facts and lies. 'You're not good enough.' Is a common one. 'Your only friend will be your emotionally-distant, unstable best friend.' Is another. 'You're still the same ugly, awkward person you were when you were 14.' Or she reminds me of the fact I haven't been on a date since I was 15 - I'm 19 for reference. She bangs drums and plays guitar, not particularly well, not enough for me to at least use the loneliness to write something raw and emotional. 

I've spent so much of the day trying to be productive and yet the moment I got home from doing errands, I was gone. She forces the air out of my lungs. Forcing me to a gasping mess of tears and sobs on the kitchen floor. I'll try to watch a movie. The rock music starts again. So I scroll, accompanied by a soundtrack of britrock. As I have been for hours now. Twitter. Reddit. Instagram. It all blurs together.

My friends are at a party right now. I wasn't invited because I didn't know a handful of the members well enough. I'm in my room, wearing a yellow tshirt, black jeans and sparkly eyeshadow, the slimmest I've been in a while. Such a waste of a good hair day.

I have given my entire teenhood to Loneliness. Watching my friends fall in love while I never have. Have sex while I never have. Talk about getting married - even if only in jest - as I never have. Going to parties and clubs. Making mistakes only to laugh about them the next day. Surrounded by friends they can depend on, by people that like them for them. I tend to befriend men more than women - the only downside to this is sometimes they only want me for my body or think my bubbly warmth is flirting (despite stating that I never feel about them that way) and expect something in return, regardless of how I feels. J, if you're reading this, I hope you fucking choke. 

Loneliness has taken everything away from me. A constant presence. Casting a shadow on tasks that I should be able to mindlessly enjoy. It's all I think about. I don't know what else I can do",lonely,Today lonely sounds like a rock concert,2021-01-02 23:01:03

The day after my birthday she texts me while I’m at work and tells me she’s feeling very anxious. I call her on my lunch break and she tells me she wants space and wanted to be single. I had to get off the phone but I began crying at work, the security officer gave me a hug. My boss told me I could go home early.

I meet with her in person that night and discuss things with her in person. The whole time she was super wishy washy in answering if she wanted me or not. We came to the conclusion that the breakup was inevitable. 

You’d think that would be it.

After she breaks up she sends me hearts and messages like we are still together. She asked me “so you’re still coming over for Christmas right? I still get presents?” 

I was flabbergasted. I thought you wanted space but you want me to come over and you’re still talking like we were together when you ended something I thought was so strong.

I end up taking her siblings presents and hers to her sister’s house and watched their siblings open the presents I got for them. The parents show up so the whole family was at the house except my new ex. I have a great relationship with her family. 

I get in the car with her brother to carpool as we had plans to hangout. I asked him why she didn’t come with her family. Her brother told me she was with her ex boyfriend (who is abusive towards her). That’s not called needing space. 

I became so enraged, alone, depressed.

I realized (and confirmed later) my girlfriend used me for sex (when she knew she was gonna break up with me) dumped me for a fake reason a day after my birthday, a couple days before Christmas, and all to get back with her abusive ex.

I feel used and thrown away. I don’t understand why a loyal man like me was left for someone who is abusive.  I gave it my all. I’m so alone again. Everyone that comes through my life ends up leaving me. 

Both her sister and her brother told me to block her and that she would someday try to get me back if she wanted me to. 

I have felt so down. So many emotions I never knew I could have.

I’ve never had a girl interested me in real life before. So, I was caught off guard that this person would continue to message me no matter what I said. 

Yesterday while talking to her...I believe I hurt her feelings when I inferred that it’s extremely unlikely that we’ll end up together. Not because I don’t really like her, I’m just not in a position to move to a different continent anytime soon. I’d probably need to visit a couple times first as well.

 It shouldn't bother me I suppose. Mom was never the maternal type. It is a head scratcher why they had kids.

 In any case dad has been gone since 2016 and mom is in prison. 

 We moved to the husbands hometown. I don't have any friends less than a two hour drive away. We talk on Facebook but no more get in the car and visit my friend Sky. Stuff like that.
 We were just settling in as all the Covid madness started. Differing mandates and stuff passed down weekly, sometimes more than once a week. (I'm in Michigan)

 The few attempts I've made ended in failure. One girl was a bit younger but she seemed nice enough..until I realized she saw me as a free babysitter. Don't get me wrong, I like kids. I also like my freedom which is why I've utilized the birth control options available.

 The other girl was my age and sadly had recently become a widow.
 I did what you do for people grieving. I made her a big pan of pasta. Chicken Tetrazinni.

 What I didn't take into account was the quarantine and she didn't know me from Adam. Or know what kind of kitchen I kept.
 Ok. That's reasonable.
Pushing the pan away and off the counter so I get steaming pasta down my pant leg and boot, not so much.
 Rather than apologize she just asked me to leave.

I don't even matter. I just can't comprehend it. I'm in so much unbearable pain right now emotionally, mentally, psychologically.

4033,4hilodendr0n,1609567726,1,"i’m 17. i lost all my friends a year ago. i thought they were better off without me so i distanced myself. they didn’t really try to stop me which i don’t fault them for. and the thing is, they are better off without me. that’s what makes it so hard. i’m attention seeking and negative and i lost my personality. the only reason i had these friends was because i was funny and outgoing when we met. when you lose those traits that make you fun to be around you become a burden. 

in september one of them reached out to me and asked how i was doing. i said i wasn’t really doing well and suggested we all get together. and we did, but the connection was gone. it was awkward. i tried so hard to be funny. i tried so hard to be like my old self. but ultimately that friendship will never be like it was. i think they sensed that and we only ended up hanging out for less than an hour. 

there’s nothing i can do. the loneliness is hard but i got used to it. but some days i realize how alone how i really am and it crushes me. i stalk their social media profiles and see them having fun with friends to torture myself. i dream about them most nights. they have completely moved on but i am stuck. 

the only thing i’m holding on to is the thought that i might make friends in college. but that is 2 years away and i doubt i’ll be able to make friends as a socially anxious shell of a person. and if i do it’ll end in me self sabotaging or them realizing that i’m a burden and leaving me.

(for your information we lived together for like 2 years) some days i came home and she wasn't here so i cooked, ate, dons the dishes and did everything alone at home after i came home from work. she didnt had a job or something like that, so i payed for her clothes and everything and she still gave me the shit everyday and gave me the feeling that i am responsible for every negativ thing in her life. anyway she told me she got herself a job when i asked her why she isn't home when i come home from work but in reality she was just banging one of my friends. i wont go to deep into detail because tbh its kinda giving me a really bad time at the moment. even if she fucked me up so badly i miss her and feel even more lonley since she isn't here anymore. she just took oof with her stuff yesterday after we had an argument.

“Social” holidays like New Years (or Halloween and such) where everyone goes out with their friends always make me depressed. I haven’t done anything for social holidays in at least two years. 

My boyfriend’s friends invited him to go out with them for New Years, but luckily he stayed home with me. However, the thought of being home alone by myself for New Years was absolutely terrifying to me. 

Today, (New Year’s Day) I’m avoiding social media because I can’t bare to see everyone’s fun New Year’s Eve events. It all just reminds me how alone and friendless I am. It makes me feel pathetic and unlovable. My birthday does this to me too.

4042,Horror1408,1609562455,1,"There’s this game called War of the Ring. It’s a war game where every new game is essentially a retelling of LotR, with one player acting as the Fellowship and Free People and one acting as Sauron and his Dark Army. It can technically hold up to 4 players, but that version of play is essentially just two different players on each side, acting as half of that original side. So it’s at its best when it’s just 2 players. It’s a fantastic game (my favourite game, in fact), and each new round has its own potential for fun and epic moments. Everyone I’ve played with agrees.

The one area I’ve found difficulty in, however, is the game’s complexity. Each game lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours, depending on how well the players understand what’s going on and how smoothly they can keep things going. The rules are the main problem; there are a lot of things going on during each phase of play, so the rulebook has a ton of little stipulations for each weirdly specific situation. This results in a good bit of manual digging each game. It’s not overwhelming, and it obviously goes down the more you play the game, but it’s still present.

It’s also the main thing that most of the people I’ve played with remember about the game. This results in it being very difficult to set up a time to play, with anyone I ask being weary of spending multiple hours of their time and effort on a game that they really only have a kinda fun time with. And that was before this year, with pretty much all of my friendships outside of the really close ones dissolving under the weight of social distance.

I only have a couple of people who are even an option to play with, and those people don’t usually have 2-5 hours to waste on a board game. I can’t even treat it like any other friendship plan, where I could set up and plan everything myself to reduce the effort required for anyone else; the game takes effort no matter what. So, what I’m left with is a game I love dearly and that I really want to play (I even got a new expansion before everything went to shit, which I still haven’t had the chance to try out), but that just isn’t ever an option.

I suppose it’d be easier to handle if I hadn’t already played the game with friends in the past, or if I wasn’t so absolutely enamoured by the game, or if the only barrier to entry wasn’t having one (only one!) other person to play with. I dunno. Just made me a bit sad.",lonely,My favourite board game just made me realise how lonely I am.,2021-01-02 15:40:55

the way i see it, that's not a good place to be: always running from yourself. running, running, running, running, running nonstop. that, to me, is even sadder than actually feeling lonely. at least we're feeling. it doesn't feel 'good,' but it's reality.

You dread whatever obligations there are, but other than that it's not a big deal. But this year was hard, because it was the second that I was basically kind of abandoned. I wanted ex/current roommate   to stick around because being alone on Christmas seemed like a big daunting bummer a couple months ago. Long story short, she left me kind of isolated to sleep off various highs. I wouldn't have minded so much if the same thing didn't happen last year and broke my heart. This year just served as a reminder of that and if I'm honest I did end up crying a little before going to sleep Christmas night.

Then last night, same thing happens, I just wanted to have someone around on NYE, and I actually enjoy New Year's Eve, because it's a license to cut loose and indulge and celebrate. I go at her door at 11;45 to pester her awake for midnight and nothing. I ended up sort of frantically messaging an acquaintance, just  so I wouldn't feel alone but the timing was off. Midnight hit, no one was around, no messages. I just messaged them and my mom ""Happy new year"" to be pleasant, turned off my phone and spent the next couple hours watching Netflix. Still half drunk, I decided to pick a bauble off my tree and pitch it against the wall just to get the anger, loneliness, and feeling of discontentment out of my system, but it turns out it was flimsy enough that I just had to press my thumbs into it and bored a hole in it. Turned on ""Auld Lang Syne"" and drunkenly toasted dying alone probably (Out loud).

I've never had the chance to be loved by someone. To truly care about someone and have them care back. I'm only 17 but sometimes... I feel like I've lived that long 5 times over. I'm just tired now. I can't put a smile on my face and pretend anymore. The ones that do care for me always leave. I just wanted to have one. To be cared for and accepted by someone. Recently I've found that who I thought was the love of my life (young love amirite) didn't even trust me. Fair enough she had reason to. But pouring yourself out to someone is hard to do. Especially when you don't get the acceptance and understanding that you were looking for. I feel weighed down by that fact. When you try and give your all only to have it returned to you in the end. When family is only a cold reminder of how dysfunctional and broken you are and you cease to see how anyone who is broken can be cared for. When you begin to feel the weight of it all settle on your heart like an elephant on an egg, ready to crack at any moment. Maybe I've finally cracked. I don't even know. All I've felt for a long time is sadness and pain speckled with brief moments of a false and fleeting joy. I'm not too sure what I feel now. I hope it ends soon. I don't want anyone to find me and help me anymore. I don't want to feel like a burden to those around me. I hope I can make it through.


To all those who understand any of that I'm sorry. And to all those who feel any of that I'm sorry. You were gifted with a heart that can be a bit too big for this world at times.

I did find someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We had our good and bad times, he was very sweet and everything I could have asked for, but then, one day something just went wrong and it was never the same since. He developed a porn addiction and me walking on eggshells, trying to please him just to keep him around, wasn’t helping. I tried my best to fulfill his sexual fantasies to keep him interested but it put me in a very bad place. We became toxic to each other.

I’ve learned my lessons about the boundary, but whenever it comes to him I can’t force myself to say no. 

On New Years Eve we had our last conversation. The last thing he said was that he’s sorry that we turned from ourselves for so long and that we shouldn’t be tempting each other anymore. I understood, agreed and let him go. Part of it is to punish myself. It’s been more than a year and it constantly hurts.

Ever since we stopped our relationship I find it’s difficult to connect to other people in a deeper level. Many people showed that they’re interested. At first I thought maybe because I never got a chance to spend time with anyone in person (due to the pandemic) but then whenever I went to hangout with people, I still felt nothing. Where all the meaning goes? I hurt many people by turning them down and it’s the shittiest feeling. I couldn’t keep doing it so I stopped seeing people. 

Does my heart really close off? Does my heart still hope for a reconciliation? Have you experienced something similar? How to fix it? I want to stop pushing people away and be happy again.",lonely,I feel like I can’t connect to anyone.,2021-01-02 08:57:01

We would often get into arguments and fights.when the relationship ended, she came to me and we mended our terms and started talking again.
It felt nice being an introvert to have someone to talk to, who cares about you. But soon, due to another fights she found out some dirt about me, I had lied to her about drinking (I told her I drank some alcohol after diluting, but actually I consumed it neat). I had some tendencies to feel depressed. So now she said she couldn't trust me again, and I felt that it was justified and we stopped talking/being friends. I spent the next 2.5 months trying to distract myself as I was still really attached to her. After 2.5 months, I mustered the courage to text her and apologize and asked her if we could be friends again, promising I am trying to change and to a very large extent, I changed. I stopped drinking tendencies and started focusing on academics to distract myself. She said that we could be friends but the things will not be same. This was in August. Fast forward to today, January 1st, we are on good terms (atleast I thought so) but I started feeling like she was getting distant. So I asked her if I did something or she forgot about me (I was slightly angry) and why was she being blunt and sending single worded replies, to which she replied that she told me that things won't be the same and that meant inconsistency in texts and talking. I feel like all the memories are coming back again. She said that we could still be friends, but I don't know how I feel about that. She was my only friend who I could talk to, but now I'm not sure I mean anything to her. It sucks. Being lonely is bad.

Our relationship was fantastic and we’d just moved to a new city together to get away from her childhood trauma. She still says she loves me and that she was happy, she just felt like she had to go. She’d just started therapy and now feels like she has to do it all alone. We’d taken care of each other for 7 years. Now we’re both all alone in a new city with no friends and now without each other.

4137,AdAdditional8499,1609518919,1,"I've realized how easy it is to fall into depression when you aren't doing anything productive or meaningful with your life. For the past three days, I've been starting my mornings by reading my book, walking my dog, and then going to the gym to work out for about half an hour to 45 minutes. This morning, I've decided that I'll take a off day from the gym, although I haven't gotten around to reading my book yet, and I've realized, like shit... When you aren't doing anything with your life, you feel pretty shitty about yourself.

So after I post this, I'm going to pick up my book. And after I do that, I'm going to walk my dog and then go to the gym; because If I don't go to the gym today then I'll feel like complete shit about myself for not having accomplished anything. One thing I learned from this 8 month psychotic/depressive episode of my life is that having a routine is imperative. It's what keeps you going. It's easy to succumb to depression and loaf around your home all day doing nothing but staring at a wall or television for hours, it's too easy to give up, but there's more to life than what's making everything seem hopeless and meaningless. I mean, I have yet to experience the good moments that are out there waiting for me as I'm slowly but gradually climbing myself out of this rut, however, I know they're out there. I've realized though, I can't just wait and sit around for those moments to happen, I have to be the one to go out there and try. You aren't entitled to anything.

You have to be the one to find your purpose in your life. Try new things, visit obscure places, pursue interests and find new hobbies. You have to make the life you want for yourself. I wish I understood that a couple of years ago.

Growth comes at the cost of great suffering. It's pretty fucked up but it is what it is. If this episode of my life never happened, I would've still had hair on my scalp, and a vibrant sheen to my skin. But if this episode of my life never happened, I would've never grown, I would've never learned these crucial life lessons. Be true to yourself yall. I wish I knew that. I put my needs before others for so long, it costed me my health. It costed me years of my life, time that I'll never get back. But I mean, hey, I'm only 20 years old.

Ive gotten help and stayed at hospitals but even then i get better for a bit and i end up falling back down. The person i loved is the same person im still with but im absolutely over it. I just want to disappear and run away.. it’s exhausting trying to work it out when i put all the effort in it and get nothing but a “ hey” and “ i love you”. It means nothing to me now and it sucks to put all the time and effort on things when its for nothing in the end. Past relationships been nothing but full of people i wish i never knew. From getting groomed as a kid by a older person i looked at as a friend to getting beat up by someone who didn’t give me the time or day. Home life is where i was neglected the most to getting kicked out 3 times around the ages of 14-now.  From getting verbally abused by my father and getting isolated and hidden from family. Self worth is my biggest struggle and body dysmorphia is another one of my problems. I just want someone to be able to look at me as a person please don’t pity me and give me a reason to feel like i could still make the most out of it. Losing my mind in a tiny room just wanting to have a piece of mind and someone to hold me. Just tell me i still have a chance at life i dont want to keep attempting or hurting myself. But i think it’s something that might happen because my mental state is declining and im slowly not being able to function in society. I need a doctor :/

I did end up breaking up with the person i was with and decided to get help. Getting better is a long ass process and it sucks when you dont have supportive people around. For those of you that have people that support you please value them because you never know what’s fully going on. I wish all of you get your problems resolved this year or the years ahead💗.

I don’t know about anyone else, but I really don’t feel like I’m being heard when all people say is the generic “you should just be happy” line. It’s the equivalent of sweeping trash under the rug. The trash is still there, just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean that it went away. Burying these feelings just makes me feel even more isolated from everyone.

4166,somelunacy,1609496495,1,"I greeted the new year with a heavy heart, a clouded mind, and teary eyes. I'm confused and lonely. I'm aching for something I can't seem to have.

A week ago, an old friend reached out and said he has a brain tumor and probably had only a few months left to live. He said he loved me, and still loves me. But he's with another girl he also loves. I don't blame him and his choices though. I chose my ex, who wanted to take me back, over him. I can't just expect him to sit around and wait. He deserves to be happy too. But I just can't help but think it could've been me.

That ex broke up with me again, for good this time. He couldn't handle the distance anymore. And it sucks but I've accepted it. 

Two guys treated me like shit over petty things and it has fucked me up. I took things to heart. And it sucks.

I seem to keep jumping from one guy to another, aching for something. I'm not even asking for something book or movie worthy, just someone to hold my hand through it all. I have love to give, I believe I have a lot to offer, but no one to give it to. I want to be loved back, I want to be appreciated, I want to be comforted, but alas, there is no one. 

It's not a coincidence, nor an accident. It's a pattern and maybe there's just something wrong with me. 

""What do you think about giving that thought and energy to someone you could invite to court you in person? I think you need to find someone closer to you for a relationships. For personal growth reasons"" - exactly what my ex told me last night.

I don't want the guys here, from where I am. I don't share the same values and beliefs they have. We're just not on the same wavelength. It's shitty I know, it's bad at its finest, but it's true. They don't understand me no matter how hard I try. They judge me instead. They're even scared or intimidated by me. They tell me things as if it's my fault no guys dares to want me. ""You're too smart"" ""you're too strong or independent"" ""you're too scary"" so? I won't change myself just to please a guy I wouldn't even want. Why would I waste my time like that. I want someone to like me for who I am, genuinely.  It's either I'm too much or too lacking. I'm never enough. 

I'm painfully lonely. I'm depressed. And I just want someone to be there for me. I want to love and be loved. I'm trying to be independent. I'm trying to be strong. My family and friends love me.

Does anyone else wish they had a loner friend? 

Like let me explain like I wish I met someone who was like me, in terms of loneliness. We keep each other company and have fun together. Go on road trips, face time, be patient with each other, do all the fun things friends do! Go out to restaurants, parties etc. meet more people together???? 

I just want a bestie I can tell my goals to, send memes and TikToks to. Just have someone to do things with. Wish someone will take me by the hand and be my guide. Sometimes just wish I had my person whether it be a relationship or Bestie. 

I just feel comfort in thinking it’s never impossible.

Anyways

Because of my situation I can’t really meet new people as I’m sure of as a lot of people bc of lockdowns and COVID. But I am hopeful for the future. I’m sure I’ll meet my person

a terrible person, and i admit it. i don’t deserve any of them, they were too good for me. i took them for granted and look where that got me. here. in pain. lying in bed each night thinking of duppy, strawberry, prinzi, sofi, i can’t seem to get them out of my fucking head. i miss them but i don’t think it’s best i reconnect with them. i want to so badly at the same time. it’s just the purest fucking pain. 

it’s just.
an empty void of thoughts. a knot in my throat in stomach, and i did i this to myself.

i can’t find people like them. they were special

strawberry was always so happy and cheerful, we could play minecraft together for hours on end and never get bored. we’d used go on to the pokémon website and send each other plushies and items we thought we liked. she was so nice to be arround.

sofi was just, really nice to me. i didn’t get to talk to her much but, i enjoyed her. she wanted to be my friend, she approached me first and that means. just more than anything in this world.

prinzi was supportive in everything i did, we were close, he understood what i was going through. he always lended me a hand when i needed one. wether that be in a game or when i was suicidal, he was there.


duppy was just, so funny p. i remember laughing so hard at one of her jokes. we would talk a lot, she was one of the people who replied to my good morning messages but that may just be because we’re in the same time zone. i loved her art, and still do. i miss her the most, she was the “funny one” in our friend group. we had plans on streaming with each other.


these people i just told you about made me want to wake up, sometimes the pain goes away but it always comes back and will stay for as long i haven’t tied the loose ends. i just want some advice i just need advice. i have nobody to go to about this. i just miss each and every one of them so much",lonely,i just want someone to listen,2021-01-01 19:48:43

We got along really well and she seemed really interested in me. We started playing playstation together after work and as we got to talking, flirting, etc. she just casually mentions her boyfriend. I felt so crushed, I didn't even really have a response. I just made up an excuse and turned off my playstation. I just feel so stupid, like I read into things that weren't there.

2-3 years ago I deleted all my social media, I opened an Instagram today because I wanted to see what kids my age were doing so I can put myself out there but social media is as cancer as ever, I was so disappointed 
I didn’t get any of the jokes, all the jokes revolve around sex and they were all repeated versions of the same joke.
The other “Jokes” were about women hating guys saying we’re replaceable. I commented “You must hate your dad” thinking she wouldn’t even see the comment then she commented a paragraph but I stopped reading after I saw she said I was a fragile male or something, how does 5 words tell you all about me?

I noticed something called tik tok is really popular but they really allow 14YO and under to twerk and stuff? And when I looked at the anime community some stuff was alright but what I’ve heard in a nutshell is drawing underaged boys sexually is ok because they’re gay? I don’t understand that and it seems gross. 

And the stuff I did find cool or funny was “offensive” even though Most of the stuff wasn’t at all. There was a meme about “pretty privilege” and people got upset because “pretty people have insecurities too” why the fuck would I ever feel bad for the 1%? 
There was a dark meme I found funny but people in the comments hated it.
Basically everyone’s mindset is “If I don’t like it, it’s bad and erase it” even though the other half liked it.

I woke up early today because my crush wanted to tell me something, I was well excited about it tbh and I couldn't well I was waiting for her response, I've spent the majority of 2020 talking to her, practically sacrificing my entire relationship w my family members and completely deleting my social life, it hurts but I had her arnd there for me when I needed to talk, I didn't want to get clingy but I loved her soo much. No words can describe it and she was the only one who was rather close to me in the sense that majority of my social life was js me trying to work out my insecurities.

&amp;#x200B;

I've given everything away for you, for us...and now you say that you love me as a friend, I understand..I can't ask for more than a friend but I dreamt of something so much more, so much better, it's hard to stay in this freakish nightmare, in a world where all you are valued for is the amount of economic growth you can provide to the nation and to your family...where you are forced to take up streams and systems that you dislike for the sake of someone else's welfare, Love is what helped me feel better, feel less empty, now without you, I feel so lifeless, my face has lost it's smile and there's nobody I can tell it to, you check my reddit and I have to post it here because I have no shoulder to cry on, I didn't expect this to be how 2021 started, Without you by my side, I've lost everything..my connections, my friends and my family relationships, no one talks to me anymore because I'm too hung up on my screens, it's the only way I can get respite from this world where I'm forced to follow cultural norms, where I can't speak out for myself because it's disrespectful, Where I'm forced to hide, lie and cheat because I need to survive. With you by my side, texting to you..changed all of this, it made me feel better, It made question less and enjoy the beauty of the smallest of things, If you're reading this Alligator...I don't ask much from you, I understand how you feel and I realise we can't be together in the sense of a relationship, in the sense that this isn't your style.All I'm asking from you is to be a friend to me and someone who I can talk to, Time flies and I have to move on no point crying abt it, I know this is the second time this has happened between you and me, But I've realised my mistake, I shldn't get too caught up w you, it's time to move on and this time I mean it, I hope we'll remain as friends, but I'm going to miss that faint feeling of sheer joy and happiness when we chatted.

4253,gaichouu_,1609466857,1,"So, I’ve just been thinking about what one of my friends said, and honestly it makes a lot more sense why do many people are uninterested in me. They just think I’m too nice to be a straight man. It makes some sense I guess. It just makes me so angry that compassion is just something that is only able to be seen through a man if he’s a homosexual. And I’m assumed as such just because I show compassion. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being gay, but that thought just makes me sad sometimes. It makes it very hard to pursue girls in person(specifically) because either they have to be super attracted to me, or I’d have to put on a facade of hypermasculinity and “toughness” to even be considered attractive. I feel like my compassionate and super energetic personality is just a turn off for so many people. Not just that, but I’m also a plus sized man who also is black, so I believe that I’m not necessarily considered desirable. I just know how skinny people are romanticized and loved much more than my body. It’s just so much easier getting someone to like me over text than through in person interactions. I feel like the loneliness I felt manifested in itself and I tried to find love in other places as well. Like I tried to go onto things like Reddit and discord to find the validation I never got from other people in real life. I’ve been shamed by my parents for that and even was threatened with the idea of being disowned, but I still think it was at least kinda worth it. I finally got -some- validation at least. 

I’ve been trying to lose weight so I can finally look desirable to someone, but I have no idea if that’ll ever even be enough.


One other thing that bothers me is the fear that no girl would ever want to be anything but friends with me. It’s scary to think I’m gonna he alone forever, and it’s started to develop an inferiority complex.

Eventually I just stopped messaging her. Felt like a chore for me and a burden on her. I guess when/if COVID goes away I should go to bars or clubs or whatever but that’s really not my scene. In an ideal world a girl will just message me but that’s not going to happen. I need to go out more, just put myself out there I guess. But that might not even happen because of COVID. 

I just wanted to vent, thanks for reading, if you did. Message me please, either if you want to get to know me, or you’re just lonely yourself. Anyway to sum, my life’s okay but fuck it am I bored of being on my own.",lonely,2021 will be my year,2021-01-01 12:23:24

There are some people that I talk to, but nobody that I can really consider a close friend. My worse fear is living like this for the rest of my life. But how do I get out of this cycle? There are still covid restrictions in my state and once again, another semester online. Maybe, I'm just making excuses but its easier for me to make friends in person, rather than online.

4292,THr0aWAY2079,1609456563,1,"Excuse the lonely, potentially alienating vent, I know it’s not going to come off great. 

I’m so tired of hearing from people that romance is all about what’s on the inside. That looks don’t matter. I’ve heard it all my life. Just like how all my life I’ve heard how wonderful I am, how sweet, how kind, how funny, etc. And yet, how many relationships have I had? Hell, how many dates have I had? None. Zero. 

None of it’s new, but I just had to vent. There’s a girl who I’ve seen on some of the dating apps that I kind of know irl. We’ve never met or anything I just know OF her because we work in the same industry and I’ve seen her. Always thought she was super cute and when I saw her on those apps, I was excited to swipe right/like (you get it). Didn’t match, but I told myself she might not have seen it or a million other reasons. Then I saw her on E-Harmony and we have a high compatibility score. I sent the like (whatever their version of that is) and watched as she read it and then ignored it. Look, the other apps are severely based on looks, but platforms like that are supposed to be based on personality and compatibility. There was objective science saying we’d be a good match, and I couldn’t even get a conversation going. 

To be clear, I’m not hating on that girl, she’s just the springboard to this vent. I’m not even mad at the women who ignore me. I’m mad at everyone who acts like relationships aren’t at least started by looks. Sure they won’t last without the personality, but to act like that it’s possible without good looks is fucking lying to themselves. It almost turns into toxic positivity and hurts worse when nothing happens.

Back story, I got married at 18 to FIT with people around me, It wasn't love but we liked each other, It lasted 5 months, I couldn't handle it and it's where my Depression and Loneliness came from, and It's not his fault, He just didn't show me the affection and support I needed and still need. 

Today I opened up to my so called ""Friends"" about my depression and how I feel so sad and lonely and how sometimes I think ""what the point of living"" and they laughed at me, Said It's my fault that I'm lonely, and few triggering things ( called me toxic, said I abused my ex by being too depressed, and the classic! ""just be happy!"" ). I just couldn't handle it I right away got in my car and started to sob, how no one here gets me or understand being lonely and depressed is real!

I'm writing this after crying myself for hours, I feel so ALONE. people here never get it, having too many people around you in public setting isn't a fix for being Alone &amp; Lonely. sometimes I wish I was born in the US or EU, Maybe I'd have people who understand THIS. 

everyone here think since I'm financially secured, then I shouldnt be sad, but money doesn't bring happiness, I learned that the hard way. I feel so alone and I don't know where to go from here. I guess welcome 2021 where I'd still be feeling sad &amp; alone.

We all struggled and fought the exact same thing, we were lost, disconnected from the world, alone, left out and sad. Some of us could most definitely feel this way right at this very moment, and i would love to see what you guys have to say about your lives in the comments

This year was most definitely the most difficult year for me, i felt like i was so alone, i eventually became depressed, i did alot of stupid things i wish i didnt do, and my parents lost all trust in me. 

i was broken down, mentally unstable and i was a wreck, i found many ways to make the sadness even worse, i went through many relationships that i thought were gonna last and unfortunately i was right. I listen to alot of sad music which made me think of alot of those relationships.

I met a girl im april, her name was Chelsea i was so in love with her, it felt amazing, i was so happy with her until i fucked it all up and she decided to leave me

I met another girl, her name was sarah, we were in a really toxic relationship, and decided to be friends after the break up

I smoked weed for the first time this year, with sarah and 2 other friends... It was the worst experience ever, but i decided to do it again, at home 3 times and my parents caught me, i was extremely broken and hopeless and tried to find anything to get away from the situation i was in at the time. 


I decided to tell my mom everything that happened this year, this was in July. I was grounded for 2 months, with no games and no phone

I met new friends and as hard as it was i cut off alot of toxic people in my life, i met these really cool people, and i hanged out with them for a month... they made feel happy again. 

There were 2 people who really stuck in my life for the rest of the year, their names were Tristan and Christine. 

Tristan is my best friend since 8th grade and Christine was someone i never expected to find.


These 2 people helped me through everything, and i mean everything!!! 


Christine and i have been dating since the 17th of December, she make me so happy, but there has been alot of ups downs, but we're strong and i believe we will go far, but no promises!!

4326,kindacoping,1609448040,1,"I moved abroad for college this year and because of the pandemic have no New Year’s plans.
I’m really far away from home so I can’t celebrate New Years with my family.

I don’t really have friends here and the two people I do speak to here come from Christian families and are from here so they are busy today with their families and I can’t even ask them to spend time with me cuz of that.

My friends back home said they would come and spend some time with me but only one of them showed up but she was sleepy and it is already past midnight where I’m from so I told her it was ok for her to go to bed.

My other friend who said he would come spend time with me has been drunk and high with his friends this entire week and simply hasn’t shown up at all, even though he said he would.

My crush tried to spend some time with me but she’s also really popular and has a lot of other friends and she went away to talk to them after spending like 10 minutes with me.

This is the first ever time I have had to spend the holidays all alone, and not even having someone to talk to online or over the phone, being in a foreign country, and dealing with this pandemic are making it really hard on me. 

I’m trying so hard to keep myself together but no one seems to understand or even want to understand how tough this is for me. 
Everyone else has their own problems and I keep saying “I understand” or “it’s no big deal” because I don’t want people to feel I’m selfish and unsympathetic or disrespectful of what they’re going through.

But it’s so tough and I feel like I have zero support here and I just wish I were home so in the worst case I could hug my parents and play with my dog and sleep.

I know the clock will turn midnight here and I’ll probably get a wish out of formality by my classmates but there’s no one who is actually going to call and wish and I’ll have to just say happy new year to myself knowing everyone else is asleep and my friends never showed up though they said they would.

I’ve no idea how to convey that I’m struggling and it feels like every time I do try to convey it I feel like I am dismissed by them. And yeah everyone has their own lives and I really don’t want to be needy but at the same time this is so tough to deal with and I’m struggling to stay strong.

Wish there was a way for me to stronger and not be this affected by these things but they do affect me and ugh I just want to go home. 

Sorry for the rant but if any of you are in the same boat, or just in general seeing this, I hope the new year is amazing for you and that there is a lot of happiness in store for you.
I hope we can all have a happier, healthier 2021 and learn to cope with our loneliness better and feel more self-sufficient, I guess.",lonely,Spending New Year’s completely alone and away from home and crying right now....,2021-01-01 07:54:00

Like I honestly thought they could become real friends after a few days of talking, and when they stopped responding out of nowhere...fuck, it really fucked me up. Not because I had some future of great friendship planned for us. I just thought that I was finally connecting with others and that they might have felt the same. But to have it confirmed that it was just another failed attempt or one sided interest, that’s what stung. I just want a friend that I can talk to every day at any time and feel like I’m not bothering them or I’m not some burden or that they actually like me as much as I like them. And it’s really disheartening to get slapped with the reality that I’m truly alone. I know I sound pathetic, but I’m literally sitting here alone crying as I type this because I have no friends.

4370,ElegantStatus529,1609428006,1, i don't even know what having a crush on someone feels like. i'm in my third year of high school and never even had a date. am i depressed or just so lonely that people feel bad for me? i don't even know how to express how lonely i am. i just want someone to love me and cuddle me. please help me. this child needs help from everyone he so lonely. p.s. i 5 ft tall nerd in a fluffy potato blanket and this was not a joke. i actually want advice. first level of lonely: im lonely. second level: i dont have words for what i feel. third level: pls help. fourth and final level: mentally and psychically numb. i am at level 4.,lonely,"pls, want advice",2021-01-01 02:20:06
4371,memiruu,1609427879,1,"Im full of self hate cos i feel like im full of flaws and insecurities and i get jealous of others easily because they are liked so easily even if they dont put in much effort into relationships or friendships woth others but i put in my all and i still get nothing back

And it sucks that i have this friend whos all about ""dang im so likeable"" ""am i that popular"" and like honestly i know she doesnt mean anything by ut but like cant she keep it to herself?? like ok its nice that youre like by everyone 🙄 but spare a thought for like others who may feel insecure and lonely right? and whats the point of saying that shes so likeable? to show the whole world how popular she is? she also knows that i struggle with acceptint myself and like being jealous of her easily cos shes surrounded by others so easily even if she doesn't put in so kuch effort into befriending others and it idk if just makes me feel so much worse about myself

Honestly at this point i wanna tell her ""since youre so likeable why dont you just leave me like everyone else and go hang around all your 100 other friends who loves you so much huh"" ARHJJJJJ i wish she could understand but you know no one ever understands how it feels 😔",lonely,UGH!,2021-01-01 02:17:59

4375,Rpgamer84,1609425092,1,"Thought this was an appropriate place to talk about a dream I had.
  Anyway. I had a dream where I was driving around town aimlessly. Then I get out the car and then I'm in a park. This woman approaches me and when she goes to Introduce herself, we both say Qwenifer. She thinks I'm her Grubhub customer. I say I'm not, then I proceed to try to flirt with her by saying, ""it must be fate that I knew your name,. Can I get your number"". I hand her my phone. She looks me dead in eye with a smile. She starts to blindly tap my phone screen randomly 4 or 5 times before returning my phone. 

I was rejected even in my dreams. Lol 😆 🤣 😂",lonely,Dreaming of failure,2021-01-01 01:31:32

Some don´t have a friend, others dont have a lover, even some don´t have a family, but whatever you are, i send my best wishes for you to find someone, that with you, give a fuk you to loneliness.

It´s gonna be a difficult year for a lot of people, but we can do it, and we are worth it.

Let 2021, be a year to a lot of us, take a serious break of feeling lonely.

4379,lostdirectionless,1609422234,1,"Hope you all have a fantastic year ahead. It is not a stretch when I say that 2020 has been an emotionally wrecking year for the many of us active on this thread. 2021 may not turn out to be a particularly different one but let's start on a positive note. 

I propose the following:-

**1) Comment on 3 interests/hobbies** 

**2) People with similar interests can reply and see if they want to pair up or form a group.** 

Let's take care of one another, support each other and become that one anonymous person(s) online we like to talk to get over our loneliness.",lonely,For everyone who's spending their NYE alone,2021-01-01 00:43:54
